Acknowledgments
Ah, acknowledgments. Although all the glory of writing a book is mostly consumed by the 
authors, it takes so many more people than just us to actually make this happen. Just like build-
ing design, the process of writing and publishing a book is truly a team sport—and without 
the hard work, dedication, and willingness to put up with the authoring team, this book would 
have never have happened.
Of all the people to thank, first of all, we’d like to thank the staff at the Revit Factory. 
Without their fine work, this would be a very empty book. A special thanks to the three Product 
Managers, Harlan Brumm, Sasha Crotty, and Steven Campbell. And a huge thank you to the 
rest of the Factory - thank you guys and gals, for your hard work, innovative ideas, and desire to 
stay in touch with current design and construction issues.
Finally, a big thanks to our technical team. They dot our i’s, cross our t’s, and chide us every 
time we turn in something late. Their work and effort ensure that we as authors can produce 
something that you the reader can actually follow. So a thank‐you to our amazing and patient 
developmental editor, Kelly Talbot, for putting up with our excuses and typos; to copyeditor 
Kim Wimpsett and proofreader Nicole Hirschman for taking our slang and making it readable; 
and to production editor Becca Anderson for putting all the pieces together and getting it ready 
for print. Thanks also to Mary Beth Wakefield for watching the schedule and allowing us to use 
you as an excuse not to visit family on weekends or holidays during “Book Season.” A thank‐
you to Eric Bogenschutz, technical editor, who has given a careful and detailed eye to all of our 
Revit workflows, and to our excellent support team at Sybex, who helped us develop all this 
foxy content.
The building photograph on the cover was designed by SOM and is the Chicago Public 
Library, Chinatown branch. The Chinatown Branch Library is a new civic, educational, and 
social hub for Chicago’s Chinatown neighborhood, providing a much‐needed public gathering 
place geared toward inclusive community activities and driven by technology‐based learning. 
An array of vertical shading fins juxtapose an ultra‐transparent, high‐performance glass cur-
tain wall that maximizes visibility for both library patrons and passersby during the day, while 
presenting the image of a glowing lantern at night. The building’s south‐facing entrance, soft-
ened triangular shape, and gentle interior circulation reference Feng Shui design principles and 
resonate with the values held by the community. Like a traditional Chinese courtyard plan, all 
spaces connect to the central atrium room, providing clear orientation and spatial cohesion.

About the Authors
Marcus Kim is a senior business consultant with Autodesk. Marcus 
focuses on enterprise adoption of Revit and BIM workflows for AEC 
customers and has traveled all over the globe providing BIM services 
to domestic and multinational customers. Marcus received his bach-
elor’s degree in architecture studies from the University of Illinois in 
Chicago and an associates of arts and sciences degree from the American 
Academy of Art in digital media. During the early part of his career, 
Marcus pursued design and technical architecture, but he was given the 
opportunity to participate in a Revit pilot program where he excelled. 
Throughout his career, until his transition over to Autodesk, Marcus 
managed the BIM on complex and high‐profile projects such as the NATO World Headquarters 
for SOM Chicago, developing and implementing workflows during a time when producing BIM 
projects and BIM management was in its infancy. Marcus has used Revit since version 7.0 and 
has lectured at Autodesk University on topics such as BIM management, BIM architecture work-
flows on large‐scale projects, and design visualization.
At Autodesk, Marcus provides both technical and business process thought leadership to his 
customers, helping them adopt and improve new and existing BIM workflows, training, content, 
and standards. He has taken BIM concepts common to AEC and applied them to other indus-
tries ranging from manufacturing to energy to mining.
Marcus is based out of the Chicagoland area and spends much of his spare time chasing after 
his toddler and sneaking in moments of relaxation by pursuing his other two passions, digital 
art and painting little toy soldiers.
Lance Kirby is a senior AEC business consultant with Autodesk. Lance’s 
primary focus is accelerating the adoption of BIM and VDC practices 
among owners and their supply chain of designers and contractors. He 
received his bachelor’s degree in architecture from Mississippi State 
University’s College of Architecture, Art, and Design and also studied 
at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, coincidentally 
alongside the creators of Graphisoft’s ArchiCAD. He spent six years in 
various architecture offices helping to produce everything from 400‐
square‐foot fast‐food kiosks in shopping malls to 7,000,000‐square‐foot 
federal prisons.
In 2000, he left a prominent architecture firm to join a new tech start-up outside Boston to 
help produce a new design tool called Revit. Helping to develop Revit since version 1 and create 
its early tutorials, Lance has supported hundreds of BIM projects and trained thousands of its 
users over the past 15 years. Coincidentally, he has also supported all the previous and current 
authors of this book at some point in his career. Although this is his first published book as an 
author, he routinely pens 1,000+ pages in customer reports a year.
Although Lance has been based in Atlanta since 1995, he is often out of town. When he is not 
traveling globally in support of Autodesk customers, he may be traveling globally with his flight 
attendant wife, Scarlett. He enjoys fiction, analog/digital gaming, gastronomy of the smoked 
meat variety, and heavy down‐tuned music.

Eddy Krygiel is a principal business consultant with the AEC team with 
Autodesk Consulting. Eddy focuses on BIM and technology workflows 
for AEC clients. He received his bachelor’s degree in architecture from 
the University of Kansas School of Architecture and Urban Design. He 
has almost 20 years of experience in architectural offices and on a range 
of projects from single‐family residential to office, federal, civic, and avia-
tion clients. Eddy has helped firms around the United States at both the 
firm level and the project level.
His most recent project was the Mexico City International Airport, 
where he had the role of BIM manager for the Centro de Integración, 
Capacitación y Operación BIM. The BIM role involved supporting and steering stakeholder 
workflows from design through construction while not affecting the overall project fee or 
schedule. The final deliverable to the airport was a facility management–ready BIM model for 
both vertical and horizontal assets. Eddy has also led or been involved in other large‐scale 
­projects that have taken BIM beyond documentation.
Eddy is the author of more than 16 books on BIM and sustainability including the Mastering 
Revit series and Green BIM. He has also taught BIM, construction documents, and architectural 
communication at the University of Kansas School of Architecture.

Introduction
“A world which sees art and engineering as divided is not seeing the world as a whole.” 

—Sir Edmund Happold
What you hold in your hands is regarded as the definitive source of Autodesk Revit expertise 
available in written form. It has been a leading book in educating novice and experienced users 
alike for the better part of a decade. Those of you who have read previous editions know there is 
a wealth of information regarding the practical usage and application of the program in produc-
ing many different architectural designs. If you have used these preceding editions to help you 
gain a better understanding of this complex application, then you know that new information 
is provided in each edition to update you on the newest features and how they might improve 
your workflow every day. What you may not know is that this specific edition seeks to go fur-
ther. Its purpose is to provide you with not only the best understanding of the available tools 
but also many of the skills sorely needed by professionals to manage these tools in an architec-
tural BIM workflow.
Often when working with architects around the world, we find that the terms Revit and 
BIM are used interchangeably in describing what is new about the profession and the way we 
execute work. From the typical user all the way to the principal members of a firm, there is a 
misconception that if you’re using Revit, you are doing BIM. The challenge, of course, is separat-
ing the tool from the technique. Although Autodesk Revit is a wonderful apparatus for joining 
three-dimensional geometry with incredibly powerful and accurate data, it’s not a process or a 
road map for producing architectural work. Although Revit is an important foundational asset 
to a BIM-based workflow, it is still a resource that needs associated procedures and the intent for 
reaching planned deliverables. Where is technology without technique?
BIM is a methodology used to produce a complete design, construction, and operations solu-
tion. It has become a catalyst for transforming design and production processes in the architec-
ture, engineering, and construction industry. A decade ago in 2005, BIM was represented solely 
as architectural design and documentation authoring tools. By 2016, BIM has grown to form the 
basis of the process from design discipline authorship to construction and operation manage-
ment of built assets. It is also being adopted for infrastructure as well as buildings. As the use of 
BIM tools and processes has become more mature, nations have changed legislation to accom-
modate the immediacy of centralized collaborative working practices in contrast with tradi-
tional sequential paper workflows. Global organizations within specific industries have defined 
exchange classifications such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and COBie, and owners and 
their customers now expect to see full 3D media to describe a building at any stage of the design 
and build process. They even expect to see it as part of the construction process on-site, control-
ling and validating the build environment.

xxvi  | Introduction  
The challenge for any company in the AEC industry is to recognize the BIM areas that 
match its business niche and to ensure that the information that it attributes to a model  
can be generated efficiently and maximized by all other information-model users. With this 
comes much more responsibility to users of the tools and managers of the information, beyond 
lines and arcs generated by zeros and ones. It entails that you work with intent beyond what 
you see displayed on monitors. It is not enough to know every button and setting contained in 
the program; the BIM practitioner must know why to use a feature and when it is appropriate. 
It is not enough to know how to customize the templates for your specific workflow; it involves 
user understanding, knowing when customization is needed to create a specific output and 
when settings are best left unchanged. It is not enough to know how to create iterative forms 
through the manipulation of Python coding; it also requires an understanding of design crite-
ria and how BIM uses align with them. And most important, it is not enough to just have the 
knowledge of how to model a thing; it is necessary to have the wisdom to know when and why 
to do so.
Rest assured, this book’s purpose is to educate you on the best techniques and practices of 
Autodesk Revit, regardless of your responsibilities as an architectural project team member. 
New users will find a plethora of information regarding everything from simple concepts to 
complex techniques in executing modeling, documentation, and data input/output. All the 
while, we have included some lesser-known tips and tricks for seasoned veterans. All readers, 
regardless of their experience, will benefit from the authors’ knowledge in planning, collaborat-
ing, governing, and supporting BIM projects with Revit at the center. The goal is not to turn 
all readers into BIM managers but to extend the amazing information provided in previous 
­volumes with additional recommendations for supporting your work for more efficiency and 
better quality.
Anyone involved in any aspect of BIM, even tangentially, can benefit from knowledge of the 
bigger picture. This edition’s coverage of the collaboration process, the management of practices, 
and the governance of data standards has been expanded so that even novices can increase 
their value to the team. By understanding principles that show that every action should have a 
method and every method should have a purpose, readers will continue to progress their exper-
tise in providing precise modeling and valid data to their teams at the right time and in the 
right format.
If you seek a greater understanding of the BIM process and strive to transcend your tra-
ditional responsibilities, this edition will help you toward the goal of BIM management. 
Pursuing knowledge of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling your projects through 
new techniques and tools will help you take those next steps. By planning, you will establish 
strategies for achieving BIM use objectives. By organizing, you will be structuring the work-
flow to maximize the collaborative integration of your team. By leading, you will optimize 
your project team’s potential for providing quality deliverables efficiently. By controlling, 
you will be able to measure the team’s performance and provide continual self-improvement 
with the goal of raising the level of excellence. Regardless of your role, you will contribute 
more.
As you begin delving into this book, keep an active mind about how each of the provided 
recommendations might fit your company’s culture, your experience, and your customer’s 
needs. Not all of these ideas may be of interest or value to every project, but the goal of this book 
is that you will grow beyond any of the tools or techniques you deploy on your BIM projects, 
that the tools become second nature and an extension of your creativity, and that through this 
you will realize great architecture.

Introduction |  xxvii  
Architecture is the process of turning a thought into a space. Although it’s so simple to con-
vey that in the written word, the actual act of doing so is much more than it is possible to write. 
It’s glory, it’s torment, it’s frustration, it’s freedom, it’s the realization that one miscalculation 
means a complete redesign, like blowing on a house of cards, and it’s the 3 a.m. epiphany when 
you realize that the new design was what you were meant to get to in the first place. With all 
of that, it’s also the burning desire to work relentlessly to make something better one step at a 
time.
Autodesk® Revit® Architecture software is one of the many tools we employ to help us 
through this organic process. It’s one tool in the toolbox, but it can be much more than that. It 
can be the workflow that helps to empower a team. That team is the designers, the contractors, 
and ultimately the owners who are all looking to speak the same language.
We hope that in the process of using this book, you’ll experience a bit of the struggle to 
­realize a bit of the satisfaction of finding the solution. We hope what you learn in this book helps 
inspire you to your own bit of greatness, because what’s most important is that architecture isn’t 
about buildings. It’s about what we are able to accomplish with what little time we have. This is 
the elegant essence of Revit. Before we go much further, we have a few semantics to discuss.
First, all the tutorial files necessary to complete the book’s exercises plus sample families are 
hosted online at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.
Don’t have a copy of Revit 2017? Download the trial version of Revit Architecture at http://
usa.autodesk.com/revit-architecture, where you’ll also find complete system requirements 
for running Revit. Are you a student or educator? Someone with an .edu e-mail address? You 
can get a copy of Revit for free at http://students.autodesk.com.
For the clearest direction when following the exercises in this book, please make sure to 
install all the Revit support files that come with the default installation. We reference them 
heavily, and you’ll need them to best leverage the software.
Beginning with Revit 2017, there is only a single version of Revit which offers Architecture, 
Structures, and MEP packages in one application. We have focused this book on the Architectural 
features and have set the user interface to remove some of the Structural and MEP tools for better 
visual clarity. The variations will be slight and hopefully manageable, which really means you 
have some extra tools for Structure and MEP design. For the ease of reading, we removed those 
from the book’s images.
Finally, Revit comes with some additional options that you can download and install 
­separately, including access to cloud rendering, storage, and analysis, which we demonstrate  
in Chapter 9, “Conceptual Design and Design Analysis.” You can go to http://accounts
.autodesk.com to create an Autodesk® A360 account to access those additional tools.
Who Should Read This Book
This book is written for architects and designers who have had some exposure to Revit and  
are eager to learn more. It’s for architects of any generation—you don’t need to be a computer 
wizard to understand or appreciate the content within. We designed the book to follow real 
project workflows and processes to help make the tools easier to use. The chapters are full of 
handy tips to make Revit easier to leverage in your day-to-day world.
This book is also for the entire range of architects, from those who are fresh out of school 
to seasoned project managers. We have endeavored to include content for all walks of the 

xxviii  | Introduction  
profession so that regardless of your role on a project, you can learn how BIM changes both 
workflow and culture within a project team. With that, a basic understanding of Revit will make 
it easier to work through the book. Revit is a very robust tool requiring more than one project 
iteration to master.
For BIM managers, the book offers insights into the best practices for creating good project 
or office templates; these managers should also take a sneak peek into the powerful world of 
building content and Revit families. We’ve added many time-saving and inspiring concepts to 
the book, supported by examples from our own projects and the rest of the real world, to help 
motivate and inspire you on your journey through building information modeling.
What You Will Learn
This book will help you take the basics of Revit and BIM that you already know and expand on 
them using real-world examples. We will show you how to take a preliminary model and add 
layers of intelligence to help analyze and augment your designs. We’ll show you how to create 
robust and accurate documentation, and then we’ll help you through the construction process.
We go beyond introductory topics. To that end, we won’t be starting a project from scratch 
or teaching you how to build a simple BIM model. If you are interested in learning at that level, 
we strongly recommend you pick up Autodesk® Revit® Architecture 2016 Essentials (Wiley, 2015) 
before plunging headlong into this book. Instead, this book begins with a brief overview of 
the BIM approach. As you are already aware, BIM is more than just a change in software; it’s 
a change in architectural workflow and culture. To leverage the full advantages of both BIM 
and Revit in your office structure, you will need to make some changes to your practice. We’ve 
designed the book around an ideal, integrated workflow to help you make this transition.
Starting with the project team, standards, and culture, we’ll discuss how BIM changes your 
project approach and how to best build your team around a newer workflow. From there, we’ll 
delve into conceptual design and sustainability studies, continuing through best practices for 
design iteration and refinement. You’ll learn how to use powerful modeling techniques, how 
to design documentation best practices, how to make compelling presentation graphics, and 
how to take advantage of parametric design with the Family Editor. We’ll explore workflow 
topics such as tracking changes and worksharing as well as some strategies that move beyond 
traditional concepts of BIM. The book concludes with an appendix on troubleshooting and best 
practices so you can avoid common pitfalls. Throughout the book we’ve shared our practical 
experience with you, particularly in the form of real-world scenario.
Whether you’re studying Revit on your own or in a class or training program, you can use 
the “Master It” questions in the section called “The Bottom Line” at the end of each chapter to 
test your mastery of the skills you’ve learned.

note when an RVT link is unloaded for the current user. A new Auto – Project Base Point To 
Project Base Point positioning option for RVT links, which aligns the link to the host model’s 
project base point (using the link’s project base point as the origin), has also been added.
Imports    A command was added to import a 3D file (SAT or Rhino) and to use the imported 
geometry to produce a generic model in the current document or a shape in the current fam-
ily. Revit’s Import Shape tool also now allows the importing of shapes that include conical 
surfaces.
Multiple Wall Joins    Several enhancements have been made to wall joins.
◆
◆
You now have the ability to specify Allow or Disallow for automatic wall joining as a 
default option in wall creation.
◆
◆
Display options (Clean Join/Don’t Clean Join/Use View Setting) when selecting multiple 
wall joining have been enabled.
◆
◆
The existing wall joining type switch function of Miter, Butt, and Square-off have been 
expanded to multiple wall joining.
Views    A read-only parameter was added to the new Underlay group in the view 
properties: Range: Top Level reports the top level of the underlay range, as well as improves 
filtering by adding support for Filter By: Contains.
Schedules    With this release, several improvements to schedules were made.
◆
◆
The ability to save additional fields for view templates, including all the available 
parameters from the Fields, Filter, Sorting/Grouping, and Formatting tabs, was added.
◆

The Align tool now works with schedules on sheet views.
Annotation    The ability to maintain text note orientation when using the Rotate Project 
North tool was also included in this release.
What to Expect
Mastering Autodesk Revit 2017 for Architecture is divided into five parts, each representing a mile-
stone in your progress toward becoming an expert Revit user. Here is a description of those 
parts and what they will show you.
Part 1: Fundamentals
This book is not intended for novices, but we recognize that not everyone will know how to find 
every tool or have a complete understanding of the workflow. The chapters in Part 1 help you 
build a foundation of essential tools and knowledge.
Chapter 1, “Introduction: The Principles of BIM,” covers principles in building information 
modeling within your office or project environment.
Chapter 2, “Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization,” details 
the Revit interface and general organization.
Chapter 3, “The Basics of the Toolbox,” explores the commands and tools within Revit. It 
gives you an overview of where to find them and leaves the deep dive into their use for the 
chapters ahead.
Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards,” discusses the tools you’ll need to 
develop and manage graphic standards in a project template.
Part 2: Collaboration and Teamwork
Part 2 sets you on the path toward using Revit on a team or throughout your firm and takes a 
deep dive into a successful BIM workflow.
Chapter 5, “Working in a Team,” discusses the critical tools to working with Revit on any 
project team.
Chapter 6, “Working with Consultants,” covers the basics of working with team members 
outside your office.
Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” details the tools you’ll need to share 
your Revit files with other team members who don’t use Revit as a design tool.
Part 3: Modeling and Massing for Design
In this part, you’ll delve into the use of Revit starting from the early stages of design through 
analysis, iteration, and visualization.

Introduction |  xxxi  
Chapter 8, “Advanced Modeling and Massing,” details the creating of forms and shapes with 
the conceptual Revit toolkit.
Chapter 9, “Conceptual Design and Design Analysis,” gives you an overview of conceptual 
Revit tools and using those in energy analysis.
Chapter 10, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options,” takes the next step after 
the initial design and analysis: iteration.
Chapter 11, “Visualization,” takes the design work you’ve created and shows you how to cre-
ate stunning renderings and imagery of your design.
Part 4: Extended Modeling Techniques
Part 4 takes the conceptual forms you create in Part 3 and expands them to the real world using 
walls, floors, roofs, and other building components to create the elements behind a building.
Chapter 12, “Creating Walls and Curtain Walls,” delves into the use of the Wall and Curtain 
Wall tools.
Chapter 13, “Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs,” demonstrates a variety of ways to work 
with the horizontal components of a building: floors, ceilings, and roofs.
Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family Editor,” shows you how to work with parametric 
families to create a host of content for the building design.
Chapter 15, “Creating Stairs and Railings,” demonstrates a variety of ways and techniques to 
use the Stair and Railing tools—for their intended purpose and for others.
Part 5: Documentation
Once the building is designed, it becomes necessary to create the views and documents needed 
to build the project. This section shows you how to detail, document, and annotate the design.
Chapter 16, “Detailing Your Design,” works with the building design you created in previous 
chapters to add 2D components for documentation.
Chapter 17, “Documenting Your Design,” works with the newly created views and helps you 
organize them on sheets.
Chapter 18, “Annotating Your Design,” takes the next step in the documentation process and 
works with keynoting and dimensioning.
Part 6: Construction and Beyond
This section focuses on what to do once the design is resolved, taking it into the construction 
process and working with presentation tools.
Chapter 19, “Working in the Construction Phase,” focuses on the tools Revit has to keep track 
of changes during construction.
Chapter 20, “Presenting Your Design,” shows you how to take the completed design and dis-
play the results in a variety of 2D and 3D methods.

xxxii  | Introduction  
Chapter 21, “Computational Design with Dynamo,” teaches you how to use new tools that 
provide parametric design environments to enable users to create unique geometry as well as 
develop automated processes and sophisticated data manipulation techniques.
Part 7: Appendixes
Finally, three appendixes supplement the chapters’ coverage of Revit software features.
Appendix A, “The Bottom Line,” offers solutions to the “Master It” questions in each chap-
ter’s “Bottom Line” section.
Appendix B, “Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting,” is just what the title describes—a collection 
of tips and tricks for troubleshooting and working effectively with Revit.
Appendix C, “Autodesk Revit Architecture Certification,” describes Autodesk’s certification 
exam for Revit Architecture and how this book can be used as a supplementary tool for test 
preparation. Throughout the book, the symbol shown on the left marks significant coverage 
of exam objectives.

 Chapter  1 
 Introduction: Th e principles of BIM 
 In this chapter, we cover the principles of a BIM approach within your offi ce environment and 
summarize some of the many practices used in today’s architectural workfl ows. We explain how 
you and your organization can achieve some of the many possible benefi ts from BIM by sharing 
the processes that these new technologies support. As you will see, these practices are oriented 
to industry BIM uses that provide advantages such as more thoroughly explored design con-
cepts, better coordinated documentation, and better executed construction methods. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Focus your investment in BIM 
 
◆
 Understand a BIM workfl ow 
 
◆
 Leverage BIM processes 
 Th e Fundamentals of a BIM approach 
 Building information modeling (BIM) is an integrated model-centric methodology that delivers 
validated and coordinated knowledge about a building project throughout planning, design, 
construction, and operation. When this collaborative, interdisciplinary approach is optimized, it 
can improve an organization’s operations. BIM provides designers, contractors, and owners with 
a process to improve decision making, quality, and timeliness. At the core of this BIM approach 
are model-centric workfl ows (geometric and data models) that support project execution and 
asset lifecycle management. These workfl ows determine the methodology for creating data-rich 
geometries, integrated deliverables, and a model-based process to develop projects from plan-
ning through the operation and management lifecycle phases. BIM can be defi ned through tech-
nology, processes (its governance through standardization), and people. The technology system 
is central to the processes of creating, storing, and using models. With processes, the success of 
BIM requires all stakeholders in the project ecosystem to follow a series of steps, both as indi-
viduals and as a team. Ultimately, the users of these new techniques and technologies are com-
mitted to improving their design process, successfully integrating both geometry and data. 
 To succeed with these practices in this new environment, a business needs to make funda-
mental changes in the way it operates, whether by moving into a new market or by changing 
its methods of operation. It requires an alignment of the organization’s activities relating to its 
people, processes, and technology with its business strategy and vision. Through collaboration 
and data management during an asset’s lifecycle, sharing information effi ciently and effectively 
can support better integration and interoperability among all project stakeholders. Along with 
this data comes the possibility of integrated analysis. By making these analyses easily accessible,

derivatives of this model-centric workflow can provide a better understanding of design 
opportunities and decisions’ consequences. With the availability of valid geometry-based data, 
2D, 3D (visualization, clash detection), 4D (time), 5D (cost), and beyond are possible. Taking 
advantage of these capabilities is a must in keeping architecture firms competitive in today’s 
market. Transforming your organization’s business quickly and efficiently will be the difference 
between maintaining your market share and taking that next evolutionary step forward.
The Management People Inside a BIM Project Team
The architectural marketplace is changing and is influencing staffing decisions to some degree 
as skills needed for BIM projects can be different than traditional CAD skillsets. Some of your 
organization’s leadership may be aware of this change and are organizing BIM teams and 
resources to better anticipate new processes. Others are unsure of how BIM may change how 
they plan projects, from staffing to hiring. When looking to acquire BIM-skilled staff, savvy 
firms look for process experience in their new hires beyond those with tool expertise only. The 
primary factor is always professional experience, but knowledge of a BIM workflow supports 
these professional skills very well.
When planning project staffing, architecture firms generally focus on deliverables produced 
by a project hierarchy of managers, designers, engineers, interns, and draftspersons. BIM roles 
and responsibilities are based on the availability within the project team, rather than compos-
ing the best fit based on model-based workflows. This does not constitute a project problem, as 
much as it decreases efficiency in two ways: roles/responsibilities are not clearly defined and 
team members must adjust to BIM project needs during the project. Managers, who are mak-
ing staffing decisions, may not have the resources to judge BIM experience level or tool/process 
skillsets, other than hearsay or previous project experience with similar circumstances. BIM 
managers have a better understanding of these capabilities, but do not generally make staffing 
decisions for projects. There may be project managers who know to confer with BIM managers 
over this need at project start-up; however, this is uncommon.
Typically, professionals are hired based on project experience, education, and certifications. 
For architecture firms in general, BIM experience is nice to have, but not typically required. 
In today’s market, more and more professionals have BIM experience on their résumés in the 
form of project experience and trained tools, as they anticipate skillsets being required more 
frequently. Not having these skillsets does not preclude new staff from being successful BIM 
project team members, but it does impede the ability of managers to access the probability of 
their successful contribution to these projects.
Regardless, whether you are making staffing decisions or are a hardworking BIM project 
team member, understanding how these new workflows are changing the planning and 
execution of projects is important. Being prepared by understanding the people, processes,  
and technology of BIM is a must.
Staffing for BIM
As the building industry’s process of design and documentation is transforming, one of the 
fundamental changes teams need to address is staff planning in a BIM process. A common mis-
conception of project management is that staffing the BIM project will be the same as it has been 
in CAD workflows. Unfortunately, many times this is not the experience of many architecture 
teams. Because a BIM-based project can significantly alter the project workflow, many of the

standard timetables for task completion are no longer valid. Although fundamental deliverables 
remain the same (drawings, schedules, etc.), the processes to reach these outputs are different. 
For example, in a CAD workflow a user can create a plan as a single one-off entity. In a BIM 
workflow, the same user would need to generate a model before a floor plan could be produced. 
The investment in the nD model requires more time upfront, and therefore the floor plan to be 
produced necessitates a longer schedule. However, once this model has been produced, many 
other derivatives can be produced with less effort. As a model is developed, the ability to pull 
accurate and precise drawings, schedules, and analysis improves geometrically. To leverage this 
workflow, the staff and processes need to take into account the gathering of momentum early in 
the cadence of execution in later phases.
Years ago, Patrick MacLeamy, CEO of Hellmuth, Obata, + Kassabaum, explained this work-
flow movement with a diagrammatical description of the shift of workload and the ease of 
affecting change in the construction process forward. The graph, which has come to be known 
as the MacLeamy Curve (Figure 1.1), is not simply intended to imply a shift in labor earlier in the 
design process; rather, it stresses the importance of being able to make higher-value decisions 
earlier before changes become too difficult or costly to implement. The x-axis of the chart repre-
sents project phases from conceptual design through occupancy, whereas the y-axis represents 
the amount of effort in each phase.
Another important aspect of a BIM workflow is its ability to leverage decisions earlier in 
the process. As shown in Figure 1.2, implementing BIM in earlier project phases allows teams 
to make and share better information earlier, so that the entire project team can benefit earlier.

6  | Chapter 1  Introduction: The Principles of BIM  
On the basis of the BIM uses, a common industry term we will refer to later in this chapter, 
project teams may need to adjust labor in the planning and design stages in order to prepare 
an environment for geometric and data to develop together. In a CAD workflow, different 
project roles may be tasked with separate tasks in order to move the design forward. A plan-
ner may be developing a program, just as a designer may be producing massing studies. In 
a BIM workflow, these roles may be continuing the same task but in the context of a single 
model allowing them to interact through geometry and information. Because of this interac-
tion and its ability to allow better decision making, project teams may be deploying additional 
staff to help support this collaboration in BIM. Depending on the uses, teams might increase 
staff to build a model or to perform energy analysis; however, deploying a BIM workflow will 
not necessarily provide more proficiency or quality than a CAD-based project without proper 
planning and governance.
Understanding Project Roles
It’s also important to understand how the significant changes to tools and processes provided 
by BIM affect the roles and responsibilities of the project team. Project managers need to plan 
staffing and labor required to complete tasks in every project phase. BIM projects are supported 
by a few primary roles that will allow the team a level of predictability, although the specific 
effort and staffing will vary between offices (and even projects). Here are three primary roles 
that should be considered on every BIM project:
Design Architect    Generates design intent from the planning stage through early design
Technical Architect    Produces the deliverables, ensuring the design intent is building
Coordinator    Directs the BIM workflow between design and production
These roles represent efforts and general tasks that you need to take into account on any BIM 
project. For larger projects, these roles could represent multiple people, whereas smaller projects 
might constitute the same person filling multiple roles. For many architecture firms, designers 
and production staff may be tightly integrated and have very little differences in the responsi-
bilities. For other firms, there may be a clear demarcation between the first two roles. Regardless

of the interaction between designers and production roles, every BIM project has some coordi-
nation responsibilities. We will now explore each of these in more detail and discuss how these 
roles affect the project workflow.
The Role of the Design Architect
The role of the architect is to generate the design intent, typically focused on the project from 
pursuit through planning to design development. These staff may include licensed architects 
and interns. Designers typically interact with the BIM process by first transferring their concep-
tual ideas into digital form. For many planners this is going from two 2D layouts to a 3D model. 
For more sophisticated designers it might be to create a conceptual massing model based on 
sketched geometry or is something as sophisticated as iterative design calculations. Whatever 
the case, designers may be the origin for models of the project.
For some workflows, designers may stay in a more traditional process, and technical archi-
tects begin the BIM process based on their designs. As creative processes and digital capabilities 
align, designers moving forward are more likely to use digital authoring tools for their work, 
rather than traditional ones, such as hand sketching and physical modeling. With this, the BIM 
process will start earlier in the project timeline. Following this workflow, designers have the 
capability of making better decisions for the project team earlier based on the intelligence they 
provide to their geometric-based designs. What becomes most important at this stage is having 
a workflow specific to design work in BIM projects that allows creativity but properly sets the 
stage for production staff to develop the designs into buildable instructions. With this in mind, 
the typical responsibilities for design architect include:
◆
◆
Create initial design intent models through the creation of 3D geometry through concep-
tual massing or iterative design processes
◆
◆
Lead the creation of architectural elements and building from within the model
◆
◆
Design around code requirements and other building logistics
The Role of the Technical Architect
The role of the technical architect is to ensure that the project is buildable. These staff can be 
a wide-ranging group from experienced licensed architects and architectural technologist, 
to interns that are learning how buildings go together. As with design architects, technical 
architects are a role in the BIM process not because of their professional skill sets but because 
of their responsibilities to the project workflow. As models are developed, technical archi-
tects solve issues such as constructability, wall types, and managing the program of spatial 
and equipment requirements, as well as other issues involving code compliance and client 
relationships.
Primarily concerned with deliverables, production staff are manipulating models to cre-
ate the needed outputs, such as drawings and schedules. The role of these staff is to create 
sheets and embellish associated views with annotations or other details. This role applies 
standards to the project (as in wall types, keynotes, and so on) and organizes the document 
set. Technical architects are responsible for the bulk of the work needed to document the 
project. In earlier stages of the project, this role is typically assumed by either the archi-
tect or the modeler, but as documentation progresses into later phases of design, this can

quickly become the role of multiple people on a larger project. This role includes the fol-
lowing tasks:
◆
◆
Validate the constructability and detailing aspects of the design
◆
◆
Produce smart deliverables from well-coordinated models
◆
◆
Follow the established Level of Development (LOD) or Model Development Specification 
(MDS) to ensure models comply with requirements of the stated BIM uses
◆
◆
Ensure the models and valid data are passed to construction and operation phases of the 
project lifecycle
The Role of the Coordinator
BIM coordinators supervise the overall project modeling techniques and discipline-specific BIM 
output through all project phases. They are responsible for checking that all models produced 
by design and production staff comply with the standards set out by the BIM project execution 
plan (PxP). They check that models are correctly named and are the current version and that all 
relevant asset metadata has been completed with appropriate values. They coordinate requests 
for supplier information from the design teams and determine whether model details already 
exist in the library of design objects. Where model components do not already exist, they create 
or delegate their creation in the context of standards and set responsibilities. Their BIM duties 
are to:
◆
◆
Author and maintain the technical sections of the PxP
◆
◆
Determine project file organization and model splitting strategy
◆
◆
Define file sharing protocols for the project
◆
◆
Determine team training needs and organize training if needed
◆
◆
Assemble and maintain any multidiscipline models
◆
◆
Manage publication of files
◆
◆
Create project delivery output from assembled files matching all the firm’s BIM standards
◆
◆
Review models for adherence to project standards
◆
◆
Maintain the team’s access to the correct tools for BIM authoring, aggregation, and analysis
◆
◆
Oversee the application of BIM technologies and ensure that the model adheres to all inter-
nal and client-specific goals and standards
◆
◆
Oversee the development of the content of a specific model element to the LOD/MDS listed 
for a particular phase of the project
◆
◆
Assist all team members in BIM processes at all stages of the project
◆
◆
Lead 3D coordination meetings
These BIM roles for architectural project teams generally work for most firms and building 
types; however, it is ultimately up to each organization and its management to decide how team

members share in the responsibilities of managing geometry and connected data specifically for 
its needs. As long as there is an expectation set at the beginning of the project and a workflow 
defined during its phases, any number of roles and responsibilities should help ensure that the 
project is completed successfully. In support of that, project managers have a responsibility to 
help maintain the integrity of this new workflow. Although they may not be directly develop-
ing models, they are making important staffing decisions based on this new workflow and have 
the responsibility to ensure that the deliverables from this process meet contractual obligations. 
With that, we suggest that project managers have enough knowledge of BIM people, processes, 
and tools to do the following things:
◆
◆
Understand the impact BIM has on a project delivery schedule
◆
◆
Allocate time as planned for BIM management activities for the BIM coordinator and any 
BIM administration and support requirements
◆
◆
Be familiar with BIM concepts and uses on a project so that they are able to effec-
tively manage the project team and communicate progress and requirements to the 
client
◆
◆
Oversee the administrative and contract sections of the BIM project execution plan (PxP)
Establishing a BIM Execution Plan
To optimize your results with BIM, you need to start with the end in mind. Although a lot of 
tasks are possible with BIM, before you draw your first wall, you will want to create a BIM proj-
ect execution plan. We go into more detail about creating these plans and some resources for 
them in Chapter 6, “Working with Consultants,” but essentially a BIM plan helps to drive the 
direction of the modeling effort and modeling outcomes. How will your consulting team share 
models? Will your project need to provide BIM deliverables such as a reference model or data-
bases in the Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) format? Does the 
owner have expectations for a model deliverable for operations and management? All of those 
possibilities and more are explored and documented in a PxP. It gives the project team a defini-
tive outcome to develop and enrich the models toward.
Creating a standard BIM project execution planning process will help project teams to plan 
and execute the required processes to achieve the anticipated goals. Using a PxP template and a 
planned methodology, the project team members should actively pursue these concepts:
◆
◆
All parties should clearly understand and communicate the strategic goals for implementing 
BIM on the project.
◆
◆
Teams should understand and communicate their roles and responsibilities in the project 
execution.
◆
◆
The plan should outline resources, training, or other competencies necessary to successfully 
implement BIM for the intended uses.
◆
◆
The baseline plan should provide a goal for measuring progress throughout the project.
◆
◆
The plan should provide a benchmark for describing the process to future participants 
who join the project.

10  | Chapter 1  Introduction: The Principles of BIM  
Teams carry additional process risk when implemented by teams that are not experienced 
with the BIM process, as many team members, managers and users alike, are not familiar with 
the strategies and processes of this new workflow. If the process is well planned and communi-
cated, the project team will set expectations of what is to be done and how, thereby reducing the 
overall risk to the project. To ensure a successful project execution planning process, the team 
should do the following things with the PxP:
◆
◆
Modify the plan to meet the project’s needs.
◆
◆
Build the plan with the entire consulting team.
◆
◆
Create an LOD or an MDS with the entire consulting team to facilitate model and staff 
planning, unless it is already required by the owner.
◆
◆
Review the plan early and often, making needed changes as project experience grows.
For those who are responsible for developing the PxP for your team, begin your plan by refer-
encing industry-based templates, such as the Penn State Project Execution Plan or the Autodesk 
BIM Deployment Plan, that can provide you shortcuts to a well-organized and consistent PxP 
process. Determine what is needed by your project teams and then modify the plan to match your 
requirements. Additional language specific to the type of facility and construction should be added 
to the plan to make it more appropriate. A comprehensive PxP should include these sections:
◆
◆
Restatement of project goals and objectives
◆
◆
Intended BIM uses
◆
◆
Team structure and deliverables
◆
◆
Roles and responsibilities
◆
◆
Data transfers
◆
◆
Phase-based data requirements
◆
◆
Intended authoring, analysis, and aggregation tools
◆
◆
Governance information
By doing these things, project teams should have no problem developing a comprehensive 
project execution plan that will benefit them on a daily basis.
The Optimization of BIM Processes
According to the National Institute of Building Sciences (www.nibs.org), BIM is defined as “a 
digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility” that serves as a 
“shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for deci-
sions during its lifecycle from inception onward.” Although this is the definition of the noun 
used to represent the electronic data, the verb form of building information modeling is equally 
important. BIM is both a tool and a process, and one cannot realistically exist without the other.
Building information modeling implies an increased attention to more informed design and 
enhanced collaboration. Simply relying on tools to replace your current processes without an 
updated corresponding methodology will yield limited success. In fact, it may even be more 
cumbersome than using traditional CAD tools to execute project work.

The Optimization of BIM Processes |  11  
Regardless of the design and production workflow you have established in the past, moving 
to BIM is going to be a change. Moving to BIM is a shift in how designers and contractors 
approach the design and documentation process throughout the entire lifecycle of the project, 
from concept to occupancy. In a traditional CAD-based workflow, represented in Figure 1.3, 
each view is drawn separately with no inherent relationship between drawings. In this type of 
production environment, the team creates plans, sections, elevations, schedules, and perspec-
tives as stand-alone entities and must coordinate any changes between these views manually.
In a BIM-based workflow, the team creates 3D parametric models to generate the drawings 
necessary for documentation and analysis. Plans, sections, elevations, schedules, and perspec-
tives are all by-products of creating a building information model, as shown in Figure 1.4. This 
enhanced representation methodology not only allows for highly coordinated documentation 
but also provides the basic model geometry necessary for analysis, such as daylighting studies, 
energy usage simulation, material takeoffs, and so on.

Identifying and Planning BIM Uses
We encourage you to explore ongoing research from organizations such as Penn State University, 
buildingSMART International, and the UK BIM Task Group. Penn State (http://bim.psu.edu) has 
developed a catalog of BIM uses and project implementation guidelines that have been adopted 
into the National BIM Standard-United States, version 2 (http://nationalbimstandard.org). 
Another important aspect of supporting numerous BIM uses is the development of open standards. 
The organization known as buildingSMART International (www.buildingsmart.org) provides a 
global platform for the development of such standards. The UK-based BIM Task Group is helping 
the region adopt BIM practices through building standards and educational support. Groups from 
a number of regional chapters around the world are generating information exchange standards 
that will soon have a profound impact on the ways in which we share model data with our clients 
and partners. The following are some of the latest developments:

As the industry continues to build processes around the technology behind BIM, its potential 
continues to grow. Many new applications are now possible using building information model-
ing. As more and more benefits are achievable through BIM, teams find new uses to explore and 
develop. Figure 1.5 shows some of the potential opportunities that have been identified by the 
AEC industry and clearly organized by Penn State.
When you are trying to plan and manage your organization’s BIM and methodology, it’s 
very important to think about the use of these processes and technology to achieve your project 
goals. One of the primary ways of understanding this is through BIM uses. These many uses 
can be organized into five basic activities: gather, generate, analyze, communicate, and realize.

Identifying and Planning BIM Uses |  13  
Gather    To collect and manage building information
Generate    To create information about the building
Analyze    To examine aspects or components of the building to make better decisions about 
how to plan, design, construct, or operate it
Communicate    To shared information about a building collaboratively
Realize    To build or manage a physical element using building data
Understanding how benefits are derived from these uses will help focus your teams’ efforts 
in planning, managing, and governing new BIM processes.
Gather
As architects pursue work and plan awarded projects, they gather information about budgets, 
required functionality, site context, and anything else that is significant knowledge required to 
make the best decisions for the project. In an analog process, this information may be gathered 
in the building program, a contract, or even a cartoon set of drawings required. The advent of 
BIM processes and technology is changing this. BIM not only allows the acquisition of smartly 
acquired contextual data about the project but also becomes an improved repository for infor-
mation gathered in traditional ways.
One example of these traditional processes is the creation of the space program. These are 
usually done by interviewing user groups that are to occupy the building and gathering infor-
mation about the things that they do and the equipment they need in the adjacencies of the 
spaces they occupy. These processes are collected in a spreadsheet or in graphical layouts that 
explain their qualities. This type of data is typically used in parallel with the design process, 
with many planners manually pulling information into CAD layouts. With BIM, this process 
takes on a more evolved approach to connecting design data to programmatic requirements. 
Using a BIM process, a designer can input spatial information directly into the model database 
even before conceptual massing or area plans are generated. This allows the designer to take 
directly from the program information to lay out his or her design and get instant feedback 
whether it meets the required tolerances for these requirements.
Another example of gathering intelligent data could be in the form of laser scanning. There is 
sophisticated technologies that allow the generation of point clouds in pre-existing spaces. The 
generation of these spatially located points can be used as an accurate underlay in the build-
ing of existing conditions. With millions of points available, designers have at their fingertips a 
massive amount of data in which to begin to understand the context of their designs. This has 
incredible applications for complex renovations or spatially challenged sites or even historical 
preservation efforts.
Through this kind of information gathering, the qualification and quantification of data can 
empower the design team to understand both the implicit and explicit attributes of its projects. 
These processes can also help support estimating and cost forecasting efforts. During the early 
design phases of a building, quantities may be generally estimated but become more certain as 
the contract documents are created and construction processes proceed. All along the stored 
information becomes more and more accurate with respect to design intent.
Toward the later part of the construction process and into operations and maintenance, 
processes can help establish real-time performance measurements within facilities to help 
owners understand energy usage, operation costs, and many other metrics. As an example, an 

14  | Chapter 1  Introduction: The Principles of BIM  
integrated O&M system may be tracking electrical costs on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, 
and yearly basis to help owners understand where they’re maximizing their energy invest-
ments and where there is waste that they may reduce. Information gathering can be important 
throughout the entire lifecycle of a BIM project.
Generate
One of the most common aspects of building information modeling, and the one most acces-
sible to new users, is the creation of intelligent geometry. As users draw a wall, a mass, or a new 
level, they are generating not only form but also data that helps them make informed design 
decisions. For example, when a wall is drawn in an authoring tool, that object can immediately 
have attributes such as length, width, and height. It may also have multiple materials, structural 
and finish, as well as cost and a fire rating. In a CAD process, the users must maintain the intel-
ligence that they attribute to the objects they are drawing. They may be able to quickly gener-
ate four lines to represent a wall that could understand length and width, but that’s where the 
distinction stops. These CAD drawings, although they can contain additional information, are 
inherently based on the output, whereas building information models inform the outputs rather 
than vice versa. A wall in a model database is the design. In CAD, the outputs represent what 
the users conceptually maintain in their mind. As smart as we are as architects, we can’t main-
tain all the information needed to be communicated to the contractor in building our designs. 
That’s where BIM can begin to support us by maintaining the information for us.
When users generate information about the project through both geometry and integrated 
data, they are prescribing attributes, arranging elements, and determining real-world dimensions. 
Within the context of the lifecycle of the building, the designers during the planning and design 
phases are the primary generators of geometry and data. During the construction phase of the proj-
ect, the subcontractors will manage most of the data in the models. For sophisticated BIM projects, 
the construction phase management of as-built data can be created to build a foundation for the 
operations phase where that information could be used to operate and maintain the building. This 
database that they might maintain could be updated with new information throughout its entire 
lifecycle. This might include new equipment installed or renovations made to existing structures.
As experts generate both geometry and data for the project, they are specifying qualities and 
generating design data. The planner of a building may define particular spaces in the building, 
just as a structural engineer may define structural grid. Later in the project, a contractor might 
define a specific construction sequence as attributes of materials, just as the owner’s construc-
tion manager may define the need for a specific piece of equipment. Because all these ideas are 
generated inside the building information model or linked systems that influence this database, 
generation of building data can happen in every phase.
As designers make decisions about the spatial configurations of the building, they are in 
a range elements in three dimensions. This is the beginning of 3D coordination processes, 
which is a major asset to BIM practices in terms of collaboration and problem solving. This can 
begin with the arrangement of spaces; move to an arrangement of structural systems, through 
mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; and end with coordination of trades that are con-
structing the build. Because of all these aspects that occupy space and therefore have some rela-
tionship with one another, the model becomes a spatial organizer for this arrangement.
Before the opportunities that BIM affords us were available, subcontractors may only have 
determined that services in the building they were installing may have issues as they were 
designed. This might include a piece of ductwork that does not quite have enough room to move 

Identifying and Planning BIM Uses |  15  
around a beam or a doorway that does not have enough clearance from the edge of the stair 
riser. With the ability to simulate these relationships as designers, engineers, and other consul-
tants coordinate spatially, we now find many of the problems we found in the past in the field 
during the 3D coordination process. This ability to solve problems earlier in the arrangement of 
these three-dimensional objects affords designers and builders a great opportunity of design-
ing better outcomes with much more cost-effective and timely solutions. In the end, it’s much 
cheaper to fix it in the computer than in the field.
The sizing geometry also is an important aspect to the generation of information in these mod-
els. Just as spatial organization is important, the ability to estimate the correct dimensional aspects 
of building systems in the specification of specific equipment is important. Generating sizing 
information in a 3D model might take the form of creating types based on standard industry spec-
ifications. Being able to specifically model objects that have real sizes and tolerances help design-
ers be able to make the right decisions about specifying common building elements and complex 
building systems. Typical offering programs have tolerances built in for the level of detail that’s 
required to have buildings constructed accurately. Users have the capability of modeling much 
more accurately than they ever could in the field. Of course, the caution here is that teams need to 
realize that though they can be more accurate in the model, the ultimate purpose of the model is 
to get the building built and into operation efficiently and effectively. This means sizes should be 
based on the requirements of the construction trades; any more information or accuracy beyond 
that is not needed. However, where BIM shines above typical CAD processes is its ability to share 
truth. It is much more work to hide the true sizes than it is to display them accurately. This may 
frustrate some users who are used to applying their own dimensions, until they realize that the 
models represent what they designed, whether it is to a standard dimension or not.
Analyze
The primary purpose for the authoring environment is creation and not analysis. Because geom-
etry and data are combined together in a single database, confidence in that interaction allows 
us to begin to understand what it is it will create. This first step into analysis begins at the plan-
ning stages. However, it’s common to pull information from the authoring environment into 
one specifically built for analysis. You’ll find that many processes and tools specifically built 
for analysis work in parallel, and sometimes perpendicular, to model authoring. The real value 
in BIM beyond design documentation is the interoperability of model geometry and metadata 
between applications. Consider energy modeling as an example. In Figure 1.6, we’re comparing 
three energy-modeling applications: A, B, and C. In the figure, the darkest blue bar reflects the 
time it takes to either import model geometry into the analysis package or redraw the design 
with the analysis package. The lighter blue bar reflects the amount of time needed to add data 
not within the authoring environment, such as loads, zoning, and so on. The lightest bar repre-
sents the time it takes to perform the analysis once all the information is in place.

16  | Chapter 1  Introduction: The Principles of BIM  
In some instances, models authored in one platform may not work directly with analysis 
platforms, such as the example in A and B. This caused the re-creation of the geometry directly 
in the analysis tool and also required time to coordinate and maintain the design and its itera-
tions between the two models. The trend of these tools is moving toward better integration or 
additional analysis tools embedded inside the authoring applications. In application C, you can 
see we were able to import the model geometry directly into the analysis package, saving nearly 
50 percent of the time needed to create and run the full analysis. Using this workflow, you can 
bring analysis to more projects, perform more iterations, or do the analysis in half the time.
The same workflow is true for daylighting (Figure 1.7) and other types of building perfor-
mance analysis. By designing directly in the authoring tool, designers are able to move away 
from anecdotal or prescriptive design solutions and begin to rely on calculated results.
Building analysis can reach beyond just the design phase and into the whole building lifecy-
cle. Once the building has been occupied, the use of BIM does not need to end. More advanced 
facilities management systems support tracking—and thereby trending—building use over 
time. By trending building use, you can begin to predict usage patterns and help anticipate 
future uses such as energy consumption or expansion. This strategy can help you become more 
proactive with maintenance and equipment replacement because you will be able to perceive 
how equipment performance begins to degrade over time. Trending will also aid you in pro-
viding a more comfortable environment for building occupants by understanding historic use 
patterns and allowing you to keep the building tuned for optimized energy performance. The 
application of this analysis comes in the Realize stage of BIM uses covered later in this chapter.
Communicate
Using BIM to better visualize a building is very powerful way to communicate design intent. 
Creating documentation and visualization using BIM gives teams the added advantage of 
being able to communicate the design of the project in 3D, where it is more accessible to project

participants. It is especially persuasive for those who are typically involved directly with the 
construction process but are still important decision makers. Owners can benefit greatly from 
this type of communication. In this, visualization is an important tool for making design or con-
struction decisions.
Although this was initially conceived as one of the “low-hanging fruits” of a BIM workflow, 
this benefit has led to an explosion of additional perceptions of the design, including isometric 
details, renderings, animations, class detection reports, and so on. This provides a much better 
way to communicate design opportunities and decisions between project stakeholders.
In the 1990s, if you wanted to create a rendering, a physical model, a daylighting model, 
an energy model, and an animation, you would have had to create five separate models and 
use five different pieces of software. There was no ability to reuse model geometry and data 
between model uses. One of the key uses of BIM is the opportunity to repurpose the model for 
a variety of visualizations. This not only allows you to not have to re-create geometry between 
uses but also ensures you’re using the most current information in each visualization because 
it all comes from the same source. As the capacity of cloud rendering and analysis grows, the 
feedback will no longer need to process locally and you’ll be able to receive feedback faster.
This digital creation of the project has given us a variety of tools to communicate its aspects. 
Because the model is a single source of truth, it can be used in many different applications for 
communicating. Models may be imported into a gaming engine for an interactive virtual expe-
rience, allowing clients to virtually tour the building at their own pace, to help understand how 
this building will accommodate their functional and aesthetic needs. These same virtual mod-
els can also be physically printed through rapid prototyping methods, creating small models 
(Figure 1.8) in a fraction of the time it would take to build one by hand. Many other forms of 
communicating through BIM are emerging as you read this book.
If we consider a broad spectrum of representations, from tabular data to intelligently gener-
ated 2D documentation and 3D visualization, our traditional design deliverables become trans-
formed. Schedules give you instantaneous reports on component quantities and space usage, 
whereas plans, sections, and elevations afford you the flexibility to customize their display using

prototyping using

the information embedded in the modeled elements. For example, the plan in Figure 1.9 shows 
how color fills can be automatically applied to illustrate space usage by department. Because 
this is live in the model, changes can be made easily, providing confidence to the communicators 
and the receivers of this information that what they are seeing is accurate and can be the basis of 
valid decision making.
Expanding 2D documentation to include 3D imagery also gives project teams the ability to 
clearly share the intent of more complex designs. It also has a positive effect on construction 
by reducing translation errors with illustrative documentation, rather than cryptic details and 
notations. Figure 1.10 shows a basic example of a drawing sheet composed of both 2D and 3D 
views generated directly from the project model.
Another obvious benefit to creating a complete model of the building is the ability to gener-
ate a wide variety of 3D images for presentation. These images are used not only to describe 
design intent but also to illustrate ideas about proportion, form, space, and functional relation-
ships. The ease at which these kinds of views can be produced makes the rendered perspective 
more of a commodity. As shown in the left side of Figure 1.11, materiality may be removed to 
focus on the building form and element adjacencies. The same model is used again for a final 
photorealistic rendering, as shown in the right side of Figure 1.11. As the model contains infor-
mation of both form and function, it’s up to the communicator to decide what information is 
shared. A plan, perspective, and schedule can share common information. Because they come in 
different forms, the intent of the communication can be different. That is the great boon of hav-
ing an intelligent model; you decide where and when information is communicated in any of 
the outputs with the confidence that it is the single source of truth.

By adding materials to the BIM elements, you can begin to explore the space in color and 
light, creating photorealistic renderings of the building. These images can convey informa-
tion about both the intent and content of the design. Iterations at this level are limited only by 
processing power and user intent. The photorealism allows for an almost lifelike exploration of 
color and light qualities within a built space even to the extent of allowing analytic brightness

calculations to reveal the exact levels of light within a space, but with the added benefit of being 
derived directly from the working models. In this case, renderings can be an embedded pro-
cess or a perpendicular instantaneous output. The first option would be rendering within the 
authoring tool. This would produce timely renderings based on the current models, but they are 
not of the typically required quality for presentation purposes. More high-end renderings used 
for marketing would normally require exports from models brought into specific rendering 
tools. These renderings can be more stylized or photorealistic; however, they are a snapshot in 
time of the working model and take additional preparation in order to be useful. This in effect 
ends their BIM connectivity.
The next logical step is taking these elements and adding the element of time. In Figure 1.12, 
you can see a still image taken from a phasing animation (commonly referred to as a 4D simu-
lation) of a project. Not only do these simulations convey time and movement through space, 
but they also have the ability to demonstrate how the building will react or perform under 
real lighting and atmospheric conditions. All of this fosters a more complete understanding of 
the constructability and performance of a project before it is realized. This is also a common 
method when trying to understand construction sequencing by contractors as they are planning 
the building of the facility.
Realize
The use of BIM can potentially remove the direct human input to develop specific elements of 
the facility. Using the data generated through BIM-based planning and design processes to fab-
ricate or manage building elements of the facility allows facility owners to realize some of the 
most beneficial aspects of the entire endeavor. Using BIM for facility management can enable 
owners to take advantage of the facility data throughout the building’s lifecycle to support safe, 
effective, and efficient environments. The maintenance of this data can improve efficiencies 
through having accurate as-builts. It can promote the optimization of operation and mainte-
nance of the facility’s systems to reduce energy usage. Let us explore two main concepts of BIM 
realization: assemblage and control.

The Integration of Tools Inside a BIM Workflow |  21  
By developing building information modeling, you can re-plan building elements way 
before they are actually fabricated and assembled. This can include the specific specification 
of existing systems or the design of custom systems to be installed in the facility. Examples 
include picking a water pump that fits both the functional requirements and the spatial 
requirements of a mechanical space or the opportunity to free fabricate a custom receptionist 
desk for a highly designed lobby space. During the projects’ early phases, these processes can 
be used to generate multiple design schemes. For construction, these processes can help the 
contractors to understand the process of bringing materials on-site and how and when they 
should go together. It might also inform them how to pre-assemble custom systems for deliv-
ery to the project site, preventing cumbersome storage or barriers to successful assemblage 
such as poor weather or misinterpreted documents. Being able to assemble systems with the 
aid of machines, such as CNC systems, can reduce not only costs but also the time needed to 
install components in the facility. Examples of prefabrication might include wall systems, duc-
twork, and curtainwall.
Building information modeling also allows operators of the facilities to help manage and 
maintain the equipment and systems once they are installed on-site. If a database was created 
during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project to ensure that all as-built 
systems are well documented with specific properties associated with each system, operations 
and maintenance stakeholders not only will have a better knowledge of what systems they 
have but also may have some automated processes that could schedule maintenance requests 
or connect in with building system analysis tools. When you do an analysis of the lifespan of a 
building, you will see most of the time is in the occupancy stage. This really means that most 
of the money spent on the facility is running it. If BIM can help reduce the costs of operating 
and maintaining a facility, this becomes a huge benefit to owners that can be realized through 
a building information modeling process. As architects we are the primary origin of this infor-
mation that can help owners achieve these benefits. A good model-based database can help 
an owner solve maintenance issues more quickly, may be able to find potential issues more 
readily, and can be able to plan future construction much more easily. The use of this data to 
regulate facility systems potentially allows facility operators to optimize their operations. It is 
even possible that in the future, building systems could be automated because of information 
generated by BIM. Be able to plan the system integrations ahead of time allows for more intelli-
gence built into the facility. An example of this is when a thermostat is programmed to modify 
the settings of the HVAC system in response to pre-programmed rules by its connection to an 
intelligent monitoring system, enabled by the BIM. Benefits such as these can really help own-
ers optimize the operations and maintenance of the facilities and demand more services from 
its designers, such as yourself.
The Integration of Tools Inside a BIM Workflow
As you have read with the explanations of people and processes involved with BIM, the last 
aspect to discuss is the technology. Without the technology you would not be here. It in effect, 
it supports all the other things that make building information modeling possible. The thing 
you may not realize is that even though it is the foundation of all these other great opportunities 
and benefits, it is still a lesser aspect of the entire BIM ecosystem. This may confuse some read-
ers, but in our experience we find that the most meaningful changes happen with the people 
deploying these processes and the methodology they take in transforming their work. The tools 

22  | Chapter 1  Introduction: The Principles of BIM  
that people use in their workflows to generate geometry and data change only slightly from 
year to year. Technology is constantly being improved, made more efficient, and better inte-
grated with other tools in the market. You as an individual user have little influence over this. 
Understanding the existing capabilities of tools is important; however, change in the technology 
sense is much more limited than improvements to your process and skillsets.
The purpose of this book is to connect your knowledge as a person with the best understand-
ing of authoring tool’s capabilities. That specific authoring tool, of course, is Autodesk Revit. 
Coming to this realization, the user must understand that an expert of the software is not an 
expert in BIM. Many people know the functions of the tool based on learning or experience but 
still do not have a grasp on why they should do something and when they should do it. That 
comes with having a better understanding of not only why BIM is beneficial but also how all 
these things come together to create an architectural zeitgeist. Throughout this volume we hope 
to make contributions to your understanding of all three and to help you make the connection 
between opportunities in the application and a methodology to deploy them, with the overall 
sense of what it means to your project and to your organization.
What Is Revit?
Autodesk Revit software is a BIM application for authoring parametric 3D models that gener-
ate geometry with embedded information for the design and construction of buildings and 
infrastructure. From these intelligent models, plans, sections, elevations, perspectives, details, 
and schedules—all of the necessary instruments to document the design of a building—can 
be derived. Drawings created using Revit are not a collection of 2D lines and shapes that are 
interpreted to represent a building but live views extracted from virtual building models. These 
models are a compilation of intelligent components that contain not only geometric attributes 
but also data informing decisions about the building at every stage of the process, including 
occupancy.
Elements in Revit are managed and manipulated through a series of parameters that we will 
discuss in greater detail throughout this book. These elements have bidirectional associativity, 
allowing the user to change the 2D views to change the 3D model, or the model to change the 
views. If you move a door in a plan, that door is moved in all of the elevations, sections, perspec-
tives, etc. in which that object appears. In addition, all of the element’s properties contain infor-
mation internally, which means that intelligent annotations are directly linked to the objects. 
These tags display the object’s data directly, rather than a manual entry interpreted by the user. 
When contrasted with traditional CAD tools that store element information only in the annota-
tion, Revit gives you the opportunity to more easily input, manage, and export your project data 
for project coordination and execution.

 Chapter  2 
 Applying the Principles of the User 
Interface and Project Organization  
 After more than a decade in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, 
Autodesk ® Revit ® software continues to be unique in its combination of powerful features and 
ease of use. Revit may not be the absolute best tool to design and document every imaginable 
building type, but its features and functions make the vast majority of production tasks much 
more effi cient and accurate. 
 Revit is a completely bidirectional, multiuser working environment, unlike other 2D computer-
aided drafting (CAD) or 3D building information modeling (BIM) tools. Instead of layers and vec-
tors, you will be using terms such as  projects ,  components , and  parameters  along with tools like Wall, 
Door, and Floor. The concepts and terminology should seem familiar if you have experience in the 
building industry; however, transitioning to them can be a daunting task if you are more familiar 
with drafting terms than construction. This chapter provides an overview of the Revit user inter-
face (UI) as well as the key aspects of data organization within a project. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Understand the user interface 
 
◆
 Understand project organization 
 Understanding the User Interface 
 The UI is based on the Windows ribbon framework that is also found in software applications 
such as Microsoft Offi ce. Within Revit, you will fi nd many commands and tools that use simi-
lar dialog boxes and workfl ows. For example, you will not fi nd disparate dialog boxes for door 
properties versus window properties. Persistence of tool location is another key to increased 
usability. Even though tools remain contextually exposed or hidden, the majority of them can be 
found in the same place relative to the overall UI. 
 As you’re learning the interface, keep in mind that the interface presents a tooltip for every 
element. This tooltip has two stages. The fi rst stage, which appears when you fi rst mouse over 
the tool, provides the name as well as an option to fi nd out more information from the Help 
menu by pressing the F1 key. Most tools provide a second stage that gives you an additional 
description about what the tool is typically used for. A new user can learn a lot just by mousing 
over various parts of the interface. 
 You have the ability to access all three disciplines of the Revit software suite—Architecture, 
Structure, and MEP. This functionality is addressed in the “Getting to Know the Ribbon” section 
of this chapter. 

26  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Figure 2.1 shows the Autodesk® Revit® Architecture 2017 UI. To illustrate some different proj-
ect views, we’ve tiled four view types: plan, elevation, 3D, and sheet. In the following sections of 
this chapter, we will review the major components of the UI.
Figure 2.1
The Revit 
Architecture 2017 UI
Accessing and Using the Application Menu
Click the big R in the upper-left corner of the UI to open the Application menu and access com-
monly used commands such as New, Open, Save, Print, and so on. You can also export your 
project to a number of 2D and 3D formats from this menu. In the upper-left corner of the dialog 
there are two icons for both recent documents and open documents. Recent Documents lists the 
last several files that you’ve opened, no matter the location. Open Documents shows you all the 
files you currently have open, as Revit allows you to load multiple files at once. This is a great 
tool in case you have many views open and you want to quickly go to a specific file you’re work-
ing on. Many of the tools that allow you to open or save multiple formats include extensions that 
help you specify different options. For example, when you have a project open and you choose 
Save As, you can save your project as a typical Revit file or as a template to be used as a basis for 
future projects. Dialogs like this will also limit you to the operations that you can do currently. 
If you have a project file open, you cannot save it as a family file; Revit will gray that option out, 
visually informing you that this is not a valid operation. These dialogs are also nice in that you 
can customize locations for opening and saving certain file types. When you open the Open 
dialog, you’ll see a list of shortcuts to the left that give you quick access to your desktop, favor-
ites, and even the history of your most recent navigation. What’s nice about this dialog is that 
you can also create additional locations based on your current workflow. Creating a shortcut to 
a library of components or to your project folder will help save you time when you’re navigat-
ing between files. The Publish option lets you upload exported formats (DWF, DWG, DXF, DGN, 
and SAT) to Autodesk® Buzzsaw® to share project documents with your team. Use the Close 
command to quickly close a project or family without closing every open view.
When accessing some of the flyout commands in the Application menu, be aware that there 
may be additional commands or options on the flyout that are hidden. This is most evident 

Understanding the User Interface |  27  
on the Export command flyout, in which you must scroll to the bottom of the flyout to access 
exporting options for IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) and others. If you click the button 
without choosing the flyout, you are choosing the default option.
Using the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar (QAT) allows you to keep frequently used tools at your fingertips. 
Some commonly used commands are included by default in the QAT, but you can customize it 
to meet your own needs.
Right-click any button in one of the ribbon tabs, and you will find the command Add To 
Quick Access Toolbar. By clicking the small, down-facing arrow to the far right of the QAT, 
you’ll find that tools may be further customized, grouped, or removed from the toolbar 
(Figure 2.2). By default, the QAT bar is above the ribbon, but you also have the option to show 
the QAT below the ribbon.
With the QAT you also have the option of temporarily hiding quick access tools based on the 
flyout arrow on the far-right side. With this, you could quickly provision or unprovision tools 
based on your current workflow, without having to re-create the shortcut.
Figure 2.2
Customizing the QAT
Using the InfoCenter
To the far right of the QAT is the InfoCenter (Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3
The InfoCenter

28  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
From left to right, you have the ability to search for help solutions, access the Subscription 
Center, open the Communication Center, show Favorites (saved articles and solutions from 
the Communication Center), sign in to other Autodesk services (such as cloud rendering or 
Collaboration for Revit), launch the Autodesk Exchange for Revit (Exchange Apps), and open the 
help content.
Because Autodesk continues to move toward more cloud services, we recommend making sure 
you have a login for your system. This helps with other things such as collaboration, but it is going 
to make it easier for you to take advantage of all the capabilities that the software has to offer.
Getting to Know the Ribbon
The ribbon is the primary location for accessing the commands and tools you will use in the 
application (Figure 2.4). Every program using Microsoft’s ribbon interface is different, and some 
software developers and companies develop their own unique interfaces and ways of working. 
Revit is a great example of this. You can launch commands and tools by selecting icons in the 
ribbon, or you can create customized keyboard shortcuts as an alternative. Refer to Chapter 3, 
“The Basics of the Toolbox,” for more information on keyboard shortcuts. Throughout this book, 
we will refer to the ribbon frequently, so you should be familiar with its basic parts: tabs and 
panels. Tabs are the categories of tools, and panels are the subcategories organized into icons.
Tabs

Figure 2.4
The ribbon
The organization and size of the icons within each panel on the ribbon will change slightly as 
you scale the size of your application window. As the application window gets smaller, the icons 
will decrease in size and will sometimes stack, or the descriptions will be hidden.
Touring the Tabs
Tabs are the highest level of organization and are used to select from among the various groups 
of functionality. There are up to 11 tabs along the top of the ribbon. We’ll take a moment to 
briefly describe them:
Architecture, Structure, or Systems    When you install Revit, you will have access to the tools 
for all three design disciplines, and you can control the visibility of these tabs (Architecture, 
Structure, and Systems) from the Options dialog box (accessed from the Application menu), as 
shown in Figure 2.5. It has become common for architects to have all three disciplines visible 

Understanding the User Interface |  29  
to improve collaboration. These tabs contain tools you will use to create or place content spe-
cific to each design discipline. At the end of the tabs bar, there is a tool that allows you to cycle 
through variations of displaying tabs and panels. This is really useful only if you are trying to 
increase the real estate that is available to your working views.
Figure 2.5
Setting the UI options
Insert    The Insert tab is used to link external files (2D, 3D, image, and other RVT files) as 
well as search for external content via Autodesk® Seek. To insert content from family files, 
you can use the Load Family command from this tab; however, this same command is avail-
able with most modeling commands in the contextual tab of the ribbon. Learn more about 
linking Revit files in Chapter 6, “Working with Consultants,” and using other file formats in 
Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform.”
Annotate    The Annotate tab contains many of the tools necessary to annotate, tag, dimen-
sion, or otherwise graphically document your project. Learn more about these tools in 
Chapter 16, “Detailing Your Design,” and Chapter 18, “Annotating Your Design.”
Analyze    The Analyze tab contains the tools necessary to modify energy analysis set-
tings and to run an energy simulation via Green Building Studio®. This feature requires an 
Autodesk Subscription account to access the online analysis engine. Learn more about con-
ceptual energy analysis in Chapter 9, “Conceptual Design and Design Analysis.”

30  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Massing & Site    The Massing & Site tab contains the tools necessary to add massing- and 
site-related elements such as toposurfaces and property lines. Learn more about modeling site 
context in Chapter 3, “The Basics of the Toolbox,” and conceptual design massing in Chapter 9.
Collaborate    The Collaborate tab contains the tools that you’ll use to coordinate and manage 
the project within your own team as well as across other teams and their linked files. Learn 
more about worksharing in Chapter 5, “Working in a Team,” and interdisciplinary coordina-
tion in Chapter 6.
View    The View tab contains the tools that you’ll use to create all your project views, 2D 
and 3D, as well as schedules, legends, and sheets. You can also modify your UI from this tab, 
including your keyboard shortcuts. Learn more about creating multiple project views and 
sheets in Chapter 17, “Documenting Your Design.”
Manage    The Manage tab contains tools to access all your project standards and other set-
tings. You will also find the Design Options and Phasing tools on this tab. Additional tools 
such as Review Warnings and Select By ID are found in the Manage tab and will help keep 
your project running smoothly.
One of the most important settings that you’ll use during your project is Object Styles on the 
Manage tab. Selecting this option will allow you to manage the global visibility settings for just 
about everything in your project: how it projects, how it cuts, and its associated color and pen 
weight. Learn more about this and other project settings in Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates 
and Standards.”
Add-Ins    The Add-Ins tab appears when additional extensions have been installed. It 
contains the tools that can do a variety of things based on additional applications created 
through the API. Many third-party companies, such as Ideate, BIMObject, and even Autodesk 
itself, have written additional applications that supplement the functions of Revit. These may 
include enhanced analysis or management processes.
Modify    The Modify tab contains the tools used to manipulate the content that you’re creat-
ing in your project. You’ll find tools like Cut, Join, Move, Copy, and Rotate, among many oth-
ers. Learn more about common editing tools in Chapter 3.
Contextual Tabs    Contextual tabs are revealed when specific elements are selected or ele-
ment creation commands are launched. For example, the Modify | Walls contextual tab 
(Figure 2.6) is displayed when a wall is selected. These unique tabs are usually colored green 
to help you distinguish them from other static tabs in the ribbon.
Figure 2.6
Example of a contextual tab
A simple, yet important, setting that may be exposed on the contextual tab when plac-
ing model content is Tag On Placement. Modeling commands like Door, Window, and 
Component allow you to enable automatic tagging to reduce overall documentation time. If 
you are working in an early design phase, you may wish to disable the Tag On Placement set-
ting, unless you have separate presentation views created.

Understanding the User Interface |  31  
Placing Panels
Within each tab in the ribbon are groups of tools and commands referred to as panels. If you want 
to make any panel consistently available for easy access, you can pull it out of its tab and arrange 
it anywhere on your computer screen. To relocate a panel, drag the panel out of the ribbon using 
your mouse pointer on the panel title bar (Figure 2.7). The panel will snap to alignment with 
other panels you have previously dragged from the ribbon if you hover over other floating panels 
while dragging. These changes are persistent beyond your use of the software and will retain 
their new position every time you restart Revit until you choose to change them again.
Figure 2.7
Panels can be relo-
cated anywhere in 
the UI.
To return a panel to the ribbon, hover the mouse pointer over a floating panel and the panel’s bor-
der will appear. Click the arrow in the upper portion of the gray bar at the right of the floating panel.
On some panels, you will find that settings can be accessed from the panel’s title bar. An 
example of these features can be seen in the Annotate tab of the ribbon. In Figure 2.8, the small 
arrow on the Text panel is known as a dialog launcher and will open the Type Properties dialog 
box for Text (not shown in Figure 2.8). Clicking the down arrow on the Tag panel exposes an 
expanded panel that displays the Loaded Tags and Symbols command.
Figure 2.8
Special panel features
Using Other Aspects of the UI
Now that we’ve covered the fundamental elements contained in the ribbon, let’s look at other 
important aspects of the UI.

32  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Options Bar
The Options bar is located directly below the ribbon and is a contextually sensitive area that 
gives you feedback as you select tools and objects. In Figure 2.9, you see the options available 
below the ribbon when the Wall tool is active. You can also use the Options bar when an object 
already placed in a project or family is selected.
Figure 2.9
Options appear in a 
bar below the ribbon.
An especially important and frequently used option is included with any annotation symbol—
the ability to include or exclude a leader. This will help you place tags in the clearest location within 
your documentation while maintaining a parametric relationship to the associated model element. 
Look for this option when you use the Tag By Category command from the Annotate tab in the 
ribbon.
Properties Palette, Project Browser
The Properties palette contains the parameters of whatever you’re currently working on and 
shows the instance parameters by default. In this palette, you will find the Type Selector, a selec-
tion filter, and the Edit Type button (Figure 2.10). You’ll learn more about filtering selected objects 
in Chapter 3, as well as much more about parameters in Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family 
Editor.”
Figure 2.10
Properties palette

Understanding the User Interface |  33  
The Project Browser (Figure 2.11) is a hierarchical listing of all the views, legends, schedules, 
sheets, families, groups, and links in your project. You can expand and collapse the project tree 
by selecting the + and – icons.
Figure 2.11
Project Browser
You can search for elements by right-clicking on any item in the Project Browser and select-
ing Search from the context menu. The simple search function will highlight any view, sheet, 
family, or type with the matching text in its name.
The Project Browser can also be filtered and grouped into folders based on a number of user-
defined parameters (see Figure 2.12). To access the Browser Organization Properties dialog box, right-
click the Views portion at the top of the palette. You can also access this tool in the View tab under 
the User Interface flyout button. Learn more about Project Browser customization in Chapter 4.
Figure 2.12
Browser Organization 
Properties dialog box

34  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
The Properties palette and Project Browser can be undocked from the main UI and can also 
be placed on a secondary monitor simply by dragging or double-clicking the top border of either 
palette. You can also drag these UI elements onto each other to use them in a unified tabbed 
or stacked palette, as shown in Figure 2.13. Dragging one palette onto the top border of the 
other will create a tabbed palette, whereas dragging it just below the top border will result in a 
stacked palette.
Figure 2.13

Project Browser combined in 
a tabbed or stacked palette
Status Bar
The status bar at the bottom of the UI provides useful information about selected objects and 
active tools. When you start a tool, the status bar will display prompts about the next step 
required of the tool. For example, select an object and start the Rotate command; the status bar 

Understanding the User Interface |  35  
will read “Click to enter rotate start ray or drag or click the rotation center control.” It is also 
useful when you are using the Tab key to toggle between object snap points or when selecting 
chains of elements.
Toward the middle of the status bar, you will find toolbars for worksets and design options. 
Showing the current worksets during a collaborative project will help ensure you are placing 
elements on the correct workset. Worksharing will be covered in Chapter 5. If you’re using 
design options (covered more in Chapter 10), the status bar can also show you which option 
you’re currently exploring.
At the far right end, you will see a filter icon next to a number. When you select objects in a 
view window, the number of selected objects will be displayed here. Click the Filter icon to open 
the Filter dialog box and refine the selection set. The five icons next to the Filter icon determine 
which objects in your model are eligible for selection. We will discuss selecting elements in 
greater detail in Chapter 3.
Drawing Area
The drawing area is the window into your design space. As shown previously in Figure 2.1, you 
can tile several views from any number of open files or you can maximize the view windows. 
When the view windows in the drawing area are maximized, press Ctrl+Tab on the keyboard to 
cycle through the open views. To reverse the cycling, press Ctrl+Shift+Tab. To go directly to the 
view you want to see, choose the view from your Project Browser.
If you decide to use tiled views when you work in Revit, you should be aware of a subtle 
limitation. You’ll be able to zoom into only the extents that are defined by the drawing area. If 
you want to get around this limitation, here’s a helpful tip: Create a new sheet, but then delete 
the sheet border. This is now a workspace for any view of the project. Just be sure to label it as a 
working sheet apart from your documentation set. Now you can create duplicate views of any of 
your project views and assemble them in this working space (Figure 2.14). Zooming in and out 
is much more fluid, and you’re not limited to the extents of one drawing area. You can create a 
keyboard shortcut to activate and deactivate views, which is helpful as well.

View Control Bar
The view control bar is at the bottom of every view and changes slightly depending on the type 
of view (Figure 2.15). For example, sheet views have only four buttons, and perspective views do 
not have a scale option. In Figure 2.15, we have tiled three view windows to illustrate some of 
the differences in the view control bar. From top to bottom, you can see a drafting view, a plan 
view, and a 3D view.
Figure 2.15
View control bar examples
Some of the buttons in the view control bar are just shortcuts to view parameters that are 
also available from the Properties palette. Scale, Detail Level, Crop View, and Show/Hide Crop 
Region are found in both the view control bar and the Properties palette. The Visual Style but-
ton allows you to select from a short list of graphic display modes that can be customized in 
detail with the Graphic Display Options in the Properties palette.
Other buttons in the view control bar are unique commands. One example is the Temporary 
Hide/Isolate command, which helps users more readily see specific elements while working in 
a view. When you select an object in a view window, use this button to select from various tools 
to hide or isolate either the selected objects or the entire category of objects. Temporary visibility 
states do not affect printing, and the view window will display with a turquoise border until the 
temporary visibility is reset. Next to the Hide/Isolate button is the Reveal Hidden Elements but-
ton. Use this tool to highlight any elements that are hidden in the current view, either temporar-
ily or through other methods.
The Worksharing Display button is available only on projects where worksharing is enabled. 
Worksharing Display can be enabled and configured in any view to illustrate Owners, Checkout 
Status, Model Updates, and Worksets. Refer to Chapter 5 for a detailed explanation of these vis-
ibility features.
The Show/Hide Analytical Model button allows you to quickly display analytical graphics 
that are commonly used by the Structural or MEP tools in Revit. Finally, the Reveal Constraints 
button temporarily displays all of the model-based constraints visible in the current view. This 
is useful for troubleshooting model elements that might not be behaving as expected.
Temporary View Properties
You may also temporarily modify view properties or apply a view template. When you click 
the Temporary View Properties icon in the view control bar, you will have a choice of Enable 
Temporary View Properties or Temporarily Apply Template Properties, as shown in Figure 2.16. 
Because these applied properties are only temporary, they will not affect printing and they will 
not be saved with the project.
Figure 2.16
Temporary View 
Properties command

Understanding the User Interface |  37  
If you select Temporarily Apply Template Properties, you can select from any view template 
established in your project. Once a view template is applied to the view with this tool, the view 
will be highlighted with a purple boundary, as shown in Figure 2.17. Refer to Chapter 4 for a 
detailed review of view templates.
Figure 2.17
Active view with 
Temporary View 
Properties applied
Referring to Figure 2.16, you will notice that any recently applied view templates will appear 
in the Temporary View Properties menu. This allows for rapid application of templates to 
increase your productivity when manipulating views for various working scenarios.
The other command selection is to Enable Temporary View Properties. This mode allows you 
to change any view properties manually. The result is the same as temporarily applying a view 
template, but you can tweak any setting to your needs. For example, you might want to tempo-
rarily hide all the furniture in a view.
To remove the temporary settings, you can simply wait until you close the project file because 
the temporary settings are not saved. Otherwise, click the Temporary View Properties icon 
again and select Restore View Properties.
Graphic Display Options
The Graphic Display Options dialog box gives you access to some of the same settings you 
can select in the view control bar; however, more refinement options are available. From the 
Properties palette, click Edit in the Graphic Display Options property field, and explore the 
graphic settings you can customize for the current view (Figure 2.18). As an alternative, you can 
click the Visual Style icon (the small box) in the view control bar and choose Graphic Display 
Options from the pop-up menu.
Many graphic options are available, including customized backgrounds, photographic expo-
sure, and a transparency slider. Experiment with a variety of the settings to see which ones meet 
your presentation and documentation needs. By saving them as view templates, you can group 
various settings for better comparison and contrast. You will learn much more about graphic 
styles in Chapter 11, “Visualization.”

38  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Work Plane Viewer
Most modeling tools and commands require an active work plane on which to place geom-
etry. When you are working in a plan view, the work plane is usually set to the current level 
Figure 2.18

dialog box

Understanding the User Interface |  39  
associated with the view. In a 3D, section, or elevation view, the definition of an active work 
plane may be a bit more confusing. In addition to levels, work planes can be defined as refer-
ence planes, a structural grid, or a surface of another object. To help you visualize an active 
work plane, a work plane viewer is available in Revit. Be aware that an active work plane could 
be perpendicular to your orientation if the view is adjusted three dimensionally.
The Viewer option is located on the Work Plane panel of the Architecture tab. This viewer 
is available from all model views when you’re in the project environment. By default, the work 
plane is based on the active work plane of the last active view. But when you enter Sketch mode 
(for example, when you are creating a floor or a roof), the active work plane is that of the sketch 
(Figure 2.19). So even if the project window shows a 3D view, the viewer shows the plane of the 
sketch—and you can sketch directly in the work plane viewer! This is useful for working on 
sloped surfaces such as roofs.
Figure 2.19

Navigation Methods
One of the challenges of any 3D modeling software is creating methods of navigation that are 
intuitive. If you have used more than one modeling application, such as Rhino, SketchUp, or 
Digital Project, you will know that there is no standard 3D navigation functionality. As is the 
case with Revit, Autodesk has consistent navigation tools across most of its industry-based 
applications such as AutoCAD® and Navisworks®. These include the ViewCube® tool, the 
SteeringWheels® tool, and basic mouse controls.
ViewCube
A 3D navigation tool known as the ViewCube is available in most Autodesk design software. 
This tool will appear by default in the upper-right corner of any 3D view. Click any face of the 
cube to orient the view to that face, or click a corner of the cube to orient to an axonometric 

40  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
angle. Press and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse pointer over the ViewCube 
to orbit the view freely. Press and hold the left mouse button while hovering over the compass, 
and the view will rotate as if it were on a turntable. The selected tool, the cube or compass, will 
highlight with a shade of blue when active.
Hovering over the ViewCube with your mouse pointer reveals the Home option (the little 
house above and left of the ViewCube) that you click to return to your home view. Right-
clicking the ViewCube opens a menu that allows you to set, save, and orient your view (see 
Figure 2.20). Selecting Options from the context menu takes you directly to the ViewCube 
options in the Options dialog box, which you can also access from the Application menu. 
The ViewCube options allow you to customize the placement, transparency, and functional 
behavior of the tool.
Figure 2.20
ViewCube context menu
SteeringWheels
Another method of navigation that is unique to Autodesk software is the SteeringWheels tool. 
This tool can be activated by pressing the F8 key, by pressing Shift+W, or from the Navigation 
bar. The SteeringWheels will follow your mouse pointer as you move about a view and will 
stop when the mouse movement slows, allowing you to hover the mouse pointer over one of 
the command areas on the wheel. As you hover the mouse pointer over a navigation command, 
press and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to activate the correspond-
ing navigation method. There are many ways to customize the SteeringWheels, all accessible 
through the Wheel menu in the lower-left side of the tool. This is easier to demonstrate than 
explain in text, so feel free to try the various modes of the SteeringWheels tool as you continue 
through this book.
If you use a laptop or mobile workstation without the benefit of a mouse, the SteeringWheels 
tool can be a welcome substitute for traditional pointer-based navigation. The touchpads or 
pointing sticks on most laptops do a poor job of emulating the press-and-drag motions of a 
mouse along with simultaneous keyboard button combinations that drive native navigation in 
Revit. If you’re struggling without a mouse connected to your laptop, try the SteeringWheels 
tool and you might thank us!

Defining Project Organization |  41  
Navigation Bar
Access to the most common navigating tools is also provided in the Navigation bar located at 
the right side of the drawing area. From here you can launch any of the SteeringWheels and all 
of the zoom/pan commands from the flyout buttons.
Navigating with the Mouse
As with most modern design applications, the mouse can also be used to navigate in any 
view. You are not constrained to using the ViewCube, SteeringWheels, or Navigation bar. 
You might have already figured out that pressing the left mouse button selects objects and 
the right mouse button is used to access context menus. We discuss selection methods with 
greater detail in Chapter 3. For now, let’s review how you can use the mouse to navigate the 
views in Revit.
To pan in any view, press and hold the wheel button on your mouse while moving it around 
your mouse pad. Hold the Shift key and use the wheel button on the mouse to orbit a 3D view.
The mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and zoom out of any view, but the zooming may be 
somewhat choppy. Hold the Ctrl key and press the wheel button while moving the mouse for-
ward to zoom out (pushing the model away) or backward to zoom in (pulling the model toward 
you). You will also notice that the views will zoom in and out with a focal point based on the 
location of the mouse pointer.
In camera views, zooming works a bit differently. Scrolling the mouse wheel zooms in and 
out but includes the view’s crop region. To adjust the view within the crop region, only the 
SteeringWheels and the ViewCube can be used.
Defining Project Organization
If you have experience with 2D CAD software, you are likely familiar with many of the terms 
and concepts related to designing and documenting a project, but not all of them have exact 
equivalents in Revit. You may be comfortable with thinking in terms of what needs to be drawn 
and coordinated: plans, sections, elevations, details, schedules, and so on. Such information is 
likely stored in a plethora of separate files that have to be linked together in order to reference 
other parts of a building design. For teams collaborating in the design process, you are also 
likely accustomed to allowing only one person in one file at a time. With this, maintaining all 
your project settings and standards is a struggle across so many disconnected files.
Working in the Revit environment affords you much more control and efficiency in manag-
ing these issues. From within a single, bidirectional database, Revit organizes these project orga-
nization aspects: datum, objects, content, views, and project management. Figure 2.21 shows 
what we like to think of as a Revit organizational chart, which gives you a visual description of 
these four categories and what these categories contain. In the following sections, we’ll discuss 
each of these categories and describe its particular role in your Revit project environment.
Introducing Datum Objects
Data (plural) are sometimes referred to in Revit as datum objects and consist of references, grids, 
and levels (Figure 2.22). Datum objects establish geometric behavior by controlling the location 
and extents of your content (the building, the stuff that goes in a building, and the stuff you 
need to document your building).

Reference planes can be created in any 2D view from the main ribbon tabs (Architecture, 
Structure, or Systems), but once created, they may not be visible in 3D. After you add reference 
planes to your project, they can be set and seen from the Work Plane panel. This will allow you 
to work with respect to the desired work plane.
Grids are used to locate structural elements in your project. You are not required to include 
grids in your project, but they are quite useful in managing structural walls and columns. Like 
reference planes, grid lines can be added to any 2D view. Keep in mind that grids can only be 
perpendicular to levels. Furthermore, grids are only visible in views that are perpendicular to 
the grid. So if the grid is in a north–south orientation, you’ll be able to see it only in plan and 
from the east–west orientation.
Levels are datum objects that are parallel to the ground plane. They serve several purposes. 
First, they are the main method for placing and managing the elevation (or Z-location) of con-
tent. Virtually all content placed in a Revit model has a Level parameter. You can even move 
objects from one level to another simply by changing this property in the Properties palette. 
Levels also function as constraints for objects such as walls and columns. These objects have top 
and bottom constraints that can be set to levels so that they will automatically update if the lev-
els are adjusted. Levels may be seen and created only in elevation and section views; therefore, 
you can’t create levels in plan, and they can’t be diagonal to the ground plane.
Creating any datum is easy. Simply select the desired tool from the Architecture tab, and 
then pick two points to define the start and end locations. Despite their two-dimensional 
appearance, all datum objects have three-dimensional extents that help you manage their 
appearance throughout a project. You will explore this further in the section “Explaining 3D 
and 2D Datum Extents” later in this chapter.
Creating and Duplicating Levels
In the previous section, we discussed the overall purpose of datum objects; however, there are 
special conditions related to the creation of levels. First, you should understand that a level does 
not always require an associated plan view. Levels that have plan views will have a blue graphic 
symbol at the end (double-click it to go to that view), whereas those that don’t will have a black 
graphic symbol. The blue represents hyperlinked data, which you can find on levels, section 
heads, and other annotations. When you create a new level, you have the option to create a cor-
responding plan view by using the Make Plan View option from the Options bar.

44  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Copying an existing level will not create the corresponding plan views. This is useful if you 
are working on a larger project, such as a high-rise, and you want to quickly configure multiple 
levels without creating them one at a time. You might also want to use levels just as a reference 
for content but not for a specific plan, such as for an intermediate landing or mezzanine.
Although it is easy to create many levels by copying or arraying, only create the levels that 
are necessary to manage major parts of your project and that need to be shown in your docu-
mentation. You do not need to create a level for every slab, stair, or floor offset, as objects can 
be shifted in the Z direction offset for any level. Too many levels can have a negative impact on 
your project’s and your performance, as they take resources to manage.
Let’s explore the creation and duplication of levels with an exercise. First, download and 
open the file c02-Levels-Start.rvt or c02-Levels-Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s web 
page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the exercise file and make sure the Project Browser is open—remember that it 
may be in a tabbed palette with Properties. Expand the Views tree and then expand 
Elevations. Double-click on South to activate that view in the drawing area.
You will see two levels that are usually present when you create a new project using the 
default template.
	
2.	 From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, find the Datum panel and click the Level tool. In 
the Options bar, ensure that the Make Plan View option is selected.
	
3.	 From left to right, draw a new level exactly 10′-0″ (3000 mm) above Level 2.
When you hover the mouse pointer anywhere near either endpoint of the existing levels, 
you will see alignment guides (dashed lines) that help keep the extents of the datum 
objects consistent.
	
4.	 Click the Modify button or press the Esc key, and you will notice that the new level has a 
blue target. Double-click the target for Level 3, and the Level 3 floor plan will open.
	
5.	 Return to the South elevation view and select Level 3. From the Modify tab in the ribbon, 
click the Copy tool. In the Options bar, select the Multiple option.
	
6.	 Create two copies of Level 3: one that is 2′-0″ (600 mm) above Level 3 and one that is 9′-0″ 
(2700 mm) above that one, as shown in Figure 2.23.
	
7.	 You can change the names and elevations of levels by selecting a level and then clicking 
the name or the elevation value. Rename Level 3 to Level 2B, Level 4 to Level 3, and Level 
5 to Roof. If you are prompted to rename the corresponding views, click Yes.
As we stated previously, plan views are not created for levels that are copied or arrayed. This 
gives you the flexibility to quickly generate levels for taller buildings without all the associated 
views that may increase your project file size unnecessarily. Although this workflow may be 
beneficial for you in early design phases, what do you do when you need all those floor plans 
and ceiling plans for that high-rise design?
If you want to convert a level that doesn’t have a view to one that does, find the Create panel 
on the View tab and then select the Plan Views flyout and then the Floor Plan command. This 
opens the dialog box shown in Figure 2.24. You can select among all the levels without corre-
sponding views in your project. Only the levels you copied in the previous exercise are listed in 
the dialog box.

Defining Project Organization |  45  
You can also use this command to create duplicate views of existing levels. Clear the Do 
Not Duplicate Existing Views option at the bottom of the dialog box to see all the levels in your 
project.
Select the Roof level and click OK. A floor plan will be created for the Roof level, and that 
floor plan will be opened. It is important to note that every plan you create with this method 
will be opened as you complete the command. Remember to use the Close Hidden Windows 
tool (available in the Quick Access toolbar) to avoid slower performance in your work session.

46  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Explaining 3D and 2D Datum Extents
Datum objects—specifically grids and levels—have two types of extents: 3D (analytic) and 2D 
(graphic). These extents are expressed as grips that are shown at the endpoints of the grids and 
levels in plans, sections, and elevations. The analytic grips control the extents of the datum 
across the entire project and all views. The analytic grip is shown as an open circle and the indi-
cator displays as 3D, as shown in Figure 2.25.
Figure 2.25
Controlling the 3D 
(analytic) extents of 
the datum
If you want to adjust the 2D extents of your datum in only the current view, click the 3D icon 
and it will change to 2D. You can then modify the 2D extents of the datum object without affect-
ing the 3D extents. We will explore this further in an exercise later in this section.
Datum objects are visible only in views that intersect their 3D extents. The elevation in 
Figure 2.26 shows four grids and four levels. Grid lines 3 and 4 are not visible on Levels 3 and 4 
because their 3D extents are not intersecting those levels.
Figure 2.26
3D (analytic) extents 
affect visibility of 
datum objects.

Defining Project Organization |  47  
You can use the 3D and 2D extents to your liking in any view. In Figure 2.27, for example, the 
3D extents of the grid lines extend through Level 1 and Level 2, but the 2D extents are set above 
Level 2. This means that the grid datum would still be visible in both levels, even though it 
looks like they do not intersect the levels.
3D Extent
Figure 2.27
Customizing 3D and 
2D extents of datum 
objects
When you move a datum object, one way or another, content is going to respond. If you 
move a level, walls and furniture are going to move accordingly. If you move a grid, structural 
elements associated to the grid are going to relocate. And if you move references, the elements 
associated with them will update. As a matter of fact, you will often constrain or pin datum 
objects in order to restrict their movement as your project is starting to develop.
Let’s continue with the exercise from the section “Creating and Duplicating Levels” and edit 
the 2D extents for one of the levels you copied. Remember that although this exercise uses levels, 
these methods can be applied to grids as well. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Open the South elevation view again, and you’ll notice that the label for Level 3 is slightly 
overlapping the label for Level 2B because they are relatively close. You’ll need to adjust 
the 2D extent of Level 3.
	
2.	 Select Level 3, and you’ll see two items at the right endpoint with which you’ll need to 
interact: the 3D indicator and the lock symbol. First, click the lock symbol to unlock the 
right endpoint. This will allow you to move the endpoint for the selected level without 
affecting all the other levels.
	
3.	 Click the 3D indicator so that it changes to 2D. Now you are ready to modify the 2D 
extents of the level.
	
4.	 Drag the 2D extents grip (the solid circle) to the right. The result should look like the 
image shown in Figure 2.28.

48  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
	
5.	 As a final option, you can choose to break the end of a level or grid line so that the tag or 
label will clearly display. Click the Add Elbow symbol near the label at the right endpoint 
of Level 3. We have indicated the location of this symbol in Figure 2.28.

Propagating Extents
Quite often you will adjust the extents of datum objects that need to be replicated in several 
other views. Fortunately, there is a tool to help you accomplish this—Propagate Extents. The 
premise of this tool is simple, but you must be aware of the subtleties in applying it to a three-
dimensional model.
The Propagate Extents tool pushes any modifications you apply to a datum object from one 
view to other parallel views of your choosing. This tool does not work well on levels because 
the parallel views are essentially mirrored views of each other. For example, the orientation of 
the South elevation is the opposite of the North elevation; therefore, if you make a change to the 
extents at the right end of a level in the South elevation, those changes would be propagated to 
the left end in the North elevation.
The best way to apply the Propagate Extents tool is with the 2D extents of grids. Why only 
the 2D extents? Because changing the 3D extents affects the datum object throughout the proj-
ect, independent of any specific view. Let us examine this behavior with a quick exercise:
	
1.	 Download and open the c02-Grids-Start.rvt file from this book’s web page, and then 
activate the South elevation.
You will see three levels and four grids.
	
2.	 Select grid 3 and click the 3D indicator at the bottom endpoint. Notice that the lock sym-
bol turns off automatically, allowing you to immediately adjust the graphic extents of the 
grid.
	
3.	 Drag the 2D extent of grid 3 up toward the top. Repeat this process for grid 4 so that the 
result looks like the image shown in Figure 2.30.
	
6.	 Use the additional line grips to adjust the level endpoint so that it resembles the image 
shown in Figure 2.29.

Defining Project Organization |  49  
The line weight of the grid lines has been increased for clarity.
Before you continue, open the Level 1 and Level 2 floor plans and observe that grids 3 
and 4 are still visible. If you had adjusted the 3D extents of the grids in the South eleva-
tion view, those changes would already be reflected in the other views. We’re using this 
method because we want to maintain the 3D extents but modify the 2D extents only in 
the South elevation view.
	
4.	 Return to the South elevation view and select grids 3 and 4 while pressing the Ctrl key. 
From the contextual tab in the ribbon, click the Propagate Extents button, and the dialog 
box will appear as shown in Figure 2.31.
Figure 2.30

5.	 In the Propagate Datum Extents dialog box, select the North elevation view.
	
6.	 Click OK to complete the command and then activate the North elevation view. Observe 
that the 2D extents of grids 3 and 4 now match the modifications you applied in the South 
elevation view.

50  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
You can use the Propagate Extents command to easily copy datum settings to any paral-
lel views in your project. This is especially effective for propagating grid extents to many plan 
views in high-rise buildings.
Resetting or Maximizing 3D Extents
Two commands you might need when adjusting datum object extents are ones that give you the 
ability to reset or maximize the 3D extents. These commands are available in the context menu 
when you have a datum object selected (Figure 2.32).
Figure 2.32
Extent commands in the 
context menu
The Reset To 3D Extents command allows you to reset any graphic extent modifications back 
to the analytic extents. Let’s apply this command in the continued exercise file:
	
1.	 In the c02-Grids-Start file, return to the South elevation view. Right-click grid 3, and 
select Reset To 3D Extents from the context menu. Repeat this step for grid 4.
	
2.	 You will see the grid lines return to their original condition; however, this has been 
changed only in the current view (South elevation). Activate the North elevation view to 
observe this behavior.
	
3.	 Return to the South elevation view and select grids 3 and 4. Click the Propagate Extents 
button in the contextual tab in the ribbon, and select the North elevation view.
	
4.	 Click OK to close the dialog box, and the reset 2D extents will be applied to the grids in 
the other views.
The other command in this pair serves a similar purpose in dealing with datum objects. 
Maximize 3D Extents is most often used if your levels or grids are exhibiting strange 
behavior. There are various reasons why this happens, but you’ll realize it when it does. 
You can use this command to set the analytic extents of a datum object to the outer 
boundaries of your project geometry.
Continuing in the exercise file, activate the Level 1 floor plan and notice that grid 
line C seems to be displayed like all the other grids. Now activate Section 1 from 
the Project Browser or by double-clicking the section head shown in the floor plan. 
You’ll notice that grid line C is not visible in the section view. This is because some-
one mistakenly pulled the analytic (3D) extents far to the left in plan while the 
graphic (2D) extents remained consistent with the other grids. Let’s continue the 
exercise and repair this problem.

Defining Project Organization |  51  
	
5.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan and select grid line C. Right-click and from the context 
menu, choose the Maximize 3D Extents command.
	
6.	 It may not seem like anything happened, but activate the Section 1 view and you’ll now 
see that grid line C is visible.
	
7.	 Return to the Level 1 floor plan, select grid line C again, and then click the 2D indicator at 
the right endpoint so that it indicates 3D.
Using Reference Planes
Objects in the Revit model are able to maintain relationships with other objects; however, you 
may not always have other model elements (like walls, floors, and roofs) to relate to other geom-
etry. This is why datum objects are so important.
If you have been using Revit for a reasonable amount of time, it seems obvious that lev-
els and grids would control content, but reference planes aren’t often appreciated. Here’s a 
simple exercise to demonstrate this special kind of relationship between reference planes and 
walls:
	
1.	 Download and open the file c02-Walls-Start.rvt from this book’s web page. Activate 
the Level 1 floor plan, select the wall segment, right-click, and then choose Create Similar 
from the context menu. Use the Tangent End Arc option from the Draw panel in the con-
textual tab of the ribbon to create a series of concentric walls starting from the left end-
point of the provided wall, as shown in Figure 2.33.
Figure 2.33
Concentric walls
	
2.	 Go to the South elevation view. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, click 
the Reference Plane tool and add two angled planes (dashed lines) as shown in 
Figure 2.34.

52  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
If you move Level 1, you’ll notice that the walls all move with it. You don’t have to select 
the walls; it’s in the properties of the walls to maintain a relationship to the Level 1 
datum. You could make the top of the walls maintain this same kind of relationship to 
Level 2.
	
3.	 You can also create a relationship to the reference planes. To do so, simply select all the 
walls (just hover your mouse over one wall, press and release the Tab key, and then left-
click to select the chain of walls), and then click the Attach Top/Base button in the ribbon. 
Note that Attach Wall ➢ Top is the default selection in the Options bar, so first pick the 
upper reference plane. Click the Attach Top/Base button again, make sure Attach Wall ➢ 
Base is selected in the Options bar, and then pick the lower reference plane.
Figure 2.35 shows the results in a 3D view, once you’ve attached the top and bottom of the 
walls to the upper and lower reference planes.
Figure 2.34
Reference planes 
and levels shown in 
elevation
Figure 2.35
Finished walls
Try moving and rotating the reference planes, and notice that the walls will maintain their 
relationships to the planes. This is shown in a section view of the walls in Figure 2.36.
Although you can use levels, grids, and reference planes to customize model ele-
ments, there may be situations where you need to establish relationships with non-planar 
geometry.

Defining Project Organization |  53  
Using Content
Effective use of content is all about repeated elements in a hierarchy (project, family, type, 
instance) that you put in your Revit project to develop and document your design. Content can 
often maintain relationships with other content, but more important, they maintain relation-
ships to datum objects. As you can see from the Revit organizational chart shown previously in 
Figure 2.21, content includes system families, component families, and spaces.
System families (also called host families) are content that is part of the Revit project environ-
ment and are more akin to rule sets rather than physically constructed components. These fami-
lies are not created and stored in external files (RFAs)—they’re found only in the RVT project 
file. If you need another type of a system family, you will duplicate an existing type from within 
the project. System families can be 3D elements such as walls, floors, roofs, ceilings, stairs, and 
railings or 2D elements such as text, dimensions, revision bubbles, and insulation.
Component families are created in the Family Editor and are either 2D or 3D content. This means 
that you will have to create and load these kinds of families outside the Revit project environment 
as RFA files. When you start to create a component family, you’ll need to select an appropriate fam-
ily template (Figure 2.37). By selecting the right family template, you will be certain that the compo-
nent that you’re creating is going to behave, view, schedule, and (if necessary) export properly.
Figure 2.36

Figure 2.37
Selecting a family 
template

54  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Although most system families help shape the physical aspects of a building, the occupied 
voids within are critical to a successful design. These elements are spaces, which take the form 
of rooms and areas. Spaces maintain relationships to datum objects but also to model elements 
including floors, walls, ceilings, and roofs. In addition to spatial properties, rooms are used to 
document finishes within your project. Take a look at the properties of a room, and you will find 
Floor Finish, Base Finish, Wall Finish, and Ceiling Finish.
Working with Type and Instance Parameters
All content in a Revit project has parameters, which are simply the information or data about 
something. Parameters can affect many different aspects of an object, such as visibility, behav-
ior, size, shape, and material.
To develop a fundamental understanding of parameters, you must note that there are two 
kinds of parameters: type and instance. Type parameters control information about every ele-
ment of the same type. For example, if the material of a piece of furniture is designated as a type 
parameter and you change it, the material for all the furniture of that type will change. Instance 
parameters control only the instances that you have selected. So if the material of the piece of 
furniture that you have selected is an instance parameter, you will be editing only the selected 
elements.
Instance parameters can be constantly exposed in the Properties palette. Selecting something 
initially displays the instance parameters. Figure 2.38 shows the instance parameters of a wall 
that control the relative height, constraints, and structural usage.
Figure 2.38
Instance parameters 
of a wall
By clicking the Edit Type button, you expose the type parameters (Figure 2.39). These param-
eters control values such as the structure, graphics, and assembly code.

Defining Project Organization |  55  
This section provided you with a basic overview of families and parameters; you will learn 
much more about these concepts in Chapter 14.
Working with Views
Views are the means by which you will interact with, perceive, and document the project. As you 
can see in the Revit organizational chart shown previously in Figure 2.21, there are both 2D and 
3D views. Two-dimensional views are oriented to specific coordinates such as plan, elevation, 
and section. Schedules and material takeoffs are yet another way of viewing information in a 
project that is neither 2D nor 3D. Three-dimensional views are either orthographic or perspec-
tive (camera view) in nature. Views also have type and instance parameters that control proper-
ties such as name, scale, detail level, phase filter, and graphic display options. We will review 
each type of view again in more detail in Part 5, “Documentation.”
Reviewing the Common Properties of Views
Let us first review, in detail, some of the properties that apply to most views. All of these are 
found in the Properties palette when no objects are selected; however, some properties may also 
be accessed in the view control bar. The most common view properties are as follows:
Crop Region    With the exception of schedules and drafting views, the extents of all views 
can be limited using crop regions. The visibility of the crop region itself can be turned off, 
but you can choose to hide all crop regions in the Print Setup dialog box when using the 
Print command. Although you might feel the need to keep crop regions visible to allow 
Figure 2.39
Type parameters of 
a wall

56  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
easier editing, you can use the Reveal Hidden Elements tool in the view control bar to tem-
porarily show hidden crop regions. Buttons to enable/disable and show/hide the crop region 
are available on the view control bar.
View Scale    The view scale is the proportional system used to represent components of mea-
sured drawings. The scale of a view not only controls its printed size but also automatically 
controls the relative weight of line work as well as the size of annotations such as text, dimen-
sions, and tags. The view scale is displayed on and can be modified from the view control bar.
Visibility/Graphics    The Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box (Figure 2.40) allows over-
rides of a view’s elements in two essential ways: visibility (turn object categories on/off) and 
graphics (customize line thickness, color, and fill pattern).
Figure 2.40
Visibility and 
graphic overrides 
for an elevation
Detail Level    The Detail Level parameter can be set to one of three predefined choices: 
Coarse, Medium, or Fine. A representation for each setting is defined during the component’s 
construction and sets the level of detail in each view level. It can help improve model perfor-
mance and avoid cluttered views by limiting the visibility of smaller model elements. Detail 
Level can be set with a button on the view control bar.
View Template    View templates are a selection of view properties, which can include prop-
erties that change the scale, detail level, and visibility of objects in the view. As an aid to stan-
dardization, view templates can help you organize common view settings and apply them to 
groups of views throughout your project and other projects within your office or firm. View 
templates are covered in detail in Chapter 4.

Defining Project Organization |  57  
Creating and Duplicating Views
You can create views in various ways in order to work with your project in a manner that meets 
your needs. Although creating views is quick and easy, you should avoid populating your proj-
ect file with too many unnecessary views. An overabundance of unused views will increase the 
amount of management your team will need for the project’s organization. Views that do not 
have a specific purpose are just another object to maintain, search through, and store. Keep it 
simple, and routinely purge valueless views. Let’s review the procedures to create different view 
types and see how to control their extents after they’re created.
New views can be generated from the Create panel on the View tab of the ribbon (Figure 2.41), 
and the process is quite simple. Click one of the buttons and a new view is activated and stored 
in the Project Browser.
Figure 2.41
Creating new views from 
the ribbon
Another quick way to create new views is to right-click a view name in the Project Browser 
and select one of the Duplicate View commands (Figure 2.42). You can also duplicate the current 
view by using the Duplicate View button in the Create panel of the ribbon.
Figure 2.42
Duplicating views from 
the Project Browser

58  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
As you can see in Figure 2.42, there are three choices in the Duplicate View flyout command: 
Duplicate, Duplicate With Detailing, and Duplicate As A Dependent. Let’s take a quick look at 
what each of these options means:
◆
◆
Duplicate: This command will create a copy of the selected view but will not replicate any 
of the annotations in the view. Use this command when you need a fresh copy of a view in 
which you will create a new annotation for a different documentation purpose or even a 
working view without clutter.
◆
◆
Duplicate With Detailing: As its name suggests, this command will create a copy of the 
selected view with all of the annotation in the view. We don’t recommend using this command 
too often because replicated annotation is often a sign of an inefficient production process.
◆
◆
Duplicate As A Dependent: This command allows you to create a series of partial views 
that assume the properties of one parent view. Using dependent views does not mean that 
you can have a parent view with a larger scale like 1:100 and then create dependent views 
at larger scales such as 1:50. The parent view has all the same properties as the dependents, 
but you can manage the crop regions and settings from the parent view. This is used 
most commonly with large plans and elevations that cannot fit on the project’s standard 
sheet size.
Creating Floor Plans and Ceiling Plans
As you learned in the section “Creating and Duplicating Levels” earlier in this chapter, when 
you create a level in an elevation or section view you have the option to create a plan view for 
that level in the Options bar. If you have levels without corresponding plan views, you can also 
use the Plan Views tool from the ribbon to create a plan view.
The vertical extents of plans and ceiling plans are controlled by the View Range settings. The 
View Range settings, as shown in Figure 2.43, define the vertical range of the view.
Figure 2.43
View Range dialog box
The view range properties can be difficult to understand, so we created a diagram to illus-
trate the principles. In Figure 2.44, you will see that the primary range is the zone you usually 
see in a default floor or ceiling plan. If an object crosses the cut plane, the object’s Cut values are 
used. If the object is below the cut plane but above the bottom, the object’s Projection values are 
used. Cut and Projection values can be found in Visibility/Graphics.

Defining Project Organization |  59  
For most views, the Bottom and View Depth parameters are set to the same plane. Therefore, 
objects below the bottom of the view range simply won’t appear. So, what happens if you need 
to show objects on a lower terrace for reference in the current view? When you set View Depth 
to Level Below or Unlimited, objects that are below the bottom of the view range but within the 
view depth will be overridden with the <Beyond> line style.
Perhaps you only need to apply a different view range setting to isolated areas of a view. This 
can be accomplished with the use of the Plan Region tool. You can find this tool in the Create 
panel of the View tab along with the other Plan View tools. The Plan Region tool allows you to 
sketch a boundary within which the View Range dialog box will be available to make specific 
changes. You can use this method for areas such as windows that might be placed in a wall 
above the cut plane but need to be shown on the plan for documentation.
Another useful property of plans is known as an underlay. Although this property may func-
tion more like a tool, it is found in the Properties palette along with the other view properties. 
An underlay allows you to use any other level as a reference in the current view. You can use the 
underlay to display ceiling soffits in a floor plan, to display furniture layouts in a ceiling plan, or 
to use another level as a reference for replicating partition layouts.
Creating Elevations
Selecting the Elevation tool on the View tab creates elevations of various types. You’ll also notice 
that as you place an elevation tag, the elevations automatically orient to walls (Figure 2.45). If 
there’s no host element nearby to reference, they’ll automatically orient to the left.
Figure 2.44
View range properties 
explained
Figure 2.45
Elevation tag 
orientation

60  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
If you select the directional point of the elevation tag, you will see a blue line that defines the 
beginning of the cut plane for the elevation as well as a dashed line that defines the side and 
rear extents (Figure 2.47). This allows you to control the analytic extents of the elevation without 
moving the graphic tag, which is useful if you want the tag in a particular location but you want 
the cutting plane to start somewhere else.
Figure 2.46
Creating additional 
elevations
Figure 2.47
Elevation extents
Selecting the center of the tag will allow you to create additional elevation views (more typi-
cally done for interior elevations) by selecting the unchecked boxes that surround the elevation 
tag (Figure 2.46).
Finally, there are three types of elevations in a Revit project: exterior, interior, and fram-
ing. Their differences are more than graphic. Exterior elevations, by default, do not have an 
active crop boundary, only a starting cut plane. Interior elevations have their crop boundary 
on by default and attempt to find boundaries of host elements, like walls, floors, and ceilings. 
Framing elevations can be placed only along a grid line, and their cut plane corresponds to the 
respective grid.
Creating Sections
Selecting the Section tool on the View tab creates sections. By default, three types of sections 
are available from the Type Selector: Building, Wall, and Detail. This allows them to be grouped 
with better clarity in the Project Browser, but there are also other important properties.

Defining Project Organization |  61  
Building and Wall sections must be created in a perpendicular orientation with respect 
to levels. But after you create them, they can be rotated in elevation. However, doing so 
would lead to confusion in your project because, once rotated, the section wouldn’t be dis-
played in plan view because the section cutting plane would no longer be perpendicular to 
the plan view.
A Detail section will have a different graphic symbol by default, although you can custom-
ize this to your liking. We discuss this form of customization in Chapter 4. Beyond the differing 
graphic symbol, Detail sections will have a smaller clipping region than a Building or Wall sec-
tion. In Figure 2.49, a Building section is shown at the left of the image and a Detail section is 
shown to the right.
It’s important to know that a Detail section created in plan will automatically display as a 
callout in any Building section or Wall section if the Detail section overlaps a larger section. Of 
course, this is not an ideal workflow for architectural documentation. We discuss the process of 
using callouts from larger sections in Chapter 16.
Also note the color of callout and section heads in Figure 2.49. These blue icons act as 
hyperlinks to the other views in your project. Double-click on any of these blue heads to acti-
vate that view.
Figure 2.48
Section properties  
and extents
Unlike with elevations, the cutting plane of a section must correspond with its graphic line. 
Figure 2.48 shows the instance properties of a Building section. The far and side cut planes of a 
section can also be controlled. This goes for both Building and Wall sections.

62  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Creating Callouts
The Callout tool allows you to create views that are intended to be enlarged from the scale of the 
parent view in which you create the callout. When you are in a parent view—a floor plan, sec-
tion view, or elevation view—you can create a callout from the View tab in the ribbon within the 
Create panel.
The most important aspect of the Callout tool you need to understand is the difference 
between the types of callout views you can create. When you activate the Callout tool, click 
on the Type Selector in the Properties palette. You will see several choices that depend on 
what kind of view you currently have activated. For example, if you are using the Callout tool 
in a floor plan view, you will see Detail and Floor Plan listed in the Type Selector, as shown 
in Figure 2.50. Two types of callouts are available in the Type Selector: Detail and Floor Plan. 
Although Detail callouts may look like Detail sections graphically, they are not visible inside 
other perpendicular views. So a callout created in plan view will not be visible in elevations or 
sections like a Detail section.
In the example shown in Figure 2.50, if you select Detail, the callout view you create will be 
listed in the Project Browser under Detail Views. If you select Floor Plan, the callout view will 
be listed under Floor Plans. You cannot change a callout view from one type to another after it is 
created, so plan the configuration of your views carefully.
Figure 2.49
Building and Detail 
sections shown in plan 
view

Defining Project Organization |  63  
Beyond the organization of callout views in the Project Browser, choosing the right type 
for your callouts affects other functionality as well. The Detail callout has a unique property 
called Show In. This property can be set to either Parent View Only or Intersecting Views. 
If the callout is set to show in Intersecting Views, this type of callout in plan would display 
as a section detail mark in an intersecting view such as a Building section. In Figure 2.51, 
you can see the callout added to the floor plan (left). When the Show In property of that 
callout is set to Intersecting Views, it displays as a detail section mark in the building 
section (right).
Figure 2.50
Be aware of the different 
types of callouts you can 
create from the Type 
Selector.
Figure 2.51
Detail callouts can 
be set to show in 
intersecting views.
If you create a callout using the same type as the parent view, the callout view will also have 
all the same view controls as the parent view. In the floor plan example, you will still have view 
properties such as Depth Clipping and View Range. In a Detail callout, the property called Far 
Clip Settings can be set to either Independent or Same As Parent View.
Take a moment to note the grips on the boundary of a callout when one is selected. You can 
use these grips to change the size of the callout boundary, but this also modifies the crop region 
within the callout view. As you might assume, if you modify the crop region in the callout view, 
the callout boundary also changes.

64  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Callouts can be created in either a simple rectangular shape or in any custom sketched shape. 
You will see these two tool options in the Callout flyout button in the ribbon, but you can always 
edit a rectangular callout by first selecting a callout and then selecting Edit Crop from the con-
textual tab in the ribbon. You can also return a custom shape callout to a simple rectangular 
shape by clicking Reset Crop in the ribbon.
Using Drafting Views
Not every view needs to be connected directly to the model. Drafting views give you the 
ability to draw without first creating a reference to something in your project. They may 
contain Detail and Repeating Detail components and any other annotation content. Drafting 
views are great for quickly documenting typical conditions that don’t require an actual 
model geometry.
Once you create a drafting view, you can refer to this view when creating an elevation, sec-
tion, detail, and so on that would normally rely on an actual view of the model. As you start to 
create a standard project view (Figure 2.52), simply select the Reference Other View option from 
the contextual tab of the ribbon, and then you’ll be allowed to select a reference view from all 
the other like views in your project as well as any drafting views. You can even use the search 
bar to easily locate specific view names instead of scrolling through a long list of all project 
views. Drafting views can also be saved out of the project as common reusable details. This will 
be covered in more depth in Chapter 16.
Figure 2.52
Use the search bar with 
the Reference Other 
View option.
Using Legends
Legends are views in which you can display samples of model elements that will not affect 
schedules and quantity takeoffs. There are two types of legends: legends and keynote legends. 
Regular legends are used to assemble analytic views of content in your project, graphics, 
geometry, tags, and so on—anything that lives in your project. Legends may contain Detail, 
Repeating Detail, and Legend components—which are live representations of 3D model 
elements. Legends are unique in that they are the only view that can be placed on more than 
one sheet.
A Legend component (Figure 2.53) is a special live representation of a system or component 
family that may appear only in legend views (not drafting views). If you make a change to an 
element in your project, the representation of that element in the legend will change as well. 
When you are creating a legend view, the Legend Component tool is located in the Component 
flyout button on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab in the ribbon.

Defining Project Organization |  65  
Keynote legends are special schedules. When creating a keynote legend, you will be 
prompted much the same way as you are when creating a schedule (Figure 2.54). These 
types of legends are meant to be placed on either one sheet or multiple sheets. If the leg-
end is placed on every sheet in which keynotes are used, the Filter By Sheet option should 
be selected on the Filter tab of the Keynote Legend Properties dialog box. With this option 
selected, only those keynotes that appear in views placed on a sheet will appear in the sheet’s 
keynote legend.
Figure 2.53

note legend placed on

66  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Using Schedules
All model elements have information about their properties such as size, material, and cost. In Revit, 
a schedule is a list of any type of element in a project or linked models and their characteristics. You 
can report and interact with this information in tabular views known as schedules. There are six 
types of schedule views that can be accessed from the Create panel in the View tab of the ribbon: 
Schedule/Quantities, Graphical Column Schedule, Material Takeoff, Sheet List, Note Block, and 
View List.
◆
◆
Schedule/Quantities: This is the most commonly used schedule type, allowing you 
to list and quantify all the element category types. You would use this type to make 
door schedules, wall schedules, window schedules, and so on. These schedule types 
are usually limited to scheduling properties within the same category; however, 
you can create a multi-category schedule or use some fields from other elements. For 
example, many model elements can refer to the properties of the room in which they 
are placed.
◆
◆
Graphical Column Schedule: This schedule is different from the other schedule types 
and is commonly used by structural engineers. Structural columns are displayed 
according to their grid intersections, indicating top and bottom constraints as well as 
offsets.
◆
◆
Material Takeoff: This type of schedule lists all the materials and subcomponents of any 
family category. You can use a material takeoff to measure any material that is used in 
a component or assembly. For example, you might want to know the volume of concrete 
within the model. Regardless of whether the concrete is in a wall or floor or column, you 
can tell the schedule to report the total amount of that material in the project. Material 
takeoffs will report material properties across multiple categories.
◆
◆
Sheet List: This schedule allows you to create a list of all the sheets in the project.
◆
◆
Note Block: This tool creates a unique schedule that lists the properties of a generic anno-
tation symbol used in a project.
◆
◆
View List: This schedule shows a list of all the views in the Project Browser and their 
properties. A view list can be a valuable tool to help you manage your project’s views 
efficiently.
One important aspect that we want to reiterate is that schedules are derivatives of the 
model. Often, if the schedule is not accurate, the model is not accurate. A schedule can also 
deal with the tolerances the team has set in the units of the file and may be based on the 
template.
Using Sheets
Printed contract documents are still a common way that architects are paid. You will use sheets 
to organize views and other annotation for the purpose of issuing printable (physical or digital) 
documents. Sheet borders can be customized, but the important fact to realize is that sheets are 
always scaled at 1:1. The important thing to remember is that you are not going to select a scale 

Defining Project Organization |  67  
when you print a sheet; it’s really more like printing than plotting. If you need your sheet to be 
smaller or fit on the desired page, these options are available, and using them is little different 
than printing from a word processing application.
You will learn more about creating sheets in Chapter 17.
Using 3D Views
Two kinds of 3D views are supported: orthographic and perspective. The Default 3D view is 
orthographic, whereas the Camera and Walkthrough views are in perspective (Figure 2.55). You 
can right-click on the View Cube and select the Toggle To command in the context menu. To 
enable the ability to toggle between isometric and perspective, you must have a crop region acti-
vated in the view. We’ll also cover 3D views in detail in Chapter 11.
Figure 2.55
Creating 3D view types 
and toggling between 
them
Orthographic views will always show parallel edges along Cartesian x-, y-, and z-axes. 
Orthographic views are best if you need to show model information to scale. Many people do 
not realize that it is possible to dimension and detail in Revit inside a 3D orthographic view. 
For a more thorough explanation of annotating a 3D view, refer to Chapter 20, “Presenting Your 
Design.”
Create camera views by placing the start and end points of a camera (typically from a plan 
view). The first point you select in plan is the point from which the view will be taken, but the 
second point is also the rotation origin for the view (Figure 2.56). This is important because if 
you select a second point that is far beyond your view, when you open the view and attempt to 
modify it, it will rotate around a target that doesn’t seem to make sense. That’s because the tar-
get location of the view is off in the distance.

68  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
A perspective view will not be to scale, but it can be made relatively larger or smaller by 
selecting the view’s crop region and then selecting the Size Crop button from the Modify | 
Camera tab. Once you do this, you will have the option to change the view size and field of 
view, proportionally or not proportionally (Figure 2.57). You can also simply drag the nodes of 
the bounding box.
Figure 2.57
Modifying 
the view size 
and field of 
view
Figure 2.56
Setting camera and 
target origins
Camera extents are defined by the Far Clip Offset option, accessed in the Properties pal-
ette for the view. If the Far Clip Offset is too low, the view may resemble the image shown in 
Figure 2.58. Geometry that you’d expect to see will be “clipped” in the view.

Defining Project Organization |  69  
Simply increase the Far Clip Offset value to show more of the model. You may also do this 
graphically by returning to a plan view, right-clicking the camera view in the Project Browser, 
and then selecting Show Camera. Once the camera is shown in your plan view, you can select 
the node at the far end of your clipping plane and manually drag the node to extend the far clip 
offset of your view in a similar manner to that shown in Figure 2.57.
Finally, the extents of 3D views (even walkthroughs) can be customized with the use of sec-
tion boxes. You’ll find the Section Box option in the Properties palette for a 3D view. This will 
allow you to control how much of the project is shown (Figure 2.59) and is helpful for creating 
cutaway visualizations in real time or in renderings.

70  | CHAPTER 2  Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization  
Once a section box is enabled in a 3D view, you can select it in order to stretch or rotate it 
according to your needs. The section box is not considered a crop region, and therefore it is not 
affected when you use the Show Crop Region command. If you want to hide a section box, select 
it and then select Hide Elements from the View panel in the ribbon.
Managing Your Project Model
Project management involves all the settings that control (and therefore restrict) the graphic 
information previously described in this chapter as relationships, repetition, and representa-
tions. Returning to the organization chart in Figure 2.21, you’ll see that a Revit project is man-
aged with settings such as line styles, phasing, and view templates.
To cover all aspects of project management in this one chapter would be overwhelming; 
therefore, you can find more detailed information about the following topics throughout this 
book:

◆
For object styles, line styles, fill patterns, line weights, and view templates, refer to 
Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards.”
◆
◆
For worksets and worksharing, refer to Chapter 5, “Working in a Team.”
◆
◆
For phasing and design options, refer to Chapter 10, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and 
Design Options.”

To learn about locations and shared positioning, refer to Chapter 3, “The Basics of the 
Toolbox.”
The Bottom Line
Understand the user interface.    In addition to understanding how your project is orga-
nized, to use the Revit software well you must understand how the UI is organized. Once 
you grasp both of these concepts, you will be ready to move ahead.
Master It    The “big” areas of the UI are the ribbon, the Properties palette, the Project 
Browser, and the drawing area. How do these areas work together, and what tabs corre-
spond to an iterative design process?
Understand project organization.    The compelling advantage of being able to design, docu-
ment, and manage your project across multiple disciplines—the architectural, structural, and 
mechanical disciplines—is something that you can do only in Revit, and understanding proj-
ect workflow is key to getting off on the right foot.
Master It    Thinking back to the Revit organizational chart shown in Figure 2.21, what 
are the main components of a Revit project, and how can you apply them to your design 
process? How do these categories directly affect your design workflow?

 Th e Basics of the toolbox 
 The road to mastering Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software will always include reinforce-
ment of fundamental skills. Just as an accomplished musician will practice her scales, here you 
will “practice” by reviewing the fundamental selection and editing tools throughout the Revit 
Architecture program. There are many tools that can assist you in refi ning your models and 
project designs. Some are simple geometry-editing functions, whereas others possess more 
powerful capabilities. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Select, modify, and replace elements 
 
◆
 Edit elements interactively 
 
◆
 Use other editing tools 
 
◆
 Create site context for your project 
 Selecting, Modifying, and replacing elements 
 Knowing how to select, modify, and replace elements effi ciently is fundamental to working 
productively in Revit software. These interface operations are the foundation on which you will 
build skills to create and edit your project models. In the following sections, we will review 
methods for selecting, fi ltering, and modifying properties. 
 Selecting elements 
 Revit was one of the fi rst programs that had the ability to pre-highlight elements as you 
hovered the mouse pointer over them, before actually clicking to select. Not only does this 
give you a clear idea of what you are about to select, but it also displays information about 
that object in the status bar and in a banner near the mouse pointer. When you hover over an 
element, it pre-highlights; click the highlighted element and it turns blue, indicating that it is 
selected. 
 Once an element is selected, the ribbon changes to Modify mode, where consistent edit-
ing tools are located on the left side and context-sensitive tools appear to the right. Notice 
the subtle differences in the ribbon, as shown in Figure  3.1 , when a roof, wall, and fl oor are 
selected.    

72  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
You can select elements in many ways:
Add or Subtract    You can build a selection of individual elements by using the Ctrl and 
Shift keys on your keyboard. Hold down the Ctrl key while picking to add elements, and 
hold down the Shift key while picking to remove elements. Notice that the mouse pointer 
will indicate a plus (+) when you hold the Ctrl key and a minus (–) when you hold the 
Shift key.
Window    To select a large number of elements in a view window, you can click and drag the 
mouse to form two different types of selection windows. Click and drag from left to right, 
and only the elements completely within the window will be selected—this implied win-
dow is displayed as a solid line. Click and drag from right to left, and any element within or 
crossing the window will be selected—this implied window is displayed as a dashed line. To 
activate either window-selection tool, you must begin by clicking in a blank area (not on an 
element) within the view window.
Chain    Chain-select is an intelligent method for selecting connected elements such as walls, 
lines, sketch segments, and line-based components. To activate this mode, hover your mouse 
Changing Selection Colors
You can customize the default colors for selection, highlighting, and alerts to your own color pal-
ette. To do this, click the Application menu and select Options. In the Options dialog box, select 
the Graphics option on the left to edit the settings for colors.

over (but don’t click) one linear element that is connected to several other linear elements. 
While the element is pre-highlighted, press the Tab key once and the connected elements will 
be pre-highlighted. You can then click to select the chain of elements. When selecting objects, 
use the Tab key to cycle through all available objects near your mouse pointer. If a floor edge 
happens to be near the edge of a wall that you are trying to chain-select, you can skip the 
chain of walls and select the floor. Be sure to look at the status bar; it will indicate “Chain of 
walls or lines” when you have selected correctly.
Select Previous Command    A little-known feature allows you to select elements you had 
previously selected. Either right-click and choose Select Previous from the context menu or 
press Ctrl and the left-arrow key on your keyboard.
Selection Options
You have the ability to choose elements that will be included or excluded when you click on ele-
ments in a model. There are two ways to adjust these settings, as shown in Figure 3.2: Click the 
drop-down menu under the Modify button in the ribbon, or use the icons at the right end of the 
status bar. Note that the icons in the status bar will change slightly to indicate the status of each 
option. When a mode is disabled, a small red X will be displayed on the icon. One of these selec-
tion options is Select Elements By Face, which allows you to select elements simply by picking 
any face of the element.
Filtering Your Selection
Once you have elements selected, a count of selected objects is displayed at the right end of 
the status bar. You can also filter the selection into object categories by clicking the Filter icon 
in the status bar or ribbon. Just as when selecting folders in Windows Explorer, you can select 
multiple categories while holding the Shift key or add a single category by holding the Ctrl 
key. This tool allows you to select large numbers of elements and then focus your selection 
by removing categories you don’t need, as shown in Figure 3.3. For example, if you window-
select an entire floor plan, you will have a selection set of many different categories. Using 
the Filter tool, you can limit the selection to just the Doors category—or perhaps Doors and 
Door Tags.

Use selection options 
to avoid picking ele-
ments, such as links 
or pinned elements. 
These options are 
found in the Select 
expanded panel (a) and 
the status bar (b).

74  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
You can also use the Properties palette as a filter; see the section “Using the Properties 
Palette” later in this chapter for more information.
Using Selection-Based Filters
If you need to save a selection of elements for future editing, you can save a selection-based fil-
ter. When you have a number of elements selected, click Save in the contextual tab of the ribbon 
and a named selection set will be created in the active project model. To load or edit any saved 
selection-based filter, go to the Manage tab in the ribbon and locate the Selection panel. Click the 
Load button to activate any of the saved selection sets, and then you can use other tools such as 
Temporary Hide/Isolate to continue your task work. These selection sets remember the items 
selected within the categories and will not select additional items made after the selection set 
was created. You may update the selection set with new items by loading the existing set and 
using your Ctrl key to add and the Shift key to subtract. The selection set can be saved over the 
previous set or made as another set.
Selecting All Instances
Another fast and powerful method for selecting objects is the Select All Instances function. 
When you right-click a single object in the drawing area or a family in the Project Browser, 
the Select All Instances tool gives you two options: Visible In View or In Entire Project. 
Selecting the Visible In View option will select only those items you can see in the current 
view. This will not select elements that have been either temporarily or permanently hidden 
in the view.
Use the In Entire Project option carefully because you could modify elements in many places 
that you did not intend to change. Always remember to look at the selection count in the status 
bar when you use Select All Instances. Here are some common situations where you might use 
this tool:
◆
◆
View titles—when updating graphics
◆
◆
Walls—when switching from generic to specific types
Figure 3.3
Use the Filter dialog box to 
fine-tune your selections.

Selecting, Modifying, and Replacing Elements |  75  
◆
◆
Title blocks—moving from design to detail documents
◆
◆
Viewports—useful when trying to purge unused viewports
Note that Select All Instances does not work on model lines or symbolic lines. This limita-
tion exists because lines not only are drawn in project views but also are integral parts of other 
objects such as filled regions and shaft openings.
Using the Properties Palette
The Properties palette is a floating palette that can remain open while you work within the 
model. The palette can be docked on either side of your screen, or it can be moved to a second 
monitor. You can open the Properties palette by using one of the following methods:
◆
◆
Click the Properties icon in the Properties panel of the Modify tab in the ribbon.
◆
◆
Select Properties from the context menu.
◆
◆
Press Ctrl+1 or PP on your keyboard.
As shown in Figure 3.4, the Type Selector is located at the top of the Properties palette. When 
you are placing elements or swapping types of elements you’ve already placed in the model, the 
palette must be open to access the Type Selector.
Figure 3.4
The Properties palette con-
tains the Type Selector and 
is used to set view properties 
when no objects are selected.

76  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
When no elements are selected, the Properties palette displays the properties of the active 
view. If you need to change settings for the current view, make the changes in the Properties 
palette and the view will be updated. For views, you do not even need to use the Apply button 
to submit the changes—simply move the mouse out of the Properties palette, and the changes 
will automatically be accepted.
Customizing the Apply Button Behavior
The behavior of the Apply button in the Properties palette can be modified by editing the Revit.ini 
file. If you want to disable the automatic application of settings when you move the mouse pointer 
from the palette into the drawing area, add the following code to the Revit.ini file:
[UserInterface]
DisableMppAutoApply=1
If the bracketed text [UserInterface] already exists in the Revit.ini file, simply add 
DisableMppAutoApply=1 below it. You should restart the application after making any changes 
to the Revit.ini file.
Finally, you can also use the Properties palette as a filtering method for selected elements. 
When you select elements from different categories, the drop-down list below the Type Selector 
displays the total number of selected elements. Open the list and you will see the elements 
listed per category, as shown in Figure 3.5. Select one of the categories to modify the parameters 
for the respective elements. This process is different from the Filter tool in that the entire selec-
tion set is maintained, allowing you to perform multiple modifying actions without reselecting 
elements.
Matching Properties
Located on the Modify tab of the ribbon in the Clipboard panel, the Match Type Properties 
tool allows you to select one element and apply its type and instance properties to other 
elements of the same category. Once you select one element, the brush icon near the mouse 
pointer appears filled. Each subsequent pick on elements of the same category will replace 
Figure 3.5
Use the Properties palette 
to filter selection sets.

Selecting, Modifying, and Replacing Elements |  77  
the selected element with the properties of the first element picked. Clicking in an open space 
will clear the brush icon and allow you to pick a new source object without restarting the 
command.
If you want to use the Match Type Properties tool for multiple objects in a more controlled 
manner, click the Select Multiple button in the contextual tab of the ribbon after the source 
object is selected. Proceed to use any of the usual selection methods described earlier in this 
chapter. When your selection is complete, click the Finish button on the ribbon.
Be careful when using this tool with walls, because not only does it change the wall type, 
it also changes the top and bottom constraints of the walls being matched. One best practice 
for changing wall types without affecting height constraints is to pick a wall and use the Type 
Selector to modify its type.
Using the Context Menu
The context menu that appears when you right-click in the view window contains several 
options. You can activate the last command or select from a list of recent commands, as shown 
in Figure 3.6.
In addition to the other right-click commands listed throughout this chapter (such as Create 
Similar), zoom commands, including Previous Pan/Zoom, are on the context menu. There are 
also useful commands when you right-click views in the Project Browser. For example, activate 
a plan view and then try right-clicking a 3D view in the browser. Select Show Section Box, and 
you can edit the extent of the 3D view’s section box while in a floor plan.

from the context menu.

Editing Elements Interactively
The Revit software provides a range of options to edit elements in the model interactively. The 
most obvious are selecting elements and then dragging them on screen, or using the blue con-
trol grips to extend walls, lines, shape faces, and region boundaries; however, you often need 
more precise ways of moving and copying objects. Let us look at some ways to do that.
Moving Elements
You can move elements in several ways, ranging from choosing traditional tools to using inter-
active dimensions that appear on the fly when you select elements. Become familiar with each 
method and determine what is best for your workflow.
Using Temporary Dimensions
You have likely noticed by now that dimensions appear when elements are selected or newly 
placed. These dimensions are called temporary dimensions and are there to inform you of the 
location of the elements relative to other elements in the model, as well as to help you reposi-
tion them. Clicking the blue dimension value (the text representing the distance measurement) 
makes it an active and editable value. Type in a new value, and the selected element will move 
relative to the element from which it is dimensioned. Remember that when you are editing the 
position of an element via the dimensions, it will always be the selected element that moves. You 
can’t modify a dimension value if an element is not selected.
If a temporary dimension is not referencing a meaningful element, you can choose a different 
reference by dragging the small blue dot on the dimension’s witness line to a new, parallel refer-
ence, which will highlight when the mouse moves over it (Figure 3.7). For example, if you want 
to position a door opening at a specific dimension from a nearby wall, you will need to drag the 
grip of the temporary dimension that references the center of the door to the side of the opening. 
Then you can edit the value of the dimension as required. When you are dragging the grip of a 
temporary dimension, you can also use the Tab key on the keyboard to cycle through available 
snapping references near the mouse pointer. To learn more about how to add references to fami-
lies, refer to Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family Editor.”
Figure 3.7
Drag or click the blue grip to 
change the reference of the 
temporary dimension.

Editing Elements Interactively |  79  
If you click a blue grip, it cycles to the next possible reference in the element. For example, 
clicking the grip of a dimension to a door or window cycles between the left and right open-
ings and the center reference. The same applies to walls: Try clicking the grip on the temporary 
dimension extending from a wall and see how the dimension cycles through the various refer-
ences in the wall (interior face, centerline, exterior face). Note that when you drag a temporary 
dimension reference to a different position, the new reference is remembered when you return 
to the element for future editing.
You can also change the default behavior of temporary dimensions using the Temporary 
Dimension Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 3.8 (on the Manage tab, click Additional 
Settings and then select Temporary Dimensions). Here you can specify how temporary dimen-
sions will independently reference walls, doors, and windows.
You can modify the font size and transparency of temporary dimensions in the program 
options. To customize these values, click the Application menu and select Options. In the Options 
dialog box that opens, switch to the Graphics category and locate the Temporary Dimension Text 
Appearance settings. Adjust the text size and transparency according to your needs.
If you have several elements selected at the same time or select an element within the prox-
imity of a large number of other elements, temporary dimensions sometimes don’t appear. 
Check the Options bar for the Activate Dimensions button; clicking it will make the temporary 
dimensions appear in the view.
Behaviors for Modify Tools
As in Autodesk AutoCAD software, you have the option to activate the Modify tools without any 
elements selected. If you choose this method, you must press the Enter key after selecting the 
objects you intend to modify.
You can also switch between any of the Modify panel tools while you have elements selected. For 
example, if you initially chose Mirror – Pick Axis and selected an element during the command, 
you can simply activate the Mirror – Draw Axis command without reselecting the elements.
Figure 3.8
The Temporary Dimension 
Properties dialog box lets you 
define default behaviors based 
on your modeling needs.

80  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Using the Move Tool
To relocate elements with more precision, use the Move tool rather than simply drag them. The 
tool allows you to type in values or use temporary dimensions as helpers.
Moving elements is a two-click process: First, you define a start point, and then you click 
to define a destination. If you know you need to move something a specific distance, it does 
not matter where your two picks take place. All that matters is that the distance between 
the two clicks is the specified distance and in the specified direction. Alternatively, you can 
guide the mouse pointer in the desired direction of the move and key in the desired dimen-
sion value.
There are a few options on the Options bar to be aware of when the Move command is active:
Constrain    When this option is selected, it constrains movement to horizontal and vertical 
directions relative to the view. Deselecting it allows you to move the element freely as long as 
the element is not hosted. Hosted elements, such as windows or doors, always move in a con-
strained manner parallel to their host’s axis.
Disjoin    The Disjoin option is helpful when you need to move elements and eliminate any 
joining relationships the moved elements might have with other objects. This is particularly 
useful with walls in some circumstances where you may be rapidly iterating through design 
scenarios.
You might also attempt to use the Disjoin option to move a hosted element, such as a door, to 
a new host. Don’t use the Move tool to perform this action; instead you must select the hosted 
element, and from the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Pick New Host. The object will be 
relocated to the new host you select. This method is also preferred over deleting and re-creat-
ing because it maintains the data associated with the original element instance.
Multiple    The Multiple option is not active for the Move tool. This option is available only 
when you switch to the Copy tool.
Nudging Elements
Nudging is a simple way to push things around quickly, as you would in software programs 
such as Adobe Photoshop. When elements are selected, you can use the arrow keys on the 
keyboard to move the elements horizontally or vertically in small increments. Each press of an 
arrow key nudges the element a specific distance based on your current zoom factor. The closer 
you zoom, the finer the nudge. Note that your snap settings do not affect the nudging distances 
set by the zoom level. However, holding the Shift key while using the nudge tool increases the 
distance of the nudge.
Moving with Nearby Elements
A simple way to constrain freestanding elements is to use the Moves With Nearby Elements 
option. This setting is designed to capture logical relationships between elements without 
establishing an explicit constraint. When furnishing a space, for example, you probably 
want to align the bed or dresser with an adjacent wall. If you change the design of the space, 
you want the furniture to follow the wall to the new location. For this purpose, select the 
furniture and then select Moves With Nearby Elements in the Options bar, as shown in 
Figure 3.9.

Editing Elements Interactively |  81  
By setting this option, you create an invisible relationship between the bed and the wall 
so that each time you move the wall, the bed moves with it. To clarify the difference between 
this approach and other constraint relationships, you could create a wall-hosted family, but 
that would limit your placement options and would subject instances to deletion if the host is 
deleted. You could align and constrain the family to its host, but too many explicit constraints 
will adversely affect model performance.
The Moves With Nearby Elements option is also a simpler alternative to using a hosted fam-
ily. When a component family does not need to cut or carve the host geometry, consider using a 
freestanding family or just a face-based family in conjunction with the Nearby Elements option. 
Refer to Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family Editor,” for more information about hosted ver-
sus non-hosted values.
Copying Elements
The Copy tool is another modifying tool that is nearly identical to the Move tool, but it makes a 
copy of the selected element at the location of the second pick. This tool doesn’t copy anything 
to the Clipboard; it copies an instance of an element or selection of elements in the same view. If 
you change views while using this tool, your selection is lost.
To activate this tool, either choose elements you want to copy and then select the Copy tool 
in the Modify tab in the ribbon or activate the Copy tool first, select elements you want to copy, 
and then press the Enter key to start the copy process. Using the Options bar, you can choose to 
make multiple copies in one transaction by selecting the Multiple option.
An alternative to using the Copy tool is to use standard Windows accelerator keys to copy 
elements. To quickly copy a single element without the precision of the Copy tool, click and drag 
an element while pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard. This technique is useful for quickly 
populating a quantity of elements in a design without the required precision of the multiple 
picks of the Copy tool.

82  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Rotating and Mirroring Elements
When refining or expanding your building design, you will likely find a frequent need to rotate 
or mirror one or more objects. Just as with moving or copying, there are a few methods for these 
types of interactive operations. We will review these methods in the following sections.
Using the Spacebar
You can use the spacebar to rotate an element, both at the time of initial placement and after it 
has been placed. In addition to rotating an object in 90-degree increments, pressing the spacebar 
will locate any nearby non-orthogonal references (walls, grids, or reference planes) as rotation 
candidates. This is a great time-saving command to become familiar with because you can forgo 
the necessity of using an additional tool, such as Rotate or Mirror, after placing an object. Here 
are a few examples:
Doors and Windows    If you have a door with its swing in the wrong direction, select it and 
press the spacebar. You can cycle through all four possible orientations of the door using the 
spacebar. The same holds true for windows; however, many window families only let you flip 
the window from inside to outside because many windows are symmetrical in elevation. If 
you are creating an asymmetrical window family, be sure to add flip controls to the window 
family during its creation. These controls allow the spacebar to work on hosted elements.
Walls    If you select a wall, pressing the spacebar flips the element as if it were being mir-
rored about its length. Walls flip based on their location line, which often isn’t the centerline 
of the assembly. If you aren’t sure which direction your wall is facing, select it and look for the 
flip-control arrows. These are always located on the exterior side of walls (Figure 3.10). You 
can also use the spacebar to flip the direction of an object. Simply select the object and hit the 
spacebar, or use it to toggle through placement options while you’re locating a component.
Copying Using Worksets
If you are working in a model in which worksharing is enabled, be careful when performing any 
method of copying. These methods include pasting from the Clipboard, mirroring, and arraying, 
as well as using the Copy tool. Copied elements will always be placed on the active workset, not the 
workset of the original object. For example, if you are copying chairs that have been placed on the 
workset named Furniture but your active workset is Structure, the copied chairs will be assigned 
to the Structure workset. For more information, refer to Chapter 5, “Working in a Team.”
Figure 3.10
The flip arrow is another 
way to reorient an element. 
For walls, it is always found 
on the exterior side.

Editing Elements Interactively |  83  
Freestanding Elements    If you select a freestanding element, the spacebar rotates the ele-
ment around the center reference planes defined in the family. Depending on how the family 
was built, the rotation origin may not make the most sense. If you decide to edit a family in 
order to change the location of the geometry relative to the center reference planes, be care-
ful: When the family is loaded back into a project, all instances of the family will jump to a 
new location based on the change you made relative to the reference planes.
Using the Rotate Tool
To rotate an element, select it and click the Rotate tool in the Modify panel. Remember, you can 
also activate the Rotate tool first, select one or more elements, and then press Enter to begin the 
operation. This is a two-click operation similar to the Move and Copy tools. The default rotation 
point is based on the center of the selected elements; however, you will most likely want to des-
ignate a more meaningful center.
To choose a new center of rotation, you have a couple of options. You can drag the center 
icon to a new location before clicking to set the starting reference angle. Note that you might 
have to zoom out in order to find the center icon. The second option is to select elements you 
want to rotate and then use the Place button in the Options bar to simply place the rotation 
point in the desired location without dragging. Once the center is established, begin rotating 
the element using the temporary dimensions as a reference or by typing in the angle of rotation 
explicitly.
Note that you can also use keyboard snap shortcuts to refine the location of the center of rota-
tion while dragging it. For example, type SE to snap to an explicit endpoint while dragging.
Using the Mirror Tool
The Mirror tool allows you to mirror elements across an axis in order to create a mirror image 
of an element or multiple elements. You can either pick an existing reference in the model with 
the Mirror – Pick Axis tool or draw the axis interactively using the Mirror – Draw Axis tool. In 
Figure 3.11, the centerline of the plumbing chase wall was picked as the axis for mirroring the 
plumbing fixtures.

and bath fixtures

around the cen-
terline of the 
chase wall: (a)

(b) the mirrored 
elements.

84  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Like the other Modify tools you have seen so far, the Mirror tools have the option to cre-
ate a copy of the selected elements or to simply mirror the selected elements to a new posi-
tion. You can find the Copy option in the Options bar after you activate either of the Mirror 
tools.
Being Careful When Mirroring
The Mirror tools should be used carefully on any type of freestanding elements that may be 
asymmetrical in design. You can use the Mirror tools on any object, but keep in mind that 
performing this operation to suit a design may distort a product component. For example, if an 
asymmetrical chair family was loaded into your model and you decide to mirror it to fit a space 
layout, the mirrored version of that chair may not be a viable product offered by the manufac-
turer. Remember that although an object can be scheduled, the schedule cannot determine if 
the object has been mirrored.
Arraying Elements
The Array tool allows you to copy instances of an element with equal spacing between the 
instances. You have the option to create intelligent arrays that can be grouped and associ-
ated for further refinement, as well as one-off, unassociated arrays. Like the other tools 
we have reviewed in the Modify tab of the ribbon, the array options are presented on the 
Options bar.
You can create two types of arrays: linear and radial. Linear arrays are set as the default 
because they’re the most common. As you would expect, a linear array creates a series of ele-
ments in a line. Each element in the array can be given a defined distance from the previous 
element (Move To 2nd option) or can be spaced equally based on a defined overall array length 
(Move To Last option). Figure 3.12 shows a linear array where the Move To 2nd option was 
selected to define a fixed distance between each instance in the array. Think of this type of 
array as additive and subtractive: If you change the number, the length of the array increases or 
decreases.
If you want to arrange elements in a fixed space and the exact spacing between elements 
is less important, use the Move To Last option. Figure 3.13 shows an array where the location 
of its last element was picked and the elements were placed equally between the first and last 
elements. With this option, the length is fixed and the array squeezes elements within that con-
straint as the number changes.
A radial array uses the same options as a linear array, but it revolves around a center point. 
The Move To 2nd and Move To Last options function as angles instead of distances in a radial 
array. You can specify the instance angle or overall array angle with two picks, or you can enter 
a specific value. With this type of array, elements auto-rotate so that each element faces the cen-
ter of the array, as shown in Figure 3.14.

The radial array is a little trickier than a linear array. Here is how to achieve the example 
shown in Figure 3.14:
	
1.	 Download and open the file c03-Array.rvt from this book’s companion website at www
.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. Activate the Level 1 floor plan. To assist in start-
ing the radial array, we provided a detail line to help locate the intended center of the 
array.
	
2.	 Select the chair and activate the Array tool from the Modify tab in the ribbon. In the 
Options bar, select the Radial option button, change Number to 6, and choose the Move 
To Last option.
	
3.	 In the drawing area, click and drag the grip indicating the center of rotation off the element 
and to the endpoint of the detail line provided.
	
4.	 Click the mouse to define any starting point. An exact starting point is not important, 
because you will be defining a complete circle in the next step.
	
5.	 Do not click a second time; instead, go to the Options bar, type 360 in the Angle option, 
and press Enter on the keyboard.
	
6.	 Press Enter or click on any open space in the drawing area to complete the command.
Enabling the Group and Associate option allows you to treat an array as a group that 
can be modified later to adjust the number and spacing of the array. If this option is 
unchecked, the array is a one-off operation and you have no means of adjusting it after it is 
created.
As shown previously in Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.13, when an element in a grouped array is 
selected, a control appears, indicating the number of elements in the array. Editing that number 
changes the number of elements in the array. This tool comes in handy when you are creating 
certain families because the array number can be associated with a parameter or driven by a 
mathematical formula. See Chapter 14 for a detailed exercise.

Elements will auto-
rotate in a radial array.

Scaling Elements
The Scale tool lets you scale certain lines and graphic elements in 2D that are appropriate for 
scaling, such as imported raster images and 2D line shapes. Although it’s not an obvious option, 
the Scale tool can be used in Sketch mode for any type of sketch-based element in a project or 
for solid and void geometry sketches in the Family Editor.
Keep in mind that you are working with a model made out of real-world objects, not abstract 
primitive forms. You cannot scale most elements because it’s not practical or meaningful and 
may cause dangerous errors in scheduling and dimensions. For example, you can’t scale the size 
of a door, wall, or sink because they represent real assemblies and scaling them would mean 
resizing all their components. This would lead to impractical results, such as a sink being dis-
played as a fraction of its actual manufactured size.
Aligning Elements
If you’ve been using Revit software for any amount of time, you have likely discovered the 
power of the Align tool. It can supplant the need to use many of the tools we have already dis-
cussed, such as Move and Rotate. The Align tool lets you line up elements in an efficient way 
that works on almost all types of objects.
With this tool, you explicitly align references from one element to another, regardless of 
the type of either object. For example, you can align windows in a facade so that their centers 
or openings are all in alignment. To use the Align tool, activate it from the Modify tab in the 
ribbon and first select the target reference—a reference to which you want to align another 
element. Next, select what you want to align to that reference—the part or side of the element 
whose position needs to be modified. The second element picked is the one that always moves 
into alignment. This selection sequence is the opposite of the other editing tools we’ve discussed 
so far, so remember: destination first, then the element to align.
As soon as you make your second pick and the aligned element is moved, a lock icon 
appears, allowing you to constrain the alignment. If you click the icon, thereby constraining the 
alignment, the alignment is preserved if either element moves. Figure 3.15 illustrates the use 
of the Align tool to align multiple windows in an elevation view using the Multiple Alignment 
option on the Options bar.
The Align tool also works within Filled Region model patterns, such as brick or stone on 
surfaces of model objects. Select a line on an object such as the edge of a wall, and then select 
a line in the surface pattern. Use the Tab key if you cannot get surface patterns selected with 
the first mouse click. Note that the Align tool will also rotate elements in the process of align-
ing them to objects that are not parallel. This is a real time-saver compared to moving and 
rotating.
Grouping Arrays of Datum Elements
When developing a project for a multistory building, you may find that using the Array tool is a 
quick and easy way to generate many levels and grid lines. We recommend not using the Group 
and Associate option when arraying datum elements. Maintaining grids and levels inside groups 
can cause problems with elements that refer to those data.

88  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Trimming or Extending Lines and Walls
You can trim and extend lines and walls to one another using the Trim/Extend tools on 
the Modify tab of the ribbon. In older versions of Revit Architecture, this function was 
assigned to a single button with three options in the Options bar. There are three separate 
tools in the ribbon: Trim/Extend To Corner, Trim/Extend Single Element, and Trim/Extend 
Multiple Elements. With the Trim/Extend tools, you first activate the tool and then operate 
on elements in the model, selecting two lines or walls that need to meet in a corner or as a 
T-intersection.
The Trim/Extend tools are used frequently for editing sketches of floors and roofs 
because it’s easy to end up with overlapping lines that need to be trimmed to form a closed 
loop. Keep in mind that with the Trim/Extend tools, you are selecting pairs of elements to 
remain, not to remove. Although the Single Element and Multiple Elements tools are similar 
to the Extend command in AutoCAD, the behavior of the Trim/Extend To Corner tool in 
Revit Architecture is more like that of the Chamfer or Fillet command rather than its Trim 
command.
The Trim/Extend tools for extending a single element or multiple elements function in a 
slightly different way than Trim/Extend To Corner. To extend a wall or line, first select a target 
reference; then select the element you want to extend to that target (Figure 3.16). Using the Trim/
Extend Multiple Elements tool, you first select the target reference; then each subsequent pick 
extends the selected element to the target reference. You also have the ability to use a selection 
box to trim multiple elements.
Using Trim/Extend on Line-Based Components
You can use the Trim/Extend tools on line-based families that are either model or detail compo-
nents. Try this using a line-based detail component for batt insulation or gypsum wallboard. The 
Trim/Extend tools will help make your detailing process much more efficient and fun!

to line up edges of win-
dows in a facade.

Splitting Lines and Walls
The Split Element tool operates on walls and lines and lets you divide an element into two 
pieces. To cut an element, activate the Split Element tool from the Modify tab in the ribbon and 
place the mouse pointer over the edge of a wall or line. Before you click, you will see a preview 
of the split line. The split line will automatically snap to any adjoining geometry.
The Options bar displays a nice feature called Delete Inner Segment that removes the need 
to use any of the Trim tools after a splitting operation. In the example in Figure 3.17, the middle 
section of a wall needs to be removed so that you end up with a clean set of wall joins. Using 
the Split Element tool with the Delete Inner Segment option checked, you can accomplish 
this with two clicks and get a clean condition without having to return with any of the Trim 
commands.
Split with Gap
The Split with Gap tool allows you to specify a gap distance and pick a single point on a wall. 
Although the wall is divided into two separate segments, the gap distance is maintained with 
an automatic constraint. To use Split with Gap, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Go to the Modify tab, and from the Modify panel, select Split with Gap.
	
2.	 Specify the Joint Gap distance in the Options bar. Note that this distance can be set only 
between 1/16″ (1.6 mm) and 1′-0″ (300 mm).
	
3.	 Move the mouse pointer over a wall and click to place the gap.
Once you have successfully split a wall with a gap, select the wall and notice the constraints 
(locks) on the gap and between the two parallel wall segments. Try to drag either of the wall 
ends separated by the gap, and you will see that the gap distance is maintained. Try to move the 
wall in a direction perpendicular to the wall segments, and you will notice that the two wall 
segments remain aligned.

90  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
If you would like to rejoin walls that have been split with a gap, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select a wall that has been split with a defined gap.
	
2.	 Click the constraint icon in the gap to unlock the dimension constraint.
	
3.	 Select each wall segment and click the Allow Join icon near the end of the wall that was split.
	
4.	 Select the other wall and repeat step 3.
	
5.	 Drag the wall end grip of one wall segment to the end of the other segment. The walls 
should join.
Note that on walls with smaller gaps, the segments may automatically join as soon as you 
select Allow Join; however, rejoined segments may not form a single segment. If you have trou-
ble joining two parallel wall segments into one, try to drag one of the wall ends away from the 
other and release the mouse button; then drag the segment back to the other end.
Offsetting Lines and Walls
Offset is similar to the Move and Copy tools in that it moves and makes a copy of an element 
by offsetting it parallel to an edge you select. You can find the Offset tool in the Modify tab of 
the ribbon. You can also specify an offset distance as an option in the Options bar when you are 
sketching lines or walls.
This tool is especially useful in the Family Editor when you are making shapes that have a 
consistent thickness in profile, such as extruded steel shapes. The Offset tool has a Copy option 
available in the Options bar that determines whether the offsetting operation generates a copy 
of the selected elements or simply moves them.
Remember that you can Tab-select a chain of elements and offset them in one click, as shown 
in Figure 3.18. When the Offset command is active, the dashed line appears on the side of the 
element to which the offset will be created.
Preventing Elements from Moving
In some cases, you may want to make sure some elements in the model never move. An example 
of this is when you work on a renovation to an existing building. For obvious reasons, you 
would not want to move existing walls. Other examples include imported drawings, grids, 
levels, and exterior walls. There are two ways to deal with this and lock certain elements, thus 
preventing them from moving.
Figure 3.18
Use Offset with Tab-
select to copy a chain 
of elements.

Editing Elements Interactively |  91  
Pinning Elements
You can restrict an element’s ability to move by pinning it with the Pin tool. Use this tool to 
lock down critical elements that need to remain fixed for long periods of time. As one example, 
this is an important tool to use on imported CAD files because it is easy to accidentally select 
an import and drag it or move it. This kind of accidental modification can lead to coordination 
problems, even in a BIM environment. Use pins to lock down grid lines because you certainly 
do not want to accidentally relocate those either.
This tool is located in the Modify panel of the Modify tab in the ribbon. Select one or more 
elements for which you want to prevent movement, and click the Pin tool. If you try to move the 
element, nothing will happen—you will not even get a preview of a potential move. To unpin 
an element, select it and click the Unpin tool, which is also located in the Modify panel. You can also 
unpin an element by clicking the pin icon that appears near a pinned element when it is selected.
Revit helps you avoid accidentally deleting elements. Instead of permitting the deletion and 
providing a warning, Revit will warn you that the element is pinned and instruct you to unpin 
the element before using Delete. If you select multiple elements (some pinned and some not 
pinned) for deletion, Revit deletes the elements that are not pinned and warns that you must 
unpin the pinned elements before deleting them.
Combining the Pin tool and the selection filters will allow a BIM coordinator to create a selec-
tion set for pinned items. By loading the selection set, the coordinator can double-check that the 
items are indeed pinned.
Constraints
Constraints aren’t as rigid as the Pin tool, but they do allow you to create dimensional rules in 
the model so that elements remain fixed relative to other elements. You can create a constraint 
using dimensions or alignments and then click the lock icon that appears upon creation of a 
dimension or completion of an alignment operation.
A simple example of using constraints is maintaining a fixed distance between a door and a 
side wall. If the wall moves, the door will also move. If you try to move the door, the software 
will not let you move it. Look at Figure 3.19; the door has been constrained to remain 4″ (100 mm) 
from the wall face.
This type of constraint is accomplished by placing a dimension string between the doorjamb 
and the face of the wall and then clicking the lock icon on the dimension. Note that the dimen-
sion can be deleted while preserving the constraint. If you delete a constrained dimension, an 
alert will appear, giving you the option to unconstrain the elements or simply delete the dimen-
sion while maintaining the constraint (Figure 3.20). Note that you can determine where con-
straints were by creating new dimensions; constrained relationships will still display with the 
lock icon. You can also view these relationships when a constrained element is selected. Simply 
hover the mouse pointer near the constraint icon, and you will see the dimension constraint 
represented as a dashed dimension string.

92  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Revealing Constraints in a View
You may find that your modeled elements behave in an unexpected way if too many constraints 
have been applied. To assist in troubleshooting constraints, you can use the Reveal Constraints 
view mode available on the view control bar. When this temporary view mode is activated, all 
constraints on visible model elements—even constrained dimensions that have been deleted—
will be displayed in red (Figure 3.21).

wall can’t be moved inde-

Exploring Other Editing Tools |  93  
Exploring Other Editing Tools
Many other editing tools are available, and we will cover them in subsequent chapters when 
they’re used in specific operations. However, there are a few you should know about now 
because they are generic tools you can put to immediate use on any project.
Using the Join Geometry Tool
Joining walls to floors and roofs creates clean-looking drawings, and Revit will attempt to create 
these joins automatically; however, in some cases, elements don’t look right until they are explicitly 
joined. This is where the Join Geometry tool comes into play. This tool creates joins between floors, 
walls, ceilings, roofs, and slabs. A common use for this tool is in building sections, where floors 
and walls may appear overlapped and not joined. Figure 3.22 shows a floor intersecting with some 
walls that aren’t joined. Using the Join Geometry tool, you can clean up these conditions nicely.
Figure 3.22
Intersections 
at Level 2 have 
been joined: 
(a) unjoined; 
(b) joined.
(a)
(b)
You might notice that some joins—especially in a view set to the Coarse detail level—contain 
a thin dividing line between two elements. This is usually because the two elements you joined 
consist of differing materials. Ensuring consistent material application will give you increased 
graphic quality in your project views.
You should also be aware that joining large host elements to many other elements may 
degrade model performance. One way to avoid this is to apply a black solid fill to elements in 
the cut plane of your coarse view sections and avoid overall manual joining; then selectively join 
for medium and fine views. You can do so easily by selecting the element in question (wall, floor, 
and so forth) and choosing Edit Type from the Properties palette. By default, the Coarse Scale 
Fill Pattern is set to No Pattern. Set this to Solid Fill; in all your coarse views, your elements will 
show as solid black.
Using the Split Face and Paint Tools
Occasionally, you may need to apply a thin material to the face of an object without making 
a new type of element. You may also need to divide an overall surface into smaller regions to 
receive different materials. You can use the Paint tool to apply materials and the Split Face tool 
to divide object surfaces. With the Paint tool, you can apply alternative materials to the exterior 
faces of walls, floors, roofs, and ceilings. This material has no thickness, but you can schedule it 
with a material takeoff schedule and annotate it with a material tag. A typical use case for these 

94  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
two tools is the application of a carpet or thin tile to a floor. See Chapter 13, “Modeling Floors, 
Ceilings, and Roofs,” for a detailed exercise on this topic.
Copying and Pasting from the Clipboard
Copying and pasting is a familiar technique used in almost all software applications, and Revit 
software provides the basic features you would expect (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V). It also has some 
additional time-saving options that are specific to working on a 3D model.
To copy any element or group of elements to the Clipboard, select them and press Ctrl+C. 
To paste, press Ctrl+V. In the majority of cases, the software pastes the elements with a dashed 
bounding box around them. You then determine where to place the elements by clicking a point 
to define its final position. In the Options bar, you will find a Constrain option that when clicked 
will only let you define the location of the pasted content orthogonally to the original ele-
ments. With the elements copied to the Clipboard, you’ll also find some additional tools on the 
Clipboard panel of the Modify tab.
Edit Pasted
Immediately after you select a point for the location of the pasted content, you will find a 
new panel in the ribbon called Edit Pasted (Figure 3.23). You can click Finish to complete 
the pasting action or start another command. If you are unsatisfied with the pasting action, 
select Cancel.
If you select Edit Pasted Elements, a special mode will be started with the Edit Pasted tools 
appearing at the top left of the drawing area (Figure 3.24). In this mode, only the pasted ele-
ments are editable. You can use the Select All or Filter button to refine those elements within the 
pasted selection. When your edits are completed, click the Finish button.
Figure 3.23
Additional actions are avail-
able when pasting elements.
Figure 3.24
Edit Pasted mode 
allows additional 
modification of pasted 
elements.
Paste Aligned
If you need to paste elements with greater location control, Paste Aligned offers options to make 
the process simple and efficient. These options allow you to quickly duplicate elements from 
one view or one level to another while maintaining a consistent location in the x-coordinate and 
y-coordinate planes. After selecting elements and copying them to the Clipboard, find the Paste 
button in the Clipboard panel, as shown in Figure 3.25.

Exploring Other Editing Tools |  95  
Five options, in addition to the Paste From Clipboard option, are available when you click the 
Paste drop-down button. Depending on the view from which you copy and what kinds of ele-
ments you copy, the availability of these options will change. For example, if you select a model 
element in a plan view, you will not have the Aligned To Selected Views option. These options 
are as follows:
Aligned To Selected Levels    This is a mode you can use to quickly paste copied elements to 
many different levels simultaneously. When you select this option, you choose levels from a 
list in a dialog box. This is useful when you have a multistory building design, and you want 
to copy a furniture layout that repeats on many floors, and selecting level graphics in a sec-
tion or elevation would be too tedious.
Aligned To Selected Views    If you want to copy view-specific elements, such as drafting 
lines, text, or dimensions, this option allows you to paste them by selecting views from a list of 
views in a dialog box. In the list available for selection, you do not see levels listed but rather 
see a list of parallel views. For example, if elements are copied from a plan view, all other plan 
views are listed. Likewise, if you copy from an elevation view, only elevation views are listed.
Aligned To Current View    This option pastes the elements from the Clipboard into the 
active view in the same spatial location. For example, if you copy a series of walls in one 
view, switch to another view in the Project Browser, and paste with the Aligned To Current 
View option, the software pastes the walls to the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate loca-
tions in the view you switched to.
Aligned To Same Place    This option places elements from the Clipboard in the exact place 
from which they were copied or cut. One use for this tool is copying elements into a design 
option; see Chapter 10, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options,” for an expla-
nation of design options.
Aligned To Picked Level    This is a mode you can use to copy and paste elements between 
different floors by picking a level in a section or elevation. Although you can cut or copy 
elements from a plan view, you must be in an elevation or section to paste using this 
option. You might use this paste option to copy balconies on a facade from one floor to 
another.
Figure 3.25
Paste Aligned options

96  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Using the Create Similar Tool
Rather than hunting through a list of families or making copies you’d have to edit later, try 
using the Create Similar tool to add new instances of a selected element to your model.
This tool is available in the Create panel of the Modify tab of the ribbon when an object is 
selected or from the context menu. To use this method, select an existing instance of the same 
type of element you’d like to create and click the Create Similar tool, and you will immediately 
be in a placement or creation mode according to the type of element. For example, if you use 
Create Similar with a floor selected, you’re taken directly into Sketch mode, where you can start 
sketching the boundary for a new floor.
Using Keyboard Shortcuts (Accelerators)
To increase your productivity even further, you may like to use keyboard shortcuts to speed 
up common commands and minimize interruptions to your workflow. When you hover your 
mouse pointer over any tool in the ribbon, the keyboard shortcut is indicated to the right of the 
tool name, as shown here.
You can customize the keyboard shortcuts assigned to all commands. To access this tool, go 
to the View tab in the ribbon, find the Windows panel, and select User Interface ➢ Keyboard 
Shortcuts. When the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box appears (Figure 3.26), you can search for 
commands in the Search box.
Figure 3.26
Customize keyboard 
shortcuts for commonly 
used Revit commands.

Modeling Site Context |  97  
Once you find a command to which you’d like to assign a shortcut, select it and type the 
shortcut in the Press New Keys box. Click the Assign button, and you will see the new shortcut 
added to the selected command. Click OK to close the dialog box, and the keyboard shortcuts 
will be ready for immediate use. If you choose to modify the shortcut, understand that no 
two commands can have an identical shortcut. As an example, if you use the shortcut AA for 
Align, you can’t use AA again for the shortcut to another command. Revit will take the one that 
appears first in the list and ignore any other entries.
Double-click to Edit
Revit allows you to double-click families and components to launch the respective editing 
mode. Although this may be the epitome of editing efficiency, you also have the ability to 
customize this behavior—even to completely disable it. From the Application menu, click the 
Options button. In the Options dialog box, select the User Interface settings, and then click the 
Customize button next to Double-Click Options. In the Customize Double-Click Settings dialog 
box, you will see the limits to which you can customize the behavior to your liking. Note that 
any of the actions can be set to Do Nothing and some can be set to Edit Type or Edit Element.
Modeling Site Context
In the previous sections of this chapter, you learned about the fundamental tools for editing and 
modifying model elements. Other tools you should become familiar with are the site tools. They 
allow you to create a context within which your building models can be situated. For example, 
a toposurface will create a hatched area when you view your building in a section, and it will 
function as a hosting surface for site components such as trees, shrubs, parking spaces, accesso-
ries, and vehicles (Figure 3.27).
The site tools are intended for use only in the creation of basic elements, including topogra-
phy, property lines, and building pads. Although editing utilities are available to manipulate 
the site elements, these tools are not meant to be used for civil engineering like the functionality 
found in AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software is.
In the following sections, you’ll learn about the different ways to create and modify a topo-
surface, how to generate property lines with tags, and how to model a building pad within a 
toposurface.

98  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Using a Toposurface
As its name suggests, a toposurface is a surface-based representation of the topography context 
supporting a project. It is not modeled as a solid; however, a toposurface will appear as if it were 
solid in a 3D view with a section box enabled (Figure 3.28).
Figure 3.27
A toposurface can 
host components, 
such as trees, 
people, vehicles, 
and other 
entourage.
Figure 3.28
A toposurface will

Modeling Site Context |  99  
You can create a toposurface in one of three ways: by placing points at specific elevations, 
by using a linked CAD file with lines or points at varying elevations, or by using a points file 
generated by a civil engineering application. We’ll examine these techniques in the following 
exercises.
Turning On and Off Tabs
If you don’t see the Massing & Site tab, just navigate to the Application menu and choose Options. 
From there, select the User Interface category. Here you can turn on and off any of the tabs from 
the ribbon.
Creating a Toposurface by Placing Points
The simplest way to create a toposurface is by placing points in your Revit project at specific 
elevations. To create a clean outer edge for your toposurface, draw a large rectangle using detail 
lines in your site plan. When you are creating a toposurface by placing points, there are no line-
based geometry tools; however, points can be snapped to the detail lines. The following exercise 
will show you how to create a toposurface by placing points:
	
1.	 Begin by opening the file c03-Site-Tools.rvt or c03-Site-Tools-Metric.rvt, which 
can be downloaded from this book’s companion web page.
	
2.	 Activate the floor plan named Site, and you will see a rectangle created from detail lines.
	
3.	 Go to the Massing & Site tab, and from the Model Site panel, click Toposurface.
Notice in the contextual tab in the ribbon that the default tool is Place Point.
	
4.	 Notice the Elevation value in the Options bar. Set the value of the points you are about to place.
Also note that the elevation values are always related to the Revit Project Base Point. They 
do not relate to the elevation of any shared coordinates.
	
5.	 With the Elevation value set to 0′-0″ (0 mm), place a point at each of the left corners of the 
rectangle.
	
6.	 Change the Elevation value to 20′-0″ (6000 mm), and then place a point at each of the right 
corners of the rectangle. You will notice the contour lines of the surface begin to appear 
after the third point of the surface is placed.
	
7.	 In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Finish Surface (green check mark) to complete 
the toposurface. Activate the Default 3D view, and you will see the sloping surface, as 
shown in Figure 3.29. And keep in mind that this will be a thin surface, not a solid. Notice 
that the 3D view in this project already has the section box property enabled. To adjust 
the section box, activate the Reveal Hidden Elements tool in the view control bar.
	
8.	 Save the file for use in a subsequent exercise in this chapter.

100  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Creating a Toposurface from Imported CAD Data
A common workflow you may encounter involves the use of CAD data generated by a civil 
engineer. In this case, the engineer must create a file with 3D data. Blocks, circles, or contour 
polylines must exist in the CAD file at the appropriate elevation to be used in the process of gen-
erating a toposurface in Revit.
In the following exercise, you will download a sample DWG file with contour polylines. You 
must link the file into your Revit project before creating the toposurface:
	
1.	 Download and open c03-Site-Link.rvt or c03-Site-Link-Metric.rvt from this

Change the visual style of the view to Consistent Colors to examine your results.
Creating a Toposurface from a Points File
A less-common method for creating a toposurface, although equally effective when using 
linked CAD data, is using a points file. A points file is a text file that is usually generated 
from a civil engineering program. It must be a comma-delimited file (TXT or CSV for-
mat) in which the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the points are the first numeric values in the

file. In the following exercise, we have provided a sample points file that was exported 
from AutoCAD Civil 3D using the XYZ_LIDAR Classification (comma-delimited) format 
setting:
	
1.	 Open the file c03-Site-Points-Start.rvt, which can be downloaded from this book’s 
web page.
	
2.	 Download the file c03-Points.csv from this book’s web page to your local computer.
	
3.	 Activate the Site plan in the Project Browser.
	
4.	 From the Massing & Site tab on the ribbon, click the Toposurface button. In the Tools 
panel of the Modify | Edit Surface tab, select Create From Import and then choose 
Specify Points File.
	
5.	 Navigate to the c03-Points.csv file and click Open. Note that if you were using 
a TXT format file, you would change the Files of Type option to Comma Delimited 
Text.
	
6.	 In the Format dialog box, select Decimal Feet. It is important to understand the units of 
the values in the points file to ensure that the toposurface will be created at the correct 
scale. Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
7.	 Click the Finish Surface button in the contextual ribbon to complete the toposurface. 
Open the Default 3D view to examine your results. You may have to use the Zoom To Fit 
command to see the extent of the new toposurface.
Modifying the Surface with Subregion
The points file example in the previous exercise represents a section of terrain across Lake 
Mead, Nevada. If you wanted to define an area of the toposurface with a different material 
but not change the geometry of the overall surface, you would use the Subregion tool. In the 
following exercise, you will use this tool to create a region that will represent the water of 
the lake:
	
1.	 Download and open the file c03-Site-Lake.rvt from this book’s website, and then acti-
vate the Site plan from the Project Browser. In this view, there are dashed detail lines that 
represent the edge of the water.
	
2.	 Go to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and click the Subregion tool.
	
3.	 Switch to Pick Lines mode in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon.
	
4.	 Hover your mouse pointer over one of the dashed detail lines on the left side of the sur-
face, Tab-select the chain of lines, and then click to select them. You will see a purple 
sketch line appear.
	
5.	 Repeat step 4 for the dashed detail lines at the right side of the surface.
	
6.	 Switch to Line mode in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon, and draw a line connecting 
each open end of the water edge lines, as shown in Figure 3.32.

Modeling Site Context |  103  
	
7.	 Click Finish Edit Mode in the contextual ribbon to complete the subregion.
	
8.	 Activate the Default 3D view and select the subregion you created in the previous steps.
	
9.	 In the Properties palette, select the Material parameter, and click the ellipsis button to 
open the Material Browser dialog box. Locate and select the material named Site - Water. 
Note that you can easily find this material by typing Water in the search field at the top of 
the dialog box.
	
10.	 Click OK to close the Material Browser dialog box; you will see the results in the 3D view, 
as shown in Figure 3.33.

104  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
When you use the Subregion tool, the geometry of the original surface remains unchanged. If 
you no longer need the subregion, you can select it and delete it. Be aware that topographic sur-
faces cannot display surface patterns assigned to materials.
Using the Split Surface Tool
If you need to divide a topographic surface into separate parts for the purpose of editing the 
geometry, you can use the Split Surface tool. With this tool, you can sketch a single line along 
which the surface will be divided into two editable entities. These separate entities can be 
recombined later using the Merge Surfaces tool. In the following exercise, you will split a topo-
graphic surface and edit some of the points. Remember that you can also use Split Surface to 
delete a portion of a topographic surface. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Open the file c03-Site-Tools.rvt or c03-Site-Tools-Metric.rvt you saved in the 
“Creating a Toposurface by Placing Points” exercise.
	
2.	 Activate the Site plan in the Project Browser.
	
3.	 Go to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and click the Split Surface tool. Remember that 
you should use the Subregion tool if you plan to assign a different material only to the 
split region of the original surface.
	
4.	 Select the topographic surface and you will enter Sketch mode. Using the Line mode in 
the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon, draw two lines that overlap the edges of the 
surface, as shown in Figure 3.34.
	
5.	 Click Finish Edit Mode in the ribbon, and you will see the split surface highlighted in 
blue.
	
6.	 Activate the Default 3D view from the Quick Access Toolbar or from the View tab.
	
7.	 Turn off the Section Box option in the Properties palette.
	
8.	 Select the split surface, and click the Edit Surface tool in the Modify | Topography tab of 
the ribbon.
	
9.	 Select the point at the outer corner of the topographic surface, and change the Elevation 
value in the Options bar from 20′-0″ (6000 mm) to 10′-0″ (3000 mm).

11.	 To illustrate the difference between a split surface and other topographic surface edits, 
select the main surface and click Edit Surface in the contextual ribbon. Select the point at 
the upper corner opposite from the split region and change the Elevation value to 10′-0″ 
(3000 mm). Notice the difference in how the surface slope is interpolated between the 
other points on the surface (Figure 3.36).
	
10.	 Click the green check (Finish Edit Mode) in the contextual ribbon, and you will see the 
result shown in Figure 3.35.
Creating a Building Pad
A building pad in Revit terminology is a unique model element that resembles a floor. It can have 
a thickness and compound structure, it is associated with a level, and it can be sloped using 
slope arrows while you’re sketching its boundary. The building pad is different from a floor 
because it will automatically cut through a toposurface, defining the outline for your building’s 
cellar or basement.
The process of creating a building pad is virtually identical to that of creating a floor. Let’s 
run through a quick exercise to create a building pad in a sample project:
	
1.	 Open the file c03-Site-Pad.rvt, which can be downloaded from this book’s web page.
	
2.	 Activate the floor plan named Site in the Project Browser. You will see an existing topo-
graphic surface and property line. Notice that reference planes were created to demarcate

106  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
If you are working on a project that has a complex site condition that might require several 
building pads at different elevations, you should be aware that the pads cannot overlap; how-
ever, they can share common boundary edges. To help avoid this situation before you get too 
involved in modeling any of the pads in your project, try using detail lines in your site plan to 
lay out the pad design first.
the required zoning setbacks from the property line. Foundation walls have been created 
within these reference planes.
Note that you don’t have to create a property line and walls before creating a building 
pad. You might create a building pad before any other building elements. Just realize that 
you can use the Pick Walls mode to associate the boundary of the building pad with the 
foundation walls.
	
3.	 Activate the Cellar floor plan from the Project Browser.
	
4.	 Go to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, and click the Building Pad button. In the 
Properties palette, change the Height Offset From Level value to 0.
	
5.	 Switch to Pick Walls mode in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon, and then pick the 
inside edges of the four foundation walls. You can use the Tab-select method to place all 
four lines at once.
	
6.	 Click the Finish Edit Mode button in the contextual ribbon to complete the sketch, and 
then double-click the section head in the plan view to examine your results. Notice that 
the top of the building pad is at the Cellar level, and the poché of the topographic surface 
has been removed in the space of the cellar (Figure 3.37).
Adjusting the Section Poché for Topographic Surfaces
If you would like to customize the settings for the fill pattern and depth of poché, click the dialog 
launcher at the bottom of the Model Site panel in the Massing & Site tab of the ribbon. This will 
open the Site Settings dialog box, shown here.

Generating Property Lines
Property lines are used to delineate the boundary of the lot within which your building will be 
constructed. These special types of lines are different from simple model lines or detail lines 
because they can be tagged with standard property line labels that will display segment lengths 
along with bearings. The property line object can also report its area in a special tag.
You can create a property line in one of two ways: by sketching lines or by entering distances 
and bearings in a table. In the following exercise, you will create a simple property line by 
sketching and converting the sketched property line into a table of distances and bearings for 
comparison:
	
1.	 Open c03-Site-Prop-Lines.rvt or c03-Site-Prop-Lines-Metric.rvt, which you 
can download from this book’s companion web page. Activate the Site plan view in the 
Project Browser.
	
2.	 Go to the Massing & Site tab and click the Property Line button. When prompted by the 
Create Property Line dialog box, choose Create By Sketching.
	
3.	 Switch to the Rectangle tool in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon and draw a rect-
angle measuring 120′ × 70′ (36 m × 21 m).
	
4.	 Click the Finish Edit Mode button in the contextual ribbon to complete the sketch.
As you can see in this dialog box, you can change the Section Cut Material and the Elevation Of 
Poche Base settings. Note that the elevation value is in relation to the Project Base Point. You can 
also adjust the display format of contour lines shown on topographic surfaces, as well as the units 
displayed by property lines.

108  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
Tagging Property Lines with Area
In standard construction documentation, it is customary to annotate each vertex of a property 
line with its distance and bearing. There are two different types of tags you can use to annotate 
property lines. In the following exercise, you will load these two types from the Revit default 
library and tag each segment of the property line, as well as display the area contained within it.
	
1.	 Go to the Insert tab of the ribbon and click the Load Family button. Navigate to the Revit 
default library; double-click the Annotations folder and then the Civil folder.
	
2.	 Locate the following files and select them both by pressing the Ctrl key (the equivalent 
metric library families are shown in parentheses):
◆
◆
Property Line Tag.rfa (M_Property Line Tag.rfa)
◆
◆
Property Tag - SF.rfa (M_Property Tag.rfa)
	
5.	 With the property line still selected, click the Edit Table button in the Modify | Property 
Lines tab of the ribbon. You will be prompted with a warning that you cannot return to 
Sketch mode once the property line has been converted to a table of distances and bear-
ings. Click Yes to continue.
You will now see each vertex of the property line expressed as a distance and a bearing, 
as shown in Figure 3.38.
	
6.	 Click OK to close the Property Lines dialog box.
Figure 3.38
A property line can be 
defined in a table of 
distances and bearings.

Modeling Site Context |  109  
Now that you have tagged the individual vertices of the property line, it is time to display the 
area within the property line. This process is not the same as applying an area tag because an 
area object doesn’t exist for the property line. Instead, the annotation family Property Tag - 
SF.rfa (M_Property Tag.rfa) is designed to apply to the property lines when all its segments 
are selected.
You can try this with the property line you created earlier. Go back to the Annotate tab in the 
ribbon and click Tag By Category. Instead of picking a single vertex of the property line, hover 
your mouse pointer over one segment and use Tab-select to highlight the entire chain of prop-
erty line segments. Click to place the property area tag. Click the question mark above the area 
to change the name of the property line, as shown in Figure 3.40.
Cut/Fill Schedules
As we mentioned earlier, Revit site tools are not meant to replace civil engineering software 
programs. We have shown you how to create a topographical surface in a variety of ways as well 
as some methods of modifying these objects. There is also a way to quickly quantify how much 
earth is displaced by proposed changes to existing topography. This is commonly referred to as 
a cut/fill schedule.
	
3.	 Click Open to load both families.
	
4.	 Go to the Annotate tab of the ribbon and click Tag By Category, and then deselect the 
Leader option in the Options bar.
	
5.	 Click each segment of the property line to place the tags indicating the distance and bear-
ing, as shown in Figure 3.39.
Figure 3.39
Tags are applied to 
display the distance 
and bearing of each 
segment of the prop-
erty line.

110  | chapter 3  The Basics of the Toolbox  
One easy way to demonstrate the use of a cut/fill schedule is through the creation of a build-
ing pad that automatically modifies the topographic surface. Let’s go through a quick exercise to 
examine this process:
	
1.	 Open the file c03-Site-Cut-Fill.rvt, which can be downloaded from this book’s web page.
In this file, open a default 3D view, select the toposurface, and you will notice that the 
topographic surface has been assigned to the Existing phase in the Properties palette.
	
2.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules and then select Schedule/Quantities to 
open the New Schedule dialog box.
	
3.	 From the Category list, choose Topography, set Phase to New Construction, and then 
click OK.
	
4.	 In the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box, choose Name, Projected Area, Net 
Cut/Fill, Phase Created, and Phase Demolished, clicking Add after each one. Click OK to 
close the dialog box.
	
5.	 While you are still in the working view of the schedule, go to the Properties palette 
and set the Phase Filter of the schedule to Show Previous + New. This will allow only 
the modified toposurfaces affected by the Graded Region command to appear in the 
schedule. The complete existing topography will not be listed in the schedule.
	
6.	 Activate the Cellar plan from the Project Browser, and create a building pad in the same 
way you created one earlier in this section.
After you complete the creation of the building pad and the topographic surface is 
modified, notice that the Net Cut/Fill values in the topography schedule still have a value 
of 0. This is because the Graded Region tool must be used on a surface to generate the 
differences required to calculate what volume must be cut versus filled in the proposed 
design.

place a property 
area tag for all 
segments.

The Bottom Line
Select, modify, and replace elements.    Many fundamental interactions are supported by 
Revit software to select just what you need and to modify elements efficiently.
Master It    How can you quickly select only the door tags in a plan view and switch 
them to another type?
Edit elements interactively.    The editing tools in Revit are similar to those found in other 
CAD and BIM software programs. Tools such as Move, Copy, and Trim are available on the 
Modify tab of the ribbon.
Master It    How do you create a parametric repetition of an element?
	
7.	 Tile the open Revit windows so you can see both the Default 3D view and the topography 
schedule.
	
8.	 On the Massing & Site tab, click the Graded Region tool, and you will see a dialog box 
appear with two options to continue the command. Choose the option Create A New 
Toposurface Exactly Like The Existing One. This option creates overlapping existing and 
proposed surfaces, which will allow the software to schedule the differences between the 
two as cut or fill volumes.
	
9.	 Select the existing toposurface, and you will see the volume values in the topography 
schedule update to reflect how the excavation for the building pad affected the overall 
soil. Note that this type of calculation does not account for various construction methods, 
such as backfilling.
	
10.	 Click the Finish Surface icon in the contextual tab of the ribbon to complete the Graded 
Region command.
Activate the Section 1 view to see the building pad more clearly. Try selecting the build-
ing pad and changing the Height Offset From Level value in the Properties palette. Observe 
how the Net Cut/Fill values change as the pad defines the scope of excavation for the 
foundation.
You can also make the topography schedule easier to read by assigning descriptive informa-
tion to each topographic surface. Select the surface and enter a value in the Name field in the 
Properties palette. Change the name of the main surface to Existing Grade and then locate the 
surface where the building pad is. Change its name to Pad Area and observe the topography 
schedule once again.
Selecting Toposurfaces with the Filter Command
If you have trouble selecting the toposurfaces, you can select the objects in the drawing window 
with a crossing window and use the Filter command to select each toposurface.

 Confi guring templates 
and Standards 
 In this chapter we discuss how to confi gure and manage standards through the development 
and use of a project template. Such templates can be rich with information that goes beyond the 
out-of-the-box content that Autodesk provides. We will present proven methods for establishing 
template settings and content, as well as explain how the reuse of work will increase productivity 
with each successive project. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Defi ne settings for graphic quality and consistency 
 
◆
 Organize views for maximum effi ciency 
 
◆
 Create custom annotation families 
 
◆
 Start a project with a custom template 
 
◆
 Develop a template management strategy 
 Introducing project templates 
 Like many other applications, the Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture application allows you to start 
with a basic template and then evolve your own custom templates to suit specifi c needs. As your 
knowledge of the software progresses, you will begin to create new and reusable content such 
as wall types, roof types, ceilings, stairs, tags, and other families in order to meet your design 
and documentation needs. This is also the case with regard to the graphical language that you 
or your fi rm has established and needs to implement within Revit. How you graphically pres-
ent elements such as text, dimensions, annotations, keynotes, and hatch patterns defi nes your 
graphic style of design documentation. In reality, the architectural profession tends to develop 
stylized graphics to convey design intent, and Revit respects this by enabling the customization 
of almost all aspects of the project template. 
 You can confi gure project templates by one or more of the following methods: 
 
◆
 Predefi ning all project graphic requirements 
 
◆
 Preloading the model with annotation families and styles 
 
◆
 Defi ning standard system families 

114  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
We will explain these methods in greater detail throughout this chapter. For now, know 
that you can save the completed settings as a new project template (with the filename extension 
.rte) and use these templates whenever you start a new project. You can create templates by 
using a completely blank project, by saving an existing project as a template, or by using one of 
the default templates provided with the Revit installation.
To start from scratch, click the Application menu and choose New ➢ Project. In the New 
Project dialog box, shown in Figure 4.1, choose None for the Template File option, and choose 
Project Template for the Create New option. Once you click OK, you will be asked to choose a 
default unit of measurement—imperial or metric. This dialog box also appears when you press 
Ctrl+N or click New in the Recent Files window.
Figure 4.1
Starting a new project 
template from scratch
Starting a new project template without a base template requires you to develop all common 
content such as levels, grids, sections, callouts, tags, and model elements. Before you start load-
ing all new graphic content, do a review comparing your requirements to the default symbol-
ogy. Determine whether you can use or modify existing families before you begin creating new 
ones to load into your new template. If you have only custom graphics and system families, 
this approach would be appropriate; however, if much of your graphic style is similar to the 
defaults, we suggest you start with one of the default templates and edit it as necessary. This is 
also a much faster approach to get you up and running. You can find these templates by clicking 
Browse in the Template File area of the New Project dialog box. By default, the template files are 
installed in the root folder of the templates directory: C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\RVT 2017\
Templates.
Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality
One of the most common complaints from teams implementing Revit software on their first 
projects is poor graphic quality of printed documents. When you first install the software, 
only some default settings are defined to approximate a standard graphic appearance of archi-
tectural drawings. For example, walls cut in sections are thicker than those shown in projected 
views and callout boundaries are dashed; however, almost all annotation categories are set 
to a line weight of 1. Fortunately, you can easily overcome these problems with some basic 
configuration.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  115  
Discovering Object Styles
The primary means of controlling graphic consistency throughout a project is through object styles. 
To access these settings, select the Manage tab and choose Object Styles from the Settings panel.  
As shown in Figure 4.2, the dialog box is divided into four tabs: Model Objects, Annotation 
Objects, Analytical Model Objects, and Imported Objects. Settings for Line Weight, Line Color, 
Line Pattern, and Material are established for each category.
Figure 4.2
The Object Styles 
dialog box gives you 
graphic control of all 
Revit categories and 
their subcategories.
Model Objects    The Category column on the Model Objects tab lists all available catego-
ries and subcategories of model elements. It is important to note that the subcategories for 
model and annotation objects are created in families, which are loaded into the project 
or template. This will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 14, “Designing with the 
Family Editor.”
The next two columns, under Line Weight, define the line weight used when the elements are 
displayed in projection or cut view. You use a projection view when you are looking at the 
object from a distance; you use a cut view when your view plane is intersecting the element 
as in a section. In some categories, the Cut setting is unavailable; these element categories 
will never be cut in plan or section views, regardless of the location of the view’s cut plane. 
For categories that enable cut display, you can set element geometry in the Family Editor to 
follow that rule or not, as shown in Figure 4.3.

116  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Line Color and Line Pattern allow you to customize the display properties of each category 
and subcategory, but remember that printing a Revit view is WYSIWYG (what you see is 
what you get)—colors will print as colors unless you override them to print as grayscale or 
black in the Print Setup dialog box. The last column, Material, allows you to define a default 
material to be associated with the category or subcategory in case family components in that 
category don’t have materials explicitly defined. If a family has materials set to By Category, 
it references the material defined in the corresponding object style within the project 
environment.
Annotation Objects    The Annotation Objects tab is similar to the Model Objects tab 
except there are no material definitions. There is also only one column for line weight 
(Projection) because lines do not have three-dimensional properties like model objects 
and cannot be “cut.”
Analytical Model Objects    This tab allows you to color the various physical conditions in 
the building that correspond to the building’s structural components. Analytical settings 
only apply to structural and MEP analysis tools within Revit and are beyond the scope of 
this book.
Imported Objects    You can control the graphic appearance of layers (DWG) and levels 
(DGN) within linked or imported CAD files throughout the project on the Imported Objects 
tab of the Object Styles dialog box; however, we will cover this in greater detail in Chapter 7, 
“Interoperability: Working Multiplatform.”
Figure 4.3
Customizing the cut 
display of geometry  
in a family
Assigning Line Weight 1
You may want to avoid assigning line weight 1 to objects because this is the weight used by most 
fill patterns. Reserving its use will help object profiles stand out compared to their patterns.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  117  
Using Line Settings
You can use lines in a variety of ways. Some lines relate to obvious tools, such as detail lines and 
model lines, whereas you can place others with filled regions and by using the Linework tool. 
Lines also relate to the graphic representation of model and annotation elements, as previously 
discussed. Achieving the desired graphic quality requires a review of line weights, patterns, 
and styles.
Setting Line Weights
To open the line weight settings, click the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line 
Weights. The dialog box shown in Figure 4.4 manages the printed line weights relative to a 
numbered assignment from 1 to 16. For model objects, heavier line weights vary between view 
scales. If you require more granular control between scales, click the Add button to insert 
another scale value column and edit the line weights as required. In the Perspective Line 
Weights and Annotation Line Weights tabs there is only one column to specify line weights. 
This is because annotation is always displayed at 1:1 scale and perspective views are not defined 
at any measurable scale.
Figure 4.4
Model line weights 
vary depending on the 
view scale.
We recommend that you first customize the graphic appearance of model and annotation 
elements with object styles before trying to manipulate any of the information in the Line 
Weights dialog box. You should attempt to refine the line weight settings only with a rigor-
ous investigation of printed views in multiple scales, because changes in one area can have an 
impact on several others.

118  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Setting Line Patterns
Line patterns are created from a repetitive series of dashes, spaces, and dots. To edit or cre-
ate line patterns, switch to the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line Patterns. 
The Line Patterns dialog box, shown in Figure 4.5, displays a list of existing line patterns in 
the project.

To edit an existing pattern, select a pattern from the list and then click the Edit button. Click 
New to create your own patterns. You create and edit patterns by specifying dash and space 
lengths, which will form a repeating sequence, as shown in Figure 4.6. For dots, a length value is 
not required.

Frequently, a line pattern is required to include a symbol or text for elements such as fence 
lines, piping, or underground utilities. In Autodesk® AutoCAD® software, shape definitions 
can be used within linetype definitions to achieve the desired results. In Revit, these special 
lines can be created as line-based detail components. Samples of this type of custom line can 
be found by downloading the file c04-Lines.rvt or c04-Lines-Metric.rvt from this book’s 
companion web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.
Creating a New Line Pattern
Follow these steps to create a new simple line pattern:
	
1.	 Switch to the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line Patterns.
	
2.	 In the Line Pattern dialog box, click New.
	
3.	 In the Name field, type MARA Pattern.
	
4.	 Define the sequence, as shown in the following image.
Any dash or dot must be followed by a space, and all dashes and spaces must have a  
defined length.
       
Using Caution When Deleting Line Patterns
Before deleting a line pattern, you must verify that it hasn’t been used anywhere in your project 
because Revit does not have any method for purging unused line patterns. You can do so only by 
manually checking Object Styles, Line Styles, and Visibility/Graphic Overrides. If you fail to do so, 
all line styles using the deleted pattern will be assigned as Solid.

120  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
	
5.	 Confirm by clicking OK.
The resulting line pattern looks like this:
Setting Line Styles
Now that we have discussed the basic components of lines—weight and pattern—the two are 
combined with a color to create line styles for use in detail lines, model lines, filled regions, and 
masking regions. They are also available when the Linework tool is used to override a part of a 
model element. To open the Line Styles dialog box (shown in Figure 4.7), switch to the Manage 
tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line Styles. Note that you may need to expand the list of 
line styles by clicking the plus sign next to Lines.
In the Line Styles dialog box, notice that some of the style names are bracketed—for example, 
<Hidden>. These are internal, “system” types of lines that cannot be renamed or deleted; 
however, their weight, color, and pattern can be modified.
Figure 4.7
Line styles consist 
of weight, color, and 
pattern.
Using Caution When Deleting Line Styles
If you delete a line style used in a project, any elements using the deleted style will be unable to 
reference that style anymore. The lines assigned to the deleted style will be reassigned to a common 
style such as Thin Lines—possibly producing undesirable results.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  121  
Establishing the best styles for your templates will be completely up to you, but we will offer 
some proven examples for inspiration. First, realize that the application already uses common 
line styles such as Thin Lines, Medium Lines, and Wide Lines. If you are creating a complete 
array of customized line styles for your colleagues to use, rename the out-of-the-box styles to fit 
into your graphic standard.
One common approach is to create line styles organized by their weight number along 
with any variable to their appearance, such as (3) Gray Dashed or +Line 01. The parentheses 
(or the use of any special characters at the beginning of the line’s name) keep your custom 
line styles sorted to the top of the list in the Line Styles dialog box as well as in the Type 
Selector when you’re using a line-based tool. This approach has proven to be effective 
and efficient when creating details in drafting views or generating fill or masking  
regions.
Another approach reserves certain line styles for special circumstances where lines rep-
resent aspects of a building in a plan, elevation, or section and must be assigned to a specific 
layer when views are exported in CAD format. For example, the crossing lines typically used 
to indicate an area-in plan that is “Open to Below” may need to be assigned to the CAD layer 
A-FLOR-BELW. This is difficult if you used a line style based solely on weight and pattern 
such as (2) Dashed. You cannot separately assign that line style to A-FLOR-BELW for the floor 
plan export and A-DETL-THIN for all other exports. Here are some examples of line styles you 
could create:
◆
◆
Open to Below
◆
◆
ADA Circles
◆
◆
Curbs
◆
◆
Fire Rating
In summary, take care to understand the different settings when you are beginning to 
customize graphic settings for lines in the Revit template. To change the displayed weight 
of an element in a project, you should make changes not in Line Weights but rather through 
the Object Styles dialog box. For example, if you want to increase the cut line weight of a 
wall already set to (5), do not increase the value of (5) in the Line Weights dialog box. You 
would change this value by selecting (6) or (7) as the cut weight of a wall in the Object Styles 
dialog box.
Defining Materials
Defining materials in your project template is another important task that can help maintain 
graphic consistency in many other areas. Materials drive the graphic representation of elements, 
not just in a rendered view but also in hidden line views that are 2D or 3D. They are also respon-
sible for cleanups between model elements because materials can merge with one another when 
elements of the same material are joined. In Figure 4.8, the surface patterns and colors are all 
derived from the material assigned to each element.

122  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Figure 4.8

the surface and cut 
patterns, color, and

Materials in Revit are organized into groups of properties called assets, consisting of the 
following: Identity, Graphics, Appearance, Physical, and Thermal. Let us explore these by open-
ing the Material Browser. Switch to the Manage tab and choose Materials on the Settings panel 
to open the Material Browser (Figure 4.9). The left side of the dialog box shows the materials that 
exist in the active project, including a search bar to help you quickly find materials for editing. 
Click the icon just below the search bar to show or hide the Library Panel. On the right, the 
selected material’s assets are displayed as tabs.
Figure 4.9

properties using the 
Material Browser.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  123  
Material Properties
Select any material in the Project Materials list and we’ll step through each of the asset 
tabs.
Identity    Defines schedule values and keynotes for materials. Specifying correct identity 
data for your standard or typical materials will increase efficiency when you’re using annota-
tion such as material tags as well as facilitate quality management by aligning model data 
such as manufacturer, model, and mark with your project specifications. In Figure 4.10, we’ve 
entered some sample identity data. The use of material identity data in project annotation is 
also discussed in Chapter 18, “Annotating Your Design.”
Figure 4.10
Use identity data to 
classify, find, tag, and 
schedule materials.
Graphics    Defines shading color, surface patterns, and cut patterns. These properties will 
determine how a model element displays in non-rendered views (Hidden Line, Shaded, or 
Consistent Colors):
Shading    Defines the color and transparency of a material. Note that the color can be 
dependent on the material’s render appearance. If the Use Render Appearance option is 
selected, the color and transparency are adopted from the Appearance asset settings and 
the shading controls will be disabled.
Surface Pattern    Allows the selection of a model pattern to be displayed on the faces 
of elements in elevation, plan, and 3D views. Note that a material’s surface pattern 
does not appear in rendered views; a pattern can be defined in the Appearance asset 
tab.
Cut Pattern    Allows the selection of a drafting pattern to be displayed when an element is 
cut in a model view. Some elements can’t be cut, as discussed previously in this chapter; 
in these cases, this setting has no effect on the graphic display and the pattern will not 
display.

124  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Appearance    Defines rendering attributes for use in Realistic and Ray Trace display modes 
as well as renderings. These properties will become visible only when you render a view 
and will not affect other graphic display styles, unless the Use Render Appearance option is 
selected in the Graphics asset under Shading.
Identity, Graphics, and Appearance are the three assets that are required for every material 
in Revit. You can add Physical and Thermal assets for analysis, if necessary.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  125  
Physical    Defines physical properties of a material for analysis.
Thermal    Defines thermal properties of a material for analysis.

126  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Adding and Replacing Material Assets
You can also replace an asset for Appearance, Physical, or Thermal properties with one from any 
asset library. Let’s review the process to add a new asset to a material. To complete the following 
exercises, download and open c04-Materials.rvt from this book’s web page.
	
1.	 Select the material Concrete - Cast-In-Place Concrete from the Project Materials list.
	
2.	 Click the plus button in the tabbed list of assets and then select Physical.
	
3.	 The Asset Browser dialog box will open (Figure 4.11). In the asset selection tree at the left, 
expand the Autodesk Physical Assets tree and navigate to Concrete and then Standard. 
Find the asset named Concrete 3.5 ksi, and with the mouse pointer hovered over the 
asset, click the arrow located at the right end of the asset listing.
	
4.	 Click the X to close the Asset Browser and return to the Material Browser.
You will see a new Physical Asset tab next to the Appearance tab.
Figure 4.11
Use the Asset Browser 
to access material 
assets in the document 
or a material library.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  127  
You cannot change any of the asset properties in the Autodesk Physical Assets library; 
however, after an asset has been assigned to a project (document), you can change the values. 
Let’s experiment with this process in a quick exercise. Remember that altering any physical or 
thermal assets may produce undesirable results in analysis or simulation.
	
1.	 Continuing from the previous exercise, make sure the Material Browser is open and the 
Concrete - Cast-In-Place Concrete material is selected. Select the Physical Asset tab.
	
2.	 Click the Duplicate This Asset icon at the top of the tab.
It should change the name of the asset to Concrete 3.5 ksi(1). To change the name of an 
asset, expand the Information drop-down menu and click in the Name field. Change the 
name to Concrete 3.5 ksi (Custom).
	
3.	 Change the Source field to your name and then expand the Concrete drop-down menu. 
Change the Shear Strength Modification to 1.75.
	
4.	 Return to the Project Materials list and select Cast-In-Place.
We will now add the customized physical asset to this project material.
	
5.	 Click the plus button in the tabbed list of assets and select Physical.
	
6.	 In the Asset Browser, scroll to the top of the list of assets and select Document 
Assets. From this list, you will find Concrete 3.5 ksi (Custom). Hover the mouse 
pointer over this asset and click the arrow at the end of the row to add it to the 
selected material.
Another way you can quickly change assets is by using the Replace Asset command. Instead 
of manually changing each asset property, simply select a material in the Material Browser 
and in one of the asset tabs, click the Replace Asset icon. Let us explore this functionality with 
another quick exercise:
	
1.	 With the Material Browser still open, select the material named Concrete - Precast 
Concrete and then select the Appearance tab.
	
2.	 Click the Replace This Asset icon in the Appearance tab.
	
3.	 In the Asset Browser, navigate to the Appearance Library folder and then click on Concrete.
Notice that the list of assets is automatically filtered to show only those assets with the 
Aspect field specified as Appearance.

128  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
	
4.	 Select the Smooth Precast Structural asset and double-click it, or click the replace arrow 
at the end of the row, as shown in Figure 4.12.
	
5.	 Click the X to close the Asset Browser, and then click OK to close the Material Browser.
Figure 4.12
The Asset Browser can 
also be used to replace 
an asset assigned to a 
material.
Planning Material Strategies
It may seem impossible to imagine all the materials you will need in a project, which may make the 
process of building a template seem daunting. Think of the basic materials you’re likely to use—
wood, brick, concrete, glass, and so on—and build from those. Remember, a template is just a starting 
point, and you can always expand it. If you create a number of high-quality materials over the course 
of a project, use the Transfer Project Standards function to copy those materials back into your tem-
plates. You can also create custom material libraries for your own reuse or for larger project teams.
Your organization’s existing graphic standards taxonomy is likely the starting place when 
you are looking to manage materials. If there is not an existing system, you can create one based 
on the workflows of your teams. When you start to organize materials by name, there are many 
prevailing theories too numerous to list here, but here are a few suggestions:
◆
◆
By Type: Each material is prefixed with a descriptor such as Metal, Paint, Carpet, Wood, and so on.
◆
◆
By Use: Each material is prefixed with a description of its application, such as Cladding, 
Interior, Exterior, Site, and so on.
◆
◆
Alphabetical: Materials have no prefixes.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  129  
◆
◆
By CSI Division: Each material is prefixed with a MasterFormat numerical descriptor 
corresponding to its specification section.
◆
◆
By Mark: Each material is prefixed with the designation of its Mark annotation parameter 
(for example, WD01-Wood-Cherry).
Whatever naming convention you choose for materials, the Material Browser can help you orga-
nize and manage them efficiently. First, note that you can change the display of the material list, 
including sorting options, by clicking the icon at the upper right, as shown in Figure 4.13. You can 
also filter the list of materials according to the Class property by clicking the arrow at the upper right.
Figure 4.13
Accessing different 
sorting options in the 
Material Browser
You can also use the Search bar to quickly find matching text in any material property field. 
For example, try typing sample in the Search bar and the list will reflect those materials that 
include that term in the Keywords property.
Creating a Simple Exterior Glazing Material
In the early phases of design, you may want to keep the level of detail to a minimum. In fact, guidelines for mod-
eling levels of development may be established as part of a BIM execution plan. (See AIA G202-2013 Project 
Building Information Modeling Protocol Form at www.aia.org/contractdocs or the BIM execution plan-
ning guide from Penn State at bim.psu.edu. You can also reference a Model Progression Specification at www
.vicosoftware.com/model-progression-specification.) To simplify the creation of exterior 
enclosures such as a curtain wall, try creating a glass material with a surface pattern approximating the 
layout dimensions of a curtain wall system (such as 5′ × 12′ or 1.5 m × 3.5 m). Then create a generic wall type 
using this material, and you will have a much lighter wall type to explore design options with great ease.

130  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Figure 4.14
Fill patterns 
are defined 
separately for 
drafting and 
model repre-
sentations.
Defining Fill Patterns
Materials are often represented with simple hatch patterns. For any material used, you can 
define a surface pattern and a cut pattern. For simple parallel hatches and crosshatches, you can 
use the patterns already supplied or you can make your own patterns.
For more complex patterns, you need to import an external pattern file (with the filename 
extension .pat). Such pattern definitions can be imported from pattern files used by 
AutoCAD—a process we explain later in this chapter. To create, modify, or view an avail-
able fill pattern, switch to the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Fill Patterns (see 
Figure 4.14). On the left side of the Fill Patterns dialog box, you can view the names and small 
graphic previews of the patterns. Below those are the Pattern Type options, where you choose 
what type of pattern to create and specify what type of pattern you want to edit (Model or 
Drafting).
Model patterns are used to convey real-world dimensional patterns to represent a material, 
whereas drafting patterns are intended for symbolic representations. For example, a model pat-
tern is used to show a brick pattern in 3D and elevation views, whereas a brick drafting pattern 
is used to represent the material in plan and section. Figure 4.15 shows how concrete masonry 
units (CMUs) are represented with a running bond pattern (model) as well as a crosshatch 
(drafting). To display cut patterns in a 3D view, you must enable and adjust a section box to 
intersect a model element.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  131  
Figure 4.15
The CMU wall has both 
a drafting pattern (cut) 
and a model pattern 
(surface) defined.
Surface
Pattern
Cut Pattern
Model patterns have specific behaviors that are not dependent on any view. The scale you estab-
lish in a model pattern will always be that size, regardless of the view scale. In the example shown 
in Figure 4.15, the surface of the CMU wall displays a block pattern that measures 16” × 8” (400 mm 
× 200 mm). If you were to change the view scale, the pattern would appear larger or smaller but it 
would always measure the same. With a drafting pattern, the opposite is true: The pattern adjusts 
with the view scale, so the pattern looks identical in all scales.
Fill patterns are also created as one of two types: simple or custom. Figure 4.16 illustrates 
some examples of each option.
Figure 4.16
From left to right: a 
simple fill pattern, a 
simple fill pattern with 
the Crosshatch option 
selected, and a custom 
fill pattern

132  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Simple    These patterns are generated with parallel or crosshatch lines that can have different 
angles and spacing. With both the Crosshatch and Parallel Lines options, you can specify only 
one angle for the entire pattern. Using crosshatch, you can set two spacing values.
Custom    To create a more complex custom pattern, you have to import a pattern (PAT) file 
from an external source. This is often necessary because of the current limitation in creating 
natively complex patterns. Your office may have a set of established patterns that have been 
used for years, and the Custom option allows you to import and reuse them without having 
to make them again from scratch. Custom patterns let you import a PAT file from anywhere 
on your hard drive or on a network and use it as a base pattern for a new fill pattern.
Creating a New Simple Pattern
To create a new simple pattern, first choose either Model or Drafting, and then click the New 
button. A generic pattern appears in the New Pattern dialog box. You can then design your 
pattern and assign orientation behavior.
The option Orientation In Host Layers is particularly useful when you’re making drafting 
patterns. This option allows you to specify how a pattern orients itself relative to host elements 
such as walls, floors, roofs, and ceilings when they are represented as cut. Note that the option is 
not available for model pattern types. As shown in Figure 4.17, the orientation options are Orient 
To View, Keep Readable, and Align With Element.
Figure 4.17
From left to right: 
Orient To View, Keep 
Readable, and Align 
With Element
Orient To View    When this orientation is applied, the patterns used in the project all have the 
same orientation and the same origin. They’re always perfectly aligned with the origin of the view.
Keep Readable    This orientation will maintain alignment with the view (that is, horizontal 
lines will remain horizontal) but will be adjusted relative to angled host elements.
Align With Element    This orientation ensures that the pattern orientation depends on the 
orientation of the host element. Patterns essentially run parallel with the element.
Creating a Custom Complex Pattern
Custom patterns require an external file that contains the definition of the pattern. The filename 
extension of that pattern should be .pat, which is what you’ll make in this exercise by editing 
an existing AutoCAD PAT file. An advantage of specifying patterns in the template file is that 
the PAT file won’t need to be installed on each computer where the application is installed; pat-
terns are stored internally in the Revit template or project file.
Before modifying PAT files, always make a copy of the original PAT file you intend to use as a 
base; you don’t want to risk messing up other files that might already be using that original PAT 
file. PAT files can be edited with Notepad or any other text-editing application. For this exercise, 

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  133  
you’ll choose the AutoCAD pattern called Grass, which you can find in acadiso.pat (in metric 
units) or acad.pat (imperial units) located on this book’s web page.
Importing a Custom Pattern
Follow these steps to make a custom fill pattern by importing an existing pattern definition:
	
1.	 Using Notepad or a similar text editor application, open the file acadiso.pat (Metric 
patterns) or acad.pat (Imperial patterns).
	
2.	 Highlight the lines that define the pattern, and select them:
*GRASS,Grass area
90, 0, 0, 17.9605, 17.9605, 4.7625, -31.1585
45, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
135, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
The actual numbers in the pattern may differ slightly, depending on whether you are 
using acadiso.pat or acad.pat.
	
3.	 Choose Edit ➢ Copy.
	
4.	 Open a new text file and paste the selection. (You can also open the Revit metric.pat or 
revit.pat file located in C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2017\Data, in which all 
Revit patterns are already saved. In that case, you can paste the selected text in that file.)
	
5.	 This is the important part: In the new text file where you pasted the selected text, add the 
two lines shown boldfaced here:
;%UNITS=MM
*GRASS,Grass area
;%TYPE=DRAFTING
90, 0, 0, 17.9605, 17.9605, 4.7625, -31.1585
45, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
135, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
The first line that you write before the pattern text, ;%UNITS=MM, can appear only 
once in the text file. It defines the value for the units used in the pattern. In the example, 
the units are millimeters (MM); if you wanted to work in imperial units, it would be 
;%UNITS=INCH. (If you use the option in step 4 to collect all patterns in the master PAT 
file, then this line already exists and you don’t need to add it.)
The second statement, ;%TYPE=DRAFTING, helps define whether you’re creating a draft-
ing or model pattern. In this example, the pattern is the Drafting type.
	
6.	 Save your text file with a .pat filename extension.
	
7.	 On the Manage tab, choose Additional Settings ➢ Fill Patterns.
	
8.	 In the Fill Patterns dialog box, verify that the Drafting option is selected, and click New.
	
9.	 In the New Pattern dialog box, select the Custom option.
The lower part of the dialog box offers new options.
	
10.	 Click Import, navigate to the place on your hard drive or network where you saved the 
PAT file, select it, and then click Open.

134  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Importing PAT Files
It’s important to know that when you import a new pattern, the type of pattern needs to be the 
same as the new type of pattern you’re making. In other words, if you’re making a new model pat-
tern, you can’t import a drafting pattern. If you try to do so, you’ll see a warning message like the 
one shown here:
In the list that appears to the right of this button, you can see the name of the pattern you 
created: GRASS, as shown in Figure 4.18. (If you have a PAT file with many patterns defined, 
you’ll see all the other drafting patterns available in that list.) The name of the pattern auto-
matically becomes the name of your fill pattern, but you can change that if you like.
If necessary, you can adjust the scales of the imported pattern. The Preview window dis-
plays the graphic of the pattern, always in 1:1 scale. This informs you if you need to scale 
the pattern up or down. You’ll know that you need to scale the pattern if the preview 
appears as a solid black box—that means the pattern is too dense. As an alternative, if the 
preview box shows only white, your scale might need to be reduced.
	
11.	 If you’re happy with the result, confirm by clicking OK.
Now that you have created a fill pattern, you can use the pattern in a number of ways. One 
of the simplest ways is to assign the pattern directly to a material. We purposely instructed you 
Figure 4.18
The New Pattern 
dialog box displays the 
imported PAT file in 
the Custom group.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  135  
to create a grass pattern in the previous exercise to illustrate a limitation in Revit—you cannot 
assign a surface pattern to a material that is associated with a toposurface.
In the following exercise, you will assign the grass pattern to a material in the sample project 
that has already been assigned to a toposurface. We will then show you how to create a new 
filled region type in order to create a symbolic representation of grass in the site plan.
	
1.	 Continuing with the c04-Materials.rvt file, switch to the Manage tab and click Materials.
	
2.	 In the Material Browser, find the material named Site - Grass and choose the Graphics 
tab. Under the Surface Pattern properties, click the Pattern field and then choose the 
GRASS pattern you created in the previous exercise. Click OK.
The pattern will be assigned to the material, but you will be prompted with a warning 
that toposurfaces do not support surface patterns. Next, we will create a filled region type 
and use it as a graphic indicator on a site plan.
	
3.	 In the Project Browser, activate the floor plan named Site. Switch to the Annotate tab and 
in the Detail panel select Region ➢ Filled Region.
	
4.	 In the Properties palette, click Edit Type and duplicate the current filled region type to a 
new type named Grass. Set the Fill Pattern property to GRASS (Figure 4.19).
	
5.	 Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box, and draw a shape on the Site plan using 
any configuration of lines, making sure your lines form a closed loop.

136  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Remember to click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to complete the sketch 
of the filled region. You can even experiment with the <Invisible Lines> type to achieve 
results similar to those shown here.
Preconfiguring Color Schemes
The use of color schemes in project documentation will be covered in greater detail in Chapter 20,  
“Presenting Your Design”; however, for now, just know that you can preconfigure them in 
­project templates for a variety of scenarios. For example, an architect may perform many 
projects for a single client that uses the same department names in all of its program design 
requirements. The architect would like to ensure that an identical color scheme is used in the 
colored plans in all projects for this client.
In the following steps, you will create a new color fill legend with some predefined 
department values and associated colors. These settings can be saved in either a custom project 
template (*.rte) or a project file (*.rvt) that acts as a container for settings to be transferred 
into another active project file. Download and open the file c04-Color-Schemes.rvt from this 
book’s web page and follow these steps:
	
1.	 Activate any floor plan view from the Project Browser. On the Annotate tab, choose the 
Color Fill panel and select the Color Fill Legend tool.
	
2.	 Place a legend in the floor plan view, and you will see the Choose Space Type And Color 
Scheme dialog box. Set Space Type to Rooms and Color Scheme to Department (these 
choices can be modified later) and then click OK.
	
3.	 Select the color fill legend you placed in the previous step, and click the Edit Scheme icon 
at the right end of the ribbon. The Edit Color Scheme dialog box will appear.
	
4.	 Click the Add Value icon (the plus symbol) to populate the list of departments in the 
Scheme Definition area. Add the values as shown in Figure 4.20. Choose colors and fill 
patterns according to your graphic requirements.

Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality |  137  
	
5.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
6.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan and, from the Architecture tab, choose the Room button 
and add rooms to the enclosed spaces shown in the plan view. For clarity, we have turned 
on the Interior Fill and Reference properties for rooms in this plan view. This will make it 
easier for you to select the rooms in the next step.
You will not want to let these rooms remain if you save the file as a project template, but it will 
help to better visualize the color schemes if you can see them placed in a sample model view.
When rooms are placed, you can either type the values for departments that match the 
predefined values in the color scheme or select the values in the Properties palette when 
each room is selected, as shown in Figure 4.21.

7.	 Select each room that you placed in the plan view, and select a Department value in the 
Properties palette according to the layout shown in Figure 4.22. The department values 
used in every project started with your project template will have the same colors and  
fill patterns according to those specified in the original color scheme. You also have a 
predefined list of your client’s department names.
Figure 4.22
Color-filled plans can 
use predefined values 
in templates.
At this point, you have two options for storing these types of settings. We will discuss 
strategies for managing templates later in this chapter, but for now you can either save this 
file as a project template or maintain it as a container file, which is simply a RVT file that holds 
settings you will transfer into other project files. For a container file, simply leave the file as is, 
and we will discuss the use of the Transfer Project Standards command later in this chapter. If 
you want to use this file as a project template, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the plan view, select all the walls, rooms, and room tags, and then delete them.
	
2.	 Activate the Room Schedule view under Schedules/Quantities in the Project Browser.
	
3.	 Click in the first row of the schedule and then click the Delete button in the ribbon. 
Repeat this step until all rooms have been removed from the schedule.
	
4.	 Go to the Application menu and then select Save As ➢ Template. Name the file 
c04-Color-Scheme-Template.rte.
You don’t have to delete all the modeled content and rooms from your project templates; 
however, it’s likely that you will have a unique layout for each project you design. By deleting 
the sample walls and rooms, you maintained the color scheme settings with the predefined col-
ors, patterns, and department names.
Increasing Efficient View Management
Once you have customized the settings for graphic quality, you can use several other tools and 
techniques to increase efficiency and ensure that your visual standards are applied consistently 
throughout your projects. The properties of all views can be used to your advantage in creating 
a browser organization that meets the needs of your teams. You can apply filters to views for 
generating graphic overrides based on model element parameters. You can manage and deploy 
these settings and more in view templates that can be applied to many views simultaneously.
Organizing Views
Maintaining a clear and consistent organization of views within a Revit project can generate 
measurable increases in project productivity. Especially in larger projects, a Revit file can have 
more than 1000 views, which can easily cause confusion and wasted time if the right view 
cannot be found in the Project Browser when needed.

Increasing Efficient View Management |  139  
Download and open the file c04-Browser-Org.rvt from this book’s web page. Most default 
project templates contain a few simple Browser Organization types that can be copied and/or 
customized—except for the type named All. To access these settings, switch to the View rib-
bon, find the Windows panel, click the User Interface drop-down button, and select Browser 
Organization, as shown in Figure 4.23.
Select any one of the listed types in the Browser Organization dialog box and click the Edit 
button. Remember, you can’t edit or delete the type named All.
In the Browser Organization Properties dialog box (Figure 4.24) are a Grouping And Sorting 
tab and a Filtering tab. Grouping And Sorting allows you to group views together based on 
selected view parameters, whereas the Filtering tab gives you the opportunity to display only 
views that pass selected criteria.

Choose the Grouping And Sorting tab to specify three levels of hierarchy to be shown in the 
Project Browser. Here are some examples:
◆
◆
Family And Type, Discipline, View Scale
◆
◆
Phase, Discipline, Family And Type
◆
◆
Detail Level, Family, Type
To further organize the views in your project, you can create additional project parameters 
and assign them to views and sheets. The following is one example of adding custom text 
parameters to views for more refined organization:
	
1.	 On the Manage tab, find the Settings panel, and click Project Parameters.
	
2.	 In the Project Parameters dialog box, click Add.
	
3.	 In the Parameter Properties dialog box, create a parameter named Zone; for Type Of 
Parameter, specify Text. Select the Instance option; then find and check the Views category, as 
shown in Figure 4.25. You may also set the Group Parameter Under value to Identity Data.
	
4.	 Click OK to close both of the open dialog boxes.
	
5.	 Return to the Browser Organization dialog box and click New. Name the new type Zone/
Phase and click OK.
	
6.	 Set the following values on the Grouping And Sorting tab in the Browser Organization 
Properties dialog box:
◆
◆
Group By: Zone
◆
◆
Then By: Phase

7.	 Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the Browser Organization dialog box.
	
8.	 Check the box next to Zone/Phase to make this browser setting current and click OK to 
close the dialog box.
The Project Browser is now ready to support the use of the custom view parameters you cre-
ated earlier.
It is now up to you to assign values to the custom view parameters created in the previous 
exercise. These values can be assigned directly to the view properties in the Properties palette 
or by adding them to view templates. Views that do not have values for these parameters will be 
found in the browser hierarchy listed as ??? (three question marks). Figure 4.26 illustrates this 
scenario in which floor plans and ceiling plans have values assigned to the Zone parameters but 
the elevation views do not.

Creating and Assigning Filters
Filters are another view configuration and customization tool that can be developed and 
deployed in Revit project templates. They are similar to the filters available in schedules in that 
they can either display or hide elements matching user-specified criteria. However, filters can 
also override the graphic appearance of elements within a view. The possible combination and 
application of view filters is virtually limitless, so let us take a look at a few real-world examples.
First, we will review the steps to create and assign a view filter. The fundamental steps are as follows:
	
1.	 Create a named filter.
	
2.	 Assign it to object categories.
	
3.	 Assign data criteria.

142  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
	
4.	 Add to the Visibility/Graphic settings of a view.
	
5.	 Define graphic overrides.
In the following example, you will create view rule-based filters to identify fire-rated walls 
with different colors. You can download the sample file c04-Sample-Building.rvt from this 
book’s web page. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Open the file c04-Sample-Building.rvt. Switch to the View tab, find the Graphics 
panel, and click Filters.
	
2.	 Add a new named filter by clicking the New button on the right side of the dialog box. 
Name the first new filter Walls-Fire 1, use the Define Rules option, and then click OK.
	
3.	 When the expanded Filters dialog box appears, make sure the Walls-Fire 1 filter is 
selected, and in the Categories list, find Walls and check the category.
	
4.	 In the Filter Rules at the right side, define the criterion to filter by Fire Rating Equals 1 HR 
and then click Apply.
	
5.	 With the Walls-Fire 1 filter still selected, click the Duplicate icon twice (the second 
icon below the Filters list) and then rename the duplicated filters Walls-Fire 2 and Walls-Fire 3.
	
6.	 Select Walls-Fire 2 and change the value in Filter Rules to 2 HR and click Apply.
	
7.	 Select Walls-Fire 3 and change the value in Filter Rules to 3 HR, as shown in Figure 4.27, 
and then click Apply again.
	
8.	 Click OK to close both of the Filters dialog boxes.
	
9.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan, open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, and 
select the Filters tab.
	
10.	 Click the Add button, select all three filters you created in the previous steps, and click OK.
Figure 4.27
Filter rules  
applied to walls  
for fire ratings
	
11.	 Click the Override button in each filter row under Cut-Lines and change the line color 
as follows:

Increasing Efficient View Management |  143  
◆
◆
Walls-Fire 1 = Green
◆
◆
Walls-Fire 2 = Yellow
◆
◆
Walls-Fire 3 = Red
	
12.	 Click OK to close the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box.
With the filters now applied to the floor plan, walls that have been assigned a fire rating 
value will appear with the color overrides you assigned to the respective filters. You can cre-
ate more filters to define graphic styles for specific model elements such as furniture by owner, 
interior walls, secure doors, or equipment not in contract.
You can also create filters based on selection. This allows you to define the objects to be 
filtered without a ruleset. This is a useful option when there is no clear rule that will allow the 
visibility you need. The selection can happen before or after the filter creation, allowing you to 
add or subtract as needed. To create a selection filter, follow these steps with same file used for 
rule-based filters:
	
1.	 Activate the view Level 1 Design. In the Manage tab, locate the Selection panel.
	
2.	 Select Edit. The Edit Filters dialog will appear with a list of rule-based filters and 
selection filters.
	
3.	 Select New.
	
4.	 When the Filter Name dialog appears, provide the name MARA Test and choose Select. 
The dialog will close with the ribbon providing the Edit Selection tools. By default, the 
Add To Selection tool is active.
	
5.	 Select several objects in the plan view to add to the set. To remove objects from the set, 
select Remove From Selection. You will notice the mouse trades its plus symbol for a 
minus symbol. You will also see that previously unselected objects are now suppressed, 
allowing you easy access to change your selection set.

144  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Using View Templates
After you have defined your desired settings in as many view types as possible, you can use 
view templates to manage these settings and apply them to other views of the same type. The 
use of view templates will be discussed in various chapters of this book, but we will discuss their 
importance to the project template in this section. Let’s begin by opening the View Templates tool:
	
1.	 On the View tab, find the Graphics panel and select View Templates ➢ Manage View Templates.
In the View Templates dialog box (Figure 4.29), you will find icons to duplicate, rename, 
or delete view templates below the list on the left. On the right are the view properties 
that can be applied when the view template is applied to a view.
Figure 4.28
Filter based on 
selection, rather  
than rules
Figure 4.29
View Templates  
dialog box
	
6.	 Once you are satisfied, choose Finish Selection. As shown in Figure 4.28, you now have a 
filter based on selection, rather than a rule.

Increasing Efficient View Management |  145  
Notice the column named Include on the right of this dialog box. This column allows you 
to include or exclude various view properties when you are applying the view template. If 
you uncheck View Scale and Detail Level settings, you can apply this template to plans of 
multiple scales and detail levels, while applying settings such as visibility of Object Styles, 
Phase Filter, and View Range without affecting the View Scale or Detail Level settings.
Also notice in Figure 4.29 the custom view parameter we created earlier: Zone. This value 
can be applied with the view template, which will have the effect of cataloging the views 
in a customized hierarchy within the Project Browser. Changes to view templates are 
automatically reflected in the views to which they have been assigned.
	
2.	 Click OK to close the window.
The only way to assign a view template to a view is in the Properties palette. Select any view 
in the Project Browser and then examine the Properties palette to locate the View Template 
parameter. If the View Template parameter button displays as <None>, then no view template 
has been assigned. Click the button to launch the Apply View Template dialog box, and choose 
an appropriate view template. In contrast to this assigning workflow, view template properties 
can be applied to individual views. Applying a view template is a onetime application. Future 
changes to the view template will not change a view where a template was applied. You can 
apply a template in various ways, including the following:
◆
◆
Select multiple views in the Project Browser, right-click, and then select Apply View 
Template from the context menu.
◆
◆
From the View tab, click View Templates ➢ Apply Template Properties To Current View.
◆
◆
Select multiple sheets in the Project Browser, right-click, and then select Apply View 
Template To All Views from the context menu.
Any of these methods will apply the properties of a view template, but it will not assign the 
view template to the view. If you use these methods and a view happens to have a view tem-
plate already assigned, a message will prompt you to partially apply the properties that are not 
being managed by the view template assigned to the view.
Any properties listed in the View Templates dialog box, shown previously in Figure 4.29, 
that are selected in the Include field will not be changed if you choose to partially apply view 
template properties to a view with an assigned template. For example, if model object styles 
are included in the assigned view template and you are attempting to apply template proper-
ties that also have model object style modifications, the model object settings from the assigned 
view template will not be overridden from the applied properties.

146  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Figure 4.30
Specify a view tem-
plate for new views 
within a view type.
Despite these relatively intuitive methods for applying view templates, you can increase 
efficiency on larger projects by assigning a default view template for each view type. In the fol-
lowing exercise, continue to use this chapter’s exercise file c04-Sample-Building.rvt from the 
filters exercise, and follow these steps:
	
1.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan in the Project Browser, right-click on the Level 1 floor plan, 
and choose Duplicate View ➢ Duplicate from the context menu. Rename the duplicate 
view as Level 1 Design.
	
2.	 With the properties of the Level 1 Design floor plan active in the Properties palette, click 
Edit Type. In the Type Properties dialog box, click Duplicate to create a new type named 
Design Plans.
	
3.	 Click the button in the View Template Applied To New Views field and select the Design 
Plan view template (Figure 4.30). Click OK.
	
4.	 Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
You should notice that the Level 1 Design floor plan in the Project Browser is now listed under 
Floor Plans (Design Plans); however, the view template has not been applied to this view yet.
	
5.	 In the Properties palette, click the View Template field button, select the Design Plan 
template, and then click OK.
The floor plan view should appear changed, no longer displaying any annotation.
	
6.	 From the View tab, click Plan Views ➢ Floor Plan. In the New Floor Plan dialog box, select 
Design Plans in the Type drop-down list and then select Level 2 from the list.
	
7.	 Click OK, and a new floor plan for Level 2 will be created that has the Design Plan view 
template already assigned. Rename this view as Level 2 Design.

Creating Custom Annotations |  147  
The workflow described in the previous exercise will help you spend less time configuring 
view settings and more time focused on your designs. Including view templates in your project 
template will give your teams the ability to quickly apply your standard view settings. It will 
also support continued consistency as each building project grows in scope and size. Remember 
that view templates are easily shared between projects using the Transfer Project Standards tool, 
which we will discuss later in this chapter in the section “Strategies for Managing Templates.”
Creating Custom Annotations
We are avid supporters of global graphic standards for architecture and engineering, such as the 
United States National CAD Standard (www.nationalcadstandard.org), but in reality many 
architects and designers will likely have their own set of graphic conventions that will need to 
be implemented in their Revit projects. Placing customized annotation families in your project 
template will save time when you are starting new projects and ensure maximum compliance 
with your firm’s conventions. You can load tag families into the template using several methods:
◆
◆
Switch to the Insert tab, and in the Load Library panel, select Load Family.
◆
◆
Using Windows Explorer, select RFA tag families and drag them into the Revit project 
environment with the template open. If you try to drag more than one family at once, you 
are prompted to either open each of those files in an independent window (so you can 
modify them) or load them all in the current project. Choose the second option.
◆
◆
Use the Loaded Tags And Symbols tool available in the Annotate tab when you expand the 
Tag panel (Figure 4.31). This tool allows you to preview all loaded and preset tags and sym-
bols that will be used for respective element categories.
Figure 4.31
The Loaded Tags dialog 
box shows loaded 
annotation families 
assigned to selected 
categories.

148  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Figure 4.32

In the following sections, we will walk you through creating some common element tags and 
customizing system annotation.
Archiving and Managing Custom Content
Many new users are unsure where to store custom-created families. It is not advisable to save them 
in the system folders created during the installation of Revit because you may lose track of them or 
inadvertently delete them when you reinstall the software. Reinstalling the application erases just 
about any folder and its entire contents. It is thus wise to keep your personally created content else-
where, under a separate, independent folder; if you are not a single user, store that folder on a shared 
network drive. Remember that you can always include additional library shortcuts in the application 
options. Just select File Locations and click the Places button from the Options menu.
You should also keep your templates up-to-date as you add more content; that way, you need to 
maintain only a few template files rather than dozens of separate family files. It’s even better if 
you can establish a template manager as a role within the office so everyone isn’t making graphical 
changes to your templates.
Introducing Tag Family Fundamentals
Tags in Revit have various similarities and differences to annotation symbols you might find 
in a CAD application. They are similar in that they are created at 1:1 scale and contain lines 
and other graphic elements. The main difference is that Revit tags merely report information 
from model elements, whereas a CAD-based symbol usually holds an attribute value that does 
not directly relate to the annotated building element. These dynamic annotation elements are 
referred to as labels within a Revit family, whereas static annotation is simply known as text.
Before you begin to customize annotation families or create your own, let’s take a detailed 
look at the difference between text and labels.
Text    In the Family Editor, placing text in an annotation family or title block means you 
are defining text that will always be the same and is unchangeable when that family is 
placed in the project environment. Figure 4.32 shows the words AREA and VOLUME as text. 
Regardless of where this room tag is placed, the text will always say AREA and VOLUME. 
Section tags work the same way: If you add static text, that text appears exactly the same for 
all section marks. This technique is not typically used for sections because each section is a 
reference to a unique view, and you want that information to be dynamic and parametric. 
That is where label functionality comes into play.

Creating Custom Annotations |  149  
Labels    Like static text, a label offers textual information; however, it is a live reference to 
a parameter value of an element in the project. For example, if you add an Area label, it will 
pull the value of the area of the room; if you add a Sheet Number label in a Section Head 
family in the Family Editor environment and then use that section head in a project, the label 
will automatically display the actual sheet number on which the section view is placed in the 
project. If you move the section view from one sheet to another, the label will automatically 
report the new sheet number. In Figure 4.32, UNIT 4 is a label reporting the room name; the 
number 201 is a label reporting the room number. The label behaves as dynamic text and is 
always fully coordinated with the value of the model element parameter it represents.
Creating a Custom Door Tag
Imagine you could use the actual width and height of a door element to drive the tag value. You 
can! As an example of creating custom tags for a basic model element, use the following steps to 
create the custom door tag shown in Figure 4.33. You can download the template files from this 
book’s web page if you can’t find them in the default location.
	
1.	 Click the Application menu and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
	
2.	 In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Door Tag
.rft or Metric Door Tag.rft, and click Open.
The Family Editor opens in a view with two crossing reference planes, the intersection of 
which represents the origin of the tag. To avoid problems later, don’t move these planes.
	
3.	 On the Create tab, find the Text panel and select Label. Click the intersection of the two 
planes to position the label.
Note that text and labels do not snap to geometric references; therefore, you will have to 
manually adjust the placement of labels to achieve the desired alignment.
	
4.	 In the Edit Label dialog box that opens, select Width from the column on the left, and 
click the Add Parameter(s) To Label icon between the Category Parameters and Label 
Parameters fields. Then do the same for Height, as shown in Figure 4.34.
Figure 4.33
Creating a custom  
door tag
Figure 4.34
Adding more than  
one parameter to a 
single label

150  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
The Width and Height parameters will be concatenated in a single label, which will dis-
play the actual size of the door in the tag. In the subsequent steps, you will customize the 
display of the label.
	
5.	 Add a space and the letter x in the Suffix column of the Width parameter, and change the 
number in the Sample Value column to 36 (in) or 1000 (mm). Change the sample value of 
the Height parameter to 80 (in) or 2000 (mm).
	
6.	 With the Width row selected (click on row 1), click the Edit Parameter’s Units Format icon. 
In the Format dialog box, uncheck the Use Project Settings option and set the following:
◆
◆
Units: Decimal Inches (or Millimeters)
◆
◆
Rounding: 0 decimal places
◆
◆
Unit Symbol: None
	
7.	 Repeat the previous step for the Height parameter.
	
8.	 Click OK in all open dialog boxes.
	
9.	 On the Create tab, activate the Masking Region tool and sketch a six-sided polygon, as 
shown previously in Figure 4.33.
Remember to finish the sketch by clicking the green check mark in the Mode panel. A 
masking region is used instead of just lines because it will allow the door tag to obscure 
any geometry if it is placed over a model object. If you do not need this graphic conven-
tion, simply create the tag outline with lines.
	
10.	 Save your tag and load it into your project template.
Make sure that it is specified as the default tag for doors in the Loaded Tags And Symbols 
dialog box, and use the Tag By Category or Tag All Not Tagged tool or place new doors with 
the Tag On Placement option. Using concatenated parameters in tag labels allows a great deal 
of flexibility while utilizing actual parametric values. In this example (Figure 4.35), the actual 
Width and Height parameters driving the door size become the text displayed in the tag.
Setting Some Defaults
To aid the users of your custom templates, take some time to establish default values for common 
elements, such as doors, windows, rooms, grids, sheets, and levels. Create one of each element 
and change the Mark value to a number just below the value at which you would like your users to 
begin. As an example, enter a value of 0 if you want your users to begin with 1. Unfortunately, this 
approach does not work for letters because nothing comes before A.
Figure 4.35

applied to doors 
comprise actual  
door sizes.

Creating Custom Annotations |  151  
Customizing View Tags
Section, callout, and elevation tags are graphic indicators that reference (link to) other views 
in your project. The graphics for these elements can be customized to meet most scenarios. To 
create a custom section tag, for example, you have to first create a custom section tag family and 
a section tail family and then load them into a template or project. You must then associate them 
with a section tag system family type, which is then assigned to a section type. Switch to the 
Manage tab, and choose Additional Settings ➢ Section Tags; you will see the application of sepa-
rate section head and tail families in a section tag system family type, as shown in Figure 4.36.
Figure 4.36
Creating a SIM type 
section tag
In simple terms, view tags are organized in the following hierarchy: The view type refers to a 
Callout Tag type (and a Section Tag type for section views); the Section Tag type then refers to a 
section head family and a section tail family.
By default, there is a predefined view tag for each view type. The graphics can vary depend-
ing on the language version of Revit you have installed on your machine. The view tags shown 
in Figure 4.37 are displayed and available by default in the U.S. English version.
Figure 4.37
The default tags
Creating a Custom Section Tag
In the next exercise, you will create a section tag that looks like the one shown in Figure 4.38. 
You will first need to create a section tag family using the Family Editor before loading the 

152  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Figure 4.38
Customizing the 
section tag
­section tag family into the template. You can download the template files from this book’s web 
page if you cannot find them in the default location.
To begin, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Application menu, and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
	
2.	 In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Section 
Head.rft or Metric Section Head.rft, and click Open.
The Family Editor environment automatically opens, and the drawing area shows a view 
in which three green reference planes (two vertical and one horizontal) have already been 
drawn. Do not change the position of either the horizontal reference plane or the vertical 
reference on the right. In some templates, this is indicated with help text in red (which 
you can later remove).
The intersection of the horizontal and the right reference planes defines the connection 
location with the section line. This means your annotation will be located in between the 
two intersections points.
A proposed geometric shape is drawn for the annotation: a circle (two arcs) and a hori-
zontal line. The default shape is there to help you visually understand where to begin 
drawing your new tag geometry.
	
3.	 Select the arcs that create the circle and delete them.
	
4.	 On the Create tab’s Text panel, click the Label button. Position your cursor between the 
two vertical reference planes and below the horizontal plane, and click to position the 
start of the label.
	
5.	 In the Edit Label dialog box, select Sheet Number. Click the Add Parameter(s) To Label 
button. In the Sample Value column, you can enter a value; the default is A101. Click OK.
The label is placed and displays blue grips when selected. These let you change the length of 
the label text field. The length is important because any value that is added (in a project) that 
is longer than the length of this box will begin to wrap and could cause undesirable results.
	
6.	 Following the same principle, place the label Detail Number above the horizontal refer-
ence plane but still between the vertical reference planes, as shown in Figure 4.39.

Creating Custom Annotations |  153  
You can reposition a label by selecting it and using the Move button to move it around. 
For more precise positioning, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge elements in 
small increments. You can also help yourself by zooming in for a better view. (Zooming 
in refines the increment for the nudge tools.)

8.	 Click Finish Edit Mode on the Mode panel of the Modify | Create Filled Region Boundary tab.
	
9.	 Save the tag you just created as Custom Arrow.rfa on your hard drive or network, and 
you’re ready to use it in the template or a project. To load it into your project, click the 
Load Into Project button located in the Family Editor panel. Choose the project where you 
want to use the symbol and click OK.
Next, you will assign this tag to a section mark system family type in the context of a project 
or template.
Creating a Section Type with a Custom Head/Tail Graphic
To create a section type that uses the section head family you created earlier, you need to load 
the new section head into the template file (if you’ve already loaded the custom arrow family in 
the previous exercise, skip to step 3):
	
1.	 If the family is not already loaded, switch to the Insert tab, and on the Load From Library 
panel, choose Load Family.
	
7.	 On the Detail panel of the Create tab, click the Filled Region button. You’ll be put into 
Sketch mode. Using the Line tool, draw the shape shown in Figure 4.40. In the Properties 
palette, click Edit Type. In the Type Properties dialog box, check that Color is set to Black 
and Cut Fill Pattern is set to Solid Fill. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box and 
then make sure the lines you sketched form a closed loop (no gaps or overlapping lines).

5.	 In the Name dialog box, name the new type Custom Filled Arrow, and click OK.
	
6.	 In the section head’s Type Properties dialog box, click the drop-down menu for Section 
Head and select Custom Arrow. For Section Tail, click <none>. This means the other end 
of the section line will not use a symbol. Click OK.
The final step is to create a customized section view type, which will use the new section 
tag type you created in the previous step.
	
7.	 Switch to the View tab, and on the Create panel, select Section.
	
8.	 On the Properties palette, select the Edit Type button.
	
9.	 In the Type Properties dialog box, select Duplicate.
	
10.	 Name the new type Design Sections, and click OK.
You can now place a section in your drawing area and see the results shown in Figure 4.41. 
Note that in our sample the section is referencing a view that has already been placed on a sheet.
You can repeat the previous exercises using a callout tag family template instead of a section 
tag template to achieve results similar to those shown in Figure 4.42.
Figure 4.42
Customizing the 
callout tag
Creating a Custom Elevation Tag
Elevation tags are a bit different from section or callout tags because one tag can simultaneously 
reference up to four views. You must, therefore, create and nest various parts of a custom eleva-
tion tag into one family in order to create custom graphics. Here is how it works:
	
1.	 Click the Application button, and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
	
2.	 In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Elevation 
Mark Body.rft or Metric Elevation Mark Body.rft, and click Open.
	
3.	 Using steps similar to those in the section tag exercise, place the Sheet Number label and 
draw lines as shown in Figure 4.43.

Creating Custom Annotations |  155  
	
4.	 Make sure the properties Keep Readable and Fixed Rotation are checked for the label.
	
5.	 Save the family as Custom Elev Head.rfa.
	
6.	 Click the Application menu and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
	
7.	 In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Elevation 
Mark Pointer.rft or Metric Elevation Mark Pointer.rft and click Open.
	
8.	 Using methods similar to those in previous steps, place labels for the Detail Number and 
Reference Label parameters. Draw a diamond with lines and a small, triangular, filled 
region, as shown in Figure 4.44.
Figure 4.43
Define the custom 
linework and sheet 
number for the  
elevation mark body.
	
9.	 Again, remember to make sure the properties Keep Readable and Fixed Rotation are 
checked for the labels.
	
10.	 Save the family as Custom Elev Pointer.rfa and load it into the Custom Elev Head
.rfa family.
	
11.	 Place four instances of the Custom Elev Pointer family around the intersection of the 
visible reference planes, as shown in Figure 4.45.
Figure 4.45
The nested pointer 
family is placed four 
times in the head 
family.
Figure 4.44

When this custom elevation tag family is loaded into a project and associated with an eleva-
tion type, it will function much like standard elevation symbols.

Starting a Project with a Custom Template
Now that we have covered many areas of customization within project templates, you can con-
figure Revit to use any of your custom project templates. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Application menu and at the bottom of the menu click Options.
	
2.	 In the Options dialog box, select the File Locations category. The list of Project Template 
Files allows you to select several RTE files that will be displayed on the Recent Files 
screen. You can see these files in a drop-down list when you launch the New Project 
command either from the Application menu or by pressing Ctrl+N on the keyboard.
	
3.	 Click the green plus to add RTE files, and use the up and down arrow icons to modify the 
order of the templates in the list (Figure 4.47).

Strategies for Managing Templates |  157  
Strategies for Managing Templates
During implementation, you can take one of two approaches when managing project templates: 
additive or subtractive. An additive approach, as shown in Figure 4.48, assumes that more than one 
project template will be developed to manage standards and content for a single project. Typically, 
a “base” template is used to start a project with a minimum amount of settings, whereas content 
and settings from “supplemental” templates are appended based on region, project type, or proj-
ect style. In this scenario, each template file is lighter, but managing the templates becomes more 
difficult because changes in common settings or families must be applied to all templates.
In contrast, the subtractive approach, shown in Figure 4.49, uses a single master template that 
contains all standard settings and content and relies on the project teams to remove and purge 
unused content. Although the file size of these templates tends to be larger, graphic settings are 
easier to manage within a single file.
Aggregating Template Data
Whether you are managing the settings between templates or developing a project with mul-
tiple templates in an additive approach, you have useful tools within Revit to help share data 
between projects, such as Transfer Project Standards, Insert Views From File, and Insert 2D 
Elements From File.
Transferring Project Standards
You can easily share Revit families between project files by loading their RFA files; however, most 
other types of content must be transferred with the Transfer Project Standards command. Types of 
elements commonly transferred with this command include, but are not limited to, the following:
◆
◆
Materials
◆
◆
System family types (Walls, Floors, Roofs, Stairs, and so on)
◆
◆
Text and dimension styles
Figure 4.48

◆
◆
Filled regions
◆
◆
Grid and level types
◆
◆
Schedules
◆
◆
Line styles and patterns
◆
◆

Viewport types
To use this command, you must first have both the source and target Revit files open within 
the same instance of the software. As an alternative, you can have the source file linked into 
your target file. Next, make the target file the active project. Switch to the Manage tab, and select 
Transfer Project Standards on the Settings panel. In the Select Items To Copy dialog box (Figure 
4.50), choose as many item categories as you want to transfer, and then click OK.
Figure 4.50
Select categories to be 
transferred between 
projects.
If you choose an element category containing some of the same types that already exist in 
your current project, you will be prompted with the option to overwrite the existing types or 
import the new types only (New Only), as shown in Figure 4.51.

Inserting Views from a File
The Insert Views From File command is useful for sharing views between project files—
especially if you use the additive method of template management we mentioned earlier. 
This command allows you to copy drafting views, renderings, or schedules from one proj-
ect to another. It can also insert entire sheets with all attached drafting views and associ-
ated properties. This procedure is quite useful if you use Revit project files as containers 
for your standard or typical details. An entire sheet of details can be inserted with one 
command!
Switch to the Insert tab, and choose Insert From File ➢ Insert Views From File in the Import 
panel.
Browse to a Revit project file (with the filename extension .rvt), and you will then 
see the Insert Views dialog box (Figure 4.52). In the left pane, all eligible drafting views, 
sheets, and schedules will be listed. If necessary, use the Views drop-down list to filter the 
choices.
If one or more sheets are selected in the Insert Views dialog box, all eligible drafting views 
placed on those sheets will be inserted into the current project as well. Note that repeating 
this process will not update the drafting views in the project but instead create new renamed 
drafting views and sheets. Also note that any custom view parameters are maintained during 
the transfer and can fit right into your customized Project Browser organizations, as we dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter.
Using Project Templates to Reduce Redundant Work
In a survey conducted by Robert Manna for an Autodesk University class, the majority of responders 
indicated that they develop two to five project templates primarily to differentiate between project 
types and/or market sectors. For example, if you work for an architectural firm that is usually 
contracted to perform work on large transportation sector projects, you might need to create a 
Revit file just to manage the site data for every project.
In that case, you would use a specific template as a site project template. Within such a template, 
you could use the following settings to reduce the amount of redundant work every time different 
teams attempt to establish a site model to which other building models are linked:
◆
◆
Name levels Sea Level and First Floor Reference.
◆
◆
Set default view scales to larger sizes.
◆
◆
Change default project units to reflect civil engineering.
◆
◆
Add a Cut/Fill schedule.
◆
◆
Create dimension types useful for large drawings.
◆
◆
Pad types, including “gravel.”

160  | Chapter 4  Configuring Templates and Standards   
Inserting 2D Elements from a File
The Insert 2D Elements From File command is similar to the Insert Views From File command, 
but instead of inserting an entire view, it will transfer only the view-specific elements from the 
selected view to the active view in the current project. You can select only one view from the 
selected file. This command allows you the flexibility to insert various view-specific elements 
such as detail lines, filled regions, text, and color fill legends. These elements can be imported 
from any view—not just drafting views.
On the Insert tab, find the Import panel, choose Insert From File ➢ Insert 2D Elements From 
File, and then navigate to a project file. Choose one of the available drafting views in the Insert 
2D Elements dialog box (Figure 4.53).
For consistency, be sure to select the Transfer View Scale option to convert the scale of 
the active drafting view to that of the view you are inserting. You can move the elements 
into position using the Move command, and after placing the 2D elements, be sure to click 
Finish in the Edit Pasted panel or double-click anywhere outside the elements to complete the 
command.

used to transfer an

Duplicate Types When Inserting
When using Insert Views From File or Insert 2D Elements From File, be sure to watch for warnings 
about existing types not being overwritten, as shown here, because new element types from the 
inserted source may contain more desirable properties.

The Bottom Line |  161

 Chapter  5 
 Working in a team   
 Most projects involve more than one person working together at any given time. It is common in 
design for many people to work collaboratively to meet deadlines and create a set of construction 
documents. Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software has tools that allow for a collaborative design 
and documentation process while giving multiple people simultaneous access to its single-fi le 
building model. This unique functionality is known as  worksharing .

 Understanding Worksharing Basics 
Worksharing refers to the use of  worksets to divide a model for the purpose of sharing project 
work among multiple people. A workset is a customizable collection of building elements that 
can be used to manage project responsibilities. By associating various building elements with 
worksets, the design team has the ability to subdivide the model to retain additional control 
over element ownership. Using worksets, several people can collaborate and work within 
the same fi le without fear that their decisions will confl ict directly with their teammates. By 
default, worksharing is not enabled when you start a project because it is assumed you are in a 
 single-user environment. 
 Worksharing is commenced when worksets are enabled and a project fi le is saved as a  central 
fi le located on a network drive. This central fi le becomes the repository where all the design 
team’s work is saved. Team members then create a local copy of the central fi le on their own 
workstation in which they will work as usual. The local copies of the model are individual 
versions of the fi le connected to the central fi le (Figure  5.1 ). 

166  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
The only information that flows instantly between the local copies and the central file is 
permissions. Edits to model elements or settings are not transferred among the project team 
members because this would significantly decrease performance and would be distracting to 
your workflow to see the model constantly changing on the screen. In other words, the only way 
another team member knows you are editing something is by seeing that you own the element. 
Even though worksets are established to break a model into manageable chunks, permissions for 
a worksharing-enabled project are managed at the object level. This means that you could have a 
worksharing-enabled project with only one workset. Remember, a project file is essentially a data-
base. As you are working on elements within the model, you are automatically obtaining permis-
sion to edit elements from the central database. Once permission to modify an element is granted, 
no one else can make changes to that element until the changes are ­reconciled with the central file. 
This occurs when you use the Synchronize With Central (SWC) command on the Collaborate tab 
to save changes you have made back to the central file and simultaneously update your local file 
with any other changes that have been published to the central file by other team members.
Figure 5.1
The worksharing 
concept
The Library Worksharing Analogy
Another way to understand worksets and how they relate to object permissions is to think of a 
workset as a shelf of books in a library and the model objects as individual books on the shelf. If you 
are working on a paper about beavers, you can go to the library and do one of two things: check out 
the entire shelf of books about animals or check out the book about beavers. Checking out an entire 
shelf of books within a certain category is the same as making an entire workset editable—no one 
else can do their animal research paper because you have all the animal books. You have become 
the owner of that workset, and there can be only one owner per workset.
As an alternative, you would likely borrow only the book on beavers so that your fellow students can 
access other animal books to complete their papers. You have become an element borrower, and there can 
be many borrowers within each workset. Of course, the teacher probably made a mistake if she assigned 
two students to complete a report on the same animal. This mistake may also hold true when your team 
is working in Revit. The same model object cannot be edited simultaneously by more than one person. 
After all, you probably should not be working on the same model area as your teammate anyway, right?

Enabling Worksharing on Your Project |  167  
The actual use of worksets can vary greatly from project to project. Quite frankly, creating 
more worksets beyond the defaults is technically not necessary; however, you can use worksets 
to take advantage of other benefits:
◆
◆
Use worksets to control the visibility of groupings of building components, such as 
­building skin, core, interior walls, and so on, without the need to use temporary view 
­settings or control visibility manually.
◆
◆
Close worksets as needed to remove those parts of your project from active memory, thus 
improving performance.
◆
◆
Use workset ownership to prevent others from editing a part of the project you are 
­currently designing.
Enabling Worksharing on Your Project
The worksharing feature can be enabled in any Revit project file. You can begin ­worksharing, 
create and remove worksets, or move elements between worksets during any stage of the 
project.
Worksharing in the Project Process
When the team has chosen to enable the worksharing feature, make sure everyone is aware of the 
change to the file and that it is planned within the project process.
To follow along with the text in this chapter, you can download the sample building ­project 
file from this book’s companion website at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. One 
­version of the project does not have worksets, whereas the other has retained worksets but is 
not configured for worksharing. Open the file c05-Sample-Building_Start.rvt and switch 
to the Collaborate tab in the ribbon. The worksharing tools are shown in Figure 5.2. 
You can initiate worksharing by clicking the Collaborate button. It will initially be the only 
active button on the Manage Collaboration panel. Selecting this tool opens the Collaborate dialog  
box, alerting you that you are about to enable collaboration for your project (Figure 5.3). You can  
choose to Collaborate within your Network or with Autodesk 360. You can only choose A360 if 
you have that application installed. Both options allow you to enable Worksets. To start work-
sets, select the Worksets button in the Manage Collaboration Panel. Two worksets are automati-
cally created within your project: Shared Levels and Grids, to which any existing levels and 
grids in your project will be assigned, and Workset1, to which all other building elements will 
be assigned. You can rename these worksets; however, we recommend not renaming Workset1 
because you can never delete that workset—even if it has been renamed. You will read about an 
alternative way to use Workset1 in the section “Organizing Worksets” later in this chapter.
Figure 5.2
The Collaborate tab

168  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Click OK to confirm that you want to enable worksharing. Depending on the size of your 
model and your processor speed, this process can take a few minutes to complete. Once it is 
done, the Worksets dialog box opens (Figure 5.4).
Figure 5.3
Activating worksharing
In the Worksets dialog box, you can create as many user-defined worksets as necessary; we 
offer some tips in the section “Organizing Worksets” later in this chapter. By default, when a 
new workset is created, it does not contain any model elements or components. You can add 
model elements to worksets as you build them or reassign existing elements to worksets. The 
Worksets dialog box also lets you take and relinquish permissions over existing worksets. First, 
Figure 5.4
The Worksets dialog 
box

Enabling Worksharing on Your Project |  169  
you should understand the different types of worksets illustrated by the options in the Show 
area at the bottom of the Worksets dialog box, shown in Figure 5.4.
Types of Worksets
There are four types of worksets in any project: user-created, families, project standards, and 
views. User-created worksets such as Shared Levels and Grids and Workset1 are shown by 
default, and you have the option to list the others by selecting the check boxes at the bottom of 
the Worksets dialog box:
User-Created Worksets    In addition to the two worksets automatically generated when 
you first enable worksharing, all of the worksets you add in the Worksets dialog box will fall 
under this category. All building elements, spaces, and datum objects you place in the project 
are assigned to user-created worksets. Only elements in user-created worksets can be moved 
to other user-created worksets.
Families Worksets    For each family loaded in the project, a workset is automatically ­created. 
When editing the properties of a family, you will automatically take ownership over that family.
Project Standards Worksets    The project standards workset type is dedicated to all the 
project settings, such as materials, dimension styles, annotations, tags, line styles, and so 
on. Any time you need to edit a project standard, such as modifying the type properties of 
dimensions, you will be taking ownership of the element’s workset.
Views Worksets    Every view created in a project has its own workset. The views work-
set type controls ownership of the view properties and any view-specific elements, such 
as annotations, dimensions, tags, detail lines, and so on. You can take ownership of a 
particular view workset by selecting it from the workset list and clicking the Editable 
button, but this is not necessary to start working in a view. You can also take ownership 
of a view by right-clicking the view in the Project Browser and choosing Make Workset 
Editable from the context menu. This can be a helpful shortcut in construction documents 
when much of the effort on the project is more view specific. Regardless of ownership, 
any team member always has the ability to add annotation elements to any view—you 
just cannot change any existing view-specific elements when another user owns a view 
workset.
We will get back to worksets in the “Organizing Worksets” section of this chapter. For now, 
you should establish the workset-enabled project model as a central file.
Creating a Central File
After you enable worksets in a project model, you must save the project as a central file to enable 
others to collaborate on the model. This is the file that will collect all the work done by your 
team members and allow them to receive regular updates of changes being made to the model 
and documentation.
You can use one of two commands to establish a workset-enabled model as a central file: 
Save or Save As. If you click Save from the Application menu, you will be presented with a 
warning telling you that this is the first time the file will be saved since worksharing was 
enabled (Figure 5.5). If you select Yes, the file will become a central file with only the default 
settings in its current location.

170  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
As an alternative, we recommend using the Save As ➢ Project command from the Application 
menu. When you click this button instead of Save, the Save As dialog box will appear. In the 
Save As dialog box, click the Options button to access the options shown in Figure 5.6.
Figure 5.5
The Save command 
will create a central file 
with only the default 
settings.
This dialog box contains some important settings. At the top, you can set the number of back-
ups the file will keep in the folder history after saves. The default value is 20. Depending on the 
storage availability on your network, how often your network is backed up, and the ­number of 
people working in the model (remember, local files are also backups), you might want to increase 
this number. For example, if three users are using Synchronizing With Central every 30 minutes; 
that might be 48 saves before the next backup. Better safe than sorry. Also, the Make This A 
Central Model After Save check box is selected and grayed out. This is because we have activated 
worksharing in this file and it is assumed that we will be making a central file on the next save.
You can also specify default settings for opening the project file (shown as Open Workset 
Default). We will discuss opening a file in the section “Creating a Local File” later in this 
­chapter, but we recommend setting this option to Specify for most project scenarios. This will 
always prompt your team members with the Worksets dialog box when a local file is opened. 
Click OK to exit the File Save Options dialog box.
Back in the Save As dialog box, choose a network location that everyone on the team has 
access to for your central file. Be sure that when you are naming your new central file, you 
Figure 5.6
Options for saving a 
project file

Enabling Worksharing on Your Project |  171  
choose a new name. Do not save over the existing Revit project file. There are two reasons for 
this: First, it automatically gives you a backup of your file as it existed before worksharing was 
enabled. Second, saving over an open Revit file can sometimes cause corruption, even if it is the 
same model. It is also a good idea to name the file with some clarity that helps identify it as a 
central file, such as MyProject-Central.rvt.
Once you have entered a new name for the file, click the Save button to save the file. Now that 
your file is saved to the network, close all the open view windows. As one final step, you need 
to make sure you don’t accidentally retain any rights over the objects and elements within the 
­central file, thereby prohibiting anyone from editing those elements.
To do this, go to the Collaborate tab, find the Synchronize panel, and click the Synchronize 
With Central button. This button is a flyout button that contains two commands: Synchronize 
And Modify Settings and Synchronize Now. You will want to use Synchronize And Modify 
Settings in this case. In the Synchronize With Central dialog box, shown in Figure 5.7, make 
sure you select any available check boxes in the middle portion to relinquish ownership of all 
­worksets. You can also add a comment to identify the action taken during this synchronization.
File Naming in Revit
When you are working with a project team in Revit, it is important to give your various team 
members some guidance when you name your files. We just touched on the idea of making sure 
you include “Central” in your filename so team members know they will need to make a local copy 
when opening the file, but there are some other guidelines you might want to consider.
When working with other disciplines, consider naming your file with a denominator to let the larger 
team know which file is architectural, which is structural, and so on. Also, because your office might be 
working on several Revit projects at one time, you might be working in more than one version of Revit if 
you’re working on more than one project. So it’s a good idea to include the Revit version in your filename 
so team members don’t accidentally open the file with a newer version. An example filename might be 
c05-Sample-Building-A16-Central.rvt.  c05-Sample-Building is the project name, A designates 
the discipline as architectural, 16 is the version of Revit (2016), and Central notes it is a central file.
Figure 5.7
Synchronizing with 
central to relinquish 
permissions

172  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Yes, it might seem odd to use the Synchronize With Central command when you are actually 
in the central file, but this method is the fastest way to relinquish all worksets and complete the 
setup of the central file. Click OK to complete the synchronization.
Using a Revit Server Accelerator
If your project team is distributed in various geographic locations, an alternative to 
­synchronizing with the central model directly over the wide area network (WAN) is to use a 
Revit Server Accelerator. This technology was developed by Autodesk to support extended 
­collaboration through the use of server technology that creates a layer of virtual central models. 
The Revit Server then manages changes into a single central model without burdening the WAN 
with full synchronization traffic.
You may learn more about A360 Collaboration for Revit, which we discuss more in the 
“Collaborating in the Cloud” section later in this chapter.
Selecting a Starting View
On the Manage tab of the ribbon, locate the Manage Project panel and click the Starting View 
command. With this command, you can select any project view to be the first view displayed 
when the model is opened (Figure 5.8). Because 3D views take longer to regenerate when your 
project opens, we recommend you select a 2D view to speed this process; you can even create a 
drafting view that contains the project name and image as the starting view.
Figure 5.8
Selecting the starting 
view
Another use for the starting view is as a project bulletin board. Simply create a drafting view 
for the starting view and keep it populated with project standards, modeling action items, and 
other notes your team might need to know.

Enabling Worksharing on Your Project |  173  
Synchronize the central file once again, and remember to relinquish any worksets you might 
have obtained during the configuration of the central file. From the Application menu click 
Close to close the central file.
Using Caution When Using a Central File
Once you have created a central file, there are a couple of things you cannot do. Do not open it directly 
again and do not change the filename. Opening the file will change its attributes, and none of your 
team members will be able to synchronize with central. If they were actively working in the local 
file, their work would be lost. The same problem occurs if you change the filename—those with a 
local copy will lose their association to the central file and they will not be able to save their work.
Creating a Local File
Now that you have made a central file, you will need to create a local copy of it in which you 
will organize worksets for team collaboration and continue your design and documentation. 
There are several ways to perform this action. One option is to simply open the network location 
of the central file and copy the file from the network to your desktop or anywhere on your local 
hard drive. Be careful not to move the file—only copy it. It is also a good idea to rename the file 
to something that identifies it as a local file, such as c05-Sample-Building-Local.rvt.
Another method of creating a local file is to use a script or macro. There are many variations 
of this method, so we will not discuss them in detail here. We believe the simplest example of 
a script is to use common Windows commands in a BAT file. You can create a BAT file in any 
simple text editor such as Windows Notepad, and you will find a command-line reference in 
Windows Help and Support on your computer (search for commands). You can also find a free 
tool on David Baldacchino’s blog:
http://do-u-revit.blogspot.com/2008/03/streamlining-local-file-creation.html
The last and most predictable method for creating a local file is to use the functionality 
­integrated with the Open command. Using any common method to open a file, you will get to 
the Open dialog box (Figure 5.9). Navigate to the central file, and when it is selected, you will 
have the option to create a new local file at the bottom of the dialog box. Whenever you select 
a central file through the Open dialog box, this box is checked for you as a safety precaution 
against you opening the central file directly.
The local file is created in the location specified as the default path for user files. This 
­setting can be found in the application options, under the File Locations settings. The default 
­location for this setting is the My Documents folder. If you choose this method, the local file 
will be appended with your workset username. If you have already created a local file with this 
method, you will be prompted with a warning the next time you attempt to create a new local 
copy from the central file (Figure 5.10). You have the option to either overwrite the existing local 
copy or append a time stamp to the existing file.
Figure 5.9
Create a new local 
file from the Open 
dialog box.

174  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Before you proceed to open the file, you can change the way you interact with worksets. If 
you click the small arrow to the right of the Open button, you will see a list of options, as shown 
in Figure 5.11.
Figure 5.10

Figure 5.11
Workset options when 
opening a file
The default setting for opening worksharing files is Last Viewed, but each of the available 
settings is helpful to your workflow. Let’s review these settings in detail:
All    This setting opens all available user-created worksets.
Editable    This setting opens only those worksets that you have previously made editable. If 
you did not retain ownership of any worksets the last time you worked on a local file, none 
of the user-created worksets will be opened. To retain ownership of worksets when you 
close a file, you will be prompted with the alert shown in Figure 5.12. Choose the option to 
keep ownership of elements and worksets. We do not recommend this workflow because it 
restricts others on your team from working on elements for which you retain ownership.
Figure 5.12
Closing a file while 
relinquishing  
ownership of worksets

Enabling Worksharing on Your Project |  175  
Last Viewed    The file will be opened with the Last Viewed worksets configuration. If 
you use this option when opening a new local file for the first time, all worksets will be 
opened.
Specify    We highly recommend this option because it will give you the most flexibility 
when opening a local file. When Specify is selected, you will be presented with the Worksets 
dialog box immediately after you click the Open button. You can then choose the worksets 
you would like to open or close before the file is loaded into memory.
To continue your exercise, choose the Specify option and then click the Open button. The 
first time any local file is opened using a method other than the Create New Local option, you 
will see a warning message alerting you that you are opening a local file. This is simply a noti-
fication that you have made a local copy of a central file and you will be the owner of the local 
file. If this warning appears, click Close to dismiss the warning and continue the file-opening 
process.
The Worksets dialog box will be displayed if you used the Specify option to open the file. At 
this point in the exercise, you will still have only Shared Levels and Grids and Workset1, but in 
the future, you will have the ability to close any workset you may not need for editing in your 
work session. Click OK to close the Worksets dialog box.
Using Caution When Using a Central File
Using a worksharing environment allows you to do something your IT department typically asks 
you not to do: work directly on your workstation’s hard drive. Although working off a network file 
is typically a good idea, there are several reasons why a local copy offers additional benefits:
◆
◆
It allows more than one user to make changes to the central file by editing local files and syn-
chronizing those changes with the central file.
◆
◆
Your local copy will be more responsive than a networked local file because your access speed 
to your hard drive is much faster than it is across most networks.
◆
◆
If anything bad happens to your network or your central file, such as file corruption, each local 
file is ­basically a backup that can be used to create a new local file by performing a Save As 
operation and selecting the option to make this a new central file. 
Using Worksharing Usernames
Each local file is automatically associated with your worksharing username once it is opened; 
after it is opened, it cannot be edited by any other user. By default, your Windows login name 
is used as your worksharing username. When you use the Create New Local option to open a 
worksharing-enabled project, the username is appended to the end of the local filename—for 
example, c05-Sample-Building-A16-Central_YourName.rvt.
It can be a good idea to adjust the naming convention for usernames to help team communi-
cation. In a smaller office, it might not be as necessary, but in a larger office or multi-office team, 
clarification of element ownership is vital. One option is to change your workset username to 
first name, last name, and phone extension. This way, team members can quickly identify and 
contact you if they need you to relinquish permission of an element.

176  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
To make this modification, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Close all your open projects files. You can change the username only when no 
­workshared projects are open (you cannot change your username while it is active in 
open projects). After you change your workset username, you will need to create a new 
local file because the old local file is associated with a different username.
	
2.	 From the Application menu, choose Options at the bottom.
	
3.	 In the Options dialog box, select the General category.
	
4.	 In the Username field, enter a new value (Figure 5.13). Click OK to exit.
Figure 5.13
Changing the default 
username
If you have signed in to an Autodesk® 360 (A360) services account, your username will 
­automatically switch to your A360 username, which may not include your telephone number 
but will give you access to other ways of communication such as instant messaging through 
applications such as C4R. A360 is an online service with Autodesk accessible from the upper-
right portion of your application window. If you are not signed in, you should see the button as 

Organizing Worksets |  177  
a small figure with Sign In next to it. More information on the A360 account is provided later in 
this chapter.
Organizing Worksets
Now that you have enabled worksets and configured your project file for worksharing, you 
have the opportunity to further organize your model into more worksets. When dividing your 
­project into worksets, it is important to think about the larger building system rather than ­try 
to isolate its individual components. In other words, worksets should not be used like layers in 
a CAD application. A good way to think about dividing up worksets is to consider the building 
elements and the number of people working on each of these elements. A basic breakdown of a 
project’s components might include the following:
◆
◆
Exterior skin
◆
◆
Core
◆
◆
Interior partitions (in a larger building, by floor)
◆
◆
Site
◆
◆
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E)
This breakdown mirrors some of the roles and responsibilities on the project as well. There 
might be a small group working on exterior skin design and detailing, another group working 
on interior partitions, and a third working on FF&E. And for larger projects where you have 
linked files (possibly from other disciplines like mechanical, electrical, and plumbing [MEP] or 
structure), it is helpful to associate those linked files with their own worksets.
How Many Worksets Do You Need?
A good rule of thumb is that you should have one or two worksets for every person working on the 
project (besides Shared Levels and Grids). On a small project with two or three people, you might 
only have three or four worksets. On larger projects, you could have a dozen or so.
Also keep in mind that once you have six to eight people working in a project, the performance of 
Revit slows somewhat, not to mention that you spend a bit more time saving local files because each 
person actually saves twice (once to save changes to central and another to download everyone else’s 
changes). If your project is large enough to warrant more than six to eight people working concur-
rently in the model, consider dividing the model into multiple files, as we discuss in Appendix B.
Continuing with the Sample Building exercise file, open a local copy of the central file and click 
the Worksets button from the Collaborate tab or from the status bar. Click the New button and cre-
ate each of the following new worksets (keep the Visible In All Views option selected each time):
◆
◆
Exterior and Structure
◆
◆
Furniture
◆
◆
Interiors

178  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
When you have done this, you should see a total of five user-created worksets, as shown in 
Figure 5.14. The worksets we have set up demonstrate how a typical breakdown might occur in 
a project of this size, but creating, defining, and assigning worksets is by no means limited to 
this scheme. Depending on how you structure work in your office, the worksets might be quite 
different.
Should You Keep Workset1?
Why keep Workset1? Well, it is a great holding place when new users need to work on the project but 
they are not certain to which workset they should assign the new elements they create. Tell them 
not to worry! Simply ask them to make Workset1 their active workset. After they have finished 
their work, they can isolate all the elements they have created and then assign them to the right 
workset later (maybe with some oversight). You can even have a 3D view with only Workset1 visible.
As we stated previously, one of the biggest challenges facing teams new to Revit is under-
standing the difference between layers in a CAD application as compared to worksets. These 
teams typically want to try to manage worksets as they managed layers in CAD, which can 
result in worksets named Doors, Windows, Walls, and so on. Although this is effective manage-
ment in a CAD environment, you do not want to create all of this structure for worksets. Not 
only is it time-consuming, but it does not provide any benefit.
Much like layers, the workset is a tool that the team will need to understand in order to use 
it successfully. Worksets should be structured by a team’s BIM coordinator or a project man-
ager familiar with a BIM workflow. Ultimately, though, it is up to the team members to place 
­elements in the proper worksets and ensure that project standards are being followed.
Figure 5.14

Organizing Worksets |  179  
Moving Elements between Worksets
With this chapter’s exercises, you are applying worksharing to an existing model; therefore, you 
will need to assign the existing model elements to the worksets you have created. The easiest 
way to move elements between user-defined worksets is by using a customized 3D view. The 
following exercise will walk you through moving elements from Workset1 to the new worksets 
you have established, using a subtractive method to reassign the model geometry. This should 
be done by a single person who owns all the elements to ensure that no permissions issues 
occur when elements are being moved between worksets. This is also best done with only one 
person actively working on the file. If you have other users with local copies, ask them to not use 
the model while you’re moving elements.
To move the elements between worksets, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the default 3D view so you can see the entire model. By selecting a 3D view, 
you cannot accidentally select view-specific elements (like elevation or sections) 
or datum—you’ll be selecting only model elements that can be assigned to user-
defined worksets. Now open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and choose 
the Worksets tab. Choose to hide all the worksets except for Workset1 (Figure 5.15), 
and click OK. This will turn off any elements that are visible on those worksets and 
allow you to “subtract” ­elements from this view as you move them to the nonvisible 
worksets.
Figure 5.15
Isolating Workset1 
in Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides

180  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
In a worksharing-enabled file, the default 3D view is unique to each user participating in 
the model. The name of the view will be appended with the team member’s username; 
for example, {3D – BIM Coordinator}.
	
2.	 To select model elements and assign them to different worksets, you have a few 
options:
◆
◆
For a smaller model, select a comfortable number of elements using the Filter 
tool and then modify the Workset parameter in the Properties palette. What 
constitutes a “comfortable” number of elements depends on your computer’s 
capabilities. As an example, if you window-select all the elements in our Sample 
Building model, you can click the Filter button in the ribbon and choose to keep 
the Furniture category active and uncheck the remaining items (Figure 5.16). 
Click OK. In the Properties ­palette, assign these elements to the Furniture 
workset.
◆
◆
For a larger model, it might first be necessary to select some individual components 
and move them separately. Although the process remains the same (select elements, 
change the workset in the Properties palette), the selection system can vary. Another 
example of moving elements by selection would be to highlight an exterior wall and 
use the Tab key to select a chain of exterior walls. Those exterior walls can be moved 
to the Exterior and Structure workset.
◆
◆
You can also select one or more types of elements in the model and use the 
Temporary Hide/Isolate tools in the view control bar. In the exercise file, try 
to locate a single window and select it. From the view control bar, click the 
Temporary Hide/Isolate icon and select Isolate Category. The boundary of the 
3D view will be highlighted, indicating a temporary view setting, and you will 
see only windows. Window-select all the windows and then go to the Properties 
Figure 5.16
Use the Filter tool to 
select specific object 
categories.

palette to assign them to the Exterior and Structure workset (Figure 5.17). Return 
to the Temporary Hide/Isolate icon in the view control bar and select Reset 
Temporary Hide/Isolate.
Figure 5.17
Assign the Workset 
property to multiple 
elements.
	
3.	 Using the same technique, you can move the remainder of the model elements to their 
respective worksets. When the default 3D view is empty, you will know that all the ele-
ments have been reassigned to new worksets.
For even easier workset management and quality control, you can create a 3D view named 
according to each workset. In each of these views, isolate the respective workset in the Worksets 
tab of the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. After these views are established in the 
­project, you can periodically examine them to fix any workset assignment mistakes. For 
­example, someone might have placed plumbing fixtures on the Site workset.
As you continue to assign model elements to worksets, you should be aware of some special 
conditions that might exist in your project. Some elements that can be selected and/or filtered 
are actually subcomponents of other systems, and as such their Workset property cannot be 
changed independently of the parent system. For example, you can select and filter curtain wall 
panels and mullions, but you can change only the Workset property of the curtain wall object, 
which is simply categorized as a wall.
Another special condition to look for is the presence of groups. Grouped objects will show up 
in the filter list as Groups and not in their respective categories. As an example, in Figure 5.18, 
the filter list shows Model Groups. Select only Model Groups in the Filter dialog box and use 
the Isolate Elements command in the view control bar, and you will see that the groups contain 
­elements in the Casework and Furniture categories.

182  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
At any point in this process, you can check your work by opening the Workset tab in the 
Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and setting all but one workset to Hide. Use this 
method to inspect the contents of each workset.
The workflow described in the preceding exercise is necessary only if you have developed a 
model before enabling worksharing for collaboration. You can always start a new project enabled 
with worksets, and your team can develop the model simultaneously. The only important thing 
to remember is to ensure your team uses the appropriate active workset when working in a 
worksharing-enabled project. We will cover that in greater detail in the following section.
Managing Workflow with Worksets
Now that you or your BIM coordinator has established a central file and organized your project 
into worksets, you can get ready to work by creating a local copy of the central file. Do you need 
to do anything special to begin working in a project that is enabled with worksets? No. You can 
simply start adding or editing content in your project because permissions are being automati-
cally managed as you work. Just remember that you cannot edit any elements (2D or 3D) that 
someone else is already editing.
Moving Every Instance of an Element
A quick way to move every instance of an element type to a new workset is to use the Select All 
Instances option from the context menu. For example, select a chair in the model and right-click 
it. From the context menu, choose Select All Instances ➢ In Entire Project. This selects all the 
family elements in the entire model, allowing you to quickly move them all to the same workset 
in the Properties palette.
Another way to select all instances of an element is to right-click the family name in the Project 
Browser under the Families node. Simply navigate to your family in its proper category.
Figure 5.18
Select only 
Model Groups 
in the Filter 
dialog box.

Managing Workflow with Worksets |  183  
You do not have to make any worksets editable unless you want to prevent other team mem-
bers from editing certain parts of your project until you have completed some work. Remember 
the library analogy earlier in this chapter.
Do Not Work in the Central File
Make sure that you never work directly within the central file. Doing so will change the file attributes 
on the server and prohibit anyone with a local file from being able to synchronize with the central 
file. The possibility of losing a lot of work and effort from team members exists, so it is safer to err 
on the side of caution by simply never opening the file.
The most important thing to remember when you use worksharing is that every element in 
the file and added to the file belongs to a workset. To make sure you are placing elements in the 
proper workset while working, know there are a few tools to ensure that you select the right 
workset.
One such location is on the Collaborate tab, where you originated worksharing. As shown in 
Figure 5.19, the active workset is Exterior and Structure. This also tells you that the Exterior and 
Structure workset is not editable. What this means is that as a user, you have not taken owner-
ship of this workset. However, as we mentioned previously, you do not need to own a workset to 
add elements to it. It just needs to be active in this window.
Figure 5.19
Setting the active 
workset in the ribbon
Figure 5.20
Setting the active 
workset in the status bar
The second location is in the status bar at the bottom of the application (Figure 5.20). The 
drop-down menu on the left serves the same function as the Active Workset drop-down in the 
Collaborate tab, but it allows you to verify that the proper workset is active without the need to 
bounce between tabs in the ribbon and interrupt your workflow. From this location you can also 
change the active workset and even open the Worksets dialog box using the small button to the 
left of the drop-down menu.
Another helpful tool located on the Collaborate tab is the Gray Inactive Worksets button. This 
dims all the elements that are not on the active workset, helping you identify what elements are 
in your current, active workset. This is a temporary view state and will not affect any printing 
or other output.

184  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
In addition, you can always view an object’s workset assignment by hovering your mouse 
pointer over the object and viewing its workset in the status bar (Figure 5.21). This location 
will also display an object’s family and category. In the example shown here, the wall is in 
the Exterior and Structure workset, in the Walls category, and its type is Exterior - EIFS on 
Mtl. Stud. There are three locations in this figure where you can see the workset: one in the 
Properties palette, one in the status bar, and one in the tooltip shown when you hover over an 
element.

bar, Properties,

information.
Saving Work
It will eventually become necessary to save your work and share your progress with others 
in the model. You have three ways to both save your work and view the work of others: Save, 
Synchronize And Modify Settings, and Synchronize Now.
Save    The Save button saves the work you have done to your local file only; the work is not 
shared or published back to the central file. This can be a useful step if you are in the middle 
of a process and want to make sure your work is saved but are not ready to share the changes 
with the rest of the team. You can find the Save tool either by choosing Application ➢ Save or 
by clicking the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar (QAT).
Synchronize With Central ➢ Synchronize And Modify Settings    When you are ready 
to publish your work for the rest of your team to see, you have two command choices to 
synchronize with the central file. The first of two synchronizing commands is known 
as Synchronize And Modify Settings. You can access this command in a couple of ways. 
The first is on the Collaborate tab in the Synchronize panel, as shown in Figure 5.22. The 
Synchronize With Central flyout button is located on the left of this panel.

Managing Workflow with Worksets |  185  
As an alternative, you can use the Synchronize With Central button located on the QAT. Both 
buttons perform the same action and will open the Synchronize With Central dialog box 
(Figure 5.23). This dialog box gives you some additional tools to assist your workflow:
◆
◆
The Compact Central Model check box allows you to compact the model to save on disk 
space. It will take some additional save time, but it can temporarily decrease your file size 
significantly. This should not be seen as a permanent solution to managing a large file, 
however. Compaction will decrease the file size, but use of the file will expand the com-
pacted elements. Tips and techniques for reducing file size are discussed in Appendix B.
◆
◆
Five additional check boxes will be available (depending on what work you have done to 
the file) to allow you to relinquish or keep permission over the elements you have previ-
ously edited. Unchecking these boxes means that you will retain ownership over all the 
elements you currently own with the model. This can be useful if you are planning to con-
tinue working on the same elements and want to publish only recent changes of the model.
◆
◆
You can add comments to the synchronization that can be useful for tracing potential 
model conflicts later in the production process.
◆
◆
A final check box, Save Local File Before And After Synchronizing With Central, allows 
you to save your changes locally, get any new changes from the central file, and then save 
locally again, ensuring that your local copy is up to date. This is the save option that takes 
the longest, and you might choose to uncheck this periodically if you have pressed for time 
or have a large file that typically takes longer to save.
Figure 5.23

Central dialog box

186  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Synchronize With Central ➢ Synchronize Now    The second command choice to ­publish 
your changes is called Synchronize Now. Choosing this option allows you to bypass the 
Synchronize With Central dialog box and simply sync your file immediately. With this 
option, you will be relinquishing all your permissions over any elements you have borrowed; 
however, you will remain the owner of any worksets you have made editable in the Worksets 
dialog box.
Saving at Intervals
You will be prompted to save your work at regular intervals. Once worksharing is enabled, you 
will receive an additional reminder to synchronize with the central file as well as to save your 
work (Figure 5.24). You can dismiss these dialog boxes by clicking Cancel at the lower right, but 
remember, it is a good idea to save regularly so you do not lose any work.
Figure 5.24
Changes Not 
Synchronized With 
Central dialog box
If the Changes Not Synchronized With Central dialog box appears, you will have three 
options to choose from:
◆
◆
Synchronize With Central, which will perform a save operation identical to that of the 
Synchronize Now command
◆
◆
Synchronize With Central And Set Reminder Intervals, which will synchronize your file 
and then pull up the Options dialog box, allowing you to set the intervals in which you 
receive this message
◆
◆
Do Not Synchronize And Set Reminder Intervals, which will cancel all future reminders 
for the remainder of your Revit session
You can modify the reminder time shown in the dialog box at any time by clicking the 
Application button, selecting Options, and then choosing the General tab.
Loading Work from Other Team Members
It is possible to update your model and load work from other team members without publishing 
your own work back to the central file. This process, called Reload Latest, basically downloads 
the latest changes from the central file to your local file. Because you are only downloading 
­content from the central file and not uploading, this process takes only a portion of the time a 
full SWC does. To do this, click the Collaborate tab on the ribbon, and choose Reload Latest from 
the Synchronize panel. The default keyboard shortcut for this command is RL.

Managing Workflow with Worksets |  187  
Using Worksharing Visualization
Sometimes it helps to have the ability to graphically display worksets and their status in the 
project. With worksharing visualization, you can visualize four different values: ownership 
status, individual ownership, updated elements, and workset assignment. You can open the 
­settings from the view control bar.
To display any of the values, select the desired setting. When any value is selected, the tempo-
rary view condition is indicated by colored highlighting around the edges of the view window.
Select the Worksharing Display Settings menu item to customize the graphic appearance of 
the visualization overrides. The Checkout Status tab of the Worksharing Display Settings dialog 
box shows three values: what is owned by you, owned by others, or not owned at all (Figure 5.25).
Figure 5.25
Checkout Status tab
Figure 5.26
Owners tab
The Owners tab of the Worksharing Display Settings dialog box illustrates which elements 
are owned by the users in your project. If you see users listed who do not have any enabled ele-
ments or worksets, you can remove them from the list by selecting their username and clicking 
the Remove User icon at the lower left (Figure 5.26).

188  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
The Model Updates tab of the Worksharing Display Settings dialog box indicates changes 
to the central file that may not be apparent until you have synchronized with the central file 
(Figure 5.27).
Figure 5.27
Model Updates tab
Figure 5.28
Worksets tab
The Worksets tab allows you to color-code the model based on the workset assignment of 
all the building elements. Color-coding is also helpful for keeping track of your active workset 
(Figure 5.28).

Managing Workflow with Worksets |  189  
Finally, how often the display settings update in your project is up to you. To modify these 
settings, choose Application ➢ Options to modify the Worksharing Update Frequency option 
(Figure 5.29). Moving the slider to the far left will set the description below the Updates 
slider to Manual Updates Only, and the update will occur when you use Reload Latest or 
Synchronize With Central. Slide just a bit to the right and you will see that the display will 
update every 60 seconds. Slide it all the way to the right and your display will update every 
5 seconds.

Managing Workset Visibility in View Templates
As we described in the section “Moving Elements between Worksets,” worksets can be used 
as a different way to visualize your project using the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. 
Workset visibility can also be managed as part of a view template. To modify these settings, go 
to the View tab, locate the Graphics panel, and select View Templates ➢ Manage View Templates. 
In the View Templates dialog box (Figure 5.30), select V/G Overrides Worksets to modify 
the visibility settings in any view template. Refer to Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and 
Standards,” for more information on view templates.

190  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Closing Revit
Eventually, you will need to close your project and leave for lunch, attend a meeting, or go home 
for the day. Do not worry—the project will still be there tomorrow. But in the meantime, it is 
important to understand how to close the project correctly so you do not accidentally retain per-
mission over any elements. This situation—where a team member has accidentally left the office 
and not closed the project file or relinquished permissions—leaves the other team members 
without a way to edit elements for which the team member had permission or even request per-
mission. So that you are not the unfortunate victim of their wrath upon your return, make sure 
you close the application properly.
The most thorough way to close the file is to simply quit the application completely. You can 
do this by clicking the X at the upper right or choosing Exit Revit from the Application menu. 
You will be presented with a dialog box in which you can choose to Synchronize With Central, 
save your changes locally, or discard the changes (Figure 5.31). Obviously, the best choice is to use 
Synchronize With Central, allowing your changes to be published and any objects you own to be 
relinquished; however, you might be in the middle of a design study and not ready to share your 
changes. In that case, you may choose to save locally and retain ownership of certain elements. 
Just be aware that no one else on your team can edit elements you own until you relinquish them. 
Our recommendation is to always relinquish all elements at the end of your work session.
What if you were only reviewing the model and making some minor changes, and you do 
not want to save the changes? Close the file or application with any of the methods previously 
mentioned and select Do Not Save The Project from the Changes Not Saved dialog box. You 
will then be presented with another dialog box with two choices concerning borrowed elements 
(Figure 5.32). In the Close Project Without Saving dialog box, you can either relinquish any bor-
rowed elements and worksets or retain ownership of them. Clearly, the best choice is to relin-
quish all elements and worksets.

Managing Workflow with Worksets |  191  
Disabling Worksharing
In a few cases, you might decide that you have enabled worksharing too soon, or after enabling 
worksharing you would rather go back. Worksharing may be disabled as part of the Detach From 
Central functionality. This option can be found at the bottom of the Open dialog box. When you elect 
to detach a copy of the central file, you have the option to discard worksets, as shown in Figure 5.33.

192  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
If you choose to preserve worksets, the worksharing functionality remains in the file. This 
allows you to maintain any visibility configurations you have established that depend on 
worksets. Although this file retains the worksharing capability, it can no longer be synchro-
nized with the original central file because it will become a new central file as soon as you 
save it after detaching. This method can also create a file for review by a project manager or 
quality control reviewer without the fear of changing the model accidentally. If you elect to 
discard worksets, you will lose any visibility settings established from worksets. You will 
also need to create all new worksets from scratch if you decide to enable worksharing again 
in the future.
Understanding Element Ownership in Worksets
One of the fundamental concepts in a model enabled with worksharing is the ownership of 
elements. When you directly edit an element in a project, you automatically take ownership of 
that element—as long as no one else owns it. Determining whether you own an element is fairly 
easy. Simply select it. If you do not own it, you will see a worksharing icon, as shown on the 
selected element in Figure 5.34.
Figure 5.34
The worksharing icon 
on a selected element
By borrowing elements, team members can take ownership of only portions of a workset, 
leaving the remainder of the workset to be edited by someone else. Taking ownership of ele-
ments in this style creates a more “take what you need” approach to editing and usually results 
in less overlap between team members.
Besides automatically borrowing elements when they are edited, you can obtain ownership 
of an element or group of elements in a few other ways:
◆
◆
In the Worksets dialog box, you can make any workset editable. You then become the 
owner of the workset instead of borrowing elements within one.
◆
◆
Select any element or series of elements, and take ownership of them by clicking the work-
sharing icon.
◆
◆
You can right-click any element in the Project Browser under the Families node. In the con-
text menu that appears, you can take ownership of families, groups, or views.
◆
◆
You can right-click any element in a view and choose Make Elements Editable from the 
context menu (see Figure 5.35). You also have the ability to make editable the entire workset 
to which the selected object is assigned.

Understanding Element Ownership in Worksets |  193  
If you use any of these options, if the selected element is already owned by another team 
member, Revit will alert you and you will not be able to modify the element or make it editable.
Figure 5.35
Making an element 
editable using the 
context menu
Accidents Happen
As proficient as any team is, accidents may occur on a project, and elements will get modified or 
deleted unexpectedly. It is important to know how to recover your work when these accidents occur.
On one project a team developed, someone new to Revit software and new to the team was work-
ing on window details in a three-sided building. In the detailing process, the new team member 
accidentally deleted one of the walls in the project. By deleting the wall, this person also deleted the 
elevation, as well as all the wall sections associated with that wall, along with the details in plan 
and section. When the new team member deleted the element, he was not aware of the mistake and 
performed a Synchronize With Central, publishing all the deletions to the central file. Fortunately, 
the error was caught before everyone else performed a Synchronize With Central, and the team 
did not have to resort to restoring the model from the previous night’s backup. The team was able 
to use another member’s local file to create a new central file, thereby minimizing the loss of work. 
Once everyone on the team made a new local copy, he was able to get back to work.
Had the deleted elements been more isolated (like a conference room layout), recovery would have 
been much less invasive. In such a case, you simply create a group from all the elements you would 
like to save and then right-click the group in the Project Browser. You will have the option to save 
the group out of the file, which can then be inserted into a different project file and ungrouped again.
Understanding Editing Requests
When working in a worksharing project, you do not always have to take ownership of an entire 
workset in order to begin editing elements. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, it is pos-
sible to take ownership of individual model elements. This process is referred to as borrowing. 
Remember, there can be only one owner of a workset but multiple borrowers of elements within 
a workset.
If you need to work on elements that already belong to someone else, you will receive an 
alert that you cannot edit the elements until the other person relinquishes them, and you will be 
given the option to place an editing request.

194  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Understanding the editing request workflow is critical for multiuser teams; it allows users to 
transfer permission of objects without having to constantly save all their work to the central file 
and relinquish all worksets. Let us look at this interchange of permissions in more detail.
Simulating a Worksharing Environment
Practicing with a multiuser environment is not easy to describe in text, although it is possible to 
configure on your own computer. If you would like to work through the exercises in this section, 
you can launch the Revit application twice. Remember to change the worksharing username in the 
application options before you create a new local file each time. And of course, remember to restore 
your original username once you have completed the training exercises.
Placing an Editing Request
Imagine you are happily working away on your model in a worksharing environment and you 
try to edit an element that someone else owns. What do you do? When that situation occurs, you 
will be presented with a dialog box that allows you to request permission to edit the element 
from the other user (Figure 5.36).
Figure 5.36
Placing a request for 
permission
Figure 5.37
Editing Request Placed 
dialog box
Looking at the dialog box, you have two options:
◆
◆
You can click Cancel and not take possession of the element, and then focus your efforts on 
another part of the design.
◆
◆
You can click Place Request to ask your team member to relinquish possession over the ele-
ment in question. When you click Place Request, the dialog box shown in Figure 5.37 opens.

Understanding Element Ownership in Worksets |  195  
Once you have placed your request, you are in a bit of a holding pattern. You cannot continue 
to edit this element until the other user has granted you permission to edit it, and you cannot 
continue working on other portions of the project. This situation applies only if you are editing 
an element and you need to make an editing request related to that element. If you simply want 
to request permission to edit an element and not edit it right away, you could close the request 
confirmation box and continue working on other elements in your project.
The recipient of an editing request will see a pop-up notification appear at the bottom of the 
application, as shown in Figure 5.38. The notification gives the recipient instant information 
about the element in question and who made the request and provides buttons to grant or deny 
the request. It also provides a Show button that finds the element in a view so the recipient can 
determine the most appropriate response to the request.
Figure 5.38
Editing request 
notification
If you happen to miss or accidentally close the request notification, there is also a small 
visual indicator on the status bar at the bottom of your screen.
It indicates whether there are any outstanding requests (both to and from you). Clicking this 
icon opens the Editing Requests dialog box (Figure 5.39). Any requests indicated by an asterisk 
require you to Synchronize With Central before granting the editing request.
Figure 5.39
The Editing Requests 
dialog box

196  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Granting an Editing Request
Let’s now observe the other side of this scenario. If you are the recipient of an editing request 
and you are ready to grant it, one of two things will happen. If you have not changed the ele-
ment, you can simply click Grant and the permission for the element will be transferred to the 
requesting team member.
If you have modified the element or one that is dependent on or hosted by the element in 
question, you will be alerted that you will need to SWC before the request can be granted. The 
team member who placed the editing request will subsequently need to use the Reload Latest 
command or SWC to receive the recent changes, and then he or she can edit the most recent 
version of that element. Permission requests that require an SWC are flagged in the Editing 
Requests dialog box by an asterisk next to the request.
After your editing request has been granted, you will receive a notification similar to 
those shown in Figure 5.40. If the request did not require an SWC from the other team 
member (as indicated in the left image in Figure 5.40), you can continue the editing com-
mand that prompted the request. Otherwise, you will need to Reload Latest before you can 
continue the editing command. If you need to return to a view of the element or elements 
related to the editing request, you can click the Show button. Click the X to close the notifi-
cation box.
Getting Permission for Someone Else’s Objects
This situation may happen on one of your projects; someone leaves for a meeting or goes home 
without relinquishing permission of borrowed elements and worksets. This scenario would prevent 
other team members from editing any of the borrowed elements until that person returns to the 
office and synchronizes the changes with the central file. If that person cannot return to the office, 
there is a workaround for this problem. The workaround will result in the loss of the work by the 
missing team member, but it will clear up all the permissions issues.
If the immediate team needs outweigh the potential loss of the missing person’s work, follow 
these steps:
	1.	 Open a new session of Revit.
	2.	 Click the Application menu, select Options, and choose the General tab in the resulting dialog box.

Relinquishing Permission
It is not always necessary to wait for a request from another team member to relinquish permis-
sion over your elements. Fortunately, there is a tool to do just that. On the Synchronize panel of 
the Collaborate tab is a button called Relinquish All Mine (Figure 5.41). This feature returns the 
permissions for any elements you have not edited back to the central file so they are available to 
the rest of your team.
	3.	 Change the name listed in the Username field from your username to the person’s whose permis-
sions you are looking to release.
	4.	 Create a new local file of the project and open it. Now simply SWC, and all the person’s elements 
will be available to the team to edit. Then close the file.
	5.	 Before closing Revit, be sure to go back to the Application menu, click Options, and select the 
General tab so you can change the username back to your own.

Using the Worksharing Monitor
If you are an Autodesk® Subscription customer, you will have access to a useful extension 
application called Worksharing Monitor, shown in Figure 5.42. When you are working on 
a team project that is enabled for worksharing, this utility gives you real-time informa-
tion about the users participating in the project file. It also has a convenient resources 
monitor to keep you informed of your computer’s available RAM, virtual memory, and 
disk space.

198  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Collaborating in the Cloud
Eventually you will need to collaborate with other designers. Maybe this partnership—if it is 
with your structural engineer or MEP designer—will require the both of you to share models. 
Maybe you simply need to share your modeling work with people within your own office who 
are not Revit savvy enough to be able to negotiate their way through the software, and you are 
looking for an easy way for them to view and comment on what you have created. Fortunately, 
there is a way for you to not only share your model but also comment on models created by 
your team.
Autodesk has created a web-based resource to share and mark up Revit files. The site is A360 
Drive (360.autodesk.com). The site requires an A360 account, which you can register for on the 
website. Once signed up, you can sign in through Revit to take advantage of online applications 
like daylighting or cloud rendering (see Chapter 9, “Conceptual Design and Design Analysis“) 
or use the site as an online collaboration portal.
The site (Figure 5.43) allows you to upload and share models with collaborators. You can 
make models public or you can share them with only certain individuals.
Figure 5.43
Viewing models  
online with A360  
Drive
One of the great benefits of the site beyond just document management and sharing is the 
ability for non-Revit users to be able to navigate the model in a read-only format. Using the sam-
ple model we will work on throughout this book, a non-Revit user can navigate any of the views 
within the model (plans, elevations, 3D views, and so forth) as well as spin the model around in 
an interactive 3D format. Figure 5.44 shows a plan view and some of the additional model meta-
data that is stored on the site.
This is an easy way to share models and allow nonusers to make comments on preset 
views. The site works best with Google’s Chrome web browser and works on either a Mac 
or a PC.

A360 Collaboration for Revit
Although the A360 Drive website allows you to upload and download files as well as view Revit 
models, it does not provide an alternative to true collaboration with Revit worksharing. A new 
service called A360 Collaboration for Revit (C4R) allows teams to synchronize changes using 
Autodesk’s cloud services instead of a Revit Server Accelerator on your WAN.
A360 Collaboration for Revit is a paid service that can be purchased per registered user. You 
can learn more about the service at www.autodesk.com/products/collaboration-for-revit.
The Bottom Line
Understand key worksharing concepts.    Once the team has created local files, it is neces-
sary to understand how to keep both the local files and the central file up to date as changes 
occur on the project. Doing so ensures that everyone is working from an updated and recent 
copy of the model at all times.
Master It     Once you have begun working in your local file, how do you publish your 
changes to the central file? How do you download changes from the central file to your 
local file?
Enable worksharing on your project.    Knowing how to activate and use worksharing is 
indispensable to working in a team environment using Revit.
Master It    How do you transition a single-user Revit file to a multiuser environment 
using worksharing?

200  | Chapter 5  Working in a Team   
Organize worksets in your model.    There is no single rule for organizing worksets in your 
project models; however, they can be used to your team’s advantage. You can use worksets to 
better organize larger projects and for additional visibility control.
Master It    How do you assign objects to worksets? How do you change an object’s work-
set assignment?
Manage workflow with worksharing.    Once the central file has been created, you will need 
to organize and structure the model into logical worksets to maintain workflow with Revit.
Master It    How do worksets differ from layers in 2D CAD? What are some logical ways 
to create worksets within a model?
Understand element ownership in worksets.    Editing elements in a central file means you 
have sole ownership over further changes to those elements. Understanding the permissions 
is critical to working in a team.
Master It    How do you edit an element in the model if someone has already taken own-
ership of it in a worksharing environment?
Collaborate in the cloud.    Not all of your team members will be Revit-savvy and know 
how to use the tools. In addition, not everyone on the team will have a copy of Revit, but you 
might still need their input and comments on the design. Learning to leverage complemen-
tary tools to Revit is critical to keeping a project moving smoothly.
Master It    How do you use the cloud to get feedback from non-Revit users on a project 
team?

 Chapter  6 
 Working with Consultants   
 Whether you work on large or small projects—residential, commercial, or industrial building 
types—collaboration is an almost certain aspect of the workfl ow you will encounter when 
implementing BIM. This chapter discusses important considerations for interdisciplinary 
coordination as well as the tools within Autodesk ® Revit ® software to help you manage the 
process. This chapter covers aspects of collaboration solely utilizing the Revit platform, and 
Chapter  7 , “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” focuses on collaborating with other 
software programs. 
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
 
◆
 Prepare for interdisciplinary collaboration 
 
◆
 Collaborate using linked Revit models 
 
◆
 Use Copy/Monitor between linked models 
 
◆
 Run interference checks 
 preparing for Collaboration 
 Working alone in the Revit environment will deliver measurable increases in productivity, 
quality, and consistency; however, the true benefi t of building information modeling (BIM) 
is the ability to effectively collaborate between design disciplines, share model data with 
contractors, and deliver useful information to facility operators. 
 The difference between these working paradigms has been described as  lonely BIM versus 
social BIM . Lonely BIM can be thought of as the use of isolated BIM techniques for targeted tasks 
such as architectural design or structural analysis. Social BIM is the act of sharing model data 
between project stakeholders in order to enhance collaboration while developing a building 
design. The importance of increased effi ciency in collaboration is the underpinning for the goals 
set forth by organizations such as buildingSMART International ( www.buildingsmart.org ) or 
the UK’s BIM Task Group ( www.bimtaskgroup.org ). 
 The ability to support high-quality information exchanges necessitates the proper use of 
3D models and nongraphic data in a highly collaborative environment. Although we will be 
discussing collaboration solely within the Revit platform in this chapter, the buildingSMART 
Alliance and the National BIM Standard (NBIMS-US) stress the need for open interoperability 
between BIM applications. 
 Once a project team decides to participate in social BIM—either through desire or the require-
ments of a client—they must decide how to collaborate with BIM in a manner that is useful to all 
constituents throughout the project life cycle. Whether or not your client requires it, you should 
develop a BIM execution plan in order to set clear expectations related to the use of BIM. 

202  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
The buildingSMART Alliance (www.buildingsmartalliance.org), in an effort sponsored by the 
Charles Pankow Foundation, the Construction Industry Institute, the Penn State Office of Physical 
Plant, and the Partnership for Achieving Construction Excellence (PACE), has created a “BIM Project 
Execution Planning Guide” and template for a BIM execution plan. You can find this information at 
the Penn State Computer Integrated Construction (CIC) website: http://bim.psu.edu.
One of the most critical parts of a BIM execution plan is the definition of the project goals 
and uses of BIM to achieve the stated goals. If you are just beginning your implementation of 
Revit software, you may be using it to create 3D visualizations, or perhaps you are attempting to 
increase your drafting productivity. Defining clear and concise reasons for implementing BIM 
on each project will help you define where to concentrate your modeling efforts. According to 
the buildingSMART Alliance, “[A] current challenge and opportunity faced by the early project 
planning team is to identify the most appropriate uses for Building Information Modeling on 
a project given the project characteristics, participants’ goals and capabilities, and the desired 
risk allocations.” A listing of the common uses of BIM along with potential value opportuni-
ties and required resources is also available on the Penn State CIC website. For our European 
counterparts, you can find another list here: aecuk.wordpress.com/documents.
According to the American Institute of Architects’ “Integrated Project Delivery: A Guide,” 
a BIM execution plan “should define the scope of BIM implementation on the project, identify 
the process flow for BIM tasks, define the information exchanges between parties, and describe 
the required project and company infrastructure needed to support the implementation.” To 
be clear, the development of such a plan does not imply the application of integrated project 
delivery (IPD). IPD is “a project delivery approach that integrates people, systems, business 
structures and practices into a process that collaboratively harnesses the talents and insights 
of all participants to optimize project results, increase value to the owner, reduce waste, and 
maximize efficiency through all phases of design, fabrication, and construction.” For the 
purposes of this chapter, we will consider only the collaboration and coordination between 
members of a project design team, not the interactions with a client or contractor.

Managing the Coordination Process
The coordination process in a Revit environment begins with linking multiple files together 
to form a composite view of your building project. Even though smaller projects might be 
coordinated within a single Revit project file, most moderate to large projects will be designed 
by multiple disciplines or trades working in different offices. A project can be divided in many 
different ways to meet a variety of workflow requirements. Most often, each discipline will 
develop at least one separate Revit project file, and many of these project files will be linked into 
each other for reference. Because there are several workflow possibilities, this chapter will focus 
on the coordination among a traditional design team consisting of the following:
◆
◆
Architect
◆
◆
Structural engineer
◆
◆
Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers

Managing the Coordination Process |  203  
The workflow within a traditional design team is more complex than you might assume. If 
you were to graph the dependencies and coordination between these parties (Figure 6.1), you 
would see a web of primary relationships (architect to/from structure, architect to MEP) and 
secondary relationships (structure to/from mechanical and piping).
Figure 6.1
The relationships 
of interdisciplinary 
coordination

These relationships can be further parsed into physical and logical relationships. If we use 
mechanical and electrical as an example, you can see that a physical relationship means making 
sure a light fixture is not hitting the bottom of a duct, whereas a logical relationship means mak-
ing sure the electrical design properly accounts for the load of the heating coil in a variable air 
volume (VAV) box (being designed by the mechanical engineer).
It is the complexity of these possible workflow scenarios that makes this process prone to 
errors and illustrates the importance of proper coordination between the different disciplines of 
a design team. So, what are the tools that can be used for collaboration between Revit products? 
Three distinct tools are typically used in a collaboration scenario:
Linked Models    Linking models together using the Link Revit tool provides full visual 
fidelity of the referenced content, showing the complete context of the other disciplines’ data, 
fostering a complete understanding of their geometry. The data can also be controlled and 
shown in any manner appropriate to the use. You can turn it on or off, half-tone the data, 
or enhance it with color or line pattern overrides. Linking also provides support for the 
Interference Check, Copy/Monitor, and Coordination Review tools.
Copy/Monitor    Copy/Monitor is a powerful tool available in all products built on the 
Revit platform and is considered the most intelligent of the coordination tools. It offers 
several benefits. It lets you link Revit files from other team members (structural engineers 
or MEP engineers) and copy key elements from their model into yours. Once that link is 
created, you can monitor that relationship and know if the element has moved or changed 

204  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
when you receive updated models from your team members. A basic example of using 
this tool would be copying the structural grid into your architectural file. If the grid 
moves or changes with subsequent updated models, you will be instantly alerted to  
the change.
Interference Check    In many cases, the only workflow requirement is to verify that 
items from another discipline are not interfering with your items. The Interference 
Check tool can be used to check between categories within a single model or between 
linked models.
Indiana University BIM Requirements
In 2009, the University Architect’s Office at Indiana University (www.iu.edu) announced that it 
would require the use of BIM on all projects with a capital value of over $5 million. Accompanying 
the announcement was the release of the IU BIM Standards and Project Delivery Requirements, 
which included a BIM execution plan template and IPD template—developed under the guidance 
of Autodesk and SHP Leading Design (www.shp.com). Although the university’s BIM requirements 
may seem new, the desire to ensure the maximum reuse of information has been evolving at IU for 
several years, beginning with its implementation of integrated GIS tools for campus and facility 
management in 1996.
One important excerpt from these requirements focuses on the organization of the interference 
checking (aka clash detection) process. Within the IU BIM Standards & Guidelines for Architects, 
Engineers, & Contractors, rules have been established for classifying clashes between modeled 
elements. Level One clashes are considered critical and include ductwork and piping clashing with 
ceilings, rated walls, or structure; equipment clearances interfering with structure are included in 
Level One as well. Level Two clashes are less critical but include casework clashing with electrical 
fixtures and structure vs. specialty equipment. Finally, Level Three clashes are still important but 
are a lower priority. These include casework clashing with walls and plumbing interfering with 
mechanical equipment.
These requirements may be defined differently by other clients, but it is critical to understand the 
importance of using interference-checking tools for logical groups of model elements. Checking 
for clashes throughout an entire model will yield a plethora of unusable data and will limit the 
effectiveness of model-based coordination.
For more information, visit the IU BIM site at www.indiana.edu/~uao/iubim.html.
Given the range of available Revit tools for collaboration, they are not necessarily 
applicable to all interdisciplinary relationships. As shown in Figure 6.2, only the most 
appropriate tools should be applied to each collaborative situation. These situations are 
merely suggestions based on the experience of the authors. The needs for your collaborative 
workflows may vary.

Managing the Coordination Process |  205  
Architect to Structural Engineer    The relationship between the architect and the structural 
engineer is becoming closer as we strive for lighter structures and more innovative design. 
In many respects, structural engineers may be affecting the building aesthetic as much 
as the architects. Thus, this workflow may be considered the most crucial and should be 
bidirectional.
Architect to Structural Engineer: Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review    By using 
Copy/Monitor, structural engineers are able to create a strong, intelligent link between 
the structural and architectural models. In doing so, they can easily track the changes 
in the architect’s model that will affect the structural design. They are also able to create 
geometry in their model using these tools, which can be directly or indirectly related to 
architectural elements such as walls and floors.
Remember that coordination of relationships for datum (grids and/or levels) should be 
established at the beginning of a project. For example, does the architect “own” the levels 
and the grids—or will the structural engineer? Conflicts due to a lack of proper planning 
will negatively impact the effective use of the Copy/Monitor tools on your projects.
Structural Engineer to Architect: Interference Check    The architect’s primary require-
ment for the structural model is to include the structure in context and to know if the 
structure is interfering with any architectural elements. For this workflow, it is recom-
mended that the architect link in the structural model and use interference checking. The 
rules governing what clashes are considered critical may be established by a client’s BIM 
standards and protocols.
Architect to MEP Engineer    The relationship between architecture and MEP is not quite as 
dynamic as that between architecture and structure but represents specific opportunities to 
benefit from collaboration.
Architect to MEP Engineer: Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review    The MEP 
engineer needs to link in the architect’s model to have the architectural model for context

and positional relationships for ceiling-based items and the avoidance of clashes. Copy/
Monitor is used to copy and monitor the architect’s levels and rooms. These room objects 
take on the additional properties, such as light levels and airflow. Levels are required to 
copy or monitor the rooms.
MEP Engineer to Architect: Linked Models    The architect’s primary benefit from 
linking in the MEP model(s) is the ability to reference this geometry within the context of 
the architectural model and drawings. There is usually no compelling reason to use the 
Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review tools from the MEP on the architectural project, 
although interference checking may be required under certain circumstances.
Structural Engineer to MEP Engineer    This relationship is almost always best served by 
cross-linked models using interference checking. The most important aspect of collaboration 
between these disciplines is the early detection and correction of clashes.
Using Linked Models in Revit
The first rule governing all Revit-to-Revit coordination situations is that all linked project 
files must be generated with the same Revit platform version, such as Autodesk Revit 2017. 
In a worksharing environment with other disciplines, it is important to ensure that the com-
puters of all team members working on a project have the same Revit build installed. As 
discussed previously in this chapter, a BIM execution plan should include an agreement on 
all modeling and coordination software to be used on a project, including the version of each 
listed program.
You can find the build information for your Revit product by clicking the Help drop-down 
button in the InfoCenter and selecting About Autodesk Revit 2017 (Figure 6.3). The build

Shared Positioning
In the collaborative process of sharing information via linked models, the coordinated 
positioning of each model is of paramount importance. To ensure accuracy, every project’s 
BIM execution plan must include agreement on a common coordinate system and origin. This 
section will help you develop a fundamental understanding of the coordinate systems within 
Revit so you can configure and manage them in your projects.
We will begin our description with a simple statement: There are two coordinate systems in a 
Revit project, project internal and shared. Each system has essential features and limitations.
Project Internal    Every Revit project has an internal coordinate system referred to in several 
places as project internal. The origin of this coordinate system is at first marked by a project 
base point; however, this reference point can be moved away from the internal origin. We 
discuss the project base point in greater detail later in this chapter.
The project internal coordinate system cannot be changed, and your model should be 
constructed within a one-mile radius of the internal origin. The true origin in Revit is referred 
to as the Project Start Up Point, and the project base point can be reset to this point by setting 
it to Unclipped, right-clicking the icon, and selecting Move To Startup Location.
A complementary component of the project internal coordinate system is the view orientation 
of Project North. This setting is the default and can be found in the View Properties of any 
plan. We strongly recommend that your model be created in an orthogonal relationship to 
the project or as you expect the plans to be oriented on a typical sheet. Your project’s actual 
relation to true north will be established via shared coordinates.
Shared Coordinates    In simple terms, shared coordinates are just a way for the project 
team to use the same work point. In other words, the shared coordinate system consists of 
a single origin and true north orientation that can be synchronized between models and 
even Autodesk® AutoCAD® drawings. In the diagram shown in Figure 6.4, you can see an 
architectural model and structural model linked together. Each model was created using a 
different project internal origin (not the recommended method), but their shared coordinates 
were synchronized.

Acquiring or Publishing Coordinates
When you attempt to synchronize shared coordinates between linked projects, there are two 
tools to achieve this: Acquire Coordinates and Publish Coordinates. A simple way to under-
stand the difference between these tools is to think of them in terms of pulling versus pushing:
◆
◆
Acquire = pull
◆
◆
Publish = push
It is important to understand the situations in which you would pull or push coordinates 
between linked files. A typical workflow for establishing a synchronized, shared coordinate 
system on a single building project is as follows:
	
1.	 A site model is generated in which the survey point (SP) in the Revit project is coordinated 
with geodetic survey markers or station lines. The site model is linked into the architectural 
Revit model. This file can be placed manually and then moved and rotated into a position 
relative to the building. Do not move or rotate your building to the linked site model!
	
2.	 From the Manage tab, select Coordinates ➢ Acquire Coordinates. Pick the linked file 
and the origin of the shared coordinate system, and the angle of true north in your Revit 
model will be synchronized with those in the linked file.
	
3.	 All engineers or consultants using Revit should obtain a copy of the site model and repeat 
steps 1 and 2. When linking other project models that have already been synchronized 
with the site model, they can be placed using the Auto–By Shared Coordinates option.
Limitations on Using Shared Coordinates for Exporting
Although you can use either Project Internal or Shared as the setting for Coordinate System Basis 
when exporting CAD formats, there are some limitations. If you are exporting sheet views, the plan 
data will always use the project internal coordinate system. Using the Export Views On Sheets And 
Links As External References option during export does not change this limitation. We recommend 
using plan views—not sheets—for issuing 2D CAD backgrounds to project participants who are 
not using Revit. Refer to Chapter 7 for more detailed information on exporting.
Acquiring Coordinates from a CAD File
A common scenario in a project workflow begins with the architect beginning a design model and 
receiving a 2D survey file in DWG format from a civil engineer. The survey is drawn in coordinates 
that are geospatially correct but may not be orthogonal to true north. The architect should cre-
ate the model close to the internal project origin; however, the architect will need to ensure that 
the building and survey coordinates are synchronized for properly oriented CAD exports and for 
coordination with additional linked Revit models from engineers in later phases of the project.

Using Linked Models in Revit |  209  
For a campus-style project in which you might be creating multiple instances of a linked 
building model, you would most likely use Publish Coordinates to push information from 
a site model into the linked building model. Here is how that would work in a hypothetical 
scenario:
	
1.	 Assuming a site model and building model were created in Revit, you would begin by 
opening the site model and linking the building model into the site.
	
2.	 Adjust the position of the first instance of the linked building model to location A.
	
3.	 From the Manage tab, select Coordinates from the Project Location panel, and then click 
Publish Coordinates. Pick the linked building model.
	
4.	 The Location Weather And Site dialog box will open, and you will create a duplicate 
location named Location A.
	
5.	 Copy the linked building model as required for each subsequent location. Repeat steps 
2 through 4 for each copy. As shown in Figure 6.5, there are three locations (Location A, 
Location B, and Location C) that represent each instance of the linked project model.
	
6.	 When you close the site model and open the building model, you can link the site 
model to the building using any of the named location references you pushed into the 
building model.
The architect will link the 2D CAD file into the Revit model but will first manually place it—moving 
and rotating the CAD file to be in proper alignment with the building model. Once the link is in 
place and constrained (or locked), the architect will acquire the coordinates from the DWG survey 
by switching to the Manage tab, selecting Coordinates ➢ Acquire Coordinates from the Project 
Location panel, and then clicking the DWG link. This will not affect any views that are oriented to 
project north—only those set to true north will display the orientation established by the coordi-
nates acquired from the survey file.

locations for a single 
linked model

Using Project Base Point and Survey Point
Revit provides two graphic objects to identify the project base point and the survey point. In the 
default templates, these points are visible in the floor plan named Site; however, they can also be 
displayed in any other plan view by opening the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, selecting 
the Model Categories tab, and expanding the Site category, as shown in Figure 6.6. You can also use 
the Reveal Hidden Elements command in the view control bar to temporarily display these points.
Figure 6.6
The Project Base Point 
and Survey Point 
settings are found 
under Site in Visibility/
Graphic Overrides.
Project Base Point    The project base point (PBP) is a reference point that is usually located 
at the origin of the internal project origin. The PBP is used to define a common reference for 
project-specific annotation such as spot coordinates. The PBP cannot be used for exporting your 
project to CAD or Navisworks® formats. The only choices you have for exporting are Internal or 
Shared. Remember, the internal project coordinates cannot be modified, but you can move the 
PBP. Let us review what the paper clip icon means when you need to relocate the base point.
The unclipped PBP can be moved in relation to the internal origin, thus creating a secondary 
reference point for spot coordinates, spot elevations, and levels—as long as the measuring 
parameter (either Coordinate Origin or Elevation Base) is set to Project Base Point in the respec-
tive type properties of such annotation elements. Moving the clipped PBP icon is the equivalent 
of using the Relocate Project tool, moving the project relative to the shared coordinates system.
Unless your project requires the use of a secondary point of reference other than the survey 
point, we recommend that you do not adjust the PBP and that you make sure your building 
model lies within a close reference of this point, such as the corner of a property line or inter-
section of column grids A and 1.
Survey Point    The survey point (SP) is the equivalent of a station pin or geodetic survey 
marker in a civil engineering drawing (Figure 6.7). This is the point that will be coordinated 
to real geospatial coordinates. For coordination with Autodesk® Civil 3D® software, the SP is 
used when a Revit project is exported to the ADSK file format.
Figure 6.7
The survey point can 
be considered similar 
to a real-world geodetic 
survey marker.

Using Linked Models in Revit |  211  
Specifying a particular location for the SP based on civil engineering data is not a require-
ment. For smaller projects, the SP and shared coordinates may never be used at all; however, 
they are critical in the use of analytical tools for daylighting and solar analysis.
To further expand your understanding of these points and what happens when they are 
modified, we created a sample file for your reference. Open the file c06-Shared-Points.rvt 
from this book’s web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017). In this file you will find 
three copies of the Level 1 floor plan. One view is configured to display the project coordinates, 
another view displays the shared coordinates, and the third view displays a combination of the 
two. There are also two types of spot coordinates: one indicating project coordinates in which the 
values are prefixed with the letter p and the other indicating shared coordinates with the prefix 
of s. You can open these three floor plans and tile the windows (click the View tab, select the 
Window panel, and choose Tile, or type the keyboard shortcut WT) to get a better sense of how 
these points affect one another (Figure 6.8).
Figure 6.8
Using tiled windows 
helps you examine the 
effect of project and 
shared coordinates.
In this sample file, you can explore the effects on your model’s coordinates of moving the 
project base point and survey point. When selected, the project base point and survey point 
have paperclip icons that determine the behavior of the points when you move them. Clicking 
the paperclip icon changes the state from clipped to unclipped and back to clipped.
The following list shows the possible point modifications and how they affect the project. In 
most cases you should not have to move the project base point or survey point if you are using a 
linked Civil 2D or 3D file and acquiring the coordinates from the linked file.
◆
◆
Project Base Point: Clipped
◆
◆
Move the PBP.
◆
◆
PBP coordinates change relative to the survey point.
◆
◆
Project-based spot coordinates do not change.
◆
◆
Model elements “move” relative to shared coordinates.

212  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
Moving a clipped PBP is the same as using Relocate Project—that is, the model elements 
maintain their relationship to the PBP, but the relationship of the PBP to the survey point is 
changed.
◆
◆
Project Base Point: Unclipped
◆
◆
Move the PBP.
◆
◆
PBP coordinates change relative to the survey point.
◆
◆
Project-based spot coordinates change.
◆
◆
Model elements do not move.
Unclipping the PBP essentially detaches it from the internal project origin. Moving the 
unclipped PBP is only used to affect the values reported in spot coordinates set to the project 
origin base. It does not have any effect on exported files.
◆
◆
Survey Point: Clipped
◆
◆
Move the SP (survey point).
◆
◆
SP coordinates do not change.
◆
◆
Shared spot coordinates change.
◆
◆
Model elements do not move.
The clipped SP represents the origin of the shared coordinate system. Moving it is the equiv-
alent of setting a new origin point. Use caution if you must move the shared coordinates 
origin if linked models already exist in which the shared coordinates have already been 
synchronized. In such a case, each linked model must be opened and manually reconciled 
with the model in which the origin has changed.
◆
◆
Survey Point: Unclipped
◆
◆
Move the SP.
◆
◆
SP coordinates change.
◆
◆
Shared spot coordinates do not change.
◆
◆
Model elements do not move.
Moving an unclipped SP essentially does not do anything. It does not affect spot coordinates, 
and it does not affect the origin of exported files.
Use Pinning to Protect Coordinate Origins
An excellent way to prevent accidental modification of your project’s coordinate systems is to pin 
them. To do so, you must first make sure the survey point and project base point are visible in a 
view (as we discussed previously in this section). Next, select each point and click the Pin button on 
the Modify panel when the Modify | Project Base Point or Modify | Survey Point ribbon appears.

Using Linked Models in Revit |  213  
Comparing Attachment to Overlay
Linked Revit models use what we will call a portability setting that is similar to the way Xrefs 
are handled in AutoCAD. Although this setting is not exposed when you initially link a Revit 
model, you can modify the setting by switching to the Insert tab and selecting Manage Links. 
Change the setting in the Reference Type column as desired (Figure 6.9).
Figure 6.9
Determining the 
reference type of 
linked Revit models
◆
◆
Attachment: The Attachment option ensures that the linked model will be included if the 
host model is subsequently linked into other hosts. For example, if Project A is linked into 
Project B as an attachment, when Project B is linked into Project C, Project A will automati-
cally be included as well.
◆
◆
Overlay: The Overlay option prevents linked models from being included if the host 
model is subsequently linked into other hosts. For example, if Project A is linked into 
Project B as an overlay, when Project B is linked into Project C, Project A will not be 
included. When you initially link a model that contains other linked models with the 
Overlay option, you will be notified that those links will be invisible (Figure 6.10).

models using the 
Overlay setting

214  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
Linking with Worksharing Files
If you are using linked Revit models where one or more of the project files have worksharing 
enabled, there are a few guidelines to follow as well as some tangible benefits, such as linked 
visibility control between worksets. Be sure to read more about worksharing in Chapter 5, 
“Working in a Team,” before continuing with this section.
When you are linking worksharing-enabled files from consultants, you will first need to 
decide if you need to maintain the worksets in the linked files. Even though you may not have 
direct access to your consultants’ servers, the software will attempt to reconcile the location of 
each project model’s central file location. We recommend handling each received project file 
using one of the following options:
◆
◆
Open the project using the Detach From Central option, choose Preserve Worksets, and 
then save the project as a new central file on your server. Refer to Chapter 5 for specific 
instructions on this process.
◆
◆
Open the project using the Detach From Central option, choose Discard Worksets, and 
then save the file.
If your team decides to disable worksets in linked files received from consultants, you will 
avoid any problems related to the central file not being found; however, you will not be able 
to extend workset visibility settings into the linked files or use worksets to selectively load 
content from the linked model into your host project. If you preserve worksets, you can continue 
to use worksets in the linked model to your advantage. For example, when you first link a 
worksharing-enabled model into your project, you can use the Specify option associated with 
the Open button in the Import/Link RVT dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.11.
Figure 6.11
Use the Specify  
option to close 
worksets when  
linking.

Using Linked Models in Revit |  215  
At any time throughout the development of the project, you can adjust the loaded worksets 
from linked files very easily. From the Manage tab or the Insert tab in the ribbon, click the 
Manage Links button. In the Manage Links dialog box (Figure 6.12), select one of the linked 
RVT files, and if it is a worksharing-enabled file, click the Manage Worksets button to open the 
Worksets dialog box. We describe this process in greater detail in the next section of this chapter.
Figure 6.12
Access worksets of 
linked files from 
Manage Links.
In addition to the workset-loading control, you can apply visibility settings automatically to 
linked models—as long as the worksets in any linked files are named exactly as they are in the 
host file. For example, if you linked a model that had the default workset named Shared Levels 
and Grids, and your host model also had that same workset, you can hide the workset in both 
the host and linked model in one step. Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, select 
the Worksets tab, and then set Shared Levels and Grids to Hide. You will see that any datum 
objects assigned to that workset—in either the host or linked model—are hidden. You do not 
need to perform a separate visibility override on the linked file.
Although the automated visibility linking of worksets can be beneficial, it can also be prob-
lematic when you need to coordinate content between the host and linked models. In the same 
scenario described previously, what if you wanted the Shared Levels and Grids workset to be 
visible in the host model but hidden in the linked model? This is common when you are coordi-
nating datum objects between architectural and engineering models. The grids and levels from 
a linked model should be visible for use with the Coordination Monitor tools described in this 
chapter, but then the linked references might need to be hidden. In this case, you might choose 
to access the Manage Worksets button discussed earlier and close the Shared Levels and Grids 

216  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
workset in the linked file. You could also adjust the linked view; however, this would require 
you to adjust every view in which the linked model appears. We discuss linked views in greater 
detail in Chapter 17, “Documenting Your Design.”
Using Worksets to Organize Linked Models
As we discussed in Chapter 5, we recommend that you create and reserve a workset for each 
linked Revit model, such as Link-RVT-Structure or Link-RVT-HVAC. This simple step will allow 
your team members to choose whether they would like any, all, or none of the linked models to 
be loaded when working on a host model. To enable this functionality, use the Specify setting in 
the drop-down options next to the Open button.
When the Worksets dialog box appears, select the worksets reserved for the linked models 
and set their Open/Closed status as you desire. The benefit of using worksets to manage linked 
Revit models is the flexibility it offers a project team. When a team member closes a workset 
containing a linked model, the linked model is unloaded only for that person—it does not 
unload for the entire team.
Expanding Workset Properties for Linked Models
Additional flexibility can be leveraged with the Workset parameter in both the instance and 
type properties of a linked model. In a large and complex project that consists of multiple build-
ing elements where some of the elements are identical, each may consist of multiple linked 
models: architecture, structure, and MEP. Figure 6.13 shows a simplified representation of such 
a design where the Podium has one set of models and Tower A and Annex are identical to one 
another, as are Tower B and the Penthouse.
Figure 6.13
Schematic represen-
tation of a complex 
project assembled with 
multiple linked models
Annex: Arch 2,
Struct 2, MEP 2
Tower A: Arch 2,
Struct 2, MEP 2
Penthouse: Arch 3,
Struct 3, MEP 3
Tower B: Arch 3,
Struct 3, MEP 3
Podium: Arch 1, Struct 1, MEP 1
In Figure 6.13, there are three Revit models that represent the podium and the two towers  
(A and B) for each discipline (Arch1, Arch2, and so on). There are multiple instances of several of 
the linked models. For each instance of a linked model, you can specify the Workset parameter 
so that the workset instance property represents the building element, and the type property 
reflects either the entire discipline or one of the discipline models, as in this example:
◆
◆
Instance workset: Tower A
◆
◆
Type workset: Link-Architecture1 or simply Link-Architecture

Using Linked Models in Revit |  217  
Using this example, you can choose to open the Tower A workset, which would load 
all the discipline models but only for Tower A, or you could choose to open the Link-
Architecture workset, which would load only the architectural models but for all the 
building elements. You can modify the workset-type properties only after placing a linked 
model in your project. Access this setting by selecting an instance of a linked model and 
opening the Properties palette, and then click Edit Type. Although this functionality can 
offer a variety of benefits to your project team, it should be used with care and proper 
planning because it can adversely affect model visibility if you are using worksets for 
visibility manipulation.
Worksharing-enabled linked models also afford you the flexibility to adjust the visibility of 
project elements for the entire project, without relying on individual settings per view or main-
tenance of view templates. For example, grids and levels are not usually displayed from linked 
models because their extents are not editable in the host model and the graphics may not match 
those in the host model. Without worksets, the owner of the host model would have to establish 
visibility settings for the linked model within all views and hopefully manage those settings in 
view templates. Assuming the owner of the linked model maintains the levels and grids on an 
agreed-upon workset such as Shared Levels and Grids, you will be able to close that workset in 
one place, thus affecting the entire host project. To modify the workset options for linked Revit 
models, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Manage Links dialog box and switch to the Revit tab.
	
2.	 Select one of the linked files and click the Manage Worksets button.
	
3.	 In the Manage Worksets for Link dialog box, select the worksets you would like to close, 
click the Close button, and then click Reload.
	
4.	 Click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
Relative Paths of Linked Models
If your team is working in a situation where your project file(s) is regularly transferred between 
multiple locations throughout the design process, you may find it difficult to maintain linked files 
(they are unloaded when the file is returned), even if you are using relative paths. To alleviate this 
problem, try keeping the linked models and CAD files within subdirectories of the central file. 
For example, if your central file is saved in W:\Architecture\BIM, try keeping linked CAD files in 
W:\Architecture\BIM\Links-CAD and linked Revit models from consultants in W:\Architecture\
BIM\Links-RVT.
Summarizing the Benefits and Limitations of Linked Models
Let us review some of the benefits and limitations of using linked Revit models. You should 
carefully consider these aspects not only when preparing for interdisciplinary coordination but 
also when managing large, complex projects with linked files.

218  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
The following list highlights some of the benefits and limitations:
◆
◆
Tagging Elements in Linked Files: Most model elements from a linked model can be 
tagged in a host model. Linked views can also be used if the annotation exists in the linked 
model and needs to be displayed in the host.
◆
◆
Scheduling Elements in Linked Files: In the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog 
box, check the option Include Elements In Links.
◆
◆
Copying/Pasting Elements from Linked Files: In a host model, use the Tab key to select 
any individual element within a linked file, and you can use standard copy-and-paste 
techniques to create a copy of the element in the host model.
◆
◆
Hiding Elements in Linked Files: In addition to having full control of a linked model’s 
visual fidelity through object styles, you can use the Tab key to select an individual element 
in a linked file and use the Hide In View commands as you would on any element within 
the host model.
The following list highlights some of the limitations:
◆
◆
Joining Walls: Walls cannot be joined between linked Revit models. Consider alternative 
graphic techniques such as using coarse-scale black solid fill to mask unjoined walls.
◆
◆
Opening Linked Models: You cannot have a host model with loaded linked models open 
in the same Revit session as the linked model files. Either separate Revit sessions must be 
launched or the host file must be closed before opening a linked model. If you choose not to 
follow either of these options and open the link in your current session, the linked model 
will be unloaded and need to be reloaded after the edits are made.
Using Linked Models—Exercises
Before you begin the exercises in this chapter, download the related files from this book’s web 
page. The project files in each section’s exercise should be saved because the lessons will build 
on the data. In this first exercise, you will do the following:
◆
◆
Link the architectural model to a structural project.
◆
◆
Establish shared coordinates.
The structural model is essentially a blank project with a few element types specifically built 
for this chapter’s lessons. Let us get started working with shared coordinates:
	
1.	 Open the sample project file c06-1-Structure.rvt or c06-1-Structure-Metric.rvt 
and activate the Level 1 floor plan.
	
2.	 Switch to the Insert tab and select Link Revit.
On the Revit tab of the Manage Links dialog box, click the Add button to add a new 
linked model. To make the steps easier to follow, the rest of this chapter will use the Link 
Revit button on the Insert tab, but both buttons will give you the same result.

Using Linked Models in Revit |  219  
	
3.	 Navigate to the file c06-2-Architecture.rvt or c06-2-Architecture-Metric.rvt.
	
4.	 Set the Positioning option to Auto – Center To Center and click Open.
	
5.	 Activate the South elevation view and use the Align tool to bring the linked model’s 
Level 1 down to align with Level 1 in the host model if necessary.
Remember, linked models should be aligned to the geometry in the host model. The mod-
eled elements in the host model should be as close to the internal project origin as possible.
	
6.	 Switch to the Manage tab, and from the Project Location panel, select Coordinates ➢ 
Acquire Coordinates. Pick the linked model.
The elevation value displayed in the level within the host file has changed to match the 
shared elevation in the linked file. This is because the Elevation Base parameter of the 
level’s type properties has been set to Survey Point.
	
7.	 Save the project file for subsequent exercises in this chapter.
Modifying Element Visibility in Linked Files
Once you have linked one or more Revit files into your source project file, you may want to 
adjust the visibility of elements within the linked files. By default, the display settings in the 
Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box are set to By Host View for linked files, which means 
model objects in the linked files will adopt the same appearance as the host file. In the follow-
ing exercise, we will show you how to customize these settings to turn the furniture off in the 
linked file and then display the room tags:
	
1.	 Continue this exercise with the structural model that you saved with the linked architec-
tural model.
	
2.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan from the Project Browser.
	
3.	 Go to the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Graphics panel, and select Visibility/Graphics. 
In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, select the Revit Links tab.
You will see the linked architectural model listed as an expandable tree. Click the plus 
sign next to the name of the linked file, and you will see a numbered instance of the link. 
This allows you to customize the visibility for each instance of a linked file if you have 
multiple copies of the link in the host file.
	
4.	 In the row displaying the name of the linked file, click the button in the Display Settings 
column that is labeled By Host View.
Doing so opens the RVT Link Display Settings dialog box.
	
5.	 To begin customizing the display of elements in the linked file, you must first choose the 
Custom option in the Basics tab, as shown in Figure 6.14. This enables all the options in 
each tab of the RVT Link Display Settings dialog box.

220  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
	
6.	 Select the Model Categories tab and choose <Custom> in the drop-down list at the top of 
the dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.15.

display settings for a

Using the Coordination Tools |  221  
	
7.	 Clear the check marks from the following categories: Casework, Furniture, and 
Furniture Systems.
	
8.	 Click OK to close all open dialog boxes.
You should observe that all the furniture and casework from the linked architecture 
file are no longer visible in the Level 1 floor plan. In a standard architecture-to-structure 
collaboration scenario, the structural engineer is likely to have a view template in which 
typical architectural elements are already hidden. In such a case, the default By Host View 
settings would be sufficient. The previous exercise illustrates a scenario where additional 
visual control is required.
Using Linked Views
Whereas the previous exercise focused on the display of model elements, a slightly different 
approach is required to use annotation elements from a linked file. In the following exercise, we 
will show you how to display the room tags from the linked architectural model. Many other 
tags can be applied to linked model elements. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Continue with the structural model saved from the previous exercise and make sure you 
have activated the Level 1 floor plan.
	
2.	 Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and select the Revit Links tab.
	
3.	 The button in the Display Settings column should be labeled as Custom based on the 
previous exercise. Click the Custom button to open the RVT Link Display Settings 
dialog box.
	
4.	 Select the Basics tab and click the Linked View drop-down box. You will see the floor 
plans available for reference in the linked file. Only view types similar to the current 
view in the host file will be available for use as a linked view.
	
5.	 Select the linked view named Level 1-A-Anno.
	
6.	 Click OK to close all open dialog boxes.
After completing these steps, you should see the room tags from the linked architectural file 
in the host file. Remember that you can tag other model elements in linked files. Try using the 
Tag By Category tool to place some door tags on the linked architectural model.
Using the Coordination Tools
Once you have established the configuration of linked Revit models for your project, the 
next step is to create intelligently bound references between specific elements within the 
models. In the past, CAD users might have referenced files containing grid lines or level 
lines to establish a level of coordination between one user’s data and another’s. These 
elements in CAD are merely lines—not datum objects as they are in a Revit model. If these 
referenced elements were modified in a CAD setting, the graphic appearance of the ref-
erenced lines would update, but there would be no additional automated response to the 
geometry. It would be the responsibility of the recipient to update any referring geometry 
in their host files.

222  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
The coordination tools in Revit—Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review—allow a project 
team to ensure a high degree of quality control while achieving it at an increased level of pro-
ductivity. These tools can function on datum (levels and grids) as well as model elements such 
as columns, walls, floors, and fixtures. The Copy/Monitor command is used first to establish the 
intelligent bonds between linked elements and host elements, whereas the Coordination Review 
command automatically monitors differences between host and linked elements that were 
previously bound with the Copy/Monitor command.
Although these tools are indeed powerful and have no similarities to CAD workflows of 
the past, it is important to employ proper planning and coordination with your design team. 
The familiar adage of “quality over quantity” holds true for the implementation of coordina-
tion tools. It may not be necessary to create monitored copies of all structural elements within 
the architectural model. How would these affect project-wide quantity takeoffs for the sake of 
minor improvements in graphic quality?
We reiterate the necessity of developing a BIM execution plan to determine important aspects 
of the collaboration process. When using specific coordination tools such as those in Revit, 
teams might plan on issues such as these:
◆
◆
Who is the “owner” of grids and levels?
◆
◆
Who is the “owner” of floor slabs?
◆
◆
Are structural walls copied, monitored, or just linked?
◆
◆
How often are models exchanged?
◆
◆
How are coordination conflicts resolved?
A seemingly powerful BIM tool will not replace the need for professional supervision and 
the standard of care implicit to respective disciplines in the building industry. Thus, there is no 
substitution for the most important part of effective collaboration: communication. Without open 
and honest communication, the coordination tools will discover conflicts, but the results may be 
ignored, dismissed, or overwritten, to the detriment of the team’s progress.
Using the Copy/Monitor Command
The Copy/Monitor command allows you to create copies of linked elements for better graphic 
control of the elements while maintaining an intelligent bond to the linked elements. If the 
linked element changes in a subsequent iteration of the project file, the changes are detected in 
the Coordination Review tool, which we will discuss next.
With the structural model saved from the “Using Linked Models” exercises, switch to the 
Collaborate tab and select Copy/Monitor ➢ Select Link. Pick the linked architectural model, and 
the ribbon will change to Copy/Monitor mode. Click the Options icon to open the dialog box 
shown in Figure 6.16.

Using the Coordination Tools |  223  
Figure 6.16
Element tabs available 
for Copy/Monitor in 
Revit Architecture
As shown in Figure 6.16, the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box in Revit is divided into five 
tabs representing the elements available to be copied and/or monitored. For each element tab, 
there is a list called Categories And Types To Copy. As shown in Figure 6.17, the Floors tab 
lists the available floor types in the linked model in the left column and host model floor types 
in the right column. Notice that any of the linked types can be specified with the option Don’t 
Copy This Type. This feature can be used for quality control if your project’s BIM execution 
plan states that certain elements are not to be copied. For example, if walls are not to be 
copied, switch to the Walls tab and set all linked wall types to Don’t Copy This Type. You can 
also use the option Copy Original Type if the element type exists in the linked file but not in 
the host file. After one or more of these elements are selected using Copy/Monitor, the type 
mapping will be synchronized.

224  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
Figure 6.17
The Copy/Monitor 
Options dialog box 
allows customiza-
tion for intelligent 
collaboration.
At the bottom of the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box, you will find a section called 
Additional Copy Parameters for each element tab (refer to Figures 6.16 and 6.17). The additional 
parameters are different for each element category. For example, when levels are copied and 
monitored, an offset and naming prefix can be applied to accommodate the difference between 
the finish floor level in a linked architectural model and the top-of-steel level in the host 
structural model.
Let’s take a closer look at each of the element category options available for the Copy/Monitor tool:
Levels    In most cases, the difference between the location of a structural level and an archi-
tectural level may lead to the presumption that you would not want to copy levels between 
files. However, maintaining an offset between linked and host levels can be quite desirable. 
Keep in mind that the offset will apply to all copy/monitor selections. Thus, if a structural 
level needs to be offset by a different value, create the level in the host model and use the 
Monitor command to create the intelligent bond to the linked model’s level. The difference 
will be maintained through any modifications in the linked model.
Grids    Copying the grids is usually a strong workflow. You can use the options on these 
tabs to convert the grid bubbles used by the architect into those used by the structural 
engineer. It is also possible to add a prefix to the grid names. For instance, you could add the 
value S- in the prefix field, and then grid A from the architectural model will come into the 
structural model as S-A.

Using the Coordination Tools |  225  
Columns    The structural engineer can choose to replace any column—architectural or 
structural—in the architectural model with an appropriate structural column; however, this 
implies that the architect will maintain an understanding of where differentiating column 
types would exist. Realistically, the structural elements should exist only in the structural 
engineer’s model and then link into the architectural model. The architect may then choose 
to either copy/monitor the linked structural columns with architectural columns (which act 
as finish wrappers) or place architectural columns along the monitored grid lines. In the lat-
ter option, architectural columns will move along with changes in grid line locations but will 
not update if structural columns are removed in the linked model.
Walls and Floors    Similar to columns, structural walls that are important to the coordination 
process may be better managed in the structural model and linked into the architectural model. 
If you decide to use a copy/monitor relationship for these types of elements, it is best to create 
uniquely named wall types for structural coordination. Name such wall types in a manner that 
makes them display at the top of the list in the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box. You can do 
so by adding a hyphen (-) or underscore (_) at the beginning of the wall type name.
Finally, make sure you select the check box Copy Windows/Doors/Openings for walls or 
Copy Openings/Inserts for floors so that you also get the appropriate openings for those 
components in the monitored elements.
Using the Copy/Monitor Command—An Exercise
Continue with the structural model saved in the previous exercise in this chapter. In this exercise, 
you will do the following:
◆
◆
Use Copy/Monitor to establish new levels and grids.
◆
◆
Use Copy/Monitor to create floors.
◆
◆
Link the new structural model back to the architectural model.
◆
◆
Use the Monitor option for grids in the architectural model.
These steps will establish the intelligent bonds between elements in the host file with the 
related elements in the linked model. With the structural model open, activate the South 
elevation view. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to the Collaborate tab and select Copy/Monitor ➢ Select Link. Choose the linked 
model.
	
2.	 On the Copy/Monitor tab, click the Options button.
	
3.	 Select the Levels tab, and under Categories And Types To Copy, make sure the rows 
under New Type are set to TOS Head (Survey Pt). In the Additional Copy Parameters 
section, set the following options:
◆
◆
Offset Level: –0’ –6” (-150 mm)
◆
◆
Add the prefix (note the order in the dialog box) to Level Name: T.O.S.
	
4.	 Select the Grids tab, and under Categories And Types To Copy, make sure the rows under 
New Type are set to 1/4” Square (6.5 mm Square).

226  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
	
5.	 Select the Floors tab and set the following options under Categories And Types To Copy:
◆
◆
Arch Slab 6” (150 mm): LW Concrete on Metal Deck
◆
◆
Set all other entries under Original Type to Don’t Copy This Type.
Remember that you can select multiple rows in the Categories And Types To Copy list by 
pressing the Shift key while selecting a range of rows. You may then make a selection in 
the New Type column for any row, and all the selected rows will be modified.
In the Additional Copy Parameters section, set the following option:
◆
◆
Copy Openings/Inserts: Yes (checked)
	
6.	 Click OK to close the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box.
	
7.	 From the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon, choose the Copy button.
	
8.	 Select the Level 2 and Roof levels in the linked model. Levels in the host model should be 
created 6” (150 mm) below the linked levels with the prefix T.O.S. (Top Of Structure).
There is already a Level 1 in the host model. You will need to use the Monitor tool to 
establish a relationship to the Level 1 in the linked model.
	
9.	 From the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon, choose the Monitor button and select Level 1 in 
the host model.
You can only select levels in the host model for the first pick.
	
10.	 Select Level 1 in the linked model to complete the monitored relationship.
You will see an icon appear near the midpoint of the level indicating that it is now moni-
toring the level in the linked model.
	
11.	 Activate Section 1 and return to Copy mode by clicking the Copy button in the Copy/
Monitor tab of the ribbon.
	
12.	 Select the floor in the linked model at Level 2.
	
13.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan and make sure the Copy tool is still active. Check the 
Multiple option in the Options bar.
	
14.	 Select all the visible grids using any selection method you prefer.
	
15.	 Click the Finish button in the Options bar to complete the multiple copy process for 
the grids. Do not click the Finish icon in the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon without 
finishing the Multiple selection mode first.
	
16.	 Click the Finish icon in the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon to exit Copy/Monitor mode.
If you now select any of the grids or levels in the host file, you will see a monitor icon 
near the center of the element. This icon indicates that the intelligent bond has been created 
between the host and the linked element and will evaluate any modifications in the linked file 
whenever the file is reloaded.

Using the Coordination Tools |  227  
Save and close the structural model and then open the architectural model, c06-2-Architecture
.rvt or c06-2-Architecture-Metric.rvt. Using the procedures you have learned in this chapter, 
link the structural file into the architectural model. Placement should be done in the Level 1 floor plan 
using Auto – By Shared Coordinates positioning.
Use the Copy/Monitor tools in Monitor mode to establish the relationships of the grids 
between host and linked models. Doing so will ensure that changes to grids in either model will 
be coordinated.
Using the Coordination Review Tool
After intelligent bonds have been established between elements in linked models, it is the 
purpose of the Coordination Review tool to support the workflow when datum or model 
elements are modified. This tool was designed to allow the recipient of linked data to 
control how and when elements in host models are modified based on changes in the  
linked models.
When a linked model is reloaded—which will happen automatically when the host model is 
opened or when you manually reload the linked model in the Manage Links dialog box—moni-
tored elements will check for any inconsistencies. If any are found, you will see a warning mes-
sage that a linked instance needs a coordination review.
The Coordination Review warning is triggered when any of the following scenarios occur:
◆
◆
A monitored element in the linked model is changed, moved, or deleted.
◆
◆
A monitored element in the host model is changed, moved, or deleted.
◆
◆
Both the original monitored element and the copied element are changed, moved, or 
deleted.
◆
◆
A hosted element (door, window, opening) is added, moved, changed, or deleted in a 
monitored wall or floor.
◆
◆
The copied element in the host file is deleted.
To perform a coordination review, switch to the Collaborate tab and click Coordination 
Review ➢ Select Link. After picking one of the linked models, you will see the Coordination 
Review dialog box, which lists any inconsistencies in monitored elements (Figure 6.18).

228  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
For each of the changes detected in the Coordination Review dialog box, one of the follow-
ing actions can be applied. Actions that result in changes to elements will be applied only to the 
host model; they do not modify elements in a linked model. Also, not all options are available 
for all monitored elements.
◆
◆
Postpone: Takes no action on the monitored element and changes the message status so 
that it can be filtered out or considered later.
◆
◆
Reject: Select this action if you believe the change made to the element in the linked file is 
incorrect. A change must then be made to the element in the linked file.
◆
◆
Accept Difference: Accepts the change made to the element and updates the relationship. 
For example, if a pair of grids was 8” (200 mm) apart and one was moved to 12” (300 mm) 
away, the change would be accepted and the relationship would now consist of a dimen-
sional offset.
◆
◆
Modify, Rename, Move: The command name changes based on the action. If the name of 
the monitored element has changed, the command reads Rename. If a column or level is 
moved, the command is Move. If a grid is changed or moved, the command is Modify.
◆
◆
Ignore New Elements: A new hosted element has been added to a monitored wall or floor. 
Select this action to ignore the new element in the host. It will not be monitored for changes.
◆
◆
Copy New Elements: A new hosted element has been added to a monitored wall or floor. 
Select this action to add the new element to the host and monitor it for changes.
◆
◆
Delete Element: A monitored element has been deleted. Select this action to delete the 
corresponding element in the current project.
Figure 6.18
The Coordination 
Review dialog box 
lists inconsistencies in 
monitored elements.

◆
◆
Copy Sketch: The sketch or boundary of a monitored opening has changed. Select this 
action to change the corresponding opening in the current project.
◆
◆
Update Extents: The extents of a monitored element have changed. Select this action to 
change the corresponding element in the current project.
As you can see, Coordination Review can be a powerful tool to support the collaboration 
process. Remember that such a tool may not be appropriate for all elements at all times. For 
example, instead of copying and monitoring columns and grids, it may be sufficient to copy 
and monitor only grids because the columns placed in your host model will move with the 
grids anyway.
Using the Coordination Review Tool—An Exercise
In this exercise, you will use two files that have already been linked together with monitored 
elements between both files. You can download the files c06-Review-Arch.rvt or c06-
Review-Arch-Metric.rvt (architectural model) and c06-Review-Stru.rvt or c06-Review-
Stru-Metric.rvt (structural model) from this book’s web page. In this exercise, you will do 
the following:
◆
◆
Modify elements in the architectural model.
◆
◆
Use Coordination Review to address these changes in the structural model.
Remember that you cannot have a host model and a linked model open in the same Revit 
session. To make this lesson easier, you can launch a second Revit session. Open c06-Review-
Arch.rvt or c06-Review-Arch-Metric.rvt in one session and c06-Review-Stru.rvt or 
c06-Review-Stru-Metric.rvt in the other. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the architectural model, activate the Level 1 floor plan and make the following 
modifications:
◆
◆
Move grid line F to the north by 2’-0” (600 mm).
◆
◆
Rename grid 6 to 8.
	
2.	 Save the architectural model and switch to the structural model. Open the Manage Links 
window, select the linked architectural model, and click Reload. Once the file is done 
reloading, you are presented with the Coordination Review warning. Click OK to close 
the dialog box and then click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
	
3.	 In the structural project, activate the Level 1 floor plan, and then switch to the Collaborate 
tab and choose Coordination Review ➢ Select Link. Select the linked architectural model.
	
4.	 When the Coordination Review dialog box opens, you will see changes to monitored ele-
ments detected in the reloaded architectural model. You may need to expand some of the 
statuses and categories to reveal the detected change and the drop-down list under the 
Action column.
	
5.	 Apply the appropriate modifying action to each of the detected changes. (Modify the 
moved grid, and rename the numbered grid.)
	
6.	 Click Apply and OK to close the dialog box.

230  | Chapter 6  Working with Consultants   
In the previous exercise, you might have noticed the appearance of a monitored floor sketch. 
Why did a floor sketch change if you only moved a grid and renamed another? The answer lies 
in constraints and relationships. The exterior wall in the architectural model was constrained 
to be 2’-0” (600 mm) offset from grid line F. When it was moved, the exterior wall was moved 
to maintain the offset. The sketches of the model’s floor slabs were created using the Pick Walls 
tools, creating an intelligent relationship to the wall. The modified grid affected the wall, which 
modified the floor, and the Coordination Monitor tools ensured that all changes were detected 
and presented to you for action.
Using Interference Checking in 3D Coordination
In addition to asset management, digital fabrication, and cost estimation, 3D coordination is 
one of the most important uses of building information modeling. It has enormous potential 
to reduce the costs of construction through the computerized resolution of clashing building 
elements as well as exposing opportunities for alternate trade scheduling or prefabrication. 
The key component to achieving 3D coordination is interference checking, also known as 
clash detection.
Indiana University Defines Clashes
As we mentioned previously in this chapter, not only are some building and facility owners requir-
ing BIM processes and deliverables for new projects, but they are also defining how these processes 
are to be used. When you focus on interference checking, myriad potential clashes can be dis-
tilled into a prioritized grouping of building elements. Borrowing from Indiana University’s BIM 
Standards & Guidelines for Architects, Engineers, & Contractors, the following is an intelligent 
approach to the organization of potential interferences. (Always remember that the priorities 
listed here are based on the requirements of one organization. The needs of your firm and those 
of your clients may vary.)
Level One Clashes
Clashes in these categories are considered the most critical to the coordination process. They usually 
relate to systems or construction techniques that are more costly to delay or reschedule.
◆
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Ceilings
◆
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Rated Walls (for coordination of dampers and other 
mechanical equipment needs)
◆
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Structure (columns, beams, framing, etc.)
◆
◆
All Equipment and Their Applicable Clearances vs. Walls
◆
◆
All Equipment and Their Applicable Clearances vs. Structure

Using the Coordination Tools |  231  
Using the Interference Check Tool
The Interference Check tool is a basic tool supporting 3D coordination. You can use it within 
a single project model or between linked models. You can also select elements prior to run-
ning the tool in order to detect clashes within a limited set of geometry instead of the entire 
project.
For more powerful clash-detection capabilities, Autodesk offers Navisworks® Manage 
(www.autodesk.com/navisworks), which is a multiformat model-reviewing tool with various 
modules supporting phasing simulation, visualization, and clash detection. Figure 6.19 
shows an example of a model in Navisworks Manage comprising Revit, Tekla Structures, 
and AutoCAD MEP components. Some of the benefits of using Navisworks for interference-
checking over Revit include automated views of each clash, grouping of related clashes, 
enhanced reporting, clash-resolution tracking, and markup capabilities. Revit models can 
be opened directly in Navisworks or exported directly to the Navisworks format from the 
Application menu.
◆
◆
Mechanical Equipment and Fixtures vs. Electrical Equipment and Fixtures
◆
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Plumbing Piping
Level Two Clashes
These categories of clashes are considered important to the design and construction process but 
are less critical than those designated as Level One.

Structure vs. Specialty Equipment
◆
◆

These clashes are considered important to the correctness of the model; however, they will usually 
change on a regular basis throughout the design and construction process.

Running an Interference Check—An Exercise
Let’s take a look at the Revit interference-checking process. For this exercise, you will need 
to download three sample files to your computer or network: c06-Interference-Arch.rvt, 
c06-Interference-Mech.rvt, and c06-Interference-Stru.rvt. You can download these 
files from this book’s web page. The sample files are already linked to each other using relative 
paths, so be sure to place all three files in the same folder. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the file c06-Interference-Mech.rvt and activate the default 3D view.
	
2.	 Switch to the Collaborate tab, find the Coordinate panel, and choose Interference Check ➢ 
Run Interference Check.
	
3.	 When the Interference Check dialog box appears, choose c06-Interference-Stru.rvt 
from the Categories From drop-down list in the left column. Select Structural Framing in 
the left column and Ducts in the right column (Figure 6.20).
	
4.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
5.	 The Interference Report window will appear, listing all clashes detected between the 
categories you selected. The list can be sorted by either Category 1 or Category 2, repre-
senting the left and right columns in the Interference Check dialog box, respectively. In 
Figure 6.21, one interference condition has been selected, and the corresponding element 
is highlighted in the 3D view.

You can navigate in the 3D view using any method (mouse, ViewCube®, or SteeringWheels®) 
while keeping the interference report open. This facilitates resolution of the clashing items. 
The results of the interference check can also be exported to an HTML format report. Click the 
Export button and specify a location for the report. You can then share this report with other 
members of your design team for remedial actions on linked models.
The Bottom Line
Prepare for interdisciplinary collaboration.    Proper planning and communication are the 
foundation of effective collaboration. Although only some client organizations may require a 
BIM planning document, it is a recommended strategy for all design teams.
Master It    What are the key elements of a BIM execution plan?
Collaborate using linked Revit models.    The most basic tool for collaboration is the

 Chapter  7 
 Interoperability: Working 
Multiplatform   
 In the previous chapter, we discussed working with others in an environment in which all par-
ties use Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software; however, often you’ll need to work with data 
from other software platforms. For example, you may need to coordinate data from other disci-
plines, reuse legacy data, or integrate disparate design platforms. There are several ways to use 
external data within your Revit Architecture model in both 2D and 3D. We will discuss not only 
the methods of importing and exporting data but also when to use each method and the reasons 
for using specifi c settings. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

 Use imported 2D CAD data 
 
◆
 Export 2D CAD data 
 
◆
 Use imported 3D model data

 examining Interoperability on a BIM Curve 
 On the basis of a 2007 study on interoperability in the design and construction industry, 
McGraw-Hill Construction reported annual losses of $9.1 billion in the building industry 
due to insuffi cient interoperability. You can fi nd the full report online ( http://www.aia
.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aias077485.pdf ). Although the study is now 
a bit dated, it underscores a problem that building information modeling (BIM) as a whole 
is designed to address. Adequate interoperability will help rectify the problem illustrated 
in Figure  7.1 , sometimes known as the BIM curve. In Figure  7.1 , the downward spikes in 
the lower line at the end of each project phase represent a loss of knowledge and acquired 
data. This loss usually occurs when a project is exported from BIM to a 2D CAD format or is 
printed to paper. Project data is then gradually reconstructed in another software platform. 
The upper line represents a more ideal paradigm where data and knowledge are gradu-
ally increased throughout the life of the project—a paradigm supported by BIM and full 
interoperability.  

236  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
Although full interoperability between BIM platforms is the ideal scenario, we realize that 
you are likely to be working with constituents who are using 2D CAD or non-BIM 3D software.
Inserting CAD Data
Although Revit software provides ample means to generate 2D documentation based on a rich 
multidimensional (3D, 4D, 5D, and so on) model, there are a few real-world scenarios in which 
CAD data must be integrated with the building information model. Such scenarios might 
include the following:
◆
◆
Using CAD details developed within your firm
◆
◆
Coordinating with other firms using CAD software
◆
◆
Converting projects from CAD to a Revit model
◆
◆
Using external modeling tools for conceptual massing
◆
◆
Using complex component models from other software
Using Predefined Settings for Inserted CAD Data
When you are inserting data from a DWG or DXF file, you can establish some predefined set-
tings to control its appearance within the Revit environment. Some settings are controlled at the 
time you insert a CAD file, but other settings can be configured more deliberately in saved con-
figuration files. The two ways you can configure this data are by mapping layer colors to Revit 
line weights and converting font types.
Mapping Layer Colors
For inserted CAD files, layers within the file are assigned a Revit line weight based on the 
weight assigned to each layer by the CAD software application that created the files. If the layer

line weights are set to Default in the CAD file, they will follow a translation template you can 
configure that maps the layer colors to Revit line weights. To access these settings, select the 
Insert tab and click the dialog launcher at the bottom right of the Import panel. Doing so opens 
the Import Line Weights dialog box, shown in Figure 7.2.
Defining the Imported Line Weights Template in Revit.ini Files
The file location for the imported line weights template is stored in the Revit.ini file under the 
following category:
[Directories]
ImportLineweightsNameDWG=&#x003C; Full path to TXT file >
If you are using any kind of automation scripts to set up standards, your imported line weights 
template file location can be written into the Revit.ini file for all your users. Doing so ensures 
consistency for all team members inserting CAD data into your Revit project.

As you can see in the title bar of this dialog box, these settings are stored in a text file (TXT) 
in the Data folder where Revit is installed. There are several predefined text files based on 
international CAD standards for layer color:

On the basis of the unique needs of some projects, you might also consider creating customized 
import setting files and storing them along with the rest of your project data.

Mapping Font Types
Another important aspect for inserted CAD data is the ability to map shape-based fonts to 
TrueType fonts. Usually a remnant of older CAD standards based on graphic performance, CAD 
files may contain fonts such as Simplex, RomanS, or Monotxt that do not have matches in stan-
dard Windows fonts. The shxfontmap.txt file defines the mapping of TrueType fonts as substi-
tutes for each specified SHX font. You can find this text file at C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\
RVT 2017\UserDataCache.
If your firm frequently uses CAD data as an integrated part of your final documentation, 
the shxfontmap.txt file should be configured to map your standard CAD fonts to your standard 
fonts used in a Revit project. This file should then be copied to the workstations of all team 
members using Revit software. Failure to do so may result in undesirable results when using 
CAD files in a worksharing environment.
Importing versus Linking
You can insert CAD data into the Revit environment in two ways: importing and linking. Each 
method has advantages and disadvantages.
Importing    Similar to the using the Insert command in Autodesk® AutoCAD® software, 
importing data integrates the CAD data into the Revit project but does not allow the 
imported data to be updated if the original CAD file is modified. In such a case, the imported 
data would have to be deleted and reimported. It also does not give you an easy way to purge 
the layers, linetypes, and hatch patterns of an imported file if it has been exploded and then 
deleted.
Linking    A linked CAD file in a Revit project is analogous to an external reference (xref) 
in an AutoCAD project. When the original CAD file is modified, its reference is auto-
matically updated in the Revit environment. Linking also allows you to easily unload or 
remove a file when it is no longer needed, which will leave no trace of the file’s contents 
after removal.
Linked data cannot be modified directly in a Revit project unless it is converted to an import 
in the Manage Links dialog box (Insert ➢ Manage Links) and then exploded. We discuss this 
process in the “Manipulating Inserted CAD Data” section later in this chapter. As an alterna-
tive, it can be modified in its original authoring application and then updated within Revit.
Linking is the preferred method for external data integration; however, too many linked files 
will make it slower to open a Revit project. For example, ceiling plan fixture layouts may change 
with every design iteration (where linking is preferred); however, standard details that all share 
a minimal amount of standardized layers, linetypes, hatch patterns, text, and dimension styles 
might be better suited as imports.
Collect CAD Links in a Linked Revit File
Another option to manage many CAD references in larger projects is to create a separate Revit 
project that contains only the inserted CAD data. If the CAD data is placed with the Current View 
Only option, you must use linked views between Revit models. If the linked data does not use this 
option, it will be visible like any other modeled element in a linked Revit model. Refer to Chapter 6, 
“Working with Consultants,” for more information about linked Revit models.

Inserting CAD Data |  239  
Using Options during Importing/Linking
After you have configured the necessary settings for inserted CAD data and decided whether 
to import or link, you need to understand certain options during the import/link process. We’ll 
discuss the preferred settings for each of the options based on real-world situations in the sec-
tions “Using Inserted 2D Data” and “Using Inserted 3D Data.” To place your first CAD file into 
a Revit project, switch to the Insert tab and select either the Link CAD or the Import CAD but-
ton. No matter which tool you use, there will be several important options at the bottom of the 
respective dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.3.
Figure 7.3
Options available for 
import/link
Let’s examine the meaning of the settings in this situation:
Current View Only    When this option is selected, the linked or imported file can be seen only 
in the view in which it was inserted and is thus considered a view-specific element. In a work-
sharing-enabled project, this data will be assigned to the view’s workset. More often than not, you 
will want to choose this option to limit the number of views in which the referenced data will 
appear. If you need this data in other views, you can copy and paste it from one view to another.
If the option is not selected, the linked file can be seen in all views, including 3D, elevations, 
and sections. In a worksharing-enabled project, this data will be assigned to the active work-
set. A benefit to using links in a worksharing environment is the ability to create a workset 
specifically for linked data and uncheck its Visible In All Views option. The CAD files placed 
in this manner will not appear in every view but are available when you need them by 
adjusting the workset visibility in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box.
Colors    Colors don’t matter for CAD files being used as a basis to create a Revit model; however, 
using Invert or Preserve may help distinguish the CAD data from the modeled elements during 
the conversion process. If you are going to integrate the inserted data with other elements in your 
project for final design or construction documentation, you’ll want to select the Black And White 
option, because printing from Revit is mostly WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). Read the 
section “Using CAD Data for Coordination” for more detailed recommendations on this process.
Layers/Levels    These options allow you to import or link all the layers, only the layers vis-
ible when the CAD file was last saved, or a selected group of layers you choose from the 
linked file in a separate dialog box. (Layers is a DWG-based term. Revit software supports the 
same functionality with levels from DGN files.)
Import Units    For CAD files generated in an original program (that is, DWG from AutoCAD 
or DGN from MicroStation), the Auto-Detect option works well. If you are linking CAD data 
that has been exported from a different program, such as DWG exported from Rhino, you 
should specify the units relative to the respective CAD file.

240  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
Positioning    To maintain consistency in a multilevel project during a CAD-to-Revit coordi-
nation or conversion process, you should use Auto – Origin To Origin or Auto – By Shared 
Coordinates. Origin To Origin will align the world coordinates origin of the CAD file with 
the project internal origin. Although Autodesk claims Auto – By Shared Coordinates is only 
for use with linked Revit files, it can be used with CAD files if the rotation of true north 
becomes inconsistent using the Origin To Origin option.
Place At    This option is available only if Current View Only is not selected; it specifies the 
level at which the inserted data will be placed.
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis    Selecting this option automatically corrects lines 
that are slightly off axis when you import or link CAD geometry. This option is selected by 
default and will help keep your Revit elements (such as walls or linework) that tie to CAD 
lines from being askew; however, you may need to consider this option carefully. If the CAD 
data you are inserting is intentionally off axis, the corrections may lead to inaccurate results. 
For example, a site plan may have property lines that are a fraction of a degree from being 
orthogonal, but they must be maintained for accurate building placement in your Revit project.
Orient To View    This option may be used if True North has been rotated away from Project 
North. If that is the case and you are linking a CAD file into a view that is set to True North, 
deselect this option to align the CAD file’s World Coordinate System with True North as 
defined in your Revit project.
If you do check the Orient To View option, the CAD file will align with Project North regard-
less of the view orientation.
Manipulating Inserted CAD Data
Once you have CAD data imported or linked into a Revit project, you have several ways of 
manipulating the data to suit your needs:
Foreground/Background    This setting applies only to linked or imported CAD files placed with 
the Current View Only option. With the inserted file selected, a drop-down menu will appear in 
the Options bar so you can adjust whether the data appears above or below your modeled Revit 
content. You can also access this setting in the Properties palette when the inserted file is selected.

Inserting CAD Data |  241  
Pay close attention to this option when integrating 2D CAD data with an existing Revit 
model—sometimes linked or imported CAD data may not appear at all until you set the 
option to Foreground because of floors or ceilings obscuring the 2D data.
Visibility of Layers/Levels    The layers or levels within a linked or imported CAD file 
can be accessed in two ways, the easiest of which is the Query tool. First, select a linked or 
imported CAD file; then, from the contextual tab in the ribbon select the Query tool and pick 
an object in the CAD file.
You will see the Import Instance Query dialog box (Figure 7.4). Using this tool, you can hide 
the layer or level by clicking the Hide In View button. The Query tool will remain active even 
after you click any of the command buttons in the Import Instance Query dialog box, and 
you must press the Esc key or click the Modify button to end the command.
Figure 7.4
Querying objects 
within a linked CAD 
file
The second way to make layers or levels in imported or linked CAD files invisible is to use 
the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box by switching to the View tab and selecting 
Visibility/Graphics from the Graphics panel. Once the dialog box opens, select the Imported 
Categories tab, as shown in Figure 7.5. Only the inserted CAD files that are visible in the 
active view will be listed in this tab. Expand any listed file to expose the layers/levels within 
that file, and use the check boxes to customize visibility of the link within the current view. 
This method is the only way to restore visibility of layers/levels that were hidden with the 
Query tool.

objects
CAD Data in Families
Remember that 2D and 3D data imported into Revit families will be listed under the Imports In 
Families category in both the Visibility/Graphic Overrides and Object Styles dialog boxes. They 
will not appear as separately listed files.
Graphic Overrides    If you need to change the appearance of the content within a linked or 
imported CAD file, you can accomplish that at the project level or within an individual view. 
To change a CAD file’s appearance throughout the project, select the Manage tab on the rib-
bon, and click Object Styles in the Settings panel. Select the Imported Objects tab (Figure 7.6), 
and expand any of the imported or linked CAD files to change the color, line weight, line pat-
tern, or material of the layers/levels within the referenced file. Changing these properties in 
the row of the filename does not affect the contents of that file. You can also apply these set-
tings in a specific view using the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box.
Exploding    Although we do not recommend exploding CAD data within a Revit project, 
you can do it to facilitate the modification of such data. Linked content must first be con-
verted to an import in order to be exploded. You do this by selecting the Insert tab on the 
ribbon, choosing Manage Links from the Link panel, choosing a listed link, and clicking the 
Import button. To explode the imported file, select it, and choose Explode ➢ Full Explode 
or Partial Explode from the contextual tab in the ribbon. The lines, text, and hatch patterns 
will become new line styles, text types, and fill regions in your project. Remember that these 
types of objects cannot be removed from your project via the Purge Unused command; you 
must remove them manually.

Tips on Importing CAD Files
To minimize the adverse impact of unnecessary styles and types carried into the Revit environ-
ment with exploding imported CAD data, we recommend removing extraneous data in the CAD 
file before importing it. Here are some general tips for this workflow:
◆
◆
If your import contains elements such as hatches or annotations not intended for use in the 
Revit project, delete them before importing.
◆
◆
Consider consolidating data within the CAD file to a minimum number of layers or levels. Doing 
so will ease the process of converting to Revit line styles if the file is exploded. This process 
will also facilitate graphic overrides.
◆
◆
If it is allowable within your workflow for the imported CAD file, import it into a family, and 
then insert that family into your project. This will not reduce the overall file size, but it will 
make it a lot easier to find and manipulate should your imported CAD file need additional 
changes. It will also give you some extra control over the graphic display of the imported file.
Revit software doesn’t allow line segments shorter than 1/32″ (0.8 mm). Although it might 
seem like you wouldn’t have a lot of lines that length, many manufacturers’ details contain 
small fillets in sections and plans and will fall into this range. Take care when exploding CAD 
details with very small line segments because they will be removed upon exploding. A good 
example of this is the manufacturers’ details. Many of those CAD files have the level of detail 
needed to create the part (for example, a window mullion) but are not necessary for architec-
tural detailing. Revit will automatically remove those shorter segments, and in some cases it 
might be quicker to simply trace over the detail rather than insert and explode it.

244  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
Using Inserted 2D Data
In the following sections, we will discuss how to import 2D CAD data from platforms such 
as AutoCAD (DWG) and MicroStation (DGN) or in the generic Drawing Exchange Format 
(DXF). You can also use files from other software platforms, but only if they are DWG, DGN, 
or DXF format. Most commercially available CAD programs are able to export in DWG or 
DXF format.
There are three fundamental ways 2D CAD data can be used with respect to a building proj-
ect’s floor plans, ceiling plans, or site plans:
◆
◆
Using 2D data as backgrounds for BIM conversion
◆
◆
Integrating 2D data with the model
◆
◆
Importing CAD details
Setting Options for BIM Conversion
On the basis of a common situation, we will assume that 2D CAD data will be linked into the 
Revit model to be converted into building elements. Although the positioning of the files is 
important, the color and line weights of the imported data are not.
To begin the next exercise, you will need the files c07-Plan01.dwg and c07-Conversion-
Start.rvt. You can download these files from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/
masteringrevit2017. After downloading, open the c07-Conversion-Start.rvt file, and 
activate the Level 1 floor plan. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD from the Link panel. Browse to the file 
c07-Plan01.dwg.
	
2.	 In the Link CAD Formats dialog box, set the following options:
◆
◆
Current View Only: Selected
◆
◆
Colors: Invert
◆
◆
Layers/Levels: All
◆
◆
Import Units: Auto-Detect
◆
◆
Positioning: Auto – Origin To Origin
◆
◆
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis: Selected
	
3.	 With those settings in place, choose Open to link in the CAD file. 
Linking Large CAD Data
Use caution when attempting to link or import CAD files with vector data very far from the origin. 
Revit software has distance limitations on imported vector data that—if exceeded—may result 
in a warning, as shown here:

Using Inserted 2D Data |  245  
Using CAD Data for Coordination
If you need to use 2D CAD data as an integrated component of your team coordination, differ-
ent settings become important. Here are a few examples of these types of scenarios:
◆
◆
Showing light fixture layouts from a lighting designer
◆
◆
Integrating landscape design into a site plan
◆
◆
Reusing existing CAD data for a renovation project
Most of the settings and procedures for conversion apply to the coordination process; how-
ever, color and the placement visibility will be different. Because this data will be included in 
the Revit output, you will usually want the color option to be set to Black And White in the 
options during linking. It is also likely that some sort of background plans will be exported 
from the Revit model for use in coordination by one or more consultants using a CAD-based 
program. The data returned in this process may still contain the background information 
originally exported from Revit; thus, we recommend agreement on a standard that establishes 
unique layers for the consultants’ content. This will help you select layers to be loaded when 
linking your consultants’ files into the Revit project.
The warning message indicates that the software will automatically use Center To Center positioning 
if the distance limitations are exceeded. This will preclude you from using the origin of the linked 
file for Origin To Origin placement. If you must link data that is physically larger than a 20-mile 
cube—which may occur in projects such as airports or master plans—you should separate the data 
into smaller portions before linking. If the data is smaller than the 20-mile cube but is located 
farther than 20 miles from its origin, an alternate origin should be coordinated with your project 
team, and the data should be moved closer to the origin.

246  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
Use these options when linking CAD files into a Revit project for plan-based coordination:
◆
◆
Current View Only: Selected if data is needed in one view; unselected if data is needed in 
many views
◆
◆
Colors: Black And White
◆
◆
Layers: Specify (choose only designated layers to isolate consultants’ content)
◆
◆
Positioning: Auto – By Shared Coordinates
If Current View Only is not selected, the 2D CAD data will be visible in all other views. This 
could be a nuisance in views such as sections and elevations; however, you might find it useful 
to visualize the data alongside the Revit model, as shown in Figure 7.7.

Linking Details
Your company’s CAD detail library does not need to go to waste when you start working in a 
Revit environment. CAD data can be linked or imported into drafting views, allowing you to 
leverage the powerful view coordination tools within Revit. Entire sheets of CAD details can 
be inserted to reduce the number of linked files you have to reconcile; however, we recommend 
linking one detail into each drafting view and using the software’s ability to automatically 
manage the view references with callouts, sections, and detail views. You may also want to 
name these drafting views with a unique prefix to help keep track of where any linked CAD 
data might reside. For example, a drafting view might be named CAD-Roof Detail 04. Also 
refer to Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards,” for additional information on view 
organization.
In this exercise, you will create a drafting view into which a single CAD detail will be linked. 
This view can be referenced throughout your Revit model using a section, callout, or eleva-
tion view with the Reference Other View option selected in the contextual tab of the ribbon, as 
shown in Figure 7.8.

Using Inserted 2D Data |  247  
To begin this exercise, open the c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt file. You can download 
this file and the associated CAD file (c07-Detail.dwg) from the book’s web page.
	
1.	 Switch to the View tab and select Drafting View from the Create panel.
	
2.	 Name the new drafting view CAD Wall Detail 1, and set the scale to 1 1/2″ = 1′-0″. Click 
OK to close the dialog box.
	
3.	 Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD.
	
4.	 In the Link CAD Formats dialog box, navigate to the c07-Detail.dwg file and set the fol-
lowing options:
◆
◆
Colors: Black And White
◆
◆
Layers/Levels: All
◆
◆
Units: Auto-Detect
◆
◆
Positioning: Auto – Center To Center
◆
◆
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis: Unchecked
	
5.	 Click Open to complete the command. If you don’t see the linked detail in the drafting 
view, use Zoom To Fit (ZF on the keyboard) in order to reset the extents of the view.
	
6.	 Open the Wall Section, Typ view from the Project Browser located under the Sections 
(Wall Section) node, and zoom to a portion of the view where a floor meets an exterior 
wall.
	
7.	 On the View tab, select Callout from the Create panel, and select Reference Other View in 
the contextual tab of the ribbon (similar to Figure 7.8). Choose Drafting View: CAD Wall

Detail 1 from the drop-down list. In the drawing window, drag the callout rectangle 
around the area where the floor at Level 2 intersects the exterior wall.
	
8.	 After the callout is placed, select the callout you just created and use the grip where the 
leader line meets the callout head to drag the callout head to the left. The result should 
look like the image shown in Figure 7.9.

9.	 Double-click the callout head, and you will be taken to the drafting view with the CAD 
detail linked in the previous steps. 
Customizing Callouts
You also have the option to create your callouts with nonrectangular shapes. Additionally, for any 
view you reference using the previous steps, you can change the target view after you’ve created 
the callout or sectional reference. Simply highlight it and choose a new detail to reference from 
the Options bar.
Using Inserted 3D Data
Now that we have discussed using 2D reference data, we will show you how to use 3D model 
data from other design software within your Revit project. There are many valid reasons for 
modeling outside of the Revit environment, including software expertise, the availability of con-
tent, and optimization of complex geometry. The following sections will explore some situations 
in which model data can be shared between programs:
◆
◆
Inserted data as a mass
◆
◆
Inserted data as a face
◆
◆
Inserted data as an object
Using CAD Data as a Mass
In Chapter 8, “Advanced Modeling and Massing,” you will learn more about harnessing the 
impressive modeling toolset in the Revit conceptual massing environment; however, the fast 
and flexible process of design may lead architects to a tool in which they have more expertise or 
comfort. This type of massing design workflow is supported in the Revit environment under the 
following conditions:

Using Inserted 3D Data |  249  
◆
◆
Inserted model data requires solid geometry to calculate volume, surface area, and floor 
area faces.
◆
◆
Finely detailed complex geometry should be avoided because the Host By Face tools may 
not be able to generate meaningful objects.
The following exercise creates an in-place mass by linking an external model—in this case, a 
SketchUp model. Download the files c07-SKP-Mass.rvt, c07-Mass.skp, and c07-Mass-2.skp 
from the book’s web page and follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the project file c07-SKP-Mass.rvt. Activate the Level 1 floor plan, and from the 
Massing & Site tab (if that tab isn’t available, you can turn it on under the Application 
menu ➢ Options ➢ User Interface), select In-Place Mass from the Conceptual Mass 
panel.
	
2.	 Name the new mass family SKP Mass and click OK.
	
3.	 Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD from the Link panel; be sure to switch your 
Files Of Type filter to *.skp files.
	
4.	 Navigate to the c07-Mass.skp file downloaded from the book’s web page and set the fol-
lowing options:
◆
◆
Current View Only: Unchecked
◆
◆
Colors: Invert
◆
◆
Layers/Levels: All
◆
◆
Import Units: Auto-Detect
◆
◆
Positioning: Auto – Center To Center
◆
◆
Place At: Level 1
	
5.	 Click Open to complete the link process.
	
6.	 Click Finish Mass in the In-Place Editor panel of the ribbon.
	
7.	 Activate the Mass Schedule view from the Project Browser and observe the values for 
Gross Surface Area and Gross Volume.
Now that a new mass has been created, you can assign mass floors and begin to see calcu-
lated results in schedules of masses and mass floors. (Refer to Chapter 8 for more information 
on these processes.) Calculation of volumes, perimeters, and mass floor areas will work well 
in this workflow, but be careful when using imported model geometry with the By Face tools 
because face updates will likely be more difficult for the software to maintain than native Revit 
massing.
Using linking instead of importing enables continued iteration of the form in the original 
software. In the case of this example, you may edit the original file in SketchUp, which is avail-
able as a free download from www.sketchup.com, or you can download the file c07-Mass-2.skp 
from this book’s web page.
If you modify and save the original SKP file yourself, save, close, and reopen the Revit proj-
ect. As an alternative, open the Manage Links dialog box, select the SKP file, and click Reload. 

250  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
If you want to use the alternative file downloaded from the book’s web page, use the following 
steps:
	
1.	 From the Insert tab of the ribbon, click Manage Links.
	
2.	 In the Manage Links dialog box, switch to the CAD Formats tab, select the SKP file, and 
click the Reload From button.
	
3.	 Navigate to the file c07-Mass-2.skp and click Open.
	
4.	 Click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
With the modified mass loaded, activate the Mass Schedule view and notice the changes of 
Gross Volume and Gross Surface Area.
Using CAD Data as a Face
Similar to the data as mass workflow, externally modeled data can be used as a planar 
host for more complex forms. An example might be the need to generate a complex curved 
roof surface. We will demonstrate this workflow using Rhino by McNeel (www.rhino3d.
com) to generate a shape, link the shape into the project, and create a roof by face on the 
shape.
As shown in Figure 7.10, a complex surface is generated in Rhino by drawing two curves and 
using the Extrude Curve Along Curve tool. Note that some reference geometry was exported 
from a Revit model to DWG and linked into this study in Rhino.
Figure 7.10
Curves for a complex 
surface in Rhino
A flat surface model is enough to generate a roof by face; however, it may be difficult to see 
the imported surface, so use the Extrude Surface tool to give it a thickness. Once the surface is 
complete (Figure 7.11), select only the double-curved geometry, choose File ➢ Export Selected 
Objects, and choose the .sat filename extension. SAT will generate the cleanest geometry for 
curved solids and surfaces.

the process as follows:
	
1.	 Open the file c07-Roof-by-Face.rvt and open the 3D view named 00-Start.
	
2.	 On the Massing & Site tab, choose In-Place Mass and name it Rhino Roof. You will see an 
alert that the Show Mass mode has been enabled. You may choose to not show this mes-
sage again, but you can always use the Show Mass combination button in the Massing & 
Site tab of the ribbon to toggle between different visibility modes.
	
3.	 Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD. In the Files Of Type drop-down, select *.sat 
and navigate to the c07-Roof-Face.sat file downloaded from the book’s web page.
	
4.	 Set the placement options as follows:

◆
Positioning: Auto – Origin To Origin

Import Units: Inch
	
5.	 Click Open to complete the link and close the dialog box, and then click the Finish Mass 
button in the ribbon.

The mass should be seen above the tops of the walls in the Revit model, as shown in  
Figure 7.12.

6.	 Return to the Massing & Site tab and select the Roof tool from the Model By Face panel. 
Choose Basic Roof: Generic - 12″ from the Type Selector, and click the top face of the 
mass created in the previous steps. Click the Create Roof button in the ribbon to complete 
the command, and the roof will be generated along the mass surface, as shown in  
Figure 7.13.

selection.
	
8.	 Select the Attach Top/Base tool from the Modify | Walls tab, set the Top option in the 
Options bar, and pick the roof by face created in step 6.
The walls will connect to the underside of the complex roof shape. Activate the 3D view 
named Camera-Front and you will see the result of the exercise, as shown in Figure 7.14.

Using Inserted 3D Data |  253  
The imported shape can be edited in the original modeling software and will update via the 
link if the original exported SAT file is overwritten. To update the roof based on the newly mod-
ified massing geometry, select the roof and click the Update To Face button in the contextual tab 
of the ribbon.
Using CAD Data as an Object
Yet another derivation of the reference data workflow supports the use of CAD model geometry 
for specific instances of building components. Examples of this scenario might include a com-
plex canopy structure being designed in SolidWorks or a building’s structural framing being 
modeled in Tekla Structures. The workflow is again similar to that of using CAD data as a mass 
or face; however, the file format will help you control the component’s visualization. In the 
previous exercise, we used an SAT format to transfer complex curved geometry from Rhino to 
Revit; however, a limitation of an SAT file is that the geometry contains only one layer, making it 
impossible to vary material assignments for different components of the design. We recommend 
using a solids-based DWG, DGN, or DXF file format, which will maintain a layer structure in 
most cases.
In the following exercise, you will create an in-place structural framing component that will 
act as a placeholder for a consultant’s structural model, which is in DWG format. You will be 
using the file c07-3D-Structure.dwg, which you can download from this book’s web page.
	
1.	 Download and open the file c07-Framing-Start.rvt from the book’s web page. Activate 
the Level 1 floor plan.
	
2.	 Switch to the Architecture tab and choose Component ➢ Model In-Place. Set the Family 
Category to Structural Framing and click OK.
	
3.	 Name the new in-place model DWG Structure.
	
4.	 From the Insert tab, select Link CAD.
	
5.	 Change the Files Of Type option to DWG Files (*.dwg) and navigate to the file 
c07-3D-Structure.dwg.

The DWG file provided is actually a sample Revit file that was exported to DWG format 
(Figure 7.15). Models may be provided in this format from any number of other design 
applications such as Autodesk® AutoCAD® MEP software or Tekla Structures.

Activate the default 3D view, and you should see the entire contents of the linked CAD model 
(Figure 7.16). Because the linked content was created as a structural framing model, the linked 
data will be displayed similarly to any other structural framing element. Examine the linked 
model in different plans and sections to observe this behavior.

Exporting CAD Data |  255  
If you’re not seeing the model as part of your 3D view, you forgot to uncheck the box for 
Current View Only in step 6. If that is the case, you’ll need to either undo your way back or 
unlink and relink the CAD file.
Using linked models in DWG, DGN, or DXF format also allows you to modify the graphic 
representation of the elements within the Revit environment. To adjust these settings, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Manage tab, click Object Styles, and switch to the Imported Objects tab.
	
2.	 Find your linked file, expand it to expose the layers or levels included in it, and modify 
the graphic settings as desired.
When you are using linked model data for custom components, the consistency of the data 
you bring into Revit software from other programs depends on the ability of that software 
to generate organized information. Some programs use layers, and some don’t. Recognizing 
this difference will give you the best opportunity for success in coordination through 
interoperability.
Exporting CAD Data
Just as significant as importing data is the ability to export Revit data for use by others. We will 
now examine various processes for exporting data from your Revit project to other formats. To 
achieve your desired results when exporting, remember that exporting from Revit is essentially 
a WYSIWYG process. For example, exporting a 3D view will result in a 3D model, exporting a 
floor plan will result in a 2D CAD file, and exporting a schedule will result in a delimited file 
that can be used in a program such as Microsoft Excel.

256  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
We will first review the settings to be configured for the exporting process. These methods 
are similar for almost all exports and will be referred to in subsequent sections.
The process for exporting CAD files from Revit has been streamlined in recent releases of the 
software. There are basically two steps to export CAD data from a Revit project: create a list of 
views to be exported, and define the settings in an export configuration.
Preparing a List of Views for Exporting
The first step to any CAD export is to establish the set of views to be exported. You can use the 
file c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt for this section’s exercises. The following steps will walk 
you through the process of creating a saved list of views for export:
	
1.	 You can find all exporting commands in the Application menu when you click the Export 
flyout. You may need to scroll down this flyout menu to access all the export commands 
available for use. From the Export menu, select CAD Formats ➢ DWG.
	
2.	 You will first see the DWG Export dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.17. The Export drop-
down list is set to <Current View/Sheet Only> by default. This is where you would select 
predefined lists of views to be exported from your project.
Figure 7.17
First view of DWG 
Export dialog box
	
3.	 Begin to create your own list of views and/or sheets to export by choosing <In-Session 
View/Sheet Set> from the Export drop-down list, as shown in Figure 7.18.

Exporting CAD Data |  257  
	
4.	 From this point, you can either use a temporary in-session set or create your own named 
set. We will continue these steps by creating a new named set. Click the New Set icon 
above the view list, shown in Figure 7.19, and name the set PLANS. Click OK to close the 
dialog box.
Using In-Session Lists with Worksharing
Be careful when using an in-session list for printing or exporting on a worksharing-enabled project. 
If two or more team members working on the same Revit project attempt to use the in-session set, 
you may receive errors about the workset not being editable. Instead, always try to use predefined 
lists for exporting and printing on worksharing projects.

list.
	
5.	 To begin adding views and/or sheets to your new export set, from the Show In List drop-
down menu, choose Views In The Model.

258  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
	
6.	 Click the Check None button to clear any extraneously selected views and then find the 
floor plans with the A- prefix. Select these views by checking the boxes next to the views 
in the Include column.
Remember, you can sort the list by clicking any of the list headers (Figure 7.20).
Figure 7.20
Adding views/sheets to 
the export list
	
7.	 For now, we will simply end this exercise by saving the list of views for later. Click the 
Save Set & Close button and the DWG Export dialog box will close.
	
8.	 Save the project file to continue the next exercise.
Now that you have created a saved list of views for export, they will be available for any CAD 
export processes. You can create as many lists as you need as well as duplicate, delete, or rename 
them in the DWG Export dialog box. In the next section, we will show you how to adjust the set-
tings for exported DWG files.
Settings for DWG Exports
In addition to saving lists of views for exporting, you have the ability to save predefined export-
ing configurations. To complete an export, you will select a list of files and an export setup 
before defining an export location and launching the process. Let’s examine the various settings 
that can be customized for DWG export.
Continuing with the c07-Sample-Building.rvt file, go to the Application menu and then 
choose Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ DWG. You will return to the DWG Export dialog box. In the 
previous exercise, you created a named list of views to export. Before we begin an exercise to 
create a customized configuration for export settings, we will briefly explore the various set-
tings that can be saved and applied to any list of views to complete the export process. Click the 
ellipsis button at the top of the dialog box. A tooltip will appear showing the associated com-
mand as Modify Export Setup. The Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box will appear 
(Figure 7.21).

Exporting CAD Data |  259  
As you can see, a number of opportunities for customization are offered in this dialog box. 
First, you’ll notice at the left side of the dialog box a list of export setups and icons similar to 
those found in the main DWG Export dialog box. Use these icons to create, duplicate, rename, 
or delete export setups in your project. Let’s take a look at some of the other export settings in 
greater detail.
Layers
The Layers tab was shown previously in Figure 7.21. It contains many options to completely cus-
tomize the export of object styles to layers. Let’s examine each of these settings more closely.
Export Layer Options
At the top of the Layers tab is a drop-down that allows you to specify the overall behavior of 
exported elements. This setting accounts for any graphic overrides that might be applied in 
a Revit view. For example, the Linework tool might have been used to modify the edge of a 
wall to a dashed line. These options determine how that override will be exported to a CAD 
format.
Export Category Properties BYLAYER And Overrides BYENTITY    This option will 
export unmodified elements to their respective layer assignments, and their properties will 
remain assigned to the layer. If an object or part of an object has been overridden, the over-
ridden element will still be assigned to the respective layer, but the graphic override will be 
applied directly to the entity. In the wall example noted previously, the wall edge would still 
be assigned to the A-WALL layer but would have a DASHED linetype instead of a BYLAYER 
assignment.
Figure 7.21
Modify DWG/DXF 
Export Setup dialog

260  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
Export All Properties BYLAYER, But Do Not Export Overrides    If the recipients 
of your CAD file will use scripts or macros to enforce their own graphic standards to 
the exported data, select this option. Using the wall example again, the wall elements 
would be assigned to the A-WALL layer; however, the dashed line overrides would not 
be exported. This style of export is usually appropriate for engineers who need to use 
architectural plans as background information and thus will override all elements to 
halftone.
Export All Properties BYLAYER, And Create New Layers For Overrides    This final 
option will assign default objects to layers based on their categories; however, any elements 
with graphic overrides will be assigned to new layers that are subsets of the original layer. 
When we continue with the previous wall example, the unmodified wall elements will be 
assigned to the A-WALL layer, but the overridden edge will be assigned to a new layer such 
as A-WALL-3, where the properties of the element are all BYLAYER and the new layer con-
tains the dashed linetype. In our opinion, this option is less useful because there is no control 
over the naming of the new layers, thus creating potential confusion for the recipients of the 
exported files.
Load Layers From Standards
Several exporting templates based on the industry-standard layering guidelines are included 
(Figure 7.22) with the Revit application and can be applied in the Load Layers From Standards 
drop-down. Similarly to import settings, you may want to create customized layer export tem-
plates and save them with your project data for future reference. Export templates may inherit 
the layer names of linked CAD files in your active project. Because of this, we recommend sav-
ing a copy of your export templates in a ZIP archive in case you need to return to the original 
template.
Figure 7.22
Industry-standard lay-
ering conventions can 
be applied to export 
settings.
Layer names and colors can also be customized by directly editing the values in the Layers 
tab in the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box. Each category and subcategory is capable 
of independent color and layer names.
Layer modifiers can be applied to any or all of the model categories for export. To do this, 
either click in the Layer Modifiers column for any of the listed model categories and then click 
the Add/Edit button that appears, or click the Add/Edit Modifiers For All button. Either method 
will open the Add/Edit Layer Modifiers dialog box (Figure 7.23). Here you can assign modifiers 
such as phase status, workset, view type, or user-customized fields.

Exporting CAD Data |  261  
Lines
Switch to the Lines tab in the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box, and you will find addi-
tional settings for assigning Revit line patterns to CAD-based linetypes (Figure 7.24). The first 
setting at the top of the tab is to assign the linetype scale in the exported CAD files. This option 
can be configured to Modelspace, Paperspace, or Scaled Linetype Definitions. This setting can be 
changed by the recipient of the exported files, so it is common to use the Modelspace setting for 
any model view exports, such as plans or elevations, and the Paperspace setting for sheet views.
Figure 7.23
Modifiers such as 
Phase Status may be 
applied to individual or 
all categories.
Figure 7.24
Line styles can be 
assigned to specific 
CAD linetypes.

262  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
In the main list within the Lines tab, any line patterns defined in your Revit project can be 
assigned to a specific CAD-based linetype. The default linetype definitions file is included with 
Revit, but it can be changed with the command buttons above the line patterns list. The default 
setting for exporting line patterns is Automatically Generate Linetype, which will replicate the 
graphic pattern but will not integrate well with any other CAD software if the exported files 
require additional modification by the recipient.
Patterns
As with lines, the exporting of fill patterns can be completely customized. Switch to the Patterns 
tab (Figure 7.25), and you will see similar options to specify a default CAD-based pattern file 
as well as the ability to assign Revit fill patterns to hatch patterns that are native to AutoCAD 
software.
Figure 7.25
Fill patterns can be 
assigned to CAD hatch 
patterns.
In Figure 7.25, we selected a few of the Revit fill patterns to be mapped to a respective pattern 
from the AutoCAD pattern definition.
Similar customizations can also be made for fonts in the Text & Fonts tab, and in the Colors 
tab you can choose to either use specific layer-based color IDs or use the true color RGB  
values assigned in your Revit project. Let’s take a quick look at the remaining tabs and their 
importance.
Solids
In the Solids tab, you have the option to select either Polymesh or ACIS Solids for exporting 
of 3D views. For cleaner solid geometry exporting, we recommend the ACIS Solids option; 
however, this will likely result in larger file size upon export.

Exporting 2D CAD Data |  263  
Units & Coordinates
One of the most important settings is Coordinate System Basis, which can be found in the Units 
& Coordinates tab. This option will affect the ability of your exported files to be properly aligned 
with other project files. Refer back to Chapter 6 for more information on using shared coordinates.
General
Finally, the General tab (Figure 7.26) contains some additional options such as assignment of 
non-plottable layers, exporting space boundaries, and default export file options.
Figure 7.26
General options allow 
further customization 
of CAD exports.
At this time, you can click the Cancel button to close both active dialog boxes. In the next 
section, you will return to these settings and save a configuration to be applied to the export 
process.
Exporting 2D CAD Data
When you are collaborating with others who require 2D CAD, developing a planned strategy 
will allow you to share your Revit data more efficiently and consistently. We highly recommend 
that you determine and document the scope of data to be shared, the schedule by which the files 
will be shared (when and how often), and the software platforms to be used on a project. These 
aspects should be compiled in a BIM execution plan, as explained in Chapter 6.
To facilitate the setup and ultimate export of plan data, you can create copies of floor plans 
and ceiling plans with a standardized naming convention in your Revit project. These should 
be easy to recognize, and they help in building the export list. Figure 7.27 shows a series of 
duplicated plans that have been created and assigned to the floor plan type named Export. The 
view name conforms to the naming convention specified by the United States National CAD 
Standard (www.nationalcadstandard.org).

264  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
Figure 7.27
View organization for 
plans to be exported
In the following exercise, you will continue to use the c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt 
project file while using the saved list of views you created in the “Preparing a List of Views for 
Exporting” exercise:
	
1.	 From the Application menu, click Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ DWG. In the DWG Export 
dialog box, make sure PLANS is selected in the Export drop-down. Click the Modify 
Export Setup ellipsis button (three dots) at the top of the dialog box.
	
2.	 In the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box, select the New Export Setup button 
from the bottom left to create a new export setup. Name the new export setup British 
Plans with Phase.
	
3.	 In the Layers tab, set the Export Layer Options drop-down list to Export Category 
Properties BYLAYER And Overrides BYENTITY. Locate the Load Layers From Standards 
drop-down list and select British Standard 1192. You will receive an error message stating 
that loading these settings will replace your previous settings. Click Yes to accept.
	
4.	 While still in the Layers tab, click the Add/Edit Modifiers For All button. In the Add/
Edit Layer Modifiers dialog box (Figure 7.28), add the {Phase Status} modifier from the 
list at the left to the Modifiers Added list at the right. Next to {Multiple Categories} in 
the Separator column, add a hyphen. The preview above should now read {Multiple 
Categories}-{Phase Status}. Click OK to close this dialog box.
Figure 7.28

5.	 Switch to the Units & Coordinates tab and set the Coordinate System Basis to Shared by 
clicking the radio button. Click OK to close the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog 
box.
	
6.	 Click the Next button to continue the exporting process. In the Export CAD Formats–
Save To Target Folder dialog box, set the Naming drop-down list to Automatic–Short. 
This will create files named similarly to FloorPlan-A-FP01.dwg.
	
7.	 Uncheck the Export Views On Sheets And Links As External References setting. 
Although this setting does not affect this exercise, we discuss its importance after the 
exercise.
	
8.	 Select an appropriate location on your computer or your network for the exported files 
and then click OK to complete the export process.
Unfortunately, you cannot customize the naming of the exported files when you export 
more than one view in a batch process. That said, any kind of file-renaming tool can 
be used to remove the prefix FloorPlan- from exported files using the Automatic–Short 
option.
There is one more option that you should understand in the exporting process. In the final 
Export CAD Formats dialog box, you will see the option to Export Views On Sheets And Links 
As External References. When this option is checked and you are exporting sheet views, any 
views that are placed on those sheets will be exported as separate files. Those files will then be 
configured as external references (Xrefs) in the exported sheets. If you also have other RVT files 
linked into your current model, they too will be exported as separate CAD files and configured 
as Xrefs in the exported files.
We recommend that you deselect the External Reference option during exporting unless it 
is absolutely necessary. The exporting process will result in fewer files and more portable and 
predictable results for the recipients of your exported data.
Exporting 3D Model Data
In the previous section, we showed you how to export 2D views to CAD formats, which will 
support more traditional collaboration work flows. You can also export your Revit project as a 
3D model in several formats for use in other modeling software. A frequent destination for such 
data is Autodesk® Navisworks® software for its enhanced coordination with contractors during 
construction. This workflow is supported by a free Navisworks plug-in to Revit that will allow 
you to export your models as NWC files, which Navisworks uses. More generic exports in DWG, 
DGN, DXF, or SAT formats can provide numerous opportunities for you to become more cre-
ative with the presentation of your designs.
Exporting to SketchUp
Previously in this chapter we discussed using SketchUp for conceptual building massing  
studies. These studies were imported directly into the Revit environment for further develop-
ment of a true building information model. Revit model data can also be exported via 3D DWG 
to SketchUp, where visualization studies can be conducted on an entire project or even a simple 
wall section.
In the following exercise, we will export a wall section study from the Revit environment to 
SketchUp using files you can download from this book’s web page. To complete this exercise, 
you will need to download SketchUp from www.sketchup.com and install it.

266  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
To begin the exercise, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the file c07-Sketchup-Wall-Study.rvt.
	
2.	 Activate the Default 3D view and enable the Section Box option in the Properties palette 
for the view.
	
3.	 Set the detail level of the view to Medium or Fine.
	
4.	 Select the section box in the 3D view, and shape handles will appear on each face. Grab 
the shape handle of one side of the section box parallel to the vertical edge of the wall 
sample, and drag toward the wall until the section box intersects the wall, as shown in 
Figure 7.29.
You should see the layers of the wall structure exposed.

5.	 With the section box still selected, right-click and choose Hide In View ➢ Elements.
This will prevent the section box from being exported.
	
6.	 Click the Application menu and select Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ DWG Files. Set the 
Export drop-down list to <Current View/Sheet Only>.
	
7.	 Click the Modify Export Setup ellipsis button to open the Modify DWG/DXF Export 
Setup dialog box. In the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box, switch to the Solids 

Exporting 3D Model Data |  267  
tab and set the option to Polymesh. Click OK to close the Modify DWG/DXF Export 
Setup dialog box.
	
8.	 Click Next and set the Files Of Type drop-down to AutoCAD 2013 DWG Files. Select a 
location on your computer or network, and then click OK to save the file.
	
9.	 Launch SketchUp, and choose File ➢ Import.
	
10.	 Switch the Files Of Type option to AutoCAD Files, navigate to the file saved in step 8, and 
click Open.
	
11.	 Switch to the Select tool, select the entire DWG import, right-click, and choose Explode.
This will allow you to directly edit the elements in the SketchUp environment. Other compo-
nents within the exploded model may need to be exploded again.
Once the DWG model is loaded in SketchUp, you can use the Paint Bucket tool to apply materi-
als to individual components, use the Push/Pull tool to hide or expose layers of the wall construc-
tion, and use the line tools to customize the profile of the revealed layers, as shown in Figure 7.30.

Using IFC Interoperability
Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are the data model standard developed by buildingSMART 
International to support interoperability in the building industry. The IFC model specification is 
registered by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as ISO/PAS 16739 and is currently 
in the process of becoming the official International Standard ISO/IS 16739. Because of its focus 
using AutoCAD MEP will usually manage their BIM with one model file per level. Even though the 
entire architectural model can be exported to a single DWG model, they may not be able to refer-
ence such a large model efficiently. The good news? Your Revit project can be set up to achieve this 
by creating 3D views with section boxes for each level.
Begin by creating a series of floor plans designed for exporting (discussed previously in this chap-
ter). In the View Range settings for these plans, set the Top value to Level Above, Offset: 0 and the 
Bottom value to Associated Level, Offset: 0. Create a 3D view for each level required in the project 
and rename the views according to your standards. In each duplicated 3D view, right-click the 
ViewCube®, select Orient To View ➢ Floor Plans, and choose the corresponding floor plan with the 
adjusted view range. This series of 3D views can be saved in an export list and batch-exported to 
3D DWG when needed for collaboration, as shown here:

Importing IFC data into the Revit environment is similar to the process for importing 3D 
CAD geometry; however, the data generated is intended to be more intelligent and editable. 
Although this method has great potential, the accuracy of the Revit IFC import is highly 
dependent on the software used to generate the IFC output. We recommend the use of one 
of the free IFC viewers listed previously to inspect IFC data prior to importing into a Revit 
project.

270  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
After you’ve reviewed the contents of the IFC file, you can link it into a Revit project and 
integrate it into your coordination process as follows:
	
1.	 Start a new project with any default template. From the Insert tab in the ribbon, click on 
Link IFC.
	
2.	 Navigate to the c07-Structure.ifc file and click Open.
	
3.	 Save the project file.
	
4.	 Open the default 3D view and inspect the linked geometry.
If an updated IFC file is received, overwrite the linked file you used in the previous steps. 
When the host project file is reopened, the linked IFC content will be updated.
Downloading and Customizing the Open Source IFC Exporter
In addition to offering a basic IFC export command in the default installation of Revit, Autodesk 
has been developing an improved IFC exporter on the website SourceForge.net (http://
sourceforge.net/projects/ifcexporter). Anyone can download the source code for this 
exporter and contribute to its development. This allows a larger international community to pro-
vide input on the improvement of this important feature.
The open source exporter consists of two separate downloads and installations: the exporter 
and a custom export UI. After they are installed, you can still launch the IFC export command 
from the Application menu; however, you will see a new Export IFC dialog box (Figure 7.32). 
Much like the CAD export process we described earlier in this chapter, this interface allows you 
to create, customize, and save export setups.
Viewing the Contents of an IFC Format File
Did you know that an IFC file can be viewed in a text editor such as Notepad? Download a sample 
file from the book’s companion web page and check it out! Right-click an IFC file, select Open With, 
and choose Notepad.

For advanced IFC exporting options, choose the Modify Setup dialog box in Figure 7.32. 
There are several tabs across the top of this dialog box that allow you to customize the IFC 
export setup (Figure 7.33). In addition to the predefined export configurations, you can create 
and save your own setups that will be maintained in the Revit project file.
Figure 7.33
Customize and save 
IFC export setups
An excellent resource for IFC interoperability in Revit is the buildingSMART alliance web page 
for Common Building Information Model Files (www.nibs.org/?page=bsa_commonbimfiles). 
You can download sample files as well as a configuration guide with additional instructions 
related to customizing IFC exports from Revit.
Classifying IFC Export Settings
Because exporting to IFC format is about converting one model format to another, settings are 
not related to layer conversions, linetypes, or text, as they are in a CAD export. Rather, it is criti-
cal to correctly map the logic of the Revit model organization to the open data standard. In other 
words, model object categories must be mapped to IFC entities; for example, walls in Revit will 
be exported as IfcWall entities. This translation seems quite logical for walls and other objects, 
but consider an electric receptacle. Such a device would be categorized in Revit as an Electrical 
Fixture; however, it is classified as IfcFlowTerminal in the open standard. Entities are further 
refined with types—in this case, IfcFlowTerminalType—that would help distinguish an electric 
receptacle from other IfcFlowTerminal entities such as a faucet or an air diffuser.
The schema of the currently released standard (IFC4) can be viewed at www.buildingsmart-
tech.org, the portal for the Model Support Group and Implementation Support Group. 
Although IFC4 is the currently released standard, many workflows still use IFC2x3, including 
native export from Revit software. If you work with IFC export and import regularly in the 
Revit environment, you should become familiar with some of the common classifications in the 
IFC schema. You’ll find the IFC2x3 IFC4 schema indexes here:
www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x3/TC1/html/index.htm
www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC4/final/html/index.htm
Click Alphabetical Listing and then Entities, and you will be able to browse through some of 
the most common IFC classifications related to building elements. For example, find and click 
IfcCovering, and you will see that this classification is used for wall claddings, flooring, and 
suspended ceilings.

One aspect of the Revit project model that can be exported to IFC is a structural grid. These 
datum objects are beneficial to the coordination process if you are using Solibri Model Checker 
or Viewer or Tekla BIMsight; however, they are not exported if you use the default IFC export 
settings in Revit. Let’s solve that problem with a quick exercise. You can continue to use the 
c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt file.
	
1.	 From the Application menu, click Export ➢ Options ➢ IFC Options.
You might need to scroll down the Export menu to see the Options flyout.
	
2.	 In the IFC Export Classes dialog box (Figure 7.34), find the entry for Grids and set the 
IFC Class Name to IfcGrid. You must manually enter any IFC entities and types into this 
dialog box; therefore, you should always refer to the buildingSMART website for accurate 
classifications.
Figure 7.34
Customize the mapping 
of Revit categories to 
IFC entities.
	
3.	 Click OK to close the IFC Export Classes dialog box.
You can save the IFC mappings to a text file for use in other projects.
	
4.	 From the Application menu, click Export ➢ IFC. If you are not using the custom IFC 
exporter that we discussed earlier in this chapter, simply set the export file type to 
IFC2×3 and save the file to your computer or network.
	
5.	 Open the IFC file in an application such as Solibri Model Checker or Viewer, and you will 
be able to see the Revit grid lines in the model-only exported format.

Exporting 3D Model Data |  273  
There are two other methods to customize the classification mappings for IFC. One is to 
use subcategories in families. As an example, a Revit family created for an elevator has been 
assigned to the Generic Models category; however, a subcategory named Elevators was created 
in the family (Figure 7.35).
Figure 7.35
Create subcategories in 
a family for customized 
classification.
After the elevator family is loaded into a project, the new subcategories can be assigned to 
an appropriate IFC classification. Click the Application menu, and then click Export ➢ Options 
➢ IFC Options to open the IFC Export Classes dialog box. Locate the Revit category for Generic 
Models and you will also see the Elevators subcategory, as shown in Figure 7.36. For IFC Class 
Name, enter IfcTransportElement and for Type, enter IfcTransportElementType, and you will be 
ready to export your project with the additional object classifications.

274  | Chapter 7  Interoperability: Working Multiplatform   
The second method of classification customization is to use two specific shared parameters 
associated with a family. These parameters must be named IfcExportType and IfcExportAs, as 
shown in Figure 7.37, but they can simply be selected from a shared parameters file downloaded 
from the Common BIM Files web page mentioned previously in this chapter. When these fami-
lies are loaded into and placed in a project, the IFC classifications will be automatically mapped 
according to the values specified in these parameters.

Subcategories can be 
mapped directly to IFC 
classifications.

 Modeling and Massing 
for Design 
 In Part 2, we covered the topics that help you defi ne important project standards when using 
Autodesk ® Revit ® software—within your team as well as across external teams with other 
consultants. In this part, we’ll delve into the use of Revit from the earliest design stages to analysis, 
iteration, and fi nally visualization.

 Chapter  8 
 advanced Modeling and Massing 
 Every design starts with an idea. That can be shapes drawn out on trace paper, or a chipboard 
model, or a conceptual form in a 3D model. This idea becomes the basis for your design and 
ultimately your building. Although you might sketch out several variations to give your ideas 
shape, there comes a point in the design process where you need to begin testing your assump-
tions. Does the fl oor plan fi t within the building’s massing? Does it meet the client’s functional 
requirements? Is the design energy effi cient? 
 Massing is a set of unique tools within Autodesk® Revit® software specifi cally created for 
this kind of early design analysis. By creating the “big” design idea at a macro level, you’re 
able to quickly and easily quantify and analyze the results. This allows you to confi dently 
work from general to specifi c as your design progresses, without concern about actual building 
elements. 
 In addition, the massing tools allow you to create forms and containers to control other 
building system components. Complex walls, curtain walls, curtain panels, and other elements 
would be incredibly diffi cult to make and update without some underlying form to establish 
and drive their design. 
 Even though your overall design might not be represented by a complex massing form, it’s 
likely that somewhere in a more conventional design, massing is essential to the success of your 
project. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

 Th e Massing User Interface and Functionality 
 A  mass is simply a form with geometric substance (solids and voids) that is not related to any 
specifi c building element category. It is intended to allow designers to create a lightweight com-
ponent that can either represent an entire building or serve as a guide for a single component, 
such as a complex roof form. When you create a mass in the context of a whole building, you can 
quantify the surface area, assign functional “fl oors” to the mass, and perform energy analysis—
all without creating a single wall, fl oor, window, or roof. 

280  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
After you create a whole-building mass, you can use By Face versions of commands to place 
system families such as walls, floors, and roofs. When these elements are placed by face, they 
retain a relationship to the mass elements. The associated building elements are not updated 
automatically, which means you can freely explore design alternatives to the massing. Once you 
are confident of your final design decision, the building elements can be updated to match the 
changes in the underlying mass.
Another important thing to know about massing is that masses can be created in either the 
project environment or the Family Editor. Much of the functionality overlaps in each case, so 
what’s the difference between the two?
The main difference as to whether you create massing in place or in the Family Editor 
doesn’t depend on the kind of shape or surface you want to create. Solid and surface forms 
can be created in both the project and Family Editor environments. Rather, it depends on 
how you want to create the massing and how you want to change the mass once it’s been 
created.
Using in-place masses gives you the ability to model in the context of other surround-
ings (Figure 8.1). For example, you may be proposing an addition to an existing ­building 
or a new building on an existing campus. You may need to create a complex shape for 
a feature wall or a roof form, and you therefore need the context of the rest of your 
building design.
Figure 8.1
Building massing in 
the context of an exist-
ing neighborhood
Creating a mass in the Family Editor gives you a slightly different user interface (UI) 
(Figure 8.2). When you create a Conceptual Mass family, you have the ability to see work 
planes and levels in 3D views; however, these references are not in the context of your project 
environment. In addition to the lack of context in the Family Editor, to make changes to 
massing, you must reload the mass families into your project for face-based elements and 
schedules to update.

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  281  
Let’s take a moment to clarify the difference between in-place component modeling and 
massing. If you need to create a custom-shaped building element, such as the wall shown in 
Figure 8.3, you would use the Model In-Place command. You would set the category to Walls 
and then use either a blend or a sweep to generate the form of the wall. You’ll notice in the 
figure that the sectional dimensions of the wall are not consistent.
Figure 8.2
Building massing in 
the Family Editor
Figure 8.3
Custom-shaped wall as 
an in-place element
If you wanted to use a wall assembly with consistent sectional dimensions but configure 
the wall in a complex vertical layout, you would create a mass and then use the Wall By Face 
command. In the example shown in Figure 8.4, a generic wall is applied to the face of a mass 
that was created by generating a surface between two splines.

282  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
The rest of this chapter will focus solely on the creation of masses for the purpose of whole-
building design. You can learn more about component modeling tools in Chapter 14, “Designing 
with the Family Editor.”
Creating Mass Geometry
How you create masses (surface or solid) differs significantly from the UI used to create other 
standard family content. When you’re creating standard project content, you have specific 
geometry tools such as Extrusion and Sweep (Figure 8.5). In some ways, this is a noun-verb 
approach: You select a tool for the form that you want to create and then you take action to 
create it.
Figure 8.4
Standard wall type 
applied to the face of 
a mass
Figure 8.5
Non-massing form-creation 
tools
Creating a mass still requires that you know the form that you intend to create, but you’re 
not required to select a particular form type to get started. Rather, you start by simply creating 
the sketch-based elements that would define your shape. Then you select them as a group and 
choose the Create Form tool (Figure 8.6). This will allow you to create both solids and voids.
Figure 8.6
The Create Form tool

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  283  
Both solid and surface may be created from model lines or reference lines; however, the dif-
ferences are important. Keep in mind that your ability to further iterate the form that you create 
depends on whether you use model or reference lines to generate the form, even though the 
forms created may look exactly the same at first.
If your intent is to simply create a form that is not likely to require rule-based parameteriza-
tion, using model lines is fine. Model lines are consumed by the form after you use the Create 
Form tool. In other words, the only way to get back to your original sketch form is to dissolve 
the shape. But if you intend to control the form with formulas and other parameters, it’s best to 
start with reference lines. Figure 8.7 shows the subtle graphic difference between the two line 
types. The model line shape is on the left, and the green reference lines are on the right. You will 
also notice that when reference lines are selected, they have much more capability to serve as 
multidimensional references for hosting other geometry.
Figure 8.7
Model lines and 
reference lines
Because the difference is so subtle on the screen, we recommend that you give your reference 
lines more thickness and lighten the default green color so that they stand out better, and make 
that a part of your project template.
Creating an In-Place Mass
Now that you are familiar with the difference between massing for components and whole-
building massing, let’s look closer at the important capabilities that will help you develop 
building designs. Download and open the file c08-Massing-1-Start.rvt or c08-Massing-1-
Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s website at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. In 
this section, we will create some simple mass forms, generate mass floors, and then build sched-
ule views to quantify the results. After you open either file, activate the Level 1 floor plan before 
starting the exercise.
Whether you create masses in place or in the Family Editor, you’re able to generate floor faces 
(not the actual floors) and schedule important metadata before you’ve even begun to assign actual 
geometry to the masses. This is important to do early in the design process because the masses 

284  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
will be “light” in your project—they won’t have a drastically negative impact on performance. 
Use them to establish your overall design idea and get a general idea for building size and area.
In-place mass forms can be both solid- and surface-based forms; however, masses that con-
tain only surfaces cannot be analyzed for any sort of volumetric quantities. You can start an in-
place mass in one of two ways: The first way is to select the Architecture tab in the ribbon, and 
on the Build panel, choose the Component ➢ Model In-Place command.
When you select this option, the Family Category And Parameters dialog box appears 
(Figure 8.8). You will be able to use the other massing tools only if the in-place component is 
assigned to the proper category. Be sure to select the Mass category and click OK.
Figure 8.8
Selecting the Mass 
category
Where Are My Massing Tools?
If you don’t see the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, you might need to activate it. In some instal-
lations, these tools are deactivated by default. In the Application menu, click Options and then 
select User Interface. Make sure that the Massing & Site Tab And Tools option is checked.

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  285  
The other way to create an in-place mass is to select the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and 
from the Conceptual mass panel, choose the In-Place Mass command. In either case, when you 
start to create the mass, you’ll want to have the Mass category visible (it’s turned off by default 
in all views). Rather than confuse you by allowing you to create objects that wouldn’t be visible, 
the software prompts you to turn the category on (Figure 8.9).
Figure 8.9
Enabling the Show 
Mass mode
Once you close this dialog box, you’ll be given the opportunity to name your in-place mass. 
In this case, you’re going to name the mass Cube (Figure 8.10).
Figure 8.10
Naming the mass
After you’ve named the mass from the previous steps and clicked OK, you’ll be shown the 
Massing toolset for in-place families. The Create tab contains the tools that you’ll use to create 
solid and void geometry as well as surface-generated masses.
In the following exercise, we will create a cube, pyramid, and sphere (Figure 8.11) to demon-
strate some uses for masses. Starting with the cube, its dimensions are 100′ × 100′ × 100′ (about 
30 m × 30 m × 30 m). The base of the pyramid is the same size as the cube, with equal sides 
tapering to the same height. The sphere is the same width as the cube.
Figure 8.11
Cube, pyramid, and 
sphere masses

286  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
You’ve already started the command with either the Model In-Place or In-Place Mass command. 
The next step will be to create the 3D geometry inside the family. Mass geometry is created in a two-
step process: First, create the 2D shape of the object; then use the Create Form tool to generate the 3D 
geometry. This process is different from typical modeling software applications because it does not 
require you to choose a specific modeling command before you begin to explore your design.
Now, let’s get into the details with the following steps:
	
1.	 For the cube, you’ll first need to sketch a square in a plan view. From the Create tab in the ribbon, 
in the Draw panel, use the Line or Rectangle tool to sketch a 100′ × 100′ (30 m × 30 m) square.
	
2.	 Activate the default 3D view, and then click the Modify button in the ribbon. Select the 
lines you sketched in the previous step. You may need to press the Tab key to ensure that 
all four lines of the square are selected. From the contextual tab in the ribbon, choose the 
Create Form flyout tool from the Form panel, and choose Solid Form. You will see a dimen-
sion in the 3D view that indicates the default height of the extrusion. Click the dimension 
value and then type 100′ (30 m) and press Enter on the keyboard to set the desired height.
	
3.	 In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Finish Mass.
	
4.	 Return to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, and then click In-Place Mass. Name the 
next mass Sphere.
	
5.	 From the Create panel in the ribbon, select the Circle tool from the Draw panel. In the 
Options bar, set the Placement Plane to Level : Midpoint. Set the Radius to 50′ (15 m).
You may get a warning that the elements are not visible in the current view. That’s fine 
for now; continue to the next step.
	
6.	 In a 3D view, click the Modify button in the ribbon, and then select the circle. From the 
contextual tab in the ribbon, choose Create Form ➢ Solid Form. This will pop up two 
visual options for you (Figure 8.12). One will allow you to simply extrude the circle and 
create a cylinder; the other will allow you to create a sphere. Choose the Sphere option.
Figure 8.12

(b)

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  287  
	
7.	 In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Finish Mass.
	
8.	 Once again, return to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, and then click In-Place Mass. 
Name the next mass Pyramid. For this shape, you will need to sketch a square in plan 
and a triangle in elevation before you use the Create Form tool.
	
9.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan and sketch a square that measures 100′ × 100′ (30 m × 30 m). 
From the Draw panel in the ribbon, click the Plane tool. Draw two reference planes—one 
for each centerline of the square you just sketched (Figure 8.13). Select the horizontal refer-
ence plane, and in the Properties palette set the Name value to Pyramid Ctr.
Figure 8.13
Draw two reference 
planes in the pyramid 
sketch
	
10.	 Activate the South elevation view. From the Draw panel in the ribbon, click the Line tool. 
You will be prompted to select a work plane. Choose the Name option, and from the drop-
down list select Reference Plane : Pyramid Ctr. Sketch a triangle as shown in Figure 8.14. 
Make sure to use intersection and endpoint snapping to make the base of the triangle in 
line with Level 1 and at the intersection of the Top level and the vertical reference plane.
Figure 8.14
Sketch a triangle in 
elevation.

288  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
11.	 In a 3D view, click the Modify button in the ribbon. Select both the square and the tri-
angle, and then select Create From ➢ Solid Form from the contextual tab in the ribbon. 
The Create Form command will detect that the most likely configuration of these two 
2D shapes is to sweep the triangle along the square path, thus forming a pyramid. Click 
Finish Mass in the contextual tab of the ribbon, and you will see the three masses that 
you’ve created: cube, pyramid, and sphere (Figure 8.15).
Figure 8.15
Cube, pyramid, and 
sphere.
As each form was finished, the in-place mass was completed, and the process was repeated 
for each new mass. In the Project Browser, locate the Families branch and the Mass category. 
Expand the branch and you will see each mass as a separate item.
Placing a Mass
Continuing with the previous exercise, you will now load and place a mass family. There are 
many premade families in the default libraries for Revit software. We have already loaded a 
mass family in the project files for this exercise. Continue with the c08-Massing-1-Start.rvt 
or c08-Massing-1-Start-Metric.rvt file by following these steps:
	
1.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan. Switch to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and click 
Place Mass. In the Type Selector, make sure that either Gable or M_Gable is selected.
	
2.	 Click an area to the right of the mass forms you created in the previous exercise steps. 
Click the Modify button in the ribbon and then select the Gable mass you just placed.
	
3.	 In the Properties palette, set the following values:
Width: 100′ (30 m)
Depth: 100′ (30 m)
Height: 100′ (30 m)
Eave Height: 50′ (15 m)

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  289  
When you switch back to a 3D view, you will see the Gable mass family in the same context 
as the in-place masses you created previously (Figure 8.16). All of the mass forms will function 
similarly as you assign mass floors, place building elements by face, and create schedules. The 
main difference is that to edit the geometry of the placed mass, you must do so by changing the 
values in the Properties palette. Keep in mind that you may also load a different mass family 
and swap one shape for another. You cannot swap an in-place family for a loaded family.
Figure 8.16
The Gable mass family 
is placed and modified.
Creating Mass Floors
Once you have created some solid mass forms, it’s important to understand how to create mass 
floors. The Mass Floors dialog box allows you to generate some quick floor plates and get a 
rough idea of the floor areas available in your masses. This technique will work equally well 
with in-place masses or loaded mass families.
To create mass floors, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Activate the South elevation view. Use the Copy tool from the Modify tab in the ribbon to 
create more levels in addition to the three provided in the exercise file. Place the copied 
levels at intervals of 10′ (1500 mm), so you have a total of 10 levels (Figure 8.17).
Figure 8.17
Create multiple 
intersecting levels
	
2.	 In a 3D view, select all the masses and click the Mass Floors button in the contextual tab 
of the ribbon.
	
3.	 In the Mass Floors dialog box, check the boxes for all the available levels. This allows you 
to assign a conceptual floor plate wherever each selected level intersects a mass form. 
Click OK to close the dialog box.
Wherever the selected levels intersect the mass forms, floor faces will be generated, as shown 
in Figure 8.18. Now the masses and floor faces can be calculated and scheduled. If you select 

290  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
any one of the masses and observe the parameters in the Properties palette, you will see that 
Gross Floor Area now reports an area that will change depending on how many mass floors are 
assigned to that mass.
Figure 8.18
Floor area faces assigned 
to mass forms
Scheduling Masses
With the mass floors created, you can now schedule them and begin to understand what kinds 
of areas you have for floor plates in these shapes. Remember, you can do this exercise with any 
type of mass shape, and it can be a great way to validate your building’s program against a vari-
ety of building forms.
Let’s continue with the exercise by following these steps:
	
1.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules ➢ Schedule/Quantities, and you’ll be 
given the option to schedule the Mass category itself or various subcategories, including 
Mass Floor (Figure 8.19). Select Mass, and we’ll schedule the masses so we can do a com-
parative analysis between the different mass types.
Figure 8.19
Creating a schedule

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  291  
	
2.	 Select the fields Family, Gross Floor Area, Gross Surface Area, and Gross Volume, as 
shown in Figure 8.20. Add them to the Scheduled Fields table by clicking the Add 
Parameter(s) button.
Figure 8.20
Scheduled fields
Add parameter(s)
Remove parameter(s)
Calculated value
For this example, we’ll also show you how to create two calculated values. This will allow 
you to calculate the overall volume of each mass compared to the floor area, as well as the 
overall surface area compared to the floor area. Schedules like this will be helpful during 
the early design process to help you understand how efficient the space of your design is 
compared to the volume and surface area required to contain that space. Follow these steps:
	
a.	 Click the Calculated Value button in the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog 
box, and name the new calculated value Volume to Floor Ratio, as shown in Figure 8.21. 
In the Formula area, enter the following formula, and be sure to use the correct case: 
(Gross Volume / 1) / Gross Floor Area. In metric units, the formula is (Gross Volume / 1m) 
/ Gross Floor Area. To keep the units consistent, you divide the gross volume by 1′ (1 m) 
before dividing by the gross floor area. Click OK to accept the formula.
Figure 8.21
Create a calculated value 
for volume-to-floor ratio.

292  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
b.	 To create your next calculated value, click the Calculated Value button again and name 
this formula Surface to Floor Ratio. In the Formula box, enter the following formula 
and again be sure to maintain the correct case: Gross Surface Area / Gross Floor Area. 
Once you’ve entered the formula, click OK (Figure 8.22).
Figure 8.22
Create a calculated value 
for the surface-to-floor 
ratio.
The finished schedule is shown in Figure 8.23. Notice that, proportionally, a sphere and a 
cube have efficient floor areas compared to their corresponding surface area and volume.
Figure 8.23
Completed schedule
On the other hand, the pyramid mass will require significantly more surface and volume to 
create the same relative surface area as a cube or a sphere; thus, a pyramid takes far more sur-
face area than a cube to contain the same amount of space.
You can download the finished file from the book’s web page. It’s in the Chapter 8 folder and 
is named c08-Massing-1-Finished.rvt.
Massing Surfaces
Now that we have discussed how to create or place solid mass forms, let’s review some of the 
ways in which you can generate massing surfaces. Similar to the process of creating a solid 
massing form, you can select one or more lines and then use the Create Form tool to generate a 
surface. Figure 8.24 shows a number of reference line types you can create with the Draw tools: 
Spline Through Points, Spline, Curve, and Line.

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  293  
As you can see in Figure 8.25, each of these reference lines has different control points that 
allow for further control.
Figure 8.24
Reference line segment 
types
Figure 8.25
Reference line control 
points
Because these are not closed loops, the form that will generate from each of these segments 
will only be a surface (Figure 8.26). You generate the form by selecting each of the lines (one at a 
time, not together) and then selecting Create Form ➢ Solid Form.
Figure 8.26
Surface forms

294  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
You can also create surface-based forms from more than one line at a time. The result is a 
surface that can be controlled in more complex ways than a single line.
Take the Spline Through Points line, for example. The form on the left in Figure 8.27 creates 
a face that is controlled by a single reference line, whereas the form on the right is a face 
controlled by two (and it could be more) reference lines.
Figure 8.27
Surfaces based on multiple 
splines
Moving the location of the control points on the form on the left maintains a consistent height 
to the top of the surface previously generated, whereas moving the control points of the surface 
on the right creates a surface that varies in height (Figure 8.28).
Figure 8.28
Single and multi-spline 
surfaces
After a surface is generated, it’s also possible to add more profiles, as illustrated by Figure 8.29. 
A profile is basically a joint in the form, allowing for another control location. Any profile you 
add will respond in the same way the edges of the mass respond, by allowing you to modify  
and manipulate both them and their location. We’ll demonstrate how to use this tool and the rest 
of the Form Element panel later in the chapter. For now, we’ll step through some of the tools so  
you can get an understanding of the relationship of tool to form and see how quickly you can  
create forms.

The Massing User Interface and Functionality |  295  
After the profile was added, it was moved to create a bulge in the surface (far right shown in 
Figure 8.30).

Figure 8.30
Moved profile
The fourth iteration of the form was created by selecting the surface and then choosing the 
Dissolve tool in the contextual tab of the ribbon. This removed the surface but left us with all the 
references used to create the form.

296  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
Once the face was dissolved, another reference called Spline Through Points was added 
between the upper and lower reference splines. The result is shown in Figure 8.31.
Figure 8.31
Additional spline 
added
Selecting all three references and then choosing the Create Form tool stitched them all into a 
new single-surface form (Figure 8.32).
Figure 8.32
New surface form
Selecting the points within the middle reference allowed for even more complex surface 
control (Figure 8.33).

Figure 8.33
Edited center spline
Keep in mind that selecting lines or shapes to create forms is a sequential operation (when it’s 
not in a closed loop). Window-selecting all the splines and then creating the surface will result 
in very different forms than if you were to sequentially select adjacent splines (Figure 8.34). The 
result is that the surface form isn’t interpolated as smooth between the upper and lower splines. 
Instead, a distinct edge is created between the two splines.
Figure 8.34
Spline-based surfaces
As you can see, it’s easy to create complex surface forms using reference lines. Now let’s 
begin to create complex forms using reference planes.
Using Free-form Building Massing
Now that you are familiar with the basic functionality of the massing tools, let’s learn how to 
generate and explore building forms in an informal way. The exercise in this section will build 
on the skills you learned in the previous section, and you will learn how to directly manipulate 
solid geometry using grips, gizmos, and dimensions.
Start by downloading and opening either c08-Massing-2-Start.rvt or c08-Massing-2-
Start-Metric.rvt from the book’s web page. Begin the exercise by following these steps:
	
1.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan. From the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, click In-Place 
Mass and name the new family Mass 1.

298  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
2.	 From the Draw panel in the ribbon, choose the Rectangle tool. In the Options bar, check 
the box to make a surface from closed loops. Sketch a rectangle that is approximately 40′ × 
90′ (12 m × 28 m). Specific dimensions are not important; it’s more about the proportions.
	
3.	 Open the Default 3D view, and click the Modify button in the ribbon. Hover the mouse 
pointer over one of the lines in the rectangle sketch. Press the Tab key until you see Form: 
Form Element displayed in the status bar. Select the form element and you will see con-
trols that allow you to pull the surface into a solid (Figure 8.35). Using the control point-
ing in the up direction, press and drag it until the form is about 140′ (43 m) tall.
Figure 8.35
Creating a solid form
There are a number of shape handles that allow you to modify each face, edge, and 
intersection. Simply hovering over each face, edge, and vertex will highlight the appropri-
ate control. You can also press the Tab key on the keyboard to select the desired control. 
We’ll step through some of the selections to give you an idea of what the controls for the 
faces, sides, and points look like.
	
4.	 Starting with any vertical face, select it and you’ll be given the control shown in Figure 8.36.
Figure 8.36
Face control

Using Free-form Building Massing |  299  
	
5.	 Select an edge and you will have the ability to move the edge of a form in multiple 
directions (Figure 8.37).
Figure 8.37
Edge control
	
6.	 Select the point at the intersection of several edges. You will likely need to press the Tab key to 
select a corner point. This control allows you to modify the location of a vertex (Figure 8.38).
Figure 8.38
Vertex control

300  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
The control arrow allows you to modify the selected element parallel to the direction of 
the arrow, whereas the angled indicators of the same colors as their corresponding arrows 
allow you to modify the location of the selected element perpendicular to the arrow.
There are also some tools to help you with the visualizations of the mass, especially as 
it gets more complex. One of these is the X-Ray tool, which will take a solid and turn it 
into a semitransparent form. Turn on X-Ray mode by selecting the form and clicking the 
X-Ray button on the Form Element panel. This will let you see any of the profiles and con-
trols on the other side of the object.
Now that X-Ray mode has been enabled, look at the options that are provided for turn-
ing a rather simple, extruded form into something complex. An edge may be added to an 
existing form from vertex to vertex or parallel with the trajectory of the form (shown as a 
dotted line from the upper to the lower face).
	
7.	 Click the Modify button in the ribbon, and then select the front face of the extruded mass 
you previously created. From the contextual tab in the ribbon, select Add Edge. As you 
mouse over the face you’ve selected, you’ll be given a ghosted line to locate the edge. 
Simply click to place it, as shown in Figure 8.39.
Figure 8.39
Adding an edge to 
a form
	
8.	 Once the edge has been added, you can push or pull the face adjacent to the new edge, as 
shown in Figure 8.40. Click the Modify button, and then select the face to the left of the 
edge you created in the previous step. Press and drag the green control arrow to move the 
face back into the extruded form.

Using Free-form Building Massing |  301  
	
9.	 Select the overall mass form again, and then click the Add Profile tool on the Form 
Element panel in the ribbon. You’ll get the same ghosted line as you did to create the 
edge, but this time it will be the circumference of your element—essentially representing 
the profile at that point. Click to place it as shown in Figure 8.41.

302  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
10.	 Again, click the Modify button in the ribbon, and then select the edge at the upper left 
of the extruded form. Use the green control arrow to pull the edge away from the mass 
form. Pushing or pulling a point or single edge will create curved and warped surfaces 
(Figure 8.42). This is fine because the form that you’re creating can be rationalized later 
when you are adding a pattern to the surface.
Figure 8.42
Pulling the edge to create 
a warped surface
	
11.	 Click the Add Edge button in the contextual tab of the ribbon, and then click the vertices 
indicated in Figure 8.43 in the order they are numbered. Doing so will force the warped 
faces to become triangulated and planar, because three points define a plane.

12.	 Select the edge at the upper right of the mass form and use the red control arrow to pull 
it away from the form, as shown in Figure 8.44. Again, it’s not necessary to maintain 
the exact dimensions of what you see here; it’s about trying to keep the proportions 
appropriate. This is what free-form massing is all about!
Figure 8.44
Pulling the upper edge
Dissolving and Rebuilding
Now, let’s say you have come to a point in your design exploration when you would like to 
simplify the mass form you’ve created and start exploring some other alternatives. The tool to 
perform this function is called Dissolve. Using the Dissolve function will remove the mass solid 
and leave behind the profiles that define the solid. The dot in the center of each plane is a control 
that will allow you to edit the elevation, rotation, and location of each profile.
Continue with the c08-Massing-2-Start.rvt or c08-Massing-2-Start-Metric.rvt file 
you used for the previous exercise, and follow these steps:
	
1.	 In a 3D view, select the entire form and then click Dissolve on the Form Element panel in 
the ribbon. Only the profiles will remain, as shown in Figure 8.45.
Escape the Madness
By now, you’re probably tired of constantly clicking the Modify button in the ribbon when you need 
to jump between commands to explore the free-form modeling processes. An easier solution is to 
simply press the Esc key to return to the Modify state.

304  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
2.	 Select all the remaining profiles and then click Create Form ➢ Solid Form. This will stitch 
the form back together in a way that interpolates the shape as more of a lofted blend 
(Figure 8.46). Once the new shape is created, you can add more profiles or edit the shape 
using the tools we just reviewed.
Figure 8.45
Using Dissolve to 
remove the mass solid
Figure 8.46
Making a lofted blend 
from three profiles
There are a few other ways to generate shapes using the profiles you just created. For 
instance, if you select only two profiles at a time, then you’ll get a form like the one in 
Figure 8.47. This form was created by first selecting the bottom and middle profiles and 
then creating the form. Then the middle and upper profiles were selected and another form 
was created. The result is straight—rather than curved—interpolation between the profiles.

Using Free-form Building Massing |  305  
Figure 8.47
Making a blend from 
two profiles at a time
As another way to generate form using these profiles, you can alter the shape of the pro-
files before you create the form again. In the next steps, you will delete the straight edges 
along one side of the profiles and then define a curved edge.
	
3.	 Start by deleting the existing edges along the right side (you’ll have to tab to select just 
the edges), as shown in Figure 8.48.
Figure 8.48
Deleting the right edge 
to modify the profile
Now you’ll want to draw a fillet arc to rejoin the two remaining edges. Before you can 
draw the arc, you first have to define the right work plane.
	
4.	 Click the Set command from the Work Plane panel. Highlight the control point in the 
center of the profile, and press the Tab key to cycle through your options until you get a 

306  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
work plane that is parallel to your profile (Figure 8.49). Click to select. Now you’ll be able 
to draw your arc on the proper plane.
Figure 8.49
Selecting the work 
plane
	
5.	 From the Draw panel in the ribbon, choose the Fillet Arc tool. Click each edge on either 
side of the open end, and then click again to set the arc in place. Once the work plane is 
selected, you’ll be able to draw additional model lines. In this example, you’re using a fil-
let arc to connect the lines. You’ll do the same thing for the other two shapes.
	
6.	 Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the other two profiles.
	
7.	 Select the lower two profiles and click Create Form ➢ Solid Form. Then do the same with 
the upper two profiles. Finally, you’ll want to remove any blends by adding an edge to the 
opposing edges.
Creating additional mass solids is easy. You can select an existing face, as shown in  
Figure 8.50, and then select the Create Form command.
Figure 8.50
Creating additional 
mass forms

Using Free-form Building Massing |  307  
Figure 8.51
Creating another form
The same tools were used to create the form shown in Figure 8.51. Click the Finish Mass com-
mand in the contextual tab of the ribbon and return to the regular project environment.
Once you’re out of In-Place Massing mode, you’ll notice that if you select the model, many 
shape handles simultaneously appear in the form of solid blue arrowheads (Figure 8.52). You 
can use shape handles to push and pull your solid mass, but you won’t be able to modify edges 
or vertices without reentering In-Place Massing mode.
Figure 8.52
Using shape handles
Figure 8.53 shows the finished mass in a perspective view. Both solids and voids can be used 
to complete a mass form. Whereas solids will add more geometry, voids will remove geometry 
from your mass.

308  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
Figure 8.53
The finished form
To demonstrate this, we’ll return to In-Place Massing mode and create another face on the 
top of the existing form (Figure 8.54).
Figure 8.54
Creating another form
Starting Voids as Solids
If you create the void as a void, it will immediately cut the solid mass and become invisible. This 
can be annoying when you’re trying to resolve your design and want to selectively cut after you’ve 
intuitively resolved a design idea. Fortunately, there’s another way to create the form as a void.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Rather than creating a void, start by creating a solid of a different color, to keep things 
clear during your design iteration. You can simply give the new solid a different material 
type to change the color.
	
2.	 Select the solid mass and convert it to a void by changing the Solid/Void property in the 
Properties palette, as shown in Figure 8.55.

Using Free-form Building Massing |  309  
Figure 8.56 shows the result of the void cutting the solid. Note how the form on the left side 
of the image has changed from Figure 8.53. Keep in mind that if you want to convert the void 
back to a solid, you’ll have to uncut any geometry that was being cut by the void. But the nice 
thing about this technique (converting solids to voids and then cutting) is that you’ve selectively 
cut only the solids that you wanted to cut. Had you originally modeled the void as a void, you 
would have found that the void was cutting many solids and you’d have had to uncut solids that 
weren’t even overlapping with the void!

310  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
Overall, creating solid masses intuitively is a great way to establish, analyze, and visualize 
your overall design idea. As you saw previously in the chapter, mass floors allow you to even 
quantify gross floor areas before you’ve committed to geometry.
Furthermore, it’s possible to put different intuitive massing ideas inside different design 
options (covered in Chapter 10, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options”) so that 
many ideas can live in a single Revit project file. Simply initiate worksharing and create work-
sets for each study mass. Multiple team members will be able to see one another’s work at the 
same time and in context with their design ideas. This is the holistic kind of team approach 
to design information that makes massing a unique and valuable design tool. If you’d like to 
investigate this file further, you can download the file c08-Massing-2-Finished.rvt from the 
Chapter 8 folder of the book’s web page.
Next, we’ll investigate parametric and formulaic solid mass creation in the Family Editor.
Creating Formula-Driven Massing
Formula-driven massing can be done in the project environment, but the challenge is that you 
have to work in the context of the project, and all the parameters, formulas, reference planes, 
and lines can start to get in the way. Therefore, having the option of creating form-driven 
masses in the Family Editor without the clutter of the project environment can help you focus 
on what you’re trying to accomplish.
In this section of the chapter, we will show you two different methods for creating formula-
driven massing. First, you will create a generic model family and then load it into the project 
environment as part of an in-place mass. Second, you will create a conceptual mass family to 
observe the differences in modeling tools and how they will affect your design explorations.
Creating a Generic Model Mass Family
Although it’s possible to create complex forms as a generic model in the Family Editor, they do 
not behave as masses when you place them in the project. You can assign standard walls, cur-
tain walls, and roofs to the faces, but you can’t add patterns, create mass floors, or even schedule 
the results as a mass. The tools you will use in this exercise are the tools available for building 
most other 3D content using extrusions, sweeps, and blends. It’s good to understand how to use 
these tools so you’re familiar with all the types of modeling in Revit software.
	
1.	 Open a Generic Model template by choosing the Application button ➢ New ➢ Family. 
Select either Generic Model.rft or Metric Generic Model.rft from the list of default 
templates.
In some cases, you can change the category of a family by clicking the Family Category 
and Parameters button in the ribbon; however, you can’t convert a generic model family 
to a mass (Figure 8.57). You’ll need to maintain the family as a Generic Model and then 
place it into an in-place mass within a project.
	
2.	 Go to a floor plan reference-level view in your family. From the Create tab in the ribbon, 
click the Reference Line tool (not Reference Plane). Draw a reference line along the y-axis 
(up), as shown in Figure 8.58. Note that the reference line is drawn from the intersection 
of the reference planes. Note also that we have increased the line weight of Reference 
Lines in the Object Styles settings for clarity.

Figure 8.58
First reference line
	
3.	 Draw another reference line in a downward direction along the y-axis (Figure 8.59). These 
reference lines will control the angular “twist” in your finished family.
Now you’re going to create a blend that will be associated with the reference lines you 
just created. The bottom of the blend will be associated with the first reference line, and 
the top of the blend will be associated with the second reference line.

312  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
Figure 8.59
Second reference line
	
4.	 From the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Blend tool. By default, you will start by defin-
ing the bottom profile of the blend. Click the Set command in the Work Plane panel of the 
contextual tab in the ribbon. Choose the Pick A Plane option (Figure 8.60), click OK, and 
then click the first reference line you drew.
Figure 8.60
Setting the work plane
	
5.	 From the Draw panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, choose the Rectangle command 
and sketch a 20’ (6 m) square in the plan view.

Figure 8.61
Establish equality 
dimensions.
	
7.	 Use the Aligned dimension tool again to create dimensions for the vertical and hori-
zontal sketch lines. This time, you’ll want to select the Reference Plane as your center 
dimension. The goal is to make the box equal on all sides and equidistant from the refer-
ence planes (Figure 8.62). After you place the two dimensions, select them, and from the 
Options bar go to the Label drop-down list, and then choose <Add Parameter>. In the 
Parameter Properties dialog box, set the following values:
◆
◆
Name: BW
◆
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
◆
◆
Edit Tooltip: Bottom width of blend
The plan view should now look similar to the image in Figure 8.62. You can adjust the 
value of the BW parameter by clicking the Family Types icon from the Properties panel in 
the ribbon.
	
6.	 Switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon and click the Aligned dimension tool. Place a 
dimension on both vertical lines in the square sketch and the vertical reference line—not 
the reference plane. Click an empty area of the plan view to finish the dimension com-
mand. Highlight the finished dimension and click the EQ icon on the dimension string. 
The plan view should look like the image in Figure 8.61.

8.	 From the contextual tab in the ribbon, choose Edit Top. Click the Set command in the 
Work Plane panel, choose the Pick A Plane option, click OK, and then click the second 
(downward) reference line you drew in step 3.
	
9.	 Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the top sketch. Equally distribute the overall dimensions in rela-
tion to the downward reference line and create the parameters as you did previously, but 
name the parameter TW (Top Width), as shown in Figure 8.63.

Creating Formula-Driven Massing |  315  
	
10.	 In the Properties palette, locate the property named Second End. Click the small button 
at the right end of the row—this is the Associate Family Parameter button. Click the Add 
Parameter button. In the Parameter Properties dialog box, set the following values:
◆
◆
Name: H

Type or Instance: Instance

Edit Tooltip: Height of blend
	
11.	 Click OK to create the parameter and close the open dialog boxes. Now select Finish 
Family (the green check mark) from the contextual tab in the ribbon to complete the 
blended form.
	
12.	 You should take a moment to test that the reference lines control the top and bottom 
sketches of the blend. Activate the default 3D view, select the reference line to highlight 
it, and then move the end of the reference line. Be careful when moving the reference 
line. The goal is to test the parameters, so when you move the line, do so by dragging 
the line slightly. You’ll see the resulting forms change. Don’t use the Move command—it 
will break the parameters. The other end remains associated with the intersection of the 
default reference planes, and the top and bottom sketches rotate, as shown in Figure 8.64.
Figure 8.64
Twisting the blend 
with reference lines
	
13.	 From a plan view, move the reference lines so that they’re no longer on top of the refer-
ence planes. From the Annotate tab, click the Angular dimension tool and place dimen-
sions between each reference line and the vertical reference plane.

316  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
14.	 Select the upper angular dimension, and from the Label drop-down list in the Options 
bar choose <Add Parameter>. Create a new family parameter with the following values:
◆
◆
Name: BA
◆
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
◆
◆
Edit Tooltip: Bottom angle, counterclockwise from 90
Furthermore, you can add parameters to control the top and bottom angles of the blend. 
We’ve called these instance parameters BA and TA (for bottom angle and top angle, 
respectively).
	
15.	 Select the lower angular dimension and again choose <Add Parameter> from the Label 
drop-down list. Create another new parameter with the following values:
◆
◆
Name: TA
◆
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
◆
◆
Edit Tooltip: Top angle, clockwise from 270
Figure 8.65 also shows all the parameters that control this blend. From the Create tab 
in the ribbon, click the Family Types icon. Go ahead and test the parameter values by 
changing angles in the Properties palette and clicking the Apply button (or moving your 
mouse out of the palette). The form should rotate and twist. This is how you will interact 
with the form after you load it into a project environment.

16.	 You’re going to use the edges of this blend to drive the geometry that you’re going to create, 
but since you don’t want to see this blend, turn it into a void. With the blend selected, use 
the Solid/Void drop-down list in the Properties palette (Figure 8.66). The blend form will 
change color to a yellow-orange if you set your visual style of the view to Shaded.

17.	 From the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Sweep tool. Select Pick Path (not Sketch Path) 
in the contextual tab of the ribbon to select the edges of the blend previously created. Pick 
the edges of the blend, as shown in Figure 8.67. Note the location of the sketch plane along 
the lower rear edge. This is because it is the first edge selected.

18.	 Once you select the edges of the blend, click the green check mark to finish the path. 
Click the Select Profile icon and select Edit Profile from the contextual tab in the ribbon. 
Doing so allows you to sketch the profile in direct context of the selected edges.

318  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
19.	 Sketch a profile 5′-6″ (1.7 m) wide × 4′-6″ (1.4 m) high. After you sketch the profile, add 
aligned dimensions, and then add parameters to the profile width and height as you’ve 
done previously in this exercise. We’ve called the instance parameters PW (profile width) 
and PH (profile height), respectively (Figure 8.68).

20.	 Finish the sketch and the sweep, and the profile will generate as shown in Figure 8.69.

Creating Formula-Driven Massing |  319  
Save the family on your computer as Generic Model Mass.rfa. With the form created, it’s 
now possible to load this family into your project environment and place it within an in-place 
mass. To do this, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a new project using the default Architecture template, and begin by creating an 
in-place mass from the Conceptual Mass panel of the Massing & Site tab. Name the mass 
Generic Mass.
	
2.	 While still in the In-Place Mass Sketch mode, toggle back to the mass family you just 
created and click Load Into Project from the ribbon. You should immediately be ready to 
place an instance of the loaded family, but if not, switch to the Create tab in the ribbon 
and click Component. Place the generic family as a component into your in-place mass.
	
3.	 Select the component you just inserted, and notice in the Properties palette that all the 
attributes you gave to the mass are available for you to edit. Using these parameters, set 
the values as follows:
◆
◆
BW: 160′ (49 m)
◆
◆
TW: 140′ (43 m)
◆
◆
H: 160′ (49 m)
◆
◆
PW: 40′ (12 m)
◆
◆
PH: 65′ (20 m)
◆
◆
BA: 22°
◆
◆
TA: 22°
	
4.	 Now finish the in-place mass by clicking the green check mark, which is the Finish Mass 
button. Even though this is a generic model family, because you’ve placed it during 
In-Place Mass mode, the software treats it as a mass.
	
5.	 Activate the South elevation view and add 15 additional levels. Space the levels every 10′ 
(3 m) apart, as shown in Figure 8.70, so that there are levels that extend across the entire 
elevation of your massing.
Figure 8.70

extend across the ele-
vation of your massing

320  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
	
6.	 Select the mass and click the Mass Floors button on the contextual tab in the ribbon. 
Select and check the boxes for all the levels, and then click OK to apply the changes and 
close the dialog box.
	
7.	 Select the mass, and on the contextual tab in the ribbon click Edit In-Place. Hover over 
one of the surfaces on the generic model, press the Tab key until the status bar indicates 
a face, and then click to select it. In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Divide Surface. 
With the face still selected, go to the Type Selector and choose Triangle (Flat). You’ll also 
be able to associate patterns and pattern-based components with your generic massing 
family (Figure 8.71). Continue to do this for each vertical surface on the generic model, 
and then click Finish Mass.
Figure 8.71
Adding pattern-based 
components
	
8.	 Finally, switch to the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Roof ➢ Roof By Face. Click 
the horizontal surfaces of the mass and then click Create Roof in the contextual tab of 
the ribbon. Click the Modify button to complete the command. Figure 8.72 shows four 
perspective views of the completed massing study, all created with the familiar geometry 
toolset.
We’ve also rendered the model, as shown in Figure 8.73. The results are quite interesting, 
and you’ll still have the ability to modify the underlying parametric family and then rehost the 
faces. You’ll also be able to schedule the volume, surface, and floor area of the mass.
You can download and further investigate the files that were used to create this exercise 
in the Chapter 8 folder of the book’s web page. Download the project file c08_Parametric_
Generic_Massing_Finish.rvt, which contains the in-place massing and the loaded generic 
element.
Now let’s begin to investigate how to create parametric massing in the Family Editor using 
the conventional massing tools.

Design by Visual Programming
A new trend in design methodology is becoming more popular—the use of visual programming tools 
to generate complex forms. We are not talking about parametric design as an aesthetic philosophy, 
but rather the tools employed to achieve the results. The term “visual programming” refers to the 
use of a graphic UI to drive code-based scripting that will generate complex geometrical forms. 
One new tool that is now available and bundled with Revit 2017 is called Dynamo. The website 
dynamobim.org has learning material, free downloads, and a discussion forum. Mastering Autodesk 
Revit 2017 for Architecture has a brand new section dedicated to Dynamo; check out Chapter 21!

Creating a Complex Mass Family
In the previous exercise, we used the basic modeling tools that are available for most family 
categories. The tools available in the conceptual massing environment are somewhat different. 
In the next exercise, you will open a conceptual mass family that we have started with a number 
of datum objects and embedded formulas.
Overall, the UI is not too dissimilar from the project environment. It’s as if you’re creating 
masses in-place—except that you’re not in the project environment; you’re in the Family Editor. 
One significant difference that you can see is that there is a single level and two reference 
planes, which also define the origin for a massing family (Figure 8.74). Keep in mind that when 
you reload this family into your project, it will update relative to the origin in the family.
Figure 8.74

interface

Creating Formula-Driven Massing |  323  
In the past, the ability to parametrically control objects in the massing editor was done using 
reference planes and reference lines. The Revit development team introduced reference point 
elements in 2010, which add another level of control to model elements. Point elements allow for 
Cartesian X, Y, Z, as well as rotational control.
With all complex and parametrically controlled families, we think it’s best to understand 
complex families to get the basic rules down first. In this case, the rules are the parameters and 
formulas that will control a twisting, tapering tower.
To begin this exercise, download and open the file c08-Formula-Massing-Start.rfa or 
c08-Formula-Massing-Start-Metric.rfa from the book’s web page. Open the Family Types 
dialog box and observe the parameters and formulas that are included with the exercise file, as 
shown in Figure 8.75.
Figure 8.75
The Family Types dialog 
box
We will briefly describe how this conceptual mass family was created so you can get an over-
view of the process and employ similar techniques on your own designs. Similar to the steps 
you performed in the previous exercise, reference lines were used to generate a square sketch at 
the first reference level.
The reference lines were dimensioned with equality constraints based on the reference 
planes defining the origin. Overall dimensions were placed and associated with the W0 param-
eter (Figure 8.76). W0 is shorthand for the width dimension on the 0-level.

324  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
Activating the South Elevation, you can see seven reference points were placed at the inter-
section of the default reference planes. Each reference point was then elevated manually by 
dragging the up arrow to move it away from the other overlapping point elements (Figure 8.77).
Figure 8.76

lines

Creating Formula-Driven Massing |  325  
When you select a reference point, you have the option to associate any of the point’s proper-
ties with any of the family parameters developed for this conceptual mass. This is done by click-
ing the small button in the Properties palette next to each property value. For each reference 
point in this exercise file, the Offset property was associated with a corresponding L-parameter 
(Figure 8.78). The L-parameters refer to the level number of each of your point elements. The 
first point element is associated with the parameter named L1 because it is reference Level 1. 
The second point is associated with L2, and so on. When you associate a property with a family 
parameter, you’ll notice that the button fills with a small equal sign.
Figure 8.78
Adding a parameter 
to the point element
By default, the reference point elements are just spherical nodes. Their reference planes are 
not visible. To make them a little more usable for your modeling purposes, you can set them to 
display their internal reference planes. With a reference point selected, in the Properties palette 
you will find a property called Show Reference Planes; set it to Always, and the reference planes 
of the point elements will be visible (Figure 8.79).
Figure 8.79
Selecting Always next to 
Show Reference Planes

(b)

326  | Chapter 8  Advanced Modeling and Massing  
Next, the Rotation Angle property of each reference point was associated with the cor-
responding family parameter. Point 1 was associated with A1 (angle 1), Point 2 with A2, and 
so on.
We then used the Set command in the Work Plane panel to use each point’s horizontal plane 
as the working reference to draw a square sketch of reference lines associated with each point. 
Each sketch was dimensioned in a similar way to the first sketch. The dimensions for the sketch 
associated with Point 1 are W1, the Point 2 sketch dimensions are W2, and so on. Switching to 
the 3D with Dimensions view, you can see this (Figure 8.80).
Figure 8.80
Reference line sketches 
and dimensions
For clarity, we’ve hidden the dimensions in the default 3D view so that you can see all the 
reference lines and point elements. If you’d like to see all the dimensions configured in this exer-
cise file, activate the 3D view named 3D with Dimensions.
Now let’s begin to create some mass forms using the parametrically driven framework of ref-
erence lines in this exercise file. Follow these steps to get started:
	
1.	 While pressing the Ctrl key, select all the square reference line sketches, and then click 
Create Form ➢ Solid Form on the Form panel in the ribbon. Although this will look like a 
simple extrusion, it’s actually a blend with many profiles.
	
2.	 Open the Family Types dialog box and begin to test the results before loading the 
family into the project (Figure 8.81). Set the WCPL and APL parameters to 0 and click 
Apply.

Creating Formula-Driven Massing |  327  
	
3.	 Test the parameter that controls the distance between levels by increasing the HPL 
instance parameter (which stands for height per level). If you hover the mouse pointer 
over these parameters, a tooltip will appear telling you what they mean.
	
4.	 Now test the ability of the shape to taper (Figure 8.82). Do so by increasing the WCPL 
instance parameter (which stands for width control per level).

5.	 Next, test the parameters that control the amount of angular twist per level (Figure 8.83). 
Do so by increasing the APL parameter (which stands for angle per level).
Figure 8.83

parameter
	
6.	 Start a new project using the default Architectural template. Switch back to the mass fam-
ily, and click Load Into Project from the ribbon. Place an instance of the conceptual mass 
family in the project environment. When you select the massing family, you’ll be given 
access to all of its parameters in the Properties dialog box. You can quickly and easily test 
the massing parameters to significantly increase the height, width, taper, and incremental 
rotation of the massing family.
	
7.	 Switch back to the family file. Hover the mouse pointer near the edge of any face on the 
mass, press the Tab key until you highlight a surface, and then click to select a surface. 
Click Divide Surface in the contextual tab of the ribbon. From the Type Selector, choose 
Rhomboid to apply the pattern, as shown in Figure 8.84. You will notice in the Properties 
palette that you can change the properties of the Rhomboid pattern to adjust the pattern 
to meet your design needs. Repeat this process for the remaining vertical surfaces of the 
mass.
	
8.	 Click Load Into Project to reload the mass into the project. Activate the South elevation 
view and set the elevation of the Level 2 datum object to 30’ (9 m). Select Level 2 and click 
the Array tool in the Modify tab of the ribbon. In the Options bar, uncheck Group and 
Associate, set Number to 60, and choose the Move To 2nd option. In the elevation, click 
once, move the mouse pointer upward, and then type 15’ (4.5 m). This will create a quick 
configuration of levels for your tower design. Note that no plans will be created when 
you copy or array levels.

9.	 Select the mass form and click Mass Floors in the contextual tab of the ribbon. Select and 
check all the levels in the project, and then click OK to apply the changes and close the dialog 
box. In Figure 8.85, we applied a section box to the 3D view to illustrate the mass floors.

If you want to learn more about expanding the use of the divided surfaces on massing forms, 
see Chapter 12, “Creating Walls and Curtain Walls.” In that chapter, we discuss the modeling 
techniques to create custom panel families and how to apply them to pattern-based curtain 
walls.
Creating interesting and complex massing studies that can be parametrically controlled isn’t 
just a skill developed over time. The rules that you develop to make and reiterate your designs 
are also carefully considered aesthetic choices to make decisions rather than blobs! To see this 
file, go to the Chapter 8 folder and download c08-Formula-Massing-Project_Finished.rvt. 
Be sure to turn on Show Mass Form And Floors on the Massing & Site tab if it’s not turned on 
when you open the file.
The Bottom Line
Create and schedule massing studies.    Starting the design process with actual building ele-
ments can lead to a lot of unexpected frustration. Walls lead to rooms, which get room tags 
and eventually scheduled. But if you’ve failed to fulfill the client’s program, you’ll wonder 
where to start over!
Master It    You’re faced with creating some design studies of a large hospital complex. 
How would you go about creating a Revit project that would allow you to create a mass-
ing study and schedule it against the design client’s program?
Know when to use solid and surface masses.    Solid masses and surface masses can both be 
used to maintain relationships to host geometry like walls and roofs, but surface masses can’t 
be volumetrically scheduled or contain floor area faces.
Master It    You’ve been asked to create a complex canopy system for the entry to a hotel 
project. The system will consist of a complex wave of triangular panels. What kind of 
mass would you create?
Use mathematical formulas for massing.    Not all massing is going to involve intuitive, in-
the-moment decision making. By discovering the underlying rules that express a form, you 
can create the formulas that can iterate and manipulate your massing study. So rather than 
manually manipulating the mass, you manipulate the formulas related to your mass.

 Chapter  9 
 Conceptual Design and 
Design Analysis   
 In this chapter, we will take a further look at the Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture Conceptual 
Design tools and how you can leverage them for sustainable design analysis. We’ll also explore 
a few other tools, some of which use BIM geometry to support design analysis. 
 Most building design starts with some simple concepts and forms. Will the building be tall or 
long? Curved or rectilinear? How will those shapes affect sustainable design concepts like solar 
gain, daylighting, and energy consumption? To perform these kinds of analyses and explore the 
initial ideas for building form in Revit, we use masses. In the previous chapter, we discussed 
how to create several kinds of massing. In this chapter, we’ll explore a different type of mass 
called a Conceptual Mass and use that to generate sustainable design analysis. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Embrace energy analysis concepts 
 
◆
 Create a conceptual mass 
 
◆
 Analyze your model for energy performance 
 Analysis for Sustainability 
 Environmentally thoughtful design strategies have been around for millennia, but the practice 
of sustainable design with quantifi able metrics has seen substantial growth in the past decade. 
Sustainable design practices can help address many issues, among them energy use, access 
to natural daylight, human health and productivity, and resource conservation. One of the 
principal goals of sustainable design is to reduce a building’s overall resource use. This can be 
measured in the building’s carbon footprint ( www.architecture2030.org ) or the net amount of 
carbon dioxide emitted by a building through its energy use. 
 Before we delve into discussing any specifi c workfl ows involving BIM and sustainable 
design analysis, it’s important to recognize that many concepts are both interdependent and 
cumulative. The more sustainable methods you can incorporate into a project, the “greener” the 
project becomes. 
 Take the example of building orientation, glazing, and daylighting. Designing your building 
in the optimal orientation, using the right glass in the correct amount and location, and 
integrating sunshading into the project to optimize the use of natural light all build on each 
other. Using these three strategies together makes a building operate more effi ciently while 

332  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
allowing occupants access to plenty of natural light. The amount of usable daylight you might 
capture will be greatly reduced with the application of highly reflective glass or if the building’s 
orientation is inappropriate for the geography. The appropriateness of any of these individual 
strategies and the benefits depend on building type and climate.
Revit software has similar characteristics. Because it is a parametric modeler, all the parts are 
interrelated. Understanding and capitalizing on these relationships typically takes numerous 
iterations that span multiple projects. Optimizing the integrated strategies and technologies 
for a high-performance design requires an understanding of how they work together to deliver 
the best potential. That is where Revit comes in—allowing the ability to iterate and analyze 
faster than in a more traditional process. The process is built on the following methodology for 
reducing the energy consumption of buildings:
◆
◆
Understand climate
◆
◆
Reduce loads
◆
◆
Use free energy
◆
◆
Use efficient systems 
Bad Modeling Has Bad Downstream Effects
Like poor ecology, poor modeling can have a negative impact downstream on team members and 
project stakeholders. If you are choosing to use your model for sustainable design analysis, remem-
ber that the more accurate you are in your modeling, the more accurate your results will be.
Conversely, a poorly assembled model will deliver inaccurate results. If you do not establish the 
proper materials in a daylighting model, for instance, you will not get the right reflectivity and 
therefore your daylighting study results will be inaccurate. If rooms and volumes are not estab-
lished properly within the model, your energy performance calculations will be inaccurate. These 
faulty results may prompt you to make changes in your design that are incorrect or unnecessary.
It is a good idea to establish early on in your modeling process which sustainable design 
analyses you will be performing based on your model geometry. It is much easier to set the 
model up for successful analysis when you begin than it is to go back and have to make signifi-
cant changes to the model to perform analysis.
Creating a Conceptual Mass
To begin performing any kind of analysis, you first need a building design. In the previous 
chapter, we discussed how to make and schedule building massing using different methods. 
In this chapter, we’re going to step through one more method of conceptual massing in order to 
generate building geometry and use that to understand the sustainable design tools.
Since we are using the conceptual massing tools in Revit, you’re first going to create an 
adaptive component. This type of family can be inserted into a mass to modify its shape, either 
by application of parameters or by being pushed and pulled in the view window. It will serve 
as a sort of skeleton, or rig, to drive the geometry in a more fluid way. In the twisting tower 

Creating a Conceptual Mass |  333  
form exercise from the previous chapter, you used a simple square form that was tapered and 
twisted. In this chapter’s massing exercise, you will create a slightly more complex plan ­profile, 
but—more important—that profile will be dynamically controlled by four vertical splines 
instead of simply twisting the plan shape.
Modeling an Adaptive Component
The first thing you’re going to create is an adaptive component family that will act as a dia-
phragm for designing the building shape. You’ll then import this family into a mass and use the 
solid form tool to wrap a stack of these shapes. This example is a bit advanced and an error in 
the steps can cause incorrect results, so please follow the steps closely.
To get started:
	
1.	 From the Application menu, choose New ➢ Family. Use the family template named 
Generic Model Adaptive.rft or Metric Generic Model Adaptive.rft. Switch to the 
Create tab and click Set in the Work Plane panel. In the view window, click the 3D level 
line to set the level as the active reference plane. The 3D Level line is the black line rep-
resented by a dash-dot pattern and forms the horizontal plane in the view (Figure 9.1). It 
will look like a normal 2D level line but shown in the 3D view.
If you prefer to see the active plane in which you will begin modeling, click the Show 
button in the Work Plane panel.
Figure 9.1
Adaptive model default 
view
	
2.	 On the Draw panel, select the Reference type and then the Point Element tool (Figure 9.2). 
In the view window, create four points. These points aren’t location-specific; just lay them 
out in a way similar to what is shown in the figure. Exact layout isn’t critical, but the order 
you place them in is. Place the points starting at the upper left and moving clockwise. 
These will later coincide with the object number of vertical elements that you’ll create in 
the mass.

334  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
	
3.	 Once all four points are placed, select all the points, and from the contextual tab in the 
ribbon, click the Make Adaptive tool.
The points will become numbered in the order in which they were inserted, and each 
point will have its own reference planes (Figure 9.3).
Figure 9.2

points

4.	 Now, from the Create tab click the Reference type; then choose the Line command. Make 
sure that 3D Snapping is enabled from the Options bar. The order in which you place the 
reference lines is critical to later steps, so connect the points in this order:
	
1.	 Point 1 to Point 2
	
2.	 Point 2 to Point 3

Creating a Conceptual Mass |  335  
	
3.	 Point 4 to Point 3
	
4.	 Point 4 to Point 1
This sets the start and end point of each segment, which has an impact on how the 
Normalized Curve Parameter will act in the following steps.
Once you’re finished, the four reference points form an enclosed shape (Figure 9.4). Once 
everything is connected, click the Modify button in the ribbon or press the Esc key twice 
to quit the Line command.
Figure 9.4
Connecting the four 
adaptive points
Now that you have all four points connected forming a rhomboid, you will create a set of 
points that will round one of the corners of the form. This rounded corner will be associ-
ated with a formula-based parameter so you can modify its radius within the mass to 
change the shape.
	
5.	 On the Create tab in the ribbon, click Reference again, and choose the Point Element 
command. Make sure you choose the Draw On Face option to the right of the Draw 
tools.
Add two points on the reference lines to each side of one of the corners. We’ve added 
points near the corner of Point 4, as illustrated in Figure 9.5. The order in which you add 
these points is not important to the exercise.

336  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
For the next step, you need to add a parameter to control the location of the points along 
the reference line. This will help form the radius of the curve. One of the default proper-
ties of a point in Revit is called Normalized Curve Parameter. This property is a ratio 
of the length of the host line expressed from 0.0 to 1.0. As an example of how to use this 
parameter, if you want to keep a point at the midpoint of a reference line, this property 
must always be 0.5.
Using Points in Revit
There are several types of points in Revit, and it’s a good idea to know the differences. In this 
exercise, we lead you through the creation of a few point types. Here’s a list of the types and some 
of their uses:
◆
◆
Reference Points: These are points that identify a specific X, Y, Z location in the conceptual 
design environment (adaptive components, conceptual masses, and the like). All reference 
points can be tied to parameters.
◆
◆
Driving Points: These are reference points that control the geometry of a dependent spline. 
When you select these points, they will allow you to manipulate them with 3D controls. In 
Revit, these points will appear larger on the screen to distinguish them from the other points.
◆
◆
Hosted Points: These are reference points that exist on a spline, line, surface, or some other 
element. Visually, they appear as smaller than driving points. Hosted points can be used to 
drive the manipulation of geometry.
◆
◆
Free Points: These are reference points that are simply placed on a reference plane. Free points 
will show 3D controls when selected and are movable on their reference plane. 
Figure 9.5
Adding points to the 
reference lines
Note 
If you select one of the placed points and you don’t see the Normalized Curve Parameter 
property, you will need to delete the point and place it again; this time ensure that you select 
the Draw On Face option in the Draw panel of the ribbon.

Creating a Conceptual Mass |  337  
To modify the Normalize Curve Parameter, continue with the steps.
	
6.	 Start with the point closest to the corner between points 4 and 1 (look ahead to 
Figure 9.7), and in the Properties palette locate the property named Normalized Curve 
Parameter. Click the small button to the right of the value field to pull up the Associate 
Family Parameter dialog box (Figure 9.6).
Figure 9.6
Adding a family 
parameter to the point
	
7.	 Click the Add Parameter button. This will open the Parameter Properties dialog box. 
Name the new parameter Rad_A1, and click OK to exit each of the dialog boxes. 
Giving the parameter this name is sufficient; don’t worry about the other settings in 
the Parameter Properties dialog box. Once this is complete, move to the next point. 
Select the next point on that same line and repeat this process, naming the point 
Rad_A2.
	
8.	 On the Create tab, click the Family Types tool from the Properties panel. In the Family 
Types dialog box, you’ll see the two parameters you’ve created so far. You want to add 
a formula that will set point A1 at half the distance between Point 4 and A2. In the 
Formula box for Rad_A1 add the formula =Rad_A2 / 2 (Figure 9.7). Click OK to exit the 
dialog box.

338  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
	
9.	 Repeat steps 6 and 7 with the points on the other line. For the other two points, select 
them as you did before and add the variables Rad_B1 and Rad_B2. The parameters 
should be associated with the points as shown in Figure 9.8.

the point locations.
	
10.	 Open the Family Types dialog box again and set Rad_B2 equal to Rad_A2. For Rad_B1 
set the formula to read =Rad_B2 / 2. When you’ve finished, the Family Types dialog box 
should have four variables and three formulas, as shown in Figure 9.9. You can test the 
formulas by changing the numbers in the Value column and clicking Apply each time. 
You should see the points move up and down the host reference line.

Creating a Conceptual Mass |  339  
	
11.	 With the points and formulas in place, you’re going to add a few additional elements to 
create the curve. Add another reference line between the two middle points (Rad_A1 and 
Rad_B1); be sure to select the 3D Snapping check box in the Options bar (Figure 9.10).
Figure 9.10
Add a reference line 
between the two 
middle points.
	
12.	 Switch to the Point Element command in the Draw panel, and then add a point to the 
middle of the reference line you added in the previous step.
	
13.	 In the Create tab, click the Model style and then select the Spline Through Points tool.
Connect the farther point, Rad_A2, to the midpoint of the line (the point you placed in 
step 12), to the point Rad_B2. The connected points should create an arc like the one 
shown in Figure 9.11.
Figure 9.11
Add the spline to 
connect the points.

340  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
	
14.	 Make sure Model is still selected in the Create tab and choose the Line tool. Connect 
the arc you just created to the other three points, completing the shape now with 
model lines. The final form will look like Figure 9.12. The order of line placement is not 
important.
Figure 9.12

to connect the other 
points
Figure 9.13
Creating a form out of 
the model lines
	
15.	 As the final step to this sequence, you need to apply a surface to the points and lines. 
Select the model lines you just created. You can select them individually (select one and 
use the Tab+Select method) or select everything and then use the Filter tool to isolate 
Lines (Generic Model).
Next, from the contextual tab in the ribbon, choose Create Form ➢ Solid Form. You’ll be 
prompted with the option to create a solid or a plane. Choose the plane, which will be the 
option on the right (Figure 9.13). The result should look like the image to the right in the 
figure.

Creating a Conceptual Mass |  341  
At this point, you need to save the family for use in your mass. Save the family with the 
name c09-Adaptive-Rig.rfa. You can download the finished file from the Chapter 9 folder on 
this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.
Building the Massing Framework
Now, you need to create a mass family into which you will load and place the adaptive compo-
nent family. From the Application menu, choose New ➢ Conceptual Mass. This will open the 
template-selection dialog box. Choose the Mass.rft or Metric Mass.rft file. The conceptual 
mass environment will mirror the adaptive component look and feel. You’re going to use this to 
study forms for an office tower.
The first steps in this exercise will show you how to add some 3D splines, to which each of 
the four reference points in the adaptive component family will attach. With the new mass fam-
ily started, follow these steps:
	
1.	 On the ViewCube® in the 3D view, click Front. In the Create tab of the ribbon, on the 
Draw panel, select Reference and choose the Spline tool. Before you place the point, set 
the Placement Plane drop-down on the Options bar to Reference Plane : Center (Front/
Back), as shown in Figure 9.14.
Figure 9.14
Select the correct work 
plane for the spline.
	
2.	 Draw one spline to the left and one to the right of the centerline (Figure 9.15). The shape of the 
spline isn’t important—keep it organic but avoid very tight radii. To create a spline, you can 
click in the view as many times as you like, and then press the Esc key to stop sketching.
Figure 9.15
Draw splines on each 
side of the work plane.

342  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
	
3.	 Orbit the 3D view slightly, and then click Left or Right from the ViewCube. Start the 
Reference and Spline tools again and choose Reference Plane : Center (Left/Right) from 
the Options bar. Draw two more reference splines, one on either side of the centerline.
	
4.	 Your next step is to join the splines with horizontal reference lines. This will allow you to 
establish some benchmarks for inserting the platform family you just created. For each of 
the sets of horizontal reference lines you create, you’re going to insert another instance of 
the adaptive component family.
You’ll draw the reference lines in the Left/Right plane to start using the same view you 
used to draw the last two splines. You want the reference lines to intersect both sets of 
points but to extend past them on both ends. The length of the reference line will deter-
mine how far the adaptive component can stretch. Start by drawing one at the base and 
extending it past both ends of the spline (Figure 9.16). Do the same for the Front/Back 
plane, making sure to remember to switch your placement plane. We will create more 
reference lines in a later step.
	
6.	 As we just mentioned, the next step is to attach the points to the reference lines. Select 
any one of the points, and then choose Host Point By Intersection from the Options bar. 
Then select the intersection of the spline and reference line, as shown in Figure 9.18. Do 
this for all four points.
Figure 9.16
Adding reference lines
236′ - 0″
	
5.	 Select one of the upper corners of the ViewCube so the view rotates back into an axono-
metric view. You’re going to add points to the splines. Choose the Model style and the 
Point Element tool and add a point to each of the splines near the intersections of the ref-
erence lines you just drew; see Figure 9.17. It doesn’t have to be exact—once you get all the 
points in place you’ll perform another step to connect the points to the intersection of the 
spline and reference line. Add four hosted points, one for each spline.

7.	 Now, you need to make several versions of these elements—points with intersecting 
lines—one set for each of your adaptive components. The more sets you create, the 
more granular control you have over the form. Open one of your elevations (it doesn’t 
matter which one) by selecting one of the elevation sides of the ViewCube. Draw a 
selection box starting on the left and going right over the ground plane so you encom-
pass the levels, points, and lines you’ve been drawing. You’ll have selected too much, 
but that’s okay. With everything selected, click the Filter tool in the contextual tab of 
the ribbon. In the Filter dialog box, uncheck Levels, Reference Points, and Reference 
Planes so that only Reference Lines is selected (Figure 9.19). Click OK to close the 
dialog box.
	
8.	 With these items selected, you’re going to make a few copies. In our example image 
(Figure 9.20) we’ve made three copies for a total of four elements. Still in the elevation 
view, choose the Copy tool from the Modify panel and copy the selected elements, 
spacing them relatively evenly. You’ll need to add points to each of these intersec-
tions. It’s a bit tedious, but it goes pretty quickly, and it will be good practice to 
remember the steps. Add the points on the splines and close the reference lines. Then 
select the points, choose Host By Intersection, and choose the reference line, as you 
did in step 6. When you’ve finished, you’ll have an array of points and lines, as shown 
in Figure 9.20.

9.	 The mass is just about complete, and you’re ready to load the c09-Adaptive-Rig fam-
ily into the project. Open the c09-Adaptive-Rig family file, or if the family is still open, 
choose the family from the Switch Windows button on the Quick Access toolbar. When 
you load an adaptive component into a family or project, it doesn’t respond quite like 
a normal component. The points you created need to be anchored to the points on the 
spline elements.
Load the platform family into the conceptual mass. Once it is loaded, one of the first 
things you’ll notice is a small, gray version of your family floating around by your cursor 
(Figure 9.21).

Creating a Conceptual Mass |  345  
	
10.	 To anchor the family, select one of the points you inserted earlier in this chapter at the base 
of the splines. Work your way around all the points in the same plane in a clockwise fash-
ion until you’ve selected all four points at the base of the spline (Figure 9.22). Notice how 
the curved section you added at Point 4 isn’t touching the point on the vertical spline.
Figure 9.22

component to the mass

It is critical to anchor the family properly. If the family gets placed and appears to have 
lines between any two points, rather than just along the boundary, your points are not 
coplanar.
	
11.	 Do the same for each of the vertical levels you added. Your mass should look like 
Figure 9.23. Make sure your first point on each level is on the same spline. This will ensure 
that all the curved sections at Point 4 stack properly. When your platforms are fully inserted, 
you can grab any of the splines and push and pull it to see the platforms change shape.

346  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
Before we create the solid form from these adaptive components, you will create a vis-
ibility toggle for the generic surfaces. This will allow you to turn them off in the project 
environment when you don’t want to see them.
	
12.	 Select each of the adaptive components you have placed in the 3D view. Click the 
Filter tool in the contextual tab of the ribbon and make sure that only Generic Models 
is selected. Click OK to close the Filter dialog box. In the Properties palette, click the 
Associate Family Parameter button for the property named Visible. This is the small but-
ton on the right of the Visible parameter row. Click Add Parameter in the dialog box.
	
13.	 In the Parameter Properties dialog box, set the Name of the new parameter as Show Rig 
and set the Group Parameter Under drop-down to Visibility (Figure 9.24). Click OK to 
close all open dialog boxes.
Figure 9.24
Setting the visibility 
parameter
	
14.	 Finally, to create the mass, select the surface for each of the rigs. This is a somewhat tricky 
operation. You’ll need to hover the mouse pointer over the edge of a surface, and press 
the Tab key until you see Generic Models : c09-Adaptive-Rig : Face appear in the 
status bar at the bottom of the application window. Click to select the face. Then hover the 

Energy Modeling |  347  
mouse pointer over the next surface, press the Tab key, and repeat the step. When you see 
the Face element in the status bar, press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking to select the 
next face. Repeat this process until all the faces are selected.
	
15.	 With these faces selected, select Create Form ➢ Solid Form from the contextual tab in the 
ribbon. Your completed mass will look like Figure 9.25. Remember to save the mass fam-
ily for use in the next section of this chapter.
Figure 9.25

instances of the 
selection and adding 
points
You can modify this mass by moving any of the nodes on the four vertical splines. You 
can also select any of the Adaptive Rig elements and click Edit Type in the Properties palette. 
Change the values for any of the Rad parameters you created in the adaptive component, and 
the severity of the curved edge will be affected. This exercise was just one example of the 
almost limitless number of ways you can use parameters and components to drive conceptual 
geometry. We’re going to use this mass family to explore conceptual energy analysis in the next 
section.
Energy Modeling
Understanding a building’s energy needs is paramount to helping the project become more 
sustainable. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov), as of 
March 2015 buildings in the United States account for 30 percent of the world’s energy consump-
tion and 60 percent of the world’s electricity use, making the United States the primary con-
sumer of energy in the world (Figure 9.26). This reality should inspire you to build responsibly 
and to think about your design choices before you implement them.

348  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
The energy needs of a building depend on a number of issues that are not simply related to 
leaving the lights on in a room that you are no longer using, turning down the heat, or increas-
ing the air-conditioning. Many of the components and systems within a building affect its 
energy use. For instance, if you increase the size of the windows on the south façade, you allow 
in more natural light and lower your need for electric lighting. However, without proper sun-
shading, you are also letting in additional solar heat gain, so those larger windows are increas-
ing your need for air-conditioning and potentially negating the energy savings from reduced 
lighting.
In exploring the use of energy in a building, you must consider all energy-related issues, 
which is a good reason to use energy-simulation tools. These computer-based models use cli-
mate data coupled with building loads, such as the following:
◆
◆
The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system
◆
◆
Solar heat gain
◆
◆
The number of occupants and their activity levels
◆
◆
Sunshading devices
◆
◆
Daylight dimming
◆
◆
Lighting levels
The energy model combines these factors to predict the building’s energy demands to help 
size the building’s HVAC system. It also combines the parameters of other components properly 
so you are not using a system larger than what you need, and you can understand the impact of 
your design on the environment. By keeping the energy model updated with the current design, 
you can begin to grasp how building massing, building envelopes, window locations, building 
orientation, and other parameters affect energy demands.
There are two ways you can use Revit Architecture software for energy analysis—by 
analyzing mass forms directly in the model or by exporting a more detailed model to 
another application using the gbXML format. The gbXML file type is a standardized XML 
schema that is used for sustainable design analysis. For either choice, you must first have 
accurate location and true north settings. Once you have those established, you can approach 
either analysis with confidence. Let’s first take a look at the process for generating a concep-
tual energy analysis.

Conceptual Energy Analysis
A conceptual energy analysis (CEA) tool was added to Revit software as a Subscription Advantage 
Pack in 2009. This tool creates a link to the online analysis service known as the Autodesk® Green 
Building Studio® service. The analysis results will indicate such information as the life cycle and 
annual energy costs. In our opinion, it is wise to use the CEA tool only to determine relative costs. 
So, if you run an analysis against a design and then make changes and rerun the analysis, the dif-
ference should give you a general idea of performance improvement or performance loss.
In the following exercise, you will load a conceptual mass into a template project to run a 
series of energy analyses. There are three basic tools for configuration, analysis, and comparison 
of results on the Analyze tab of the ribbon for both building elements and masses (Figure 9.27).
Note on GBS and Revit CEA Tools
You will need an Autodesk Subscription account to access the Green Building Studio service and 
use the CEA tools. Not sure if you have a subscription account? Check with your BIM manager or 
local reseller; however, if you’ve purchased Revit on subscription, you’ll have access to the tools. 
Another way to gain more limited access is to simply sign up for an Autodesk® 360 account. You 
can do that from the top-right portion of the Revit software using the Sign In button or by visiting 
360.autodesk.com.
Figure 9.27
The Energy Analysis 
panel in the ribbon
Energy Analysis Setup
Before you can run an analysis for either building elements or massing, you need to do a bit of con-
figuration to give your analysis engine some parameters to run. You’re going to use the mass you 
created, but you’re going to insert that mass into an existing building model so you can run the anal-
ysis side by side. Let’s get started by comparing the two buildings (existing and mass) side by side.
Open the c09-Analysis-Start.rvt or c09-Analysis-Start-Metric.rvt file. You can 
download the file from this book’s web page. Once the file is open, activate the Level 1 floor plan, 
and then load and insert the mass you made earlier in this chapter or the one from the website. 
You can also download the completed massing family from the web page (c09-Conceptual-
Mass-Finished.rfa). Position the mass in the center of the plan view.
To begin the configuration of the energy analysis settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	 To begin, from the Massing & Site tab, choose Show Mass Form and Floors from the 
conceptual mass panel. Next, activate the default 3D view, and in the view control bar, 
set Visual Style to Shaded and turn Shadows on. Select the massing form, and from the 
Properties palette click Edit Type. Deselect the Show Rig property and then click Apply. 
This will turn off the generic model faces from the adaptive component you used to build 
the massing form. Click OK to close the dialog box.

350  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
	
2.	 Activate the South elevation view. Use the Copy or Array tool to create several new levels 
that span the height of your massing family (Figure 9.28). Make the levels above Level 2 
evenly spaced at 15′-0″ (4 m) each. Select the massing family again and from the contextual 
tab in the ribbon, click Mass Floors. Select all the levels in the dialog box and then click OK.
Figure 9.28
Create levels and mass 
floors.

The Energy Settings 
dialog box
	
3.	 On the Analyze tab, click Energy Settings. The Energy Settings dialog box is shown in 
Figure 9.29. We’re going to work our way down this dialog box, making sure you have the 
settings correct.

Energy Modeling |  351  
	
4.	 The next step is to establish the correct location of your project. Click the selection button 
to the right of the Location parameter to open the Location Weather And Site dialog box 
(Figure 9.30). Insert Boulder, CO, USA (or your hometown) in the Project Address field and 
click Search. Click one of the closest weather stations (shown by the pin icons) in the list or 
directly on the map. Finally, choose Use Daylight Savings Time if that is appropriate for your 
location and time of year. When you’ve made a selection, click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 9.30
In Location Weather 
And Site, first specify 
the location and 
weather station.
You’ll notice a lot of options in the Energy Settings dialog box—some of them quite com-
plex. To complete the rest of the dialog box, we’re going to step through each of the sec-
tions. So far, we’ve completed the Location.
	
5.	 In the Energy Analytical Model settings, change the following values:
◆
◆
Mode: Change this to Use Conceptual Masses.
◆
◆
Ground Plane: This should be set to Level 1.
We are going to leave the rest of the settings as they are, but let’s review a few of them so 
you understand their impact to the conceptual model.
◆
◆
Project Phase: This is the phase the analysis will be run against. Keep the default set-
ting of New Construction, but if you had multiple phases to your project, you could 
change how the analysis is run here.

352  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
◆
◆
Analytical Space Resolution and Analytical Surface Resolution: These numbers 
dictate the tolerances for Revit to resolve the spaces and surfaces within the model. 
For our uses, keep the default values.
◆
◆
Perimeter Zone Depth and Perimeter Zone Division: When this setting is enabled 
(the default), zones are automatically defined around the perimeter of the massing 
form. If you prefer to create your own zones, disable this setting and set the Core 
Offset value to 0. Then create more detailed mass forms and use the Cut Geometry 
tool to combine overlapping forms.
	
6.	 The final option in this dialog box is in the Advanced group and is an option for 
Other Options. Choose the Edit button and you’ll see the Advanced Energy Settings 
dialog box (Figure 9.31). As the dialog box suggests, these are more advanced 
settings for the energy performance and building systems. Let’s walk through these 
as well.
Figure 9.31
Advanced Energy 
Settings dialog box
◆
◆
Target Percentage Glazing: When you click the Show Energy Model but-
ton, you will see the Target Percentage Glazing value illustrated as solid and 
semi-transparent regions on the vertical exterior surfaces of the massing form 
(Figure 9.32). This value sets the assumed amount of glazing as a percentage of the 
overall wall area.

Energy Modeling |  353  
◆
◆
Target Sill Height: This is the height of the sill for glazing to begin on each floor.
◆
◆
Glazing Is Shaded: Select this check box if you intend to design sunshading for the 
glazing. This does not differentiate by building orientation, so if you check the box, 
conceptual shading elements will be added to the glazing assumptions on all sides 
(Figure 9.33).
Figure 9.32
Assumptions for glazing 
are illustrated on exte-
rior surfaces of the 
massing form at the 
default of 40 percent.
Figure 9.33
Conceptual shading 
elements are added to 
all sides of the massing 
form.
◆
◆
Shade Depth: When the Glazing Is Shaded option is checked, you can assign a depth 
to any assumed sunshading.
◆
◆
Target Percentage Skylights: Like Target Percentage Glazing, this value assumes an 
amount of skylighting for your model.
◆
◆
Skylight Width & Depth: This value sets the size for skylights if you are using that 
value.

354  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
◆
◆
Building Type: This value sets the type of building use. By default, it is set to 
Office building, but there are many different building uses. The building use will 
help dictate the type of load on the building, assumed number of occupants, and 
so on.
◆
◆
Building Operation Schedule: How often will your building be occupied? Will it 
have people in it 24/7, or will it be operational only during office hours? This can have 
a large impact on your heating and cooling cycles.
◆
◆
HVAC System: Here you can set a conceptual HVAC system. That could be a 
four-pipe system, underfloor air distribution, or a variety of other HVAC system 
types.
◆
◆
Outdoor Air Information: If you know how many air exchanges you’ll be required to 
produce per hour, you can set that value here.
◆
◆
Export Category: Your option here is either Rooms or Spaces. If you’re working 
from an architectural model, chances are you’re using Rooms. If this were an MEP 
model or you were linking in information from an MEP consultant, you’d want to use 
Spaces. For this exercise, leave it set to Rooms.
◆
◆
Conceptual Types: The Conceptual Types dialog box allows you to edit the assumed 
values of building elements for the mass form, as shown in Figure 9.34.
Figure 9.34
Conceptual Types allow 
you to test assump-
tions about massing 
forms.
◆
◆
Schematic Types: The Schematic Types dialog box allows you to edit the assumed 
values of the U values for each building system. Here is where you can customize 
the assumptions for the building type for insulation values, as shown in 
Figure 9.35.

Energy Modeling |  355  
◆
◆
Detailed Elements: The final setting in the dialog box is the Detailed Elements 
check box. This box is unchecked by default, but checking it will tell Revit to use the 
thermal properties associated with the materials you have in your model. For our 
analysis, we have no materials assigned, so we will leave this unchecked, but if you 
are performing an analysis on a more developed model, this option could give more 
exact results. Be aware that you will need to make sure to have thermal properties 
assigned to each of your materials in order to get accurate results.
Once those values are set, click OK to exit the dialog box.
Remember that this type of analysis is based on assumptions only and uses the overall size, 
location, and orientation of your proposed design. After you start analyzing the results, you can 
examine different massing configurations with the same construction and systems assumptions 
or varied assumptions on the same massing configuration.
Running Energy Analysis Simulations
After you have established some baseline settings and assumptions for an energy analysis, it’s 
time to create the energy model. This is the final step before running a simulation. Selecting the 
Create Energy Model button from the Analysis tab will apply the settings we just reviewed to 
your model. You can see the changes and assumptions it made in Figure 9.36.
Finally, it’s time to run the simulation. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Run Energy Simulation button on the ribbon to start the analysis. If you haven’t 
logged into A360, you’ll be asked to sign in. Next, you’ll get a dialog box asking you to 
name your new simulation. We’ve filled this in with some project-specific values, but you 
can name this whatever you’d like (Figure 9.37). You will need an Internet connection and 
an Autodesk Subscription account to run energy simulations. Once you click Continue, 
Revit will begin uploading your energy data.
Figure 9.35

allows you to edit the 
assumed insulation 
(U-values).

2.	 In the Run Energy Simulation dialog box, name this analysis Baseline_SouthCurve 
and click to run your initial analysis. The project name will be the file name by default. 
The software will start to communicate with the Green Building Studio service online 
and load your model into the analysis engine. Click Continue to start the analysis. 
This will take a few minutes to run. Your model data will be sent off to Autodesk’s 
cloud for processing and allow you to continue working while the analysis is being 
performed.
	
3.	 Click the Results & Compare button on the ribbon to view the progress of the upload. 
If you don’t have the Results And Compare dialog box open, an alert will appear in the 
lower-right portion of the application window, informing you that the analysis is com-
plete. Once the analysis is complete, you will see the run (Baseline_SouthCurve) listed 
under the name of the model you are analyzing, as shown in Figure 9.38. You can scroll 
through the list of analyses that are provided.
Figure 9.38
The Results And 
Compare window
You can scroll through the results and get a basic understanding of the building loads 
(Figure 9.39). One of the great uses for this tool isn’t looking at the actual reported data 
but using it as a comparative analysis. If you make changes to the building form, size, or 
orientation, how does that change your performance?

358  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
	
4.	 Activate the plan view, Site, from the Project Browser. Select the massing family and 
select the Rotate tool from the contextual tab in the ribbon. Rotate the mass so that the 
curved face is oriented South (90 degrees counterclockwise).
Return to the Analysis tab, and let’s make some adjustments to the model so we can com-
pare results.
	
5.	 Go back to the main application window and click the Energy Settings button on the rib-
bon. Click the Other Options tool to pull up the Advanced dialog box. Change the follow-
ing settings:

Click the Conceptual Types Edit button and change the Mass Glazing setting to 
Double Pane Clear - High Performance, LowE, High Tvis, Low SHGC. Click OK to 
close all three dialog boxes.
	
6.	 Click the Run Energy Simulation button again, name this run Shading + HighPerfGlass, 
and choose to use the existing model.
	
7.	 After the run has completed, return to the Results And Compare window, press and 
hold the Ctrl key, and select both the Baseline_SouthCurve and Shading + HighPerfGlass 
runs. Click the Compare button.
You will see the results of the two analyses runs side by side. Notice that the second run has 
a lower monthly electricity consumption and lower fuel consumption. Be careful when read-
ing the graphs, because the values in each graph may be different. Take a look at the Monthly 
Cooling Load graphs. Notice that the values for Window Solar are lower for the second run; 
however, the values for Light Fixtures are slightly higher. This is due to the addition of the shad-
ing, which requires more electric lighting power.
Making More Informed Decisions
We have seen so many projects in which design forms were arbitrarily created and presented to 
clients—only to have them choose the option that looked the most compelling. Cost of construc-
tion may come into play for a more complex design against a simpler solution. But what about how 
each of the design solutions will perform after construction?
Using the conceptual energy analysis tools has allowed our teams not only to present various 
design ideas to clients but to accompany the forms with performance characteristics as well. One 
design may cost more to construct but is projected to perform better in terms of heating loads in 
the winter. We frequently use selected graphs and comparisons from the Results And Compare 
reports in our early design phase presentations to clients. This enhanced information increases 
stakeholder confidence in making key decisions when they are most appropriate to drive value in 
the design and construction process.
Detailed Energy Modeling
Later in the design process, you may want to use your building elements to perform more 
detailed energy modeling. For this process to be successful, you first need a solid, well-built 
model. This does not mean you need to have all the materials and details figured out, but you 
do have to establish some basic conditions. To ensure that your model is correctly constructed 
to work with an energy-modeling application, there are a few things you need to do within 
the model to get the proper results. Some of this might sound like common sense, but it is 

360  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
important to ensure that you have the following elements properly modeled or you may have 
incorrect results:
◆
◆
The model must have roofs and floors.
◆
◆
Walls inside and outside need to touch the roofs and floors.
◆
◆
All areas within the analysis should be bound by building geometry (no unbound build-
ing geometry allowed).
To perform an energy analysis, you need to take portions of the model and export them 
using gbXML to an energy-analysis application. The following are the energy-modeling applica-
tions commonly used within the design industry. They vary in price, ease of use, and interoper-
ability with a gbXML model. Choosing the correct application for your office or workflow will 
depend on a balance of those variables.
◆
◆
IES VE: IES VE (www.iesve.com) is a robust energy-analysis tool that offers a high degree 
of accuracy and interoperability with a design model. The application can run the whole 
gamut of building environmental analysis, from energy and daylighting to computational 
fluid dynamics (CFDs) used to study airflow for mechanical systems. Cons to this appli-
cation are its current complexity for the user and the relatively expensive cost of the tool 
suite.
◆
◆
eQuest: The name stands for the Quick Energy Simulation Tool (www.doe2.com/equest). 
This application is a free tool created by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
(LBNL). It’s robust and contains a series of wizards to help you define your energy parame-
ters for a building. As with Ecotect, it can be a challenge to import a design model smoothly 
depending on the complexity of the design, although it will directly import SketchUp  
models by using a free plug-in.
Exporting to gbXML
Before you can export the model to gbXML and run your energy analysis, you need to create 
several settings so you can export the proper information. The order in which these options are 
set isn’t important, but it is important to check that they are set before exporting to gbXML. If 
the information within the model is not properly created, the results of the energy analysis will 
be incorrect.
Project Location
As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, the physical location of the project on the globe is an 
important factor in energy use analysis. You can give your building a location in a couple of 
ways. One is to choose the Manage tab and click the Location button. Another way to get to this 
same dialog box is through the Graphic Display Options dialog box you used for sunshading 
earlier in this chapter.
Building Envelope
Although this might seem obvious in concept, you cannot run an accurate energy analysis 
on a building without walls. Although the specific wall or roof composition won’t be taken 

Energy Modeling |  361  
into account, each room needs to be bound by a wall, floor, or roof. These elements are criti-
cal in creating the gbXML file and defining the spaces or rooms within the building. These 
spaces can in turn be defined as different activity zones in the energy-analysis application. 
Before you export, verify that you have a building envelope free of unwanted openings. 
This means all your walls meet floors and roofs and there are no “holes” in the building 
(Figure 9.40).
Figure 9.40
Make sure your 
building envelope is 
fully enclosed.
Rooms and Volumes
When you export to a gbXML file, you are actually exporting the room volumes because they 
are constrained by the building geometry. This is what will define the zones within the energy-
analysis application. You will need to verify several things to make sure your rooms and room 
volumes are properly configured:
Ensure that all spaces have a room element.    Each area within the model that will be 
affected by the mechanical system will need to have a room element added to it. To add 
rooms, select the Room tool from the Architecture tab.
Set room heights.    Once all the rooms are placed, each room’s properties should be rede-
fined to reflect its height. The height of the room should extend to the bottom of the room 
above (in a multistory building), or if it is the top floor or only floor of a building, the room 
must fully extend through the roof plane. When you extend the room through the roof plane, 
the software will use the Roof geometry to limit the height of the room element and con-
form it to the bottom of the roof. Rooms should never overlap either in plan (horizontally) or 
between floors (vertically) because this will give you inaccurate results.
An easy way to set the room heights is to open each level and select everything. Using the 
Filter tool (Figure 9.41), you can deselect all the elements and choose to keep only the rooms 
selected. In this way, you can edit all the rooms on a given floor at one time.

362  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
Once the rooms are selected, go to the Properties palette and modify the room heights. By 
default, rooms are inserted at 8’-0” high, and the default for metric projects is 4m. You have the 
option to set a room height directly, or you can modify the room height settings to go to the bot-
tom of the floor above. This second option is shown in Figure 9.42. Note that you’ll need to set 
Upper Limit to the floor above and set the Limit Offset value to 0 (zero). Repeat this same work-
flow for every floor of the building.

Turn on room volumes.    Now that all the heights are defined, you have to tell the appli-
cation to calculate the volumes of the spaces. By default, Revit does not perform this 
calculation. Depending on the size of your file, leaving this setting on can hinder perfor-
mance. Make sure that after you export to gbXML, you return to the Area And Volume 
Computations dialog box from the Room & Area panel on the Architecture tab and change 
the setting back to Areas Only.

Energy Modeling |  363  
To turn on room volumes, select the flyout menu from the Room & Area panel on the 
Architecture tab (Figure 9.43) and click Area And Volume Computations.
Figure 9.43
Opening Area And 
Volume Computations
Doing so opens the Area And Volume Computations dialog box. There are a couple of 
simple settings here that will allow you to activate the volume calculations (Figure 9.44). 
You’ll want to select the Areas And Volumes radio button on the Computations tab so that 
the software will calculate in the vertical dimension as well as the horizontal for your room 
elements.
The Room Area Computation setting tells Revit from where in the wall to calculate rooms. If 
you choose At Wall Finish, the software will not calculate any of the space a wall actually takes 
up with the model. Arguably, this is also conditioned space. Technically, what you would want 
is to calculate from the wall centers on interior partitions and the interior face of walls on exte-
rior walls. However, you do not have that option, so choose to calculate from At Wall Center. 
Once you’ve modified those settings, click OK.

Exporting to gbXML
Now that you have all the room settings in place, you’re ready to export to gbXML. To start this 
process, click the Application menu and select Export ➢ gbXML. If this step opens the Space 
Volumes Not Computed warning, be sure to select Yes. This will enable Revit to calculate vol-
umes instead of just areas. Next, you’ll need to decide whether you want to calculate the analy-
sis based on your rooms and areas or the energy settings (Figure 9.45). Choose the Use Room/
Area Space Volumes option.
Figure 9.46
Exporting gbXML 
settings
Once you do that, a dialog box like the one in Figure 9.46 will open, allowing you to refine 
your settings for a gbXML export.
There are a few things to take note of in this dialog box. First, you’ll see a 3D image of the 
building showing all the room volumes that are bound by the exterior building geometry. You 
can see in our building visualization that the boundary for the building is not completely full 
of room elements and that some of the room elements do not visually extend to the floor above. 
Figure 9.45
Choosing the analysis 
type

Energy Modeling |  365  
This would be your first clue that all your rooms do not have room elements placed or set prop-
erly, and you’ll want to dismiss this dialog box to change those settings.
Second, you’ll notice the ViewCube feature at the upper right of the 3D view window. This 
window will respond to all the same commands that a default 3D view will, directly in the Revit 
interface, allowing you to turn, pan, and zoom the visualization.
There are also two tabs on the right of this dialog box. The General tab contains general 
information about your building (building type, location, ground plane, and project phase), and 
you’ll want to verify that it is filled out properly. These settings will help determine the building 
use type (for conceptual-level energy modeling) and the location of your building in the world. 
There are two other settings that you’ll need to be aware of: Sliver Space Tolerance and Export 
Complexity. Sliver Space Tolerance will help take into account that you might not have fully 
buttoned up your Revit building geometry. This will allow you a gap of up to a foot, and the 
software will assume that those gaps (12”/300 mm or less) are not meant to be there. The Export 
Complexity setting allows you to modify the complexity of the gbXML export. You have several 
choices (Figure 9.47) based on the complexity of your model and the export. These are identical 
to the ones found in the Energy Settings dialog box.
Figure 9.47
Exporting complexity 
settings
The Details tab will give you a room-by-room breakdown of all the room elements that will 
be exported in the gbXML model. Figure 9.48 shows the expanded Details tab. This is an impor-
tant place to check because, as you’ll also notice, this dialog box will report errors or warnings 
with those room elements.
Figure 9.48
The Details tab allows 
you to examine any 
errors or warnings.

366  | CHAPTER 9  Conceptual Design and Design Analysis    
If you expand any of the levels and select a room, clicking the warning triangle will give 
you a list of the errors and warnings associated with that room. You’ll want to make sure your 
gbXML export is free of any errors or warnings before completing the export.
Once you’re ready to finish the export, click Next. This will give you the standard Save As 
dialog box, allowing you to locate and name your gbXML file. Depending on the size and com-
plexity of your building, a gbXML export can take several minutes and the resulting file size can 
be tens of megabytes.
You’re now ready to import the gbXML file into your energy analysis application to begin 
computing your energy loads.

 Chapter  10 
 Working with phasing, Groups, 
and Design Options 
 Projects will progress through various stages during design and construction. As a result, it’s 
sometimes necessary to distinguish the element of time within your project: when something is 
created, if it is demolished, and what it will look like when the project is complete. Beyond just 
phasing, design is also about maintaining relationships between repetitive elements. Sometimes 
this repetitive element can be a single component in your project, such as a light or a piece of furni-
ture. But it can also be an entire collection of elements, such as a typical room in a hotel or hospital. 
 Another fundamental aspect of design is the iteration of options. You have to be able to see 
many ideas simultaneously and in context with other ideas. The client and contractor need to 
see options and alternates. It’s important that these options not be fully independent, separate 
fi les so that the results can be analyzed and compared. 
 This chapter focuses on these three concepts: time, repetition, and iteration of options. In 
Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software, they’re addressed with phasing, groups, and design 
options, respectively. 
In this chapter, you’ll learn to:
 
◆
 Use the Phasing tools to create, demolish, and propose a new design 
 
◆
 Understand and utilize groups 
 
◆
 Create and use design options 
 Using phasing 
Phasing is the software’s method of allowing you to add the element of time to objects in your 
project. It’s easy to think of an architectural design in terms of what something is, where some-
thing is, and how it will be assembled. Phasing adds the dimension of  when something is, which 
is incredibly useful and powerful. 
 Phases are most useful for doing the kinds of tasks that require you to show when elements 
are being introduced into your design: showing demolition and new construction in an existing 
building, or showing different drawing packages as examples. But a few words of caution and 
clarifi cation: We don’t recommend using extensive phasing to simulate construction sequencing, 
which is sometimes referred to as 4D. It might seem like a great idea at fi rst, but ultimately it 
will degrade the performance of your model and lead to confusion across your project team. 
 There’s a far more effi cient method of simulating construction sequences that allows model 
elements to be scheduled, viewed, and even color-coded based on the sequence value that you 
defi ne: project parameters. 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

368  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
By using project parameters, you’re able to create and assign an instance parameter value 
to everything in your project that you’d want to assign a construction sequence, as shown in 
Figure 10.1.
Figure 10.1
Creating a construc-
tion sequence instance 
parameter for project 
geometry
Once you’ve created this instance parameter, you’ll be able to create view filters that override 
the default display style of an object based on the parameter value, as shown in Figure 10.2. Each 
construction week value is assigned to a filter rule.
Figure 10.2
Developing filters  
by parameter

Using Phasing |  369  
Combined with visibility and graphic overrides, you’re able to create a filter that modifies the 
graphics based on a parameter, as shown in Figure 10.3.
Figure 10.3
Applying filters to 
graphic override 
settings
As a result of applying parameter-based filters, you will be able to modify the graphics of 
a view to illustrate some metadata about the objects in a far more flexible and predictable way 
than the phasing functionality, as shown in Figure 10.4. Another benefit is that this technique is 
not limited to views of geometry. View filters can be applied to any view, including schedules, 
which will allow you to group and filter schedules based on your unique project parameter.
Figure 10.4
Using parameters and 
view filters to override 
graphics
Now that you understand a better way to create sequencing in Revit using parameters and 
filters, we’ll discuss how phasing is best used. To work along with the steps in the following 
section, download and open the file c10-Phases-Start.rvt from this book’s web page at 
www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.
What Can You Phase?
All modeled elements in Revit have two parameters associated with phasing: Phase Created 
and Phase Demolished. When you place geometry in a view, the Phase Created property by 
default is the phase assigned to that view. For example, if your view is set to Phase Existing, all 
elements you place in that view will automatically be assigned to the Existing phase. After an 
element is placed in the project, the phase can always be changed in the Properties palette, as 
shown in Figure 10.5.

370  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Rooms also have phasing properties, but there is an important difference: The Phase property 
of a room cannot be changed after it is placed. As shown in Figure 10.6, the phase is shown in 
the Properties palette, but it is read only. If you want to change the phase of a room, you’ll need 
to delete and re-create the room in a view that is assigned the desired phase. You also might find 
it faster to press Ctrl+X to cut the rooms from one view and then press Ctrl+V to paste them into 
a view that has been set to the desired phase.

of geometry (near the 
bottom of the dialog 
box)

The phase of a room 
may not be changed 
after placement.

Using Phasing |  371  
The phase of an element when initially placed is often confusing to a new user, but it is quite 
simple: The phase of the view that you’re placing the element into determines the element’s 
phase, as shown in Figure 10.7. This is more critical for rooms than for building elements because 
the phase of a building element can be changed after placement. But there may be occasions 
when you’re placing many elements that you intend to be in a particular phase, and you’ll want 
to create a view with that phase active. This will allow you to place elements in that view and 
not worry about changing their phase later.
Figure 10.7
Changing the phase  
of a view
Implementing Phase Settings
Applying the notion of time to your project may seem complicated, but it is quite simple 
to implement. You need to understand three basic aspects about the settings related to 
phasing:
◆
◆
What are the major phases of your project?
◆
◆
How will you use the phasing properties to filter views within your project 
documentation?
◆
◆
What is the graphic convention to convey an object’s phase?
These aspects are expressed in the three tabs of the Phasing dialog box. On the 
Manage tab of the ribbon, click the Phasing button to open the Phasing dialog box,  
shown in Figure 10.8.

372  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Applying Project Phases
In the most common of phased projects, you’ll have views to illustrate Existing, Demolition, 
and New Construction conditions. On more complex projects, you might have several stages of 
new construction as you build out larger facilities. Because this dialog box shows only Existing 
and New Construction, new users will mistakenly create a new phase for Demolition. As we’ll 
demonstrate later, demolished elements are represented with phase filters, not as a dedicated 
project phase.
So, when do you need to create more than the phases shown by default? As one example, 
think of a staged construction project that will happen in two new phases. In this scenario, 
you are designing with a start time for the building shell followed by another phase for inte-
riors, allowing the owner to split funding for the project into two budgets. In phase one, the 
building core and shell are built. In the second phase, interior construction occurs. Your first 
phase is labeled Shell and Core. Your other phase is labeled Interiors. This phasing also gives 
a contractor who is familiar with Revit the ability to use the model to see what needs to be 
built and when. Depending on how your model is created, the contractor can even do cost 
estimates by phase.
In the Project Phases tab of the Phasing dialog box, create the two phases as we just 
described (Figure 10.9). You can simply rename the New Construction phase Shell and Core. 
Click the Insert After button to create an additional project phase and then rename it Interiors. 
We’ll use these in a sample exercise in a moment. When you’re creating phases, you might 
notice there’s no Delete button. You can’t delete a phase once you’ve added it because you don’t 
want to delete any geometry placed on a phase. Should your planning process change and 
you want to eliminate a phase, you can merge two phases using either of the Combine With 
buttons on the right.
Figure 10.8

dialog box

Click OK to accept the changes and close the Phasing dialog box, and then activate the 
Level 1 floor plan. Once you’ve created these additional project phases, pick any project geom-
etry and look at its instance parameters. You’ll notice in the Properties palette that it can be 
assigned to any one of these three phases, as shown in Figure 10.10.

374  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Applying Phase Filters
Return to the Manage tab in the ribbon and once again click the Phasing tool. The middle tab in 
the Phasing dialog box is Phase Filters (Figure 10.11). Seven predefined phase filters are listed.
Figure 10.11
The Phase Filters tab 
with seven predefined 
phase filters
Don’t be concerned if the filter names seem a bit cryptic at first. What’s really important is the 
four graphic conditions that can be overridden: New, Existing, Demolished, and Temporary. Let’s 
take a moment to explore how these graphic conditions are applied to a virtually unlimited number 
of user-defined project phases. Any object you place into a project has certain states relative to any 
particular phase. In other words, you might ask the following questions about a model element:
◆
◆
Was it created in the current phase? That’s new.
◆
◆
Was it created in a previous phase? That’s existing.
◆
◆
Was it created in a previous phase and demolished in the current phase? That’s demolished.
◆
◆
Is the object created and demolished in the same phase? That’s temporary.
As you can see, phase filters are relative settings. That is, the filters are relative to the phasing 
properties of the object and the phase of the view in which the object is displayed. Also realize 
that although phases are applied to elements, phase filters are applied only to views.
Now let’s explore the predefined ways a phase filter can be applied. Select any of the drop-down 
menus, as shown in Figure 10.12. You’ll notice that the phase filter can override the graphics in one 
of three ways:
◆
◆
By Category: The object can be shown by its category settings or not overridden. It will be 
displayed in the project just as it does by default.
◆
◆
Overridden: This means that you can define a graphic override for that object. We’ll get 
into the graphic overrides in a moment.
◆
◆
Not Displayed: The object is hidden in the view.

Using Phasing |  375  
Once you understand how each of the phase filters displays objects, phases can begin to 
make sense. For example, the Show Complete phase filter shows New and Existing elements 
By Category. But Demolished and Temporary elements are not displayed at all. Use this setting 
when you want to show the model in a finished condition. Another example is to use the Show 
New phase filter in a schedule such as in a door schedule. The Show New filter will include only 
those doors that are assigned to the phase that is also assigned to the schedule. The schedule 
will not list any existing doors or doors that were demolished.
If there’s any remaining confusion, it probably involves the naming convention of Show Previous + 
Demo. A better name might be Show Existing + Demolition, but Existing is a bit misleading because 
this setting is showing the previous phase, which is not necessarily existing elements. They might be 
temporary elements that need to be demolished. Therefore, Show Previous makes more sense.
Using Graphic Overrides
The Graphic Overrides tab is the final tab in the Phasing dialog box (Figure 10.13). This dialog 
box relates back to the Overridden assignment of the previous tab.
Figure 10.12
Setting a filter override
Figure 10.13
The Graphic  
Overrides tab
This tab allows you to override geometry in a few areas: the Lines and Patterns character-
istics of Projection/Surface and Cut (which refers to the cut profile of objects). You also have 
the option to just halftone the element. Finally, you can assign a unique Material setting when 

376  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
rendering. Although this ability is helpful for rendering with phase information, it can also 
be useful for rendering everything to a matte material, something we discuss in Chapter 11, 
“Visualization.” As it is, phasing can show you where you are (new construction) and where 
you’re coming from (existing), but not where you’re going (future).
Illustrating the Geometry Phase
Here’s a simple exercise to illustrate each of the phases in a single view. Download and open the 
c10-Phases-Start.rvt file from the book’s companion web page if you have not already done 
so. Activate the default 3D view (Figure 10.14).
Figure 10.14
Four generic walls
By default, all of these walls have been created in the New Construction phase because 
the phase of the view is New Construction. Now, selecting each of the walls from left to right, 
associate them with each of the following phase settings:
◆
◆
Wall 1: Phase Created: Existing/Phase Demolished: None
◆
◆
Wall 2: Phase Created: Existing/Phase Demolished: New Construction
◆
◆
Wall 3: Phase Created: New Construction/Phase Demolished: None
◆
◆
Wall 4: Phase Created: New Construction/Phase Demolished: New Construction
It’s Hammer Time
Throughout most of this chapter we show you how to set the Phase Demolished property in the 
Properties palette, but there’s a more fun way to change this parameter. In the Modify tab of the rib-
bon, within the Geometry panel you will find the Demolish hammer. Activate this tool and you can 
simply click model elements in the active view to set their Phase Demolished property to the phase 
of the view. It’s even been suggested to Autodesk to include a hammering sound effect to this tool!
In Figure 10.15, you’ll notice that Wall 1 (Existing/Phase Demolished: None) and Wall 3 (New 
Construction/Phase Demolished: None) look similar. Graphically, this might not be enough to 
demonstrate the different phases, so let’s change the graphic properties of the Existing wall so 
it’s visually more distinct.

Switch to the Graphics tab and under the Shading properties, check the Use Render

well. Click OK to close the Material Browser. When you finish changing these settings, you’ll 
have the result shown in Figure 10.19, with each phase shown distinctively within the view.
Figure 10.19
Finished shading 
values
Once you settle on a color and graphic scheme, we recommend making this particular set-
ting part of your default project template or your office’s standards. That way, new users will be 
able to distinguish the phase of an object far more clearly, and the standard will be consistent 
throughout your office.
Using the View Phase
Now that we’ve discussed the phasing properties of geometry, we’ll cover the phase properties 
of the views. Starting with the 3D view from the previous example, examine the view properties 
in the Properties palette, provided there are no model elements selected (Figure 10.20). We have 
collapsed some of the property groups at the top to show the Phasing properties at the bottom 
of the list.
Figure 10.20
Phasing options for  
a view

380  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Remember that all the graphic overrides and filters for phasing are relative to the phase 
that is assigned to geometry or a view. By default, the New Construction phase is assigned to 
new views created in your project. This phase assignment can be changed at any time from 
the Properties palette. The phase property can also be assigned to a view template for easier 
management of this parameter.
The next important step is to apply the most appropriate phase filter. To illustrate how a 
phase filter changes the way objects are displayed in a view, you will step through several filters 
in the following exercises.
The default phase filter is Show All (Figure 10.21). This filter will show all the model elements rel-
ative to the phase assigned to the view and will override their graphics based on their Phase Created 
and Phase Demolished parameters. It also gives you a sense of all the elements as they exist in time.
Figure 10.21

Construction phase

Although this is great for 3D views, where every phase has a distinct color, it’s also useful for 
working in a plan, elevation, or section. To turn this graphic visibility on, activate the Level 1 floor 
plan from the Project Browser and change the Graphic Display setting to Shaded or Consistent Colors. 
You’ll be able to clearly distinguish between objects in different phases, as shown in Figure 10.22.
Figure 10.22
Shaded plan view of

Using Phasing |  381  
Now let’s start moving through each of the phase filters. But here’s an important note: Rather 
than moving through the various phase filters from top to bottom, let’s move through time by 
changing the Phase parameter.
Return to the 3D view and keep the Phase Filter set to Show All, but change the Phase to 
Existing (Figure 10.23). This will show only the objects created in the Existing phase—and their 
graphics are not overridden. The two walls that were assigned to the New Construction phase 
are not shown in the view because Revit does not provide a way to see future construction 
beyond the phase assigned to the view.
Figure 10.23
Show All phase filter 
for the Existing phase
Set the phase of the view back to New Construction and set the phase filter to Show 
Previous + Demo (Figure 10.24). This filter still shows only the existing walls (the walls from the 
previous phase). One of the walls is clearly being demolished. Keep in mind that the graphic 
overrides that are being applied are relative to what you’d be seeing through the lens of the New 
Construction phase.
Figure 10.24
Show Previous + Demo 
phase filter
Now select Show Previous Phase as the phase filter, as shown in Figure 10.25. The 
demolished element is no longer shown.

382  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
We’ll move forward another moment in time and set the phase filter to Show Previous + New. 
This shows only the remaining elements (not any of the demolished content) from the present 
and previous views (Figure 10.26). It is not always necessary to click Apply in the Properties 
palette each time you want to apply the settings you’ve just changed. Moving your mouse 
pointer outside the palette has the same effect as clicking Apply.
Figure 10.25
Show Previous Phase 
phase filter
Figure 10.26
Show Previous + New 
phase filter
This visualization brings up another interesting point: Why not show the remaining existing 
elements as well as the proposed and temporary elements? Although you could also create a 
new phase filter, for this example we’ll change the settings of the Show Previous + New graphic 
phase filter (Figure 10.27). From the Manage tab on the ribbon, click the Phases tool again. 
Choose the Phase Filters tab, and in the Show Previous + New row, go to the Temporary column 
and change the setting to Overridden.

Click OK to exit the dialog box. Figure 10.28 shows the result.
Figure 10.28

porary elements added
The next step in the sequence is to set the view to Show Demo + New, which will show 
demolished elements from the present phase as well as any new elements from the present 
phase (see Figure 10.29). The numbers disappeared because they are Model Text elements that 
were placed on the Existing phase.
Figure 10.29

Moving forward in time, let’s now show only the elements in the New Construction phase. 
Set the phase filter to Show New and only one wall will be displayed, as shown in Figure 10.30.
Figure 10.30

384  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Now comes the final phase filter setting, Show Complete (Figure 10.31). This shows only the 
existing elements that were not demolished in previous phases up to the phase assigned to the 
view. Elements that are demolished in any phase are not displayed, and neither existing nor new 
elements are overridden. This phase filter is most often used for camera views where a render-
ing of the finished conditions may need to be generated without any sort of graphic overrides.
Figure 10.31

Phasing with Linked Models
If you are working on larger-scale projects, you’ll want to keep some additional factors in mind 
when using phasing. To control your phasing between linked models (which could be linked archi-
tectural models or consultant models), make sure your phase names are identical. If one model has 
“Existing + Demo” and the other team has “existing+demo,” the linked models will see those as 
different phases. Remember: Consistency is the key.
Creating and Using Groups
It’s easy to think of groups as functionally similar to blocks in Autodesk® AutoCAD® software 
or cells in Bentley MicroStation, but groups can be much more. They are great at maintaining 
repetition within your project, but there are some major differences:
◆
◆
Creating groups is quite easy. And whether it’s a 2D or 3D group, the insertion point for the 
group is easily defined and modified. The same can’t be said of simple 2D blocks in other 
applications.
◆
◆
Updating groups is a breeze. It’s easy and intuitive to modify a group after it’s been cre-
ated. Practically anyone on your team can do it, which means that design workflow will not 
bottleneck in your project team.
◆
◆
Copying groups throughout your project is also a breeze. Groups can be copied across 
different levels, rotated, and even mirrored. We cover groups in more detail later in this 
chapter.
There are a few good practices that you’ll want to keep in mind when using groups. But 
they’re so straightforward that you’ll wonder how you’ve ever worked without them.

Creating and Using Groups |  385  
Creating Groups
You can create two kinds of groups in Revit. One kind is just for geometry, and these groups are 
called model groups. The other is just for view-specific content like text, tags, dimensions, and 
so on, and these groups are called detail groups. You can create one kind of group or the other 
explicitly. But if you try to create a group with both model and detail elements, Revit is smart 
enough to create a separate detail group that’s associated with the model group.
To demonstrate this, download and open the file c10-Groups-Start.rvt or c10-Groups-
Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page. Activate the Level 1 floor plan and you will see 
four walls with dimensions, as shown in Figure 10.32.
Figure 10.32
Four walls and dimensions
Select the walls and dimensions in the view, and click the Create Group button on the con-
textual ribbon in the Create panel. Keep the default name, Group 1, for both Model Group and 
Attached Detail Group (Figure 10.33).
Figure 10.33

and attached detail 
group

386  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Now select the group of walls and copy it to the side of your original group. You’ll notice that 
only the model-based group is copied, which is fine for now (Figure 10.34).
Figure 10.34
Copied model group
It is a simple process to associate the detail group to another instance of the model group. 
Select the group and then click the Attached Detail Groups button on the Group panel in the 
contextual ribbon, and you’ll see the dialog box shown in Figure 10.35. Select the check box for 
Group 1 from the list and click OK.

The results are fairly straightforward (Figure 10.36). Both groups are now identical with 
geometry and dimensions.

Modifying Groups
Now that you’ve created two identical groups, let’s add a door to one of the walls that belong to 
the group, as shown in Figure 10.37. But don’t add the door to the group—just place it in one of 
the walls as you would with any nongrouped wall.
Figure 10.37
Adding a door outside 
of Edit Group mode
Now select the group to the left (the one with the new door) and select Edit Group from the 
Group panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon. You’ll enter a special editing environment, shown 
in Figure 10.38, and the nongrouped elements will be grayed out. The screen overlay color alerts 
you that you are in Edit Group mode. The screen will appear with a yellow background in this 
mode. Here you’ll be able to add, remove, and attach other elements to your group.
Figure 10.38
Edit Group mode
Now add the door to the group by selecting the Add function from the Edit Group panel. 
When you add an element to the group, it will appear black in the Edit Group mode, letting you 

388  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
know you were able to successfully add it to your group. You’ll notice that you can’t add the 
door numbers because this is a model group and tags are 2D components. Now finish the group 
by clicking the Finish button (the green check), and you’ll notice that both groups now have a 
door in the same location (Figure 10.39).
Figure 10.39
Finished group
The process is essentially the same for modifying any group: Start the Edit Group mode, 
make the changes and/or additions, and then finish the group.
Creating New Groups
Sometimes the easiest way to make a new group is to copy and modify an old one. A quick way 
to do this is to right-click the name of the group you want to duplicate in the Project Browser 
and choose Duplicate from the context menu, as shown in Figure 10.40. Complete this command 
and make sure the new group is named Group 2 in the Project Browser.
Figure 10.40
Duplicating a group
Return to the plan view and select your group. Notice in the Type Selector that you can swap 
between groups in the same way you can swap between types within a family. Choose Group 2 
in the Type Selector so you have one of each group type on the screen.

Creating and Using Groups |  389  
With Group 2 still selected, click Edit Group from the contextual tab in the ribbon. Edit it by 
making it 13’-6” square (4 m), as shown in Figure 10.41; then finish the group.
Figure 10.41
Modifying the second 
group type
Groups have insertion points that you need to consider before you exchange one group for 
another. When you create a group, the insertion point is initially at the geometric center of all 
the elements in the group. The group’s origin is also identified by x- and y-coordinates.
But keep in mind that as you edit the group, the insertion point doesn’t move until you delib-
erately relocate it. This can be seen in Figure 10.42; editing the geometry for Group 2 retains the 
same insertion point that was active when the group was initially created. Even though we’ve 
modified the group, the insertion point remains where it was originally when the group was 
created. (When editing this group, the left wall was moved to the right and the top wall was 
moved down to achieve the dimensions.)
Figure 10.42
Insertion points in 
different groups
Moving the insertion point is an easy matter of dragging (and, if necessary, rotating) the 
Insertion Point icon to a common location before swapping one group for another (Figure 10.43). 
Drag the insertion points for both Group 1 and Group 2 to the inside face of the walls at the 
lower-left corner.

390  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Once you have adjusted the insertion points of multiple similar groups, swapping groups 
will occur at the same relative location. Figure 10.44 illustrates Group 1 being swapped for 
Group 2, and vice versa, but common insertion points are maintained. Select the instance of 
Group 1 in the floor plan and choose Group 2 from the Type Selector.
Figure 10.43

Excluding Elements within Groups
There will be occasions where everything in a group works great and it works throughout the 
project—except for that one particular case where a condition is slightly different. In the past, 
you had to create new groups for each slight exception, which might have been conceptually 
consistent but often led to a much longer list of group variants. You were left with little ability to 
cohesively modify them as the project size (and number of groups) continued to grow.
This workflow is now deftly handled by excluding individual elements from groups. The original 
group definitions remain intact, and schedules are aware of excluded elements. Figure 10.45 shows 
an example of this in practice. We’ve created another instance of Group 1; however, there’s a column 
right in the middle of the door.
We don’t want to destroy the integrity of the group and give up being able to quickly modify 
similar elements, but we also cannot advance the design with the column located where it is 
shown. To resolve this, hover the mouse pointer over the door within the group and then press 
the Tab key until the door is highlighted, right-click it, and select Create Similar from the con-
text menu. This will allow you to place a new door in a better location. This door will not be 
part of the group. In Figure 10.46, the new door has been placed above the grouped door, and its 
swing direction has been flipped.

Creating and Using Groups |  391  
Figure 10.45
A column location 
conflicts with the door 
in our sample group.
Figure 10.46
Adding a new door 
using Create Similar
Now you can exclude the door that conflicts with the column as an exception to the original 
group definition. This process can be a bit confusing at first because you don’t need to enter 
Group Edit mode to exclude members from groups. Simply hover the mouse pointer over  
the door and press the Tab key until the door is highlighted. Select the door, as shown in  
Figure 10.47.

392  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Once the door in the group is selected, you’ll notice an icon pointing to the door. Clicking 
this icon will allow you to exclude the door as an exception to the group. The icon will change 
and show a red hash through it. This means the element is now excluded and will automatically 
be deleted when you deselect the group. The wall will heal itself as if the door were never there.
How can you tell if a given group has elements that have been excluded? Selecting the group 
will reveal any hidden elements in the group that are excluded (Figure 10.48). Just tab through to 
select the hidden door to include the component back into the group.

Saving and Loading Groups
Even though we stress the fact that Revit is a whole-process BIM application (by integrating the 
modeling, documentation, and multiuser workflow into one database), there are times when 
you’ll want to share the data across many files.

Creating and Using Groups |  393  
Just as you wouldn’t want your family components locked up inside a project file, there are 
good reasons to keep commonly used groups outside your project. You might even want to keep 
them in a folder just as you do your custom content so you can use them again on similar proj-
ects or as part of your office’s library. You can do so by saving groups outside your projects.
Saving groups is a simple matter of right-clicking the group name in your Project Browser 
and selecting Save Group (Figure 10.49).
Figure 10.49
Saving groups from the 
Project Browser
You’ll then be prompted to save the group as an RVT file. You can open this file as you would 
any other RVT file if you’d like to modify it later and then reload the group into the project in 
order to update all the instances. To load an external group into a project, go to the Insert tab in 
the ribbon. On the Load From Library panel, choose Load As Group.
Be aware that when you load the group in a project, if the group name already exists, you’ll 
be given a warning. You can overwrite the existing group (by selecting Yes) or load with the 
option to rename the group that’s being loaded (by selecting No). Or you can cancel the opera-
tion altogether (Figure 10.50).
Figure 10.50
Loading groups with 
the same name

394  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
What’s really great is that when you reload the group, Revit even remembers to exclude previ-
ously excluded elements from the group that’s been modified in another session. Figure 10.51 shows 
that a desk and chair have been added to Group 1 in the RVT file saved from the original group. 
The group has been reloaded, overwriting the original group, but the exclusion remains intact.
Figure 10.51
Retaining excluded 
group elements
Creating Groups from Links
Because groups are also RVT files, they can be linked into the project environment as well. 
Although you can’t edit a link in place (as with a group), there are some excellent reasons why 
you might want to start a group as a link and then bind the link at a later time. Binding a linked 
project will convert it to a group. Groups and links can also exist within design options (more 
on design options later in this chapter). To follow this workflow, use these steps:
	
1.	 From the Insert tab in the ribbon, choose Link Revit from the Link panel (Figure 10.52).
Figure 10.52
Use the Link Revit 
command to add 
groups as links.
	
2.	 Browse to the group you just exported and click Open.
After the link has been placed, you can copy it throughout your project as you would any 
other element in Revit. Keep in mind that all the functionality between groups and non-grouped 
elements will not behave the same in links as it does throughout the rest of your project. For 
example, in Figure 10.53, the upper-right collection of walls and furniture is a link, not a group. 
As a result, walls are not cleaning up between linked models and groups in the same way they 
are between groups and other walls in the project.

Creating and Using Groups |  395  
Figure 10.53
Walls don’t join to 
linked models.
This graphic restriction may not be a concern during early stages of design, when links allow 
for a lot of rapid flexibility. After you’ve resolved your design using linked models, you can bind 
them into the project environment by selecting each link in a view and clicking Bind Link from 
the contextual tab in the ribbon.
Rather than explode the linked model into separate and unrelated elements, Revit converts 
the link to a group. Once this happens, walls easily join across groups, as shown in Figure 10.54.
Figure 10.54
Wall joins are 
resolved when linked 
models are bound in 
the current project.

396  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Using Best Practices for Groups
So far, you have learned that groups can help you maintain consistency among repeated ele-
ments and will facilitate additional design iteration; however, there are some important excep-
tions that you will want to note. Nearly every time a problem crops up with groups, it’s the 
result of ignoring one of the following best practices:
Don’t put datum objects in your group.    Avoid putting datum objects (levels and grids) 
inside your group. First, you can’t manage the extents of the datum objects unless you’re in 
Edit Group mode, which can create conflicts elsewhere in your project. Of course, you will 
have the option to not include the datum objects when you bind your link. Again, doing so 
doesn’t necessarily create a technical hurdle, but it can create a lot of confusion. We’ve seen 
situations where duplicate levels were deleted only to find out that those levels were hosting 
content in the project.
Don’t nest groups.    In other words, avoid creating groups within other groups. Although 
nesting can save time in some situations when the design is preliminary and your team is 
trying to distribute content and design ideas quickly, you’ll likely find a point of diminishing 
returns as the design evolves. You can’t get to all the features and functionality of Revit when 
you’re in Edit Group mode. And if you’re nested deep into groups and trying to modify proj-
ect properties, you’ll quickly get frustrated digging in, out, and across nested groups to go 
back and forth between your group and the project.
Group hosted elements and their hosts together.    Always keep your hosted elements 
and hosts together. For example, do not group doors and windows without the walls that 
are hosting them. If any of the windows in a group become unhosted from walls and then 
deleted, this will delete the respective windows in all other group instances—even if they are 
properly hosted.
Don’t use attached relationships in groups.    The top constraints of walls are commonly 
attached to levels or other hosts like floors and roofs, but these relationships should be 
avoided in groups. If you manipulate the datum or attached host and the relationship creates 
inconsistent conditions among the instances of the group, you’ll see a warning asking you to 
fix the groups (Figure 10.55).
Figure 10.55
Avoid attaching with 
groups.
Fixing the group really doesn’t fix the group. It actually explodes it or creates a new group 
that is no longer referenced to the first group (Figure 10.56).

Making Design Options for Design Iteration |  397  
Don’t mirror groups.    Finally, and maybe most important, don’t mirror groups. Instead, it’s 
better to create left and right versions. Does mirroring work in concept? Yes. Does it work in 
the real world? Not really.
Think about it. You’d love to be able to mirror that prototype coffee shop, right? Mirror the 
coffee shop—and all the equipment in the group—and now the baristas are foaming milk on 
the right rather than the left. This might look great in a rendering, but it doesn’t make sense 
for the company that manufactures the espresso machines.
And now the display cases have power supplies on the wrong side. The cash register has 
keys on the wrong side. The desk in the manager’s office now has drawers on the left and 
filing cabinets on the right. And to make matters worse, the sink in the bathroom now has 
hot water coming from the wrong faucet. Again, it makes all the conceptual sense in the 
world to be able to mirror a building—and a group. But trying to make it work can cost a 
lot of time and money. And that’s just a coffee shop. If you think it’s a good idea to mirror a 
hospital room or a surgical theater or some other mission-critical building or civil construct, 
well, it could end badly. Or you will have to work very, very late to resolve the issues.
If you’d like to download the file that has been created during the examples, you can find it in 
the Chapter 10 folder on the book’s web page; the file is called c10-Groups-Finished.rvt.
Making Design Options for Design Iteration
Revit software provides a unique set of tools for developing multiple design iterations in the 
confines of a single-model environment. You can use these tools to explore alternative designs 
without the need to save multiple independent versions of your model as you move in differ-
ent directions. You’re free to investigate multiple roof configurations or different entry canopies 
or to explore various furniture, office layouts, and stairs—quite literally anything that can be 
modeled. This functionality also allows you to create views that show each option so multiple 
designs can be compared.
Let’s begin by establishing a fundamental understanding of the workflow for design options. 
First, you have a main model, which includes all the elements you’ve learned how to model so far in 
this book. The main model can be thought of as a backdrop or stage on which different options are 
displayed. Elements in the main model are always visible by default, whereas design options come 
and go, appearing and disappearing depending on which design option you’re editing or viewing. 
Put another way, the main model includes everything else that’s not in the design options.
Figure 10.56
Resolving attachments 
warning

398  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
You begin to explore design options by first creating a named option set—for example, 
Canopy Options. Within the option set, you then define options, the first of which is the pri-
mary option. Each option can be named to help you identify the intent, such as Glass Canopy 
and Steel Canopy. From here, you need to either select elements you’ve already modeled and 
add them to the appropriate design options or edit each option and create the elements with the 
Design Options tool active. Either way, the primary option in each option set will be displayed 
throughout your project by default. You can make as many options as you need—there is no 
limit.
The last part of configuring design options is to create some additional views in which to 
compare the ideas. As soon as you start creating design options in a project, the Design Options 
tab is added to the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. In this interface, you can select a 
specific option to be displayed for any of the option sets in the project. You can then present 
them to a client, to the project architect, or to other stakeholders in the design process. At any 
time, you may set any other option as the primary option. This will affect any views that are 
displaying the default option.
When an option within a set is finalized, you can accept the primary design solution and add 
it back to the main model. Doing so deletes all elements in the other options within the option 
set and merges your accepted option back into the main model.
Creating Design Options
Let’s now explore the use of design options with a simple exercise. Download and open the file 
c10-DesignOptions-Start.rvt or c10-DesignOptions-Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s 
web page. The sample files have a simple layout of walls, as shown in Figure 10.57.
Figure 10.57
Create a simple layout 
of walls to begin 
studying design 
options.
Starting in the Level 1 view, you’re going to configure this simple space into a design option 
that divides the space vertically in one option and horizontally in the other:
	
1.	 From the Manage tab in the ribbon, locate the Design Options panel (Figure 10.58) and 
then click the Design Options button.

Making Design Options for Design Iteration |  399  
You can also access the Design Options tool from the status bar at the bottom of the 
application window.
Figure 10.58
Launching the Design 
Options tool
	
2.	 In the Design Options dialog box, click New in the Option Set area to create a new option 
set. This will automatically create one design option within the set.
	
3.	 Click New in the Option area of the dialog box to create an Option 2 option, as shown in 
Figure 10.59. Click Close to dismiss the dialog box.
Figure 10.59
Creating an option set 
and two options
Now that you’ve started creating design options, everything in the project is considered 
the main model. You can start adding elements to one of the two options.
	
4.	 Select the center wall, which will immediately initiate the Modify | Walls contextual tab 
in the ribbon.
With the wall segment selected, you can find the Add To Set button in either the Manage 
tab in the ribbon or the Design Options toolbar in the status bar (Figure 10.60).

400  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
	
5.	 In the Add To Design Option Set dialog box, add the wall to Option 1 but not Option 2, as 
shown in Figure 10.61.
Figure 10.60
Using the Add To Set 
tool on the Design 
Options panel
Figure 10.61
Adding elements to 
option sets
Note that when the elements are added to the option set, you immediately lose the ability 
to select them within the main model. This is because an option called Exclude Options in the 
status bar is checked by default. The purpose of this option is to support a workflow in which 
design options are explicitly edited. Otherwise, it is assumed you are working exclusively on 
other parts of the building design. Of course, you can disable this option at any time by dese-
lecting the check box in the status bar.
Editing Design Options
Selecting a design option to edit allows you to enter a special mode called Edit Option mode. In 
this mode, you can add elements you’ve already created in the main model or create them from 
within the option set. The elements that are not inside this option set turn light gray, indicating 
that they are not editable.
Entering Edit Option mode is quite easy. From the drop-down list in the Design Options 
toolbar or from the Design Options panel in the Manage tab, select the option you want to begin 
editing (Figure 10.62). In our example, we chose Option 2.
Figure 10.62
Accessing Edit Option 
mode

Making Design Options for Design Iteration |  401  
Once you have entered Edit Option mode, you will notice that the wall you added to Option 1 
is not visible. Add one horizontal wall dividing the space, as shown in Figure 10.63. Note that 
anything else you add to the project while in Edit Option mode will be assigned to that design 
option. You can also modify or delete any elements in the selected option in this mode.
Figure 10.63
Adding a wall in Edit 
Option mode
To exit Edit Option mode, return to the Design Options drop-down list and select Main 
Model. Remember that only the primary option will appear by default; therefore, when you 
finish adding the horizontal wall to Option 2 and you return to the main model, the horizontal 
wall will disappear and the vertical wall will reappear. In the next section, you’ll learn how to 
control the visibility of design options.
Viewing and Scheduling Design Options
You’ll notice that whenever you switch between Option 1 and Option 2, the view automatically 
changes to show the option that you’ve selected. Initiating design options automatically creates 
a new tab in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. By default, a design option’s display 
shows as <Automatic> (Figure 10.64). This means that the Primary design option (in this case, 
Option 1) will be shown in the view.
Figure 10.64
The Design Options 
tab displays 
<Automatic>.
The Design Options tab is available for any view, even for schedules. Selecting the Visibility/
Graphic settings in the view properties of a schedule filters the schedule according to the 
desired design option.

402  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
If you want to specify or lock a view to a particular design option, open the Visibility/
Graphic Overrides dialog box and select the Design Options tab. From the drop-down list, 
change the setting from <Automatic> to one of the design options (Figure 10.65).
Figure 10.65
Locking the view to a 
design option
For working views, it’s fine to leave the view properties set to <Automatic> so that the view 
switches to actively show the primary design option; however, using the Visibility/Graphic 
settings can be particularly useful for views that are being placed on sheets. To show mul-
tiple design options on one sheet, simply duplicate any relevant views and use the Visibility/
Graphic settings to set a specific design option for each view. One of the compelling visualiza-
tion techniques using this feature is perspective. You can quickly and easily show a variety 
of design options all from the same vantage point within the model by simply creating a per-
spective view, duplicating it, and setting the relevant design option in the Visibility/Graphic 
settings.
Removing Design Options and Option Sets
As your project progresses, it may become necessary to delete an option set, accept the pri-
mary design option, or delete a single design option. Although some of these methods might 
yield similar outcomes, there are important differences. Remember that you can create an 
unlimited number of option sets and any number of individual options within each set. 
Maintaining too many design options may have adverse performance effects on your project 
file, so you should be conscious of the status of all design options. As always, each option set 
should be named appropriately so that your project team can understand the intended use of 
each study.
Accepting the Primary Design Option
The most common outcome of a design option study is to accept one option and delete 
the remaining ones. The Design Option tools are built to support this workflow quite 
effectively.
To accept the primary design option, open the Design Options dialog box from the 
Manage tab or the status bar. Select the associated option set from the list. Make sure that  
the option you want to keep is the primary option. If it is not, select that option; then click 
the Make Primary button. Once that is complete, click the Accept Primary button, as shown 
in Figure 10.66.
When you accept the primary option in an option set, the geometry associated with the 
primary option is integrated into the main model. Any geometry on other options within the 
selected option set is deleted.

Making Design Options for Design Iteration |  403  
You will proceed through a series of warnings and confirmations before completing the 
process. If any views are specifically assigned to display the options being deleted, you will have 
the option to delete or retain such views (Figure 10.67). This is a good way to keep your project 
file clean and free from extraneous views related to the rapid iteration process of design options.

design option

views related to

404  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Deleting an Option Set
Do not confuse the ability to completely delete an option set with the ability to accept the pri-
mary option and delete all other options within the set. If you delete an option set, all options 
within the set are deleted. This workflow is less common because you usually study options for 
some element of your design that will need to be included in one form or another. Sometimes 
you may just need to study a potential addition to the scope of your project and it doesn’t get 
accepted. This is where it is useful to completely delete an option set.
To delete an option set, return to the Design Options dialog box and select an option set. 
Click the Delete button in the Option Set area, as shown in Figure 10.68. As in the previous exer-
cise, you will be prompted with a series of warnings and confirmations because of the content 
you are about to permanently delete from your project.
Preserving Your Design Iterations
In our experience, we have heard many stories about vast amounts of effort that have been wiped 
out when various actions are taken in a Revit model, usually for the sake of improving performance. 
One classic scenario is when several design options are created and only one is moved forward after 
certain project milestones. If you use the Design Options tool, be sure to create an archive copy 
of your project model before you activate potentially destructive commands such as accepting the 
primary design option or deleting an option set.
Figure 10.68
Deleting an option set

Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options |  405  
Deleting an Individual Option
Another common workflow in the iteration of design is to delete just one of the options within 
an option set. This may occur for various reasons, but let’s say you didn’t want to continue 
exploring the option for all enclosed offices in the furniture layout for the first floor of your 
project. In Figure 10.69, we have the Design Options dialog box open and the All Enclosed 
option selected within the 1st Floor Furniture option set. From here, you would click the  
Delete button in the Option area, as shown in the figure.
Figure 10.69
Deleting an option 
within an option set
You cannot delete the primary option in an option set. Some other option must be assigned 
as the primary option before you can delete the original primary option. To make an option 
the primary option, open the Design Options dialog box, select an option, and click the Make 
Primary button.
Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options
Now it’s time to bring it all together—phasing, groups, and design options. In this exercise, 
we’re going to create a tenant-finish package in two phases. The first phase will start construc-
tion on one side of the space, and then we’ll turn to the other side of the space to complete the 
renovation. We’ll also rely on groups for collections of components. Finally, we’ll create a design 
option for the second space. Ultimately, you need to visualize the exercise in plan, perspective, 
and schedule.
Download the c10-Exercise-Start.rvt file from this book’s web page to get started. Before 
you start this exercise, remember that this model will be the existing condition. So rather than 
create the existing walls and then change their phase, let’s start by duplicating a view and 
changing the phase of that view so that the walls and other content are displayed as existing.

406  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
	
1.	 In the Project Browser, duplicate the Level 1 floor plan and name the duplicated view 
LEVEL 1 - EXISTING.
	
2.	 Activate the LEVEL 1 - EXISTING view, and in the Properties palette make sure the phase 
is set to Existing. Leave the phase filter set to Show All for now.
Don’t be concerned that the elevation tags have disappeared in the view. View tags are also 
phase aware, and they’re in the New Construction phase. The finished existing plan is shown in 
Figure 10.70.
Figure 10.70
The existing floor plan
As you can see, the finished existing space is really two areas. In this scenario, the tenant in 
the lower-left space is expanding and will be taking over the upper space. The idea is that we’re 
going to demolish the space in stages. We don’t want to upset the existing tenants to complete 
the phased work.
Phase 1: Demolition
In the first phase of our exercise project, we will indicate some of the existing walls to be demolished. 
You don’t want to demolish them in the existing Level 1 floor plan view because the demolition 

Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options |  407  
should take place at the start of the New Construction phase. That said, there will be two construction 
phases (so there will also be two demolition phases). Create the new phases and associated plans by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Phases. In the Phasing dialog box, rename the 
New Construction phase to New Construction - Phase 1. Click the After button and 
create a new phase named New Construction - Phase 2 (Figure 10.71). Click OK to close 
the dialog box.
Figure 10.71
Create two new  
construction phases.
	
2.	 In the Project Browser, duplicate the Level 1 floor plan. Activate the duplicated view, and 
in the Properties palette set the following values:
◆
◆
View Name: LEVEL 1 - PHASE 1 - DEMOLITION
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1
◆
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo
	
3.	 Duplicate the default 3D view, listed in the Project Browser as {3D}. Activate the dupli-
cated view, and in the Properties palette set the following values:
◆
◆
View Name: PHASE 1 - DEMOLITION
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1
◆
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo
You’ll notice in the demolition plan that the graphic override for existing walls has been 
set to include a gray solid fill. This will help to distinguish the existing, new, and demol-
ished walls. In the 3D view, existing elements are shown as transparent green to also aid 
in the visualization of the phases.
	
4.	 Demolish the walls as shown in Figure 10.72 using the Demolish tool (the small hammer) 
on the Geometry panel of the Modify tab.
You don’t have to demolish the doors if you first demolish the walls that host them.

408  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Phase 1: Proposed
Now that you’ve created a demolition plan for Phase 1 and have demolished the interior parti-
tions for that area, we’ll need to create another plan view in which you will create a new layout. 
Follow these steps to continue the exercise:
	
1.	 Duplicate the Level 1 floor plan, and in the Properties palette set the following values:
◆
◆
View Name: LEVEL 1 − PHASE 1 PROPOSED
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction − Phase 1
◆
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + New
	
2.	 Duplicate the default 3D view, listed in the Project Browser as {3D}, and in the Properties 
palette set the following values:
◆
◆
View Name: PHASE 1 – PROPOSED
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction − Phase 1
◆
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + New
	
3.	 In the LEVEL 1 − PHASE 1 − PROPOSED plan view, you will add the new elements, as 
shown in Figure 10.73. First, add segments of Curtain Wall: Storefront to the existing 
walls in the room shown at the lower left of Figure 10.73.
Because the new storefront is proposed and the interior walls exist, this action will auto-
matically demolish the openings necessary to accommodate the new wall type.
	
4.	 Using the furniture families already loaded in the project, add furniture to the proposed 
space as shown in Figure 10.73.
You’ll add a reception area and other office furniture. Add desks, tables, shelving, and chairs.
	
5.	 Add workstation and chair components to the open office area to the right of the Phase 1 
area, but group the assembly before you start copying through the office space.

Use your own judgment and creativity in laying out the new elements in the space. The aim 
of this exercise is to become familiar with phasing and grouping. Figure 10.74 illustrates the 
space in a perspective view. Note that the demolished walls are not being shown.

Phase 2: Demolition
Now that we have created a new layout for the first phase of our renovations, we will create 
similar views for the second phase. In addition to some selective demolition, we will add a 

410  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
design option set to explore two different ideas for the second phase. Follow these steps to  
get started:
	
1.	 Duplicate the plan view LEVEL 1 − PHASE 1 DEMOLITION, and in the Properties palette 
set the following values:
◆
◆
View Name: LEVEL 1 − PHASE 2 DEMOLITION
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction − Phase 2
◆
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo
	
2.	 Duplicate the 3D view PHASE 1 − DEMOLITION. Activate the duplicated view, and in 
the Properties palette set the following values:
◆
◆
View Name: PHASE 2 − DEMOLITION
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction − Phase 2
◆
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo
	
3.	 Demolish the existing walls shown as dashed lines in Figure 10.75 using the demolition 
tool (the small hammer) from the Modify tab in the ribbon. Note that you’ll have to split 
the long wall between Phase 1 Proposed and Phase 2 Proposed in order to allow only a 
portion of the wall to be demolished.
Figure 10.75
Demolished walls  
for Phase 2
	
4.	 Return to the 3D view named PHASE 2–DEMOLITION and your view should be similar 
to the image shown in Figure 10.76. Don’t be confused by the proposed content from New 
Construction − Phase 1 showing as existing. This is correct because that content is now 
considered existing when seen through the lens of New Construction − Phase 2.

Phase 2: Proposed
In the final steps of our exercise project, we will create two different layouts for the client to review. 
We will generate a design option set and views that will specifically show the alternate option.
	
1.	 Duplicate the plan view LEVEL 1 − PHASE 1 PROPOSED and rename it 
LEVEL 1 − PHASE 2 PROPOSED. Set the Phase to New Construction − Phase 2.
	
2.	 Start working in your new plan view, adding proposed elements for the primary design 
layout as shown in Figure 10.77.

the primary option in 
Phase 2

412  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Don’t worry about getting the design right—just get the idea right.
Just remember, adding elements in the view with the appropriate Phase and Phase Filter set-
tings is the easiest way to avoid confusion. Figure 10.78 shows a perspective of the first proposed 
layout.

Scheduling
Now let’s create a schedule for walls that we will use to provide a volume-based cost for demoli-
tion in each phase of the proposed work.
First, you will need to create a phase filter to show only demolished elements. After you 
create the new phase filter, you can apply it to any floor plan or 3D view to verify what the filter 
will display. The same elements will be displayed in a schedule. To create the phase filter and 
the wall demolition schedules, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Phases. In the Phasing dialog box, switch to the 
Phase Filters tab. Click the New button and name the new filter Demo Only. Set the New 
and Existing column values in the table to Not Displayed, and then click OK to close the 
dialog box.
	
2.	 Switch to the View tab in the ribbon, and from the Create panel choose Schedules ➢ 
Schedules/Quantities. In the New Schedule dialog box, set the following values and then 
click OK:
◆
◆
Category: Walls
◆
◆
Name: Wall Demo Schedule − Phase 1
◆
◆
Phase: New Construction − Phase 1

Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options |  413  
	
3.	 In the Schedule Properties dialog box, make sure you are in the Fields tab. Add the 
parameters Type and Volume to the Scheduled Fields list, as shown in Figure 10.79.
Figure 10.79
Add Type and Volume 
to the list of scheduled 
fields.
	
4.	 Click the Add Parameter button, and in the Parameter Properties dialog box set the 
following values:
◆
◆
Parameter Type: Project Parameter
◆
◆
Name: Demo Cost Per Unit
◆
◆
Type Or Instance: Type
◆
◆
Type Of Parameter: Currency
◆
◆
Group Parameter Under: Construction
	
5.	 Click OK to close the Parameter Properties dialog box, and then click the Calculated 
Value button in the Schedule Properties dialog box. Create a new calculated value with 
the following values. You’ll need to add a calculated value in order to multiply the 
demolished walls’ volume by the cost per unit and get the total. Click the Calculated 
Value button in the Schedule Properties dialog box. We’ve divided the Volume value by  
1 CF to keep the units consistent.
◆
◆
Name: Disposal Cost
◆
◆
Formula or Percentage: Formula
◆
◆
Type: Currency
◆
◆
Formula: Volume / 1 CF × Demo Cost Per Unit

414  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
In this formula, it is important that the spelling of each parameter be exact because it is 
case sensitive. We divided by 1 unit (cubic feet in this example) to eliminate the volu-
metric units in the equation. The result will be a number that is multiplied by the value 
assigned to the Demo Cost Per Unit parameter.
	
6.	 Click OK to close the Calculated Value dialog box, and then switch to the Sorting/
Grouping tab. Establish the settings to sort by Type (with the Header option) and 
then by Volume, as shown in Figure 10.80. Check the box for Grand Totals, and set 
the associated drop-down list to Totals Only. Deselect the Itemize Every Instance 
option.
Figure 10.80
Set the Sorting/
Grouping options 
for the demolition 
schedule.
	
7.	 Switch to the Formatting tab and select Disposal Cost. Check the Calculate Totals box, 
and then click OK to create the schedule.
	
8.	 In the Properties palette, set Phase to New Construction–Phase 1 and Phase Filter to 
Demo Only. After you type a value in any of the Demo Cost Per Unit fields, the schedule 
will look similar to the image in Figure 10.81.
	
9.	 For the Phase 2 demolition schedule, don’t start over. In the Project Browser, duplicate the 
previously created schedule and just change the phase in the Properties palette to New 
Construction − Phase 2.

Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options |  415  
At this point in the exercise, you can drag the floor plan views, 3D views, and schedules from 
the Project Browser onto sheets for publishing, as shown in Figure 10.82. We’ll cover sheets in 
greater detail in Chapter 17, “Documenting Your Design,” but for now you can begin to become 
familiar with the process. Add the plans, 3D views, and schedule for Phase 1 to sheet A101, and 
then add the views for Phase 2 to sheet A102.

Using the Design Option Tool
Everything looks great so far, but our client has asked us to prepare an alternative design for 
the second phase of construction. We’ll accomplish this within the same exercise file using the 
Design Option tool. Let’s get started with the following steps:
	
1.	 From the status bar at the bottom of the application window, click the Design Options 
icon. In the Design Options dialog box, click the New button to create a new option set. 

416  | Chapter 10  Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options   
Click the Rename button and name the new set Phase 2 − Proposed. Click the other New 
button to add two options, as shown in Figure 10.83.
Figure 10.83
Create a new design 
option set with two 
options.
Using a Phase Filter to Start Design Options
Here’s a great tip: To isolate what you need to assign to Option 1, activate the Phase 2 floor plan, 
and then set the Phase Filter property to Show New. This will turn off any existing conditions from 
the previous phases.
	
2.	 Activate the LEVEL 1 − PHASE 2 PROPOSED floor plan and then select all the new 
construction elements. Switch to the Manage tab in the ribbon, and click Add To Set. 
Uncheck Option 2, as shown in Figure 10.84, and click OK. This will add everything 
selected to the primary design option. If you changed the Phase Filter property to help 
select the new construction elements, remember to set it back to Show Previous + New.
Figure 10.84
Add the primary 
design elements to 
only the first design 
option.
	
3.	 In the Project Browser, duplicate LEVEL 1 − PHASE 2 PROPOSED and rename it LEVEL 
1–PHASE 2 PROPOSED − OPTION 2.
This will be your working view for the second design option.

Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options |  417  
	
4.	 Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and switch to the Design Options tab. 
Change the Design Option value for the design option set shown from <Automatic> to 
Option 2. Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
5.	 From the Design Options toolbar, select Option 2 in the drop-down list to make Option 2 
active for editing and create another design iteration, as shown in Figure 10.85. When 
you are finished with the alternate layout, set the Design Options drop-down list to Main 
Model.
Figure 10.85
Create an alternate 
design layout.
	
6.	 In the Project Browser, duplicate the 3D view named PHASE 2 − PROPOSED and name 
the duplicated view PHASE 2 − PROPOSED − OPTION 2. In the Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides dialog box for the view, set Design Option to Option 2.
	
7.	 Activate sheet A102 and then drag and drop the views for Option 2 onto the sheet, as 
shown in Figure 10.86.
Selecting Elements in Design Options
You might notice that you can’t select model elements that have been added to design option sets. 
There is a setting in the status bar at the bottom of the application window called Exclude Options, 
which is checked by default. When you uncheck this setting, you can select elements that are 
assigned to design options.
If you’d like to download the completed file used for this exercise, you can find it in the 
Chapter 10 folder at this book’s web page; the file is called c10-Exercise-Finished.rvt.

The Bottom Line
Use the Phasing tools to create, demolish, and propose a new design.    Time is such an 
important element to the design process and nearly impossible to capture with traditional 
CAD tools. Don’t use phasing for construction sequencing (there’s a better way). Embrace 
phasing for communication, not just illustration.
Master It    How can you use phasing to communicate your design across a series of key 
stages? What kind of project is best suited to phasing?
Understand and utilize groups.    Groups are great for creating collections of both host and 
family component geometry. Just remember to apply best practices, and you’ll avoid a lot of 
common roadblocks. Individual model elements within groups will always appear properly 
in schedules, as you’d expect. And creating exceptions in groups allows you to make subtle 
changes without creating a new group.
Master It    Why shouldn’t you mirror groups?
Create and use design options.    Like groups, design options work great when you fol-
low the rules. Design options are intended for design iteration that is bounded and well-
defined—not for putting multiple buildings in one project file. Remember that links, groups, 
and phasing can exist within design options. Always keep hosted elements with their host 
when using design options.
Master It    Suppose you have a multistory tower. How could you show multiple design 
options for the entire vertical exterior enclosure?

 Chapter  11 
 Visualization   
 Visualization in Autodesk ® Revit ® software—as with any tool (even a pencil)—isn’t an exact science. 
It still requires a patient, aesthetic eye. The most important thing you can do to successfully visualize 
your work starts with one thing: the ability to listen. That’s right—it’s your ears that make you a great 
artist! You need to be able to understand what your client is trying to accomplish because you’re not 
really trying to visualize something—you’re trying to communicate something  for someone else . 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Create real-time and rendered analytic visualizations 
 
◆
 Render emotive photorealistic visualizations 
 
◆
 Understand the importance of sequencing your visualization workfl ow 
 Explaining the Role of Visualization 
 We believe that anyone can use Revit to create compelling, emotive visualizations. What’s really 
great is that your visualizations are based on the same coordinated design information you’re 
using to document your project. But there are a few challenges: 
 
◆
 Creating emotive visualization is usually such a small part of your project’s overall workfl ow 
that it’s hard to spend the time necessary to hone your rendering skills. This is the reason that 
photorealistic renderings, both still and moving images, are often the realm of a specialist 
who deeply understands the techniques and workfl ow needed to create compelling imagery. 
 
◆
 The reality is that visualization is both art and science, but especially art. You’ll never be 
able to just push a button and get a beautiful image. There’s a world of difference between 
something that’s photorealistic and something that’s emotive and compelling. In other 
words, the button says Render, not Make Beautiful. 
 
◆
 Most important, visualization is about communication, something that many people for-
get to take into account. Don’t ever create a rendering until you know what you’re trying to 
accomplish. You must know your audience and understand what needs to be communicated 
(keeping in mind that the person requesting the rendering isn’t always the intended audi-
ence). Otherwise, you’ll spend hours doing something that is beautiful but entirely irrelevant. 
 You’ll likely struggle with two important points about rendering in Revit, and unfortunately 
there’s little that you can do about it, because the two are in tension with each other: 
 
◆
 Although engineers often analyze in order to design, architects often visualize in order to 
design. But if your intent is to put all of this visual iteration into Revit just to render it, you’ll 
probably get frustrated over all the entourage you’re putting into a database that you want 

420  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
to keep light and flexible (particularly during early design). The reality is that Revit is most 
useful during early design to communicate analytic rather than visually representative 
information.
◆
◆
You’ll never be able to render out of Revit more than you put into it. The level of detail 
required to create deeply emotive and detailed visualizations is usually far greater than 
the level of detail necessary to produce accurate construction documentation.
Even though Revit has the ability to help you create great renderings, the level of detail 
required at the beginning of a project (when analytical relationships are still being resolved) is 
too high for schematic design. Even when the project is well resolved and established, the level 
of detail required for a highly finished and photorealistic visualization is far beyond what’s 
required to complete your project documentation. So what is the point of this chapter?
Our focus is to get you somewhere in the middle. You need to understand how Revit works, 
but you also need to understand that although something is technically feasible, it may not be 
practical from a workflow standpoint. Our goal is to help you focus on communication, not just 
visualization for its own sake. So if you’re happy with visualizing your project at its current 
level of development (not too far ahead and not overly detailed), you’re going to have a lot of 
success rendering with Revit software.
Analytic versus Photorealistic Visualization
Throughout this chapter we will refer to basic modes of visualization as analytic as compared to 
the more advanced modes we will refer to as photorealistic. Although photorealistic visualization is 
self-explanatory, analytic visualization is the most common form of communicating with 3D views 
in Revit. You will not achieve the true realism of a photorealistic rendering, but analytic views are 
active views of the model within which you can create or analyze the design. You can even create 
a camera view with analytic graphic settings to use as a cover sheet for your document set—and 
you’ll never need to remember to regenerate a rendering to update the cover image!
Before we begin to address the two types of visualization techniques in greater detail, let’s 
review the basic controls that are available to help you configure views for further visualization.
Understanding View Controls
In this section, we’ll describe the various visual styles that are available in the view control bar 
with regard to analytic visualization. Figure 11.1 shows the view control bar of an orthographic 
view and that of a perspective view.
Figure 11.1
2D and orthographic view 
control bar and perspective 
view control bar
All of the icons in the view control bar refer to view properties that can also be set in the 
Properties palette. The view control bar simply gives you quicker access to the most commonly 

Understanding View Controls |  421  
used settings. The first control at the left of the view control bar is the view scale. Because cam-
era views are not scale specific, it simply lists the status as Perspective.
Setting the Detail Level
After the Scale setting, the next icon in the view control bar sets the detail level in the view 
(Figure 11.2). The Detail Level property can be set to Coarse, Medium, or Fine.
Figure 11.2
Level of detail
When you create a new view, the default value for Detail Level is initially determined by 
the scale of the view, as shown by switching to the Manage tab in the ribbon and clicking 
Additional Settings ➢ Detail Level. Figure 11.3 shows the default settings.
Figure 11.3
View Scale-To-Detail 
Level Correspondence 
window
Even though a default value is specified for a new view, the Detail Level setting can be over-
ridden after the view is created. This fact is important for two reasons. First, changing the scale 
after the view is created will not automatically reset the level of detail. Second, rendering a view 
with a finer detail level will (generally speaking) take more time. Even though the results may 
not be visible to the naked eye, the calculations required to render what you won’t be able to dis-
cern (because the objects are so small) will still be computed.
When you consider this information, you will find it’s very important to render at the appro-
priate level of detail. To understand this, look at the two perspectives in Figure 11.4. Although 
these two views look identical, one will rotate, refresh, and render faster than the other because 
they’re set to different levels of detail.

422  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
This difference may not have a large effect on a small project, yet it can have a significant 
effect on your project when you render (not to mention the additional time it will take when you 
export and print). So be sure that before you render a view, the level of detail is appropriately 
set. If you’re far away from the building or your view is broad, a Coarse detail level is sufficient. 
But if you’re zoomed in on a particular detail or part of the building (or just a single office or 
room), a Fine detail level might be more appropriate.
We discuss the use of detail level in Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family Editor,” where 
you will learn how to apply this property to your own content families.
Working with Graphic Display Options
The Graphic Display Options dialog box allows you to control all of your views’ graphic options 
(Figure 11.6). These are the Model Display (which we’ve just reviewed) and the Shadows, 
Sketchy Lines, Lighting, Photographic Exposure, Background settings, and Depth Cueing (new 
in 2017). This dialog box also allows you to save views as templates to quickly transfer the set-
tings to other views. It’s important to understand how these settings impact the visualization 
in your view. Since we just stepped through the Model Display options, let’s go through the 
options in this dialog box to round out your understanding of how you can modify the view to 
get the desired effect in your renderings and visualizations.
Figure 11.4
Nonidentical views
The view on the left is set to a Coarse level of detail, but the view on the right is set to a Fine 
level of detail. Although this different detail level doesn’t have much of an effect on the content 
in either view, the detail level affects performance.
The Executive Chair family has been modified so that the casters at the base of the chair dis-
play only at a Fine level of detail. The results are shown in Figure 11.5.

424  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Model Display
Model Display is the first group of settings you will find in the Graphic Display Options dialog 
box. In this group, you can define settings for the visual style, transparency of model elements, 
and silhouettes.
Likely one of the most commonly used settings, the visual style of your view can be defined 
from one of six options. The available visual styles are shown in the context of the view control 
bar in Figure 11.7.
Figure 11.7
Visual style settings in 
the view control bar
As we explore each of the visual styles, note that the Show Ambient Shadows setting has 
been enabled. The Wireframe view style (Figure 11.8) maintains only the edges of objects. Faces 
are hidden. Note that in Revit 2017, ambient shadows are not available in Wireframe view.
Figure 11.8
Wireframe view style
The Hidden Line view style keeps both the edges and faces visible (Figure 11.9). This view 
style is used by default in 2D and 3D views.

Understanding View Controls |  425  
Figure 11.9
Hidden Line view style
The Shaded view style shows faces in their shaded value with accentuated edges (Figure 11.10). 
Note the change in color depending on an object’s orientation. This effect is particularly pro-
nounced on curved surfaces. In addition, if you have a material applied to an element and that 
material has a color associated with it, you’ll see those colors and patterns represented. Glazing 
appears clear and the shelving and desks have a wood tone to them. Materials with a model pat-
tern (like the brick at the bottom of the image) will show their patterns as well.
Figure 11.10
Shaded view style
The Consistent Colors view style removes the color variation based on an object’s orientation 
to the viewer. Colors are strict interpolations of the shaded color setting (the RGB value of the 
material assignment) and therefore have a flatter yet more consistent appearance (Figure 11.11). 

426  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Figure 11.11
Consistent Colors view 
style
The curved wall in the center of the image is stone, so it begins showing as a color that is differ-
ent from those of the other wall types.
Figure 11.12
Realistic view style
The Realistic view style provides real-time overlays of geometry with the material that 
will be used during a photorealistic rendering, as shown in Figure 11.12. In both Shaded and 
Realistic view styles, you can turn off Show Edges in the Graphic Display Options dialog box, 
whereas this mode is always on for all other styles.
The Interactive Ray Trace mode is available only in the view control bar; it is not available in 
the Graphic Display Options dialog box. When you select this mode from the view control bar, 

Understanding View Controls |  427  
the application will perform a quick render of the view window based on your current view set-
tings (Figure 11.13). Based on your computer’s processor, it may take a bit of time to render the 
view, but once rendered, the view remains interactive—meaning you can continue to navigate 
within the view. As you do, the rendering will dynamically update. This is a fairly computation-
ally intensive view type; if you’re working in this view, make sure you close other applications 
that might consume RAM or processor resources so the view you use is quick and fluid.
Figure 11.13
Interactive Ray Trace 
mode
One graphic setting in the Model Display options that’s not accessible in the view control bar 
is Transparency. This slider at the top of the Graphic Display Options dialog box allows you to 
make all the elements within the view transparent to an equal degree. In earlier versions of Revit, 
this was the Ghost Surfaces setting, but the percent of opacity/translucency was not modifiable. In 
Figure 11.14, the view has been set to 40 percent transparency with the Consistent Colors view style.

428  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
The Silhouettes option allows you to override the edges of objects in the view using your 
defined line styles (Figure 11.15).
Figure 11.15
Silhouettes style
In Figure 11.16, the image on the left illustrates the view without silhouettes, and the image 
on the right shows the view with Wide Lines enabled.

Shadows
The Shadows toggle is available in the Graphic Display Options dialog box, but there’s also a toggle 
in the view control bar. With this button, there is no flyout—simply select it to toggle shadows on 
and off based on sun settings which we will discuss later in this chapter. The ability to turn shad-
ows on in real time is a terrific feature that helps you add an improved sense of depth to your view 
(Figure 11.17). Note that the Shadows toggle is not available if a Transparency override is applied.
Figure 11.17
Default shadows on

Understanding View Controls |  429  
Keep a couple of things in mind when turning on shadows. First, it takes a bit longer for the 
screen to refresh when shadows are turned on. Depending on the complexity of your view and 
the size of your model, you might want to keep shadows off in your working views as you zoom 
in, zoom out, and rotate.
Second, the default settings could use adjusting depending on how you like to have the view 
rendered. Sometimes it’s more valuable to show the space well lit than to show an exact time of 
day for the sun position. To set the sun to an angle that is not dependent on a location and time, 
choose the Sun Setting button in the Lighting group of options. This button will report the cur-
rent preset (sunlight from top right). Clicking this button will open the Sun Settings dialog box 
(Figure 11.18). Notice that the Lighting radio button is selected and an azimuth and altitude are 
specified as being relative to the view. This will show a sun angle regardless of the building’s 
orientation or location on the globe.
Figure 11.18
The Sun Settings 
dialog box
Back in the Graphic Display Options dialog box, you also have the ability to modify the 
intensity of the sun, ambient light, and shadows with the sliders (Figure 11.19). Changing these 
can dramatically change the amount of shade or shadow that appears in your view.
Figure 11.19
Increased sun intensity 
setting
Another important visualization tool in the Shadows settings is the Show Ambient Shadows 
option. Combined with other graphic options such as edge enhancements and real-time materi-
als, this setting allows you to create emotive, real-time views of your project that do not require 
renderings.

430  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
To activate ambient light and shadows, open the Graphic Display Options dialog box, expand 
the Shadows settings, and then select Show Ambient Shadows.
The results are noticeable, particularly around the intersections of objects. Shaded elements 
are embellished by highlights in the center of objects and deeper shading at the edges. The 
result is almost a watercolor effect that considerably softens the shaded view. The effect can be 
accentuated when combined with the option to enhance the silhouette of edges for even more 
real-time effects. Figure 11.20 demonstrates the differences in effect between shadows with and 
without ambient shadows turned on.
Sketchy Lines
You can apply the Sketchy Lines feature as a graphic display style (Figure 11.21).

Lighting
For most analytic view styles, only sunlight settings are available to cast shadows throughout 
your model. Lighting controls are fully enabled in the Graphic Display Options when Realistic 
mode is selected. We discuss the use of artificial lighting settings for photorealistic visualization 
later in this chapter. If you are using Hidden Line, Shaded, or Consistent Colors, you will have 
access only to the Sun Settings dialog box we discussed earlier.
Sunlight can be customized to reflect the location of your project at a specific date and time 
or a position relative to the view. We will discuss solar and shadow studies later in this section.
Photographic Exposure
Photographic Exposure allows you to control the color range within the view (Figure 11.23). This 
option is available only when your model display is set to Realistic.
Without this setting enabled, the Realistic view types tend to be rather dark. This setting allows 
you to lighten the views and correct the highlights, shadow intensity, color saturation, and white 
point to get the best possible image (Figure 11.24). Photographic Exposure also has an Automatic set-
ting that allows you to let the software pick the best possible combination between those settings.

432  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Background
The final settings in the Graphic Display Options dialog box are the Background options 
(Figure 11.25).
Figure 11.25
Background settings
Figure 11.26
Default background 
settings applied to a 
section view
From the Background drop-down, you can choose Sky, Gradient, or Image. With the Gradient 
or Sky option, you can simulate a ground plane and horizon without rendering. This is a great 
feature if you’re presenting anything live within the model environment because it gives a 
visual plane for the building to sit on. Figure 11.26 shows the effect of the default Gradient set-
tings on the building section. This setting can also be used in elevation and 3D views.
Depth Cueing
Depth Cueing is a new feature added to Graphic Display Options in Revit 2017. Depth Cueing 
provides easy controls that can graphically adjust the 3D effect of an image viewed in section or 
Figure 11.24

elevation by illustrating objects in the front more vividly than objects in the back. In past ver-
sions of Revit, this illustration effect could be achieved only by selecting an object and applying 
a manual graphic override.
Though this option is listed in Graphic Display Options for any view, it can be activated only 
within an elevation or section. With an elevation or section open, from the Depth Cueing menu, 
with Show Depth selected, control sliders can be manipulated to adjust the effect of Depth 
Cueing (Figure 11.27).
The Fade Start/End Location slider represents the overall clipping depth of a section or eleva-
tion. The default value of 0 in the Near setting represents the point in which the section or eleva-
tion cuts the model. The default value of 100 in the Far setting represents the maximum extent 
of the clipping plane for the section (Figure 11.28). Adjusting the values for Near and Far is the 
equivalent of inputting a percentage of the total distance for the clipping plane.
The Fade Limit (%) slider applies the amount of fading from the Near, where objects are 
clearly displayed, which then fades to the specified percentage as it approaches the Far distance. 
The slider ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 denotes objects in the distance that are significantly 
grayed to 100 where the objects in the distance maintain the same graphic characteristics as set 
by the object styles. In Figure 11.29, section (a) represents a section with Depth Cueing off, and 
section (b) represents the same section with Depth Cueing set to Near = 10, Far = 100, and Fade 
Limit (%) = 5. Note the differences between the two sections and how section (b) denotes objects 
in various shades of gray, with the furthest wall illustrated in the lightest shade of gray.

434  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Working with the Section Box
Before we get into the rendering process, let’s discuss the section box. By selecting the Section 
Box option from the Properties palette for the view, you create a rectilinear matrix around 
your project that may be pushed and pulled to isolate a portion of your project within the 
view.
In Figure 11.30, the section box has been pulled to isolate a portion of the project. This tech-
nique is helpful for isolating a smaller portion of a larger project. But a word of warning: Be 
careful toggling the section box off and on. The extents of the section box will reset and you’ll 
have to pull them back into place. Very frustrating! If you want to see the whole project and the 
sectional view, it’s best to use two separate views.
After you activate a section box in a 3D view and you configure the box to intersect some 
model elements, you have another graphic tool to aid in your visualization. If the Detail Level 
option of the view is set to Coarse, model elements that are intersected by the section box will 
display a color and fill override that can be customized as you see fit. From the Properties 
palette for the view, select Edit Type. When you open the type properties, you’ll notice that 
there’s a Coarse Poche Material setting, which determines the color and fill pattern of the 
poché.
The poché can be seen in all display types (Wireframe through Realistic), but it is displayed 
only in a view that is set to the Coarse level of detail. We recommend that you set the default 
color to black.
Figure 11.29
Fade Limit used with 
Near and Far settings
(a)
(b)

Understanding View Controls |  435  
Here’s why you would want the poché color to be black. As shown in Figure 11.31, the regions 
between host elements (like the walls and floors) are shown as discrete geometries. Notice that 
you can see black lines dividing the geometry where walls meet floors and so on.
Figure 11.30

the project

Regions between host 
elements are shown as 
discrete geometries.
You can use the Join Geometry option to clean up the lines between elements. But this 
approach is time-consuming and often leads to other problems in your file when a lot of things 
get “joined” just to create a graphic impression.
One simple way to clean this up graphically is to select a poché color that is the same as the 
color of the lines between elements: black. Again, it’s not the most desirable result, but it’s fast, 
doesn’t require manual joining of geometry, and reads well (Figure 11.32).

436  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Understanding Analytic Visualization
Now that we have covered the basic view control tools, let’s get back to the two types of 
visualization: analytic and photorealistic. To better understand the analytic concept, think 
for a moment about Google Maps and how it uses two types of visualization—there’s an 
option to view both Map and Satellite modes. Think of the Map mode as your analytic view 
and the Satellite mode as your photorealistic view. Both views are important, depending 
on what you’re trying to communicate. If you’re simply trying to understand directional 
information, the Map view is better. But if you’re trying to show someone what something 
looks like with regard to trees and other real-world features, the Satellite view has obvious 
advantages.
It’s also interesting that real-time information is easier to maintain in analytic views. For 
example, Google Maps has the option to show live traffic data. But this doesn’t mean that 
they’re showing actual cars moving on actual streets in photorealistic mode. Rather, they’re 
color-coding the streets based on overall traffic patterns and movement.
The same is going to be true when you’re visualizing your project in Revit. More often 
than not, you’ll have the ability to show analytic information in real time; however, producing 
photorealistic images of your project will require additional time to render.
Even as you get into more of the project development and detail, materials may be a distrac-
tion whereas textures may not. Keeping your materials abstract and analytic allows you to help 
keep your focus on communicating the big ideas of your project. For example, does the spatial 
arrangement elegantly fulfill the design requirements? How is the vertical/horizontal stacking? 
We’ll show you how to communicate these ideas in the following sections.
Project Parameters
Viewing information about your project in a variety of ways is easy, and one way to do this is 
with view filters. In this section, first you’ll create a view filter based on a project parameter, and 
then you’ll create one to illustrate a user-defined project parameter. A filter can be used to alter 
the default display properties of elements on a per-view basis. As you can see from the Filters 
dialog box in Figure 11.33, you can apply up to three filters to a single filter type to override the 
graphic values of 2D and 3D content as well as spaces.
Figure 11.32

Understanding Analytic Visualization |  437  
Figure 11.33
The Filters dialog box
Figure 11.34
The default view— 
unfiltered
Figure 11.34 shows a simple example of how this works. In the view, there are walls that are 
two-hour rated. You’d be able to see this in a schedule, but how would you see it in a project 
view (2D or 3D)? You can easily show that with filters.
Let’s now explore the use of filters with a simple exercise. Download and open the file 
c11-Visualization-Start.rvt from this book’s web page. From the Project Browser, open the 
ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW. To apply a filter to your view and visualize the rated walls, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 First, open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box (type VG on the keyboard or 
select it in the Properties palette) and choose the Filters tab. Click the Add button to begin 
the process of creating and applying a new filter.

438  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
	
2.	 Select the Edit/New button and create a new filter called Rated Walls, as shown in 
Figure 11.35. From the Categories list, check the box for Walls. In the Filter Rules group on 
the right side of the dialog box, select Fire Rating from the Filter By drop-down menu. Set 
the filter to Equals in the next drop-down, and from the third drop-down menu, select 
2. Make sure the filter is selected in the column on the left, and click OK to add it to your 
Visibility/Graphic Overrides settings.
Figure 11.36
Graphic overrides
	
3.	 When you return to the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, you’ll need to add the 
filter to your view. Simply click Add, and select Rated Walls.
	
4.	 The next step is to customize the Rated Walls filter so that items that fall into the filter cat-
egory will have a specific graphic effect. Set the Projection/Surface override for Patterns 
to Red and Solid Fill. To do this, select the Override button in that category to bring up 
the dialog box shown in Figure 11.36. You’ll also want to choose the Override button for 
both Lines and Patterns under the Cut heading and set each of their colors to Red, as you 
just did for line graphics.
Figure 11.35

category, and filter rule

5.	 When you’ve finished, click OK to return to the view of the project. You’ll see that the 
filter is overriding the project-defined graphics of the two-hour rated walls (Figure 11.37).
Figure 11.37

Shaded view

The applied filter in 
Hidden Line view
What’s wonderful about this is that you’re able to visually coordinate and verify your project 
schedules with project views that confirm what is being described in the schedules. This even 
works in Hidden Line view, as shown in Figure 11.38. Changing elements in the schedule or 
from the project environment will immediately update in all views of your project.

440  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Setting User-Defined Parameters
Now let’s look at another example where a particular parameter you might need for a project 
is not part of the default project environment. In this example, you want to show the space as 
functionally complete—all the office furniture in place—but a lot of the content that is shown in 
the image isn’t actually in the scope of work for your contract. To demonstrate this, you want to 
show those furnishings as a separate color. To do this, you’ll make two changes to the image.
First, this kind of parameter will have to be applied across many categories of elements— 
furniture, equipment, appliances, and so on. Second, it may apply to one element but not apply 
to another element in the very same category, name, and type. For example, under the Furniture 
category, the designer can specify the desks and cubicles but not the chairs. To make this pos-
sible, you’ll want to make sure you’re using an instance parameter (not a type parameter).
For this exercise, continue with the file from the previous section or download and open the 
file c11-Visualization-Start.rvt from this book’s web page.
	
1.	 From the Project Browser, right-click the ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW and duplicate the 
view. Rename the duplicate view that is created to PHASE 2 – 2 HOUR RATED WALLS. 
In the view, return to your Filters dialog box by opening the Visibility/Graphic Overrides 
dialog box (VG) and create a new filter named Not In Contract.
	
2.	 Make sure you select numerous categories of elements that you want to be able to dis-
tinguish as Not In Contract. For this example, we chose Electrical Equipment, Electrical 
Fixtures, Furniture, and Furniture Systems, as shown in Figure 11.39. When you finish, 
select <More Parameters…> from the Filter Rules drop-down list.
Figure 11.39
Multicategory 
selection
	
3.	 The Project Parameters dialog box opens. You need to make a new parameter called 
Not In Contract. Select the Add button. This will take you to the Parameter Properties 
dialog box. Type in the name of the new parameter, Not In Contract. From the Type of 
Parameter drop-down menu, choose Yes/No. Finally, check the boxes for the following 
categories: Electrical Equipment, Electrical Fixtures, Furniture, and Furniture Systems, as 
shown in Figure 11.40.
This user-defined project parameter will allow you to distinguish elements across a num-
ber of categories.

User-defined instance 
parameters

Filter parameters
	
5.	 You’ll return to the Filters tab in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, where you’ll 
define how the graphics will be overridden. Once again, add the filter and override the 
surface pattern with a solid yellow color.
	
4.	 Click OK to apply your parameter to the filter.
In this case, you’re instructing Revit to override the graphics when the value of Not In 
Contract equals Yes in the Filter Rules settings (Figure 11.41).

442  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
	
6.	 Back in the 3D view, select some elements from the categories that you’ve just created a 
filter for. You’ll notice that as you select the object in your file, the instance parameter for 
Not In Contract is available in the Properties palette (Figure 11.42).
Figure 11.43

graphic override in 
action
	
7.	 Select the check box.
As you do, the solid color will be applied to the components, as shown in Figure 11.43, 
because the filter that you created now applies to the elements that you’ve selected, even 
in Hidden Line views!
Figure 11.42
Instance parameters

Understanding Analytic Visualization |  443  
Identifying Design Elements
Another use for this process of using filters is identifying “generic” host design elements as you 
move between design iteration and design resolution. Figure 11.44 shows a filter that has been 
applied to a view to highlight any walls, floors, ceilings, or roofs that have the term Generic used 
in their family name.
Figure 11.44
Identifying generic 
elements
Figure 11.45
Generic host element 
filter
Typically in a design project, you might create a series of generic elements to replace the 
ones that have a more detailed label. Using a filter to identify those, you can quickly locate what 
needs more detail from within your project. The default template already uses the term generic to 
describe basic design host elements, which makes them easy to filter, as shown in Figure 11.45.

444  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Setting Solar and Shadow Studies
By using solar and shadow studies, you can use another analytic visual style that allows you to 
communicate natural lighting based on your project’s location, orientation, and time of year. The 
sun’s path can also be displayed (Figure 11.46), and you can edit the path of the sun both directly 
by dragging the sun or sun path within the view and indirectly through time-of-day settings.
Figure 11.47
Sun Settings
The sun path can be activated from the view control bar. You’ll also notice the Sun Settings 
option in the Sun Settings pop-up menu. This setting will allow you to give an exact location, 
time, and date for the sun. Selecting Sun Settings (Figure 11.47) allows you to select the settings 
for your particular view and solar study type. This tool can be used in various view types, 
including plans, elevations, 3D, and perspectives.
Figure 11.46
Visual sun path

Understanding Analytic Visualization |  445  
There are four types of solar studies that you can create in Revit:
◆
◆
The Still setting allows you to create a study of a particular time, date, and location.
◆
◆
Single Day allows you to create a study over an entire day at intervals of 15, 30, 45, and 
60 minutes.
◆
◆
Multi-Day allows you to create a sun study over a range of dates at intervals of an hour, a 
day, a week, and a month.
◆
◆
A Lighting study is not related to a particular time, date, or place. It’s more useful for add-
ing graphic depth and texture with “sunlight” from an analytic top right or top left.
Single images are created using the Rendering dialog box. However, animations of single- 
and multiday solar studies are created by clicking the Application menu and selecting Export ➢ 
Images And Animations ➢ Solar Study.
For either single- or multiday sun studies, you can set your project location through the Sun 
Settings dialog box. In the upper-right corner is the Location button. Selecting this button will 
pull up the Location Weather and Site dialog box (Figure 11.48). Here you can select your project 
location from the map or via the Project Address drop-down menu. Select your city and click 
OK to close the dialog box. This will set the location of your project universally for this model, 
so if you are using the energy modeling tools or sun settings, or exporting the project for use in 
another application like Autodesk® 3ds Max® software, this setting will locate the project on the 
globe for all those uses.
Figure 11.48
Locating the project

446  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Regardless of whether you choose to use Still, Single Day, or Multi-Day, analytic visualiza-
tion is incredibly useful for quickly communicating information about your project in a way 
that isn’t literally associated with the actual real-world material assignments of your project 
elements. Although photorealistic visualization would render wood as “wood,” an analytic 
visualization could be used to identify which wood materials were sustainably harvested, 
recycled, or LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certified. Analytic visual-
ization is concerned with the actual properties of a material, not just what it looks like. Because 
analytic visualizations can often be viewed in real time, your project information remains 
visually concurrent and up to date.
Understanding Photorealistic Visualization
When compared to analytic visualization, photorealistic visualization is the expression of the 
emotive, experiential qualities of your space and content. Materials are carefully selected 
for accuracy and real-world simulation. Put another way, if analytic visualization is about 
what something means, photorealistic visualization is about how something feels or is 
experienced.
In many cases you’ll find yourself tweaking materials and lighting in order to “theatrically” 
increase the visual interest of the space. Embellishing your model with nonproject entourage is 
probably essential, and we’ll cover important techniques to keep that content from cluttering up 
the views that are necessary for construction documentation.
In the following sections, we’ll review the process for creating camera views and walkthroughs, 
and then we’ll look at some of the settings that impact the outcome of the renderings in Revit.
Rendering Sequence and Workflow
You’d be surprised, but many people render in the wrong sequence. The workflow for creat-
ing compelling renderings is not the same one you use to resolve your design process. If 
you try to do one like the other, the result is a lot of wasted time and frustration. Consider a 
­documentation-based design process to create a building that moves from intent to content:
	
1.	 Host components (walls, floors, and roofs)
	
2.	 Hosted components (doors and windows)
	
3.	 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment
	
4.	 Assembly details and documentation
The challenge is that this process does not provide an optimal workflow for creating great 
renderings. If you’re focused on the process of visualization, the ideal workflow is more along the 
lines of the following:
	
1.	 Geometry (host and family components)
	
2.	 Cameras (setting up your views)
	
3.	 Lighting (using matte materials)
	
4.	 Materials

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  447  
Yes, this is as simple as it gets: cameras, and then lights, and then materials. In a documen-
tation-based process, lights don’t usually show up until the building is well resolved because 
you’re placing lights meant to be the actual fixtures to be installed in the building, not just 
for rendering. So the documentation process is simply out of sequence with the visualization 
process.
In addition, you need to evaluate the lighting neutrally, without materials to distract you. As 
you’re placing your content, a lot of elements already have material assignments. You need to 
find a way to neutralize the material settings while you figure out lighting. Now you just need 
to put it all together!
Creating Perspective Views
The tasks of creating and modifying your camera views are almost as important as the model 
content you’re creating. If you’re not careful, you can easily fail to impress the viewer by select-
ing the wrong view and aspect ratio of the camera and controls.
Perspective views communicate far more depth than orthographic views (Figure 11.49). 
Unless the view needs to be at dimensioned scales, we prefer to use perspective views of the 
project for renderings.
Figure 11.49
Orthographic 
view versus 
perspective view
To create a perspective view, switch to the View tab, locate the Create panel, and click 3D 
View ➢ Camera. This command will not work if you are working in a drafting view, a schedule, 
or another camera view. When the Camera command is activated, you will need to pick two 
points. The first point to select is the camera location, and the second point is the target location. 
Keep in mind that when you rotate your view, the rotation is centered on the target elevation. If 
you use the Camera command in a plan view, as shown in Figure 11.50, you have the opportu-
nity to specify the elevation of the camera as an exact distance from the associated level in the 
Options bar.
After creating a camera view, you should understand that there is a boundary box that 
defines the extents of the view defined by the camera and target locations. If you need to adjust 
these two locations (other than navigating within the camera view), you can activate the controls 
by going to another view, like a plan, and then locate the camera view in the Project Browser. 
Right-click the camera view and choose Show Camera from the context menu, as shown in 
Figure 11.51.

448  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Once you see the camera, you can select and move it around your project. Doing so allows 
you to move your camera closer or farther away. You can also select the clipping planes of your 
camera and edit the front and back planes of your camera’s view.
The aspect ratio of your camera view is also important. For example, a television ratio of 4:3 
seems far less expansive and dramatic than a 16:9 wide-screen ratio. Figure 11.52 illustrates this; 
image (a) is 4:3 and image (b) is 16:9. The result is that image (a) seems too tight and constrained, 
whereas image (b) is far more natural.

The Crop Region Size 
dialog box
To change the aspect ratio, select the crop region in the camera view and then click the Size 
Crop command in the contextual tab of the ribbon. In the resulting dialog box, you can change 
the aspect proportionally or non-proportionally (Figure 11.53). Keep in mind that this setting 
doesn’t zoom your camera forward and backward; it simply changes the relative height and 
width of the aperture.
You can also modify the camera position and angle on the fly using the SteeringWheels® 
(similar to other Autodesk products). Simply activate the Navigation Wheel (Figure 11.54) 
located on the right side of the view window or press Shift+W on the keyboard. You’ll be able 
to zoom, pan, and orbit as well as control other view features using the Navigation Wheel. 
This tool can take some getting used to because it will “follow” your mouse pointer across 
the screen—it’s not anchored at the bottom corner as the image might suggest. This is helpful 

450  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Locking Your View
After you create your view, you might want to consider locking it so it can’t be accidentally 
adjusted. Although you can’t tag elements in a perspective view, it is a good practice to lock 
camera views to preserve consistency between rendering iterations. The view-locking tools can 
be accessed from the view control bar, as shown in Figure 11.55.
Collaborating on Your Designs
One of the great features of Revit software is the almost immediate visualizations you can perform 
within a model for quick yet meaningful collaboration. In many firms, the lead designers tend 
to work and think with pen and paper. Traditionally, they find it difficult to design in modeling 
software. Using the visualization tools, it’s easy for modelers and non-modelers to speak the same 
language. Being able to identify some key camera points within the model will allow you to create 
quick hidden line or shadowed perspectives that a designer can then trace over and collaborate with 
the team to drive changes in the model. Save those perspectives and they can be printed again and 
again as the design changes, allowing the designer to see the progress.
Figure 11.55
Lock view settings

The Navigation Wheel
because it will give you a dynamic menu to change and modify your view, but don’t forget to 
turn it off before you start modifying geometry. Selecting the same button again will hide the 
tool until you need it again.
Three options are available from the Lock 3D View option. Save Orientation And Lock View 
keeps the current orientation and prohibits anyone from rotating the view. As its name implies, 
the Unlock View command unlocks the view and allows you to navigate freely. After you have 
unlocked a previously locked view and changed the view, click Restore Orientation And Lock 

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  451  
View to return the view to its previously saved orientation. If you unlock a locked view and 
then choose Save Orientation And Lock View, the previously saved orientation is lost while the 
new orientation is saved and locked.
Creating a Walkthrough
In addition to still perspective views, you have the ability to create animation paths called 
­walkthroughs. Creating a walkthrough is much like creating a series of connected camera 
views. Like any other 3D view, a walkthrough can be generated using any of the visual styles 
and ­settings we described previously in this chapter. In the following exercise, use the c11-­

1.	 From your Level 1 plan view, start placing a series of cameras by setting the camera loca-
tion and then the camera direction.
Note that each time you pick a location, these cameras will become the key frames in 
your animation. When you have placed the last camera, press the Esc key and your 
­finished path will appear (Figure 11.56).

path

2.	 Right-clicking the path and choosing Edit Walkthrough will allow you to manipulate 
each of the series of views that you just created. Right-click the nodes on the path and 
choose Go To View.
If your walkthrough path is not displayed, look in the Project Browser for the 
Walkthroughs category and locate the walkthrough view you just created. Right-click it 
and select Show Camera from the context menu.
	
3.	 Double-click the walkthrough view in the Project Browser to open the view as you would 
any of the other views.
Figure 11.57 shows the first view in the path that we’ve just created along with the 
Walkthrough view properties from the Properties palette.
The view you might see when you activate a walkthrough is the last frame in the camera 
path. You’ll need to use the Show Camera method to select the walkthrough and then 
click Edit Walkthrough to access the frame controls. You can then use the control icons in 
the ribbon or set the Frame value to 1 in the Options bar to get to the first camera point in 
your walkthrough.

view with associated 
properties
	
4.	 Let’s modify the aspect ratio to 16:9. Select the view boundary and select Size Crop from 
the contextual tab in the ribbon. By default, the view is 6″ × 4 -1/2″ (150 mm × 113 mm). 
Select the Field Of View radio button and then set the Width value to 8” (200 mm).
	
5.	 We’re going to export a Hidden Line view for testing (especially before rendering), but we 
want to give the walkthrough more depth. So, in the Graphic Display Options dialog box 
we reviewed earlier in this chapter, under Model Display change the Silhouettes option 
to Wide Lines.
It’s not usually desirable to simply walk with the camera facing the same direction that 
you’re walking. So you’re going to modify the camera directions to make the visualiza-
tion more dynamic. This will require that you open a couple of views and tile the view 
windows, as shown in Figure 11.58. This way, you’ll be able to see the results of your 
work in one view while working in another.

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  453  
	
6.	 Activate the plan view of Level 1, and then click the Close Hidden Windows button from 
the Quick Access toolbar. Activate the walkthrough, and then tile those views by press-
ing WT on the keyboard. Press ZA to activate the Zoom All To Fit command.
A couple of important points should be noted. First, you’re showing the plan and the 
camera view at the same time. This allows you to see both the graphic and the analytic 
camera, which is important for modifying views. As you can see, when you select the 
boundary of the view on the right, the camera path highlights in the view on the left. 
Since the view is selected, you have the option of editing the crop size just as with any 
other camera. But you also have the option of editing the walkthrough.
	
7.	 Click the Edit Walkthrough option, and you’ll see the contextual toolbar, shown in 
Figure 11.59.
Figure 11.58
Tiled camera and  
plan views
Figure 11.59
Edit Walkthrough 
contextual toolbar
When you open the Walkthrough Editor, the camera path now shows important controls 
(Figure 11.60).
The red dots along the path represent key frame locations (when you placed your cam-
era), and the red dot directly in front of the camera allows you to control the rotational 
direction. By default, all the cameras face ahead relative to their location on the path. 
But you can edit the default so that the camera can follow one direction but face another 
direction.

454  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Because the default path is 300 frames in length, it would take a long time to go to each frame 
and edit what you see. It’s better to jump ahead from key frame to key frame, editing fewer loca-
tions. When you do this, Revit will interpolate the frames between the key frames for you. As 
you advance through each key frame, try to experiment rotating the camera to the left and right 
as well as glancing up and down. You can do so by dragging the target point in the plan view 
or using the Navigation Wheel in the camera view. Use the Look command from the Navigation 
Wheel for best results.
Exporting a Walkthrough
After you edit the key frames in the walkthrough, you can export the animation by clicking  
the Application button and choosing Export ➢ Images And Animations ➢ Walkthrough. 
The options to export an AVI are the same as all of the options for rendering still images  
(Figure 11.61).
A 15 frames-per-second (fps) frame rate is minimal to keep the animation smooth. But if you 
increased the frame rate, the animation length would shorten and it would seem like you were 
running (rather than walking) through the scene. What can you do to have a longer animation 
without adding speed? Simply add more frames to your animation.
Figure 11.60
Camera path and 
controls

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  455  
Figure 11.61
Graphic format 
controls
Figure 11.62
Default frame count
From the Properties palette, open the Walkthrough Frames dialog box (Figure 11.62). By 
increasing the Total Frames value, you can also adjust the relative frames per second (fps) to 
maintain the desired speed.
So, for example, if you wanted to increase the fps to 30 but maintain the same travel speed, 
you would also increase the Total Frames setting to 600.
Finally, where a lot of people struggle is with the speed of their animation. Unless you’re 
breaking up your animation into separate paths (which will be combined later into a single 
sequence), it’s necessary to be able to speed up or slow down your camera’s movement. In Revit, 
you can uncheck the Uniform Speed option to speed up or slow down the camera during a 
single animation study.

456  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
The same visual effect plays a part in your renderings. The farther you are from something, 
the faster your camera can move as you fly by and still seem smooth and fluid. But you will 
need to slow down considerably if you’re walking through the building, where a comfortable 
pace is 6 to 8 feet (2 to 2.5 meters) per second.
We’ve exported the animation from this portion of the chapter. It’s important to understand 
that when Revit exports video, it exports in an uncompressed format. The file sizes will be large 
compared to what you might be used to. Any of the videos can be brought into other video-edit-
ing tools (iMovie, HandBrake, Movie Maker, and so on) to compress the raw footage. If you want 
to investigate the file or animation, you can download the c11-Visualization-Finished.rvt 
file or the c11_Visualization_Animation.avi file from the Chapter 11 folder on this book’s 
web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.
Rendering Settings
Now that we have covered the processes to create still camera views and walkthroughs, let’s 
discuss some of the settings that are important to understand before you begin to generate pho-
torealistic renderings. You can access the Rendering dialog box by clicking the teapot icon on 
the View tab in the ribbon or in the view control bar of a 3D view.
Some of these settings are also available from the Rendering Settings dialog box, which is 
accessed from the Properties palette when you are working with a 3D view. Figure 11.63 shows 
the Rendering dialog box to the left and the Rendering Settings dialog box to the right.
Figure 11.63
Rendering dialog box

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  457  
If you are a veteran to Revit, you will notice that there is a subtle difference with the new 
Rendering dialog. When Revit 2016 was released, it allowed a user to select a render engine 
called NVIDIA mental ray® or a new render engine called Autodesk Raytracer®, which had very 
similar rendering characteristics to the interactive Ray Trace view setting that can be selected 
in the view control bar. With the release of Revit 2017, NVIDIA mental ray has been removed; 
instead, Raytracer is the main rendering engine and has undergone incremental improvement 
from what was released in Revit 2016.
So, what is Raytracer? Raytracer is an iterative rendering engine that renders in a series of 
passes, with each pass adding to the accuracy of how materials and lighting are represented 
in the rendered scene. Unlike traditional rendering engines, if you were to stop Raytracer mid-
render, the fidelity of the rendered image would be consistent and complete. It would not have 
missing rendered areas or areas that are partially rendered. This capability brings enormous 
flexibility in a rendering workflow. With Raytracer, you no longer have to worry if the avail-
able time for rendering is sufficient to complete a rendered image. As long as you initiate the 
rendering process, even if you have only 30 minutes, the end result will be a complete render-
ing, consistent in its quality. Granted, the previous example represents the direst of circum-
stances, but in the high-speed architecture industry, this capability is the difference between 
having something to show at a design meeting and being left empty-handed after working 
really late hours.
Using Output Settings
An important setting in this dialog box is Resolution. It’s easy to spend far too much time creating a 
rendered view because rendering times increase exponentially when the resolution doubles. Think 
of it this way: If you’re rendering a view at 150 dots per inch (dpi) and then you render the same 
view at 300 dpi, the image is now four times larger, not twice as large (1 × 1 = 1 and 2 × 2 = 4). If you 
were to render the view at 600 dpi, it would be 16 times larger (4 × 4 = 16), and you could reasonably 
expect the 150 dpi image that rendered in a few minutes to take considerably longer at 600 dpi.
How large you need to render something depends on what you’re going to use it for: screen 
or print. Don’t expect a rendering the size of a 3” × 5” (75 mm × 150 mm) postcard to work for a 
3′ × 5’ (900 mm × 1500 mm) banner.
The Output Settings options help you determine the level of resolution at which your image can 
be saved when rendered. The screen resolution is simply the resolution of the view on your monitor.
You should be much more interested in the Printer settings because of the likelihood that 
you’ll need to print your views. Again, the resolution is important, because you’re printing for 
something that will be viewed at some distance (arm’s length or a few feet away) with the naked 
eye. Rendering beyond what can reasonably be seen is time that can be spent on further refining 
your design. While the default printer resolutions are shown in Figure 11.64, you can input other 
values by typing them in the dialog box.
Figure 11.64
Printer settings

458  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Using Quality
Revit’s new Raytracer render engine maintains the look of previous quality setting options but 
provides only four presets: Draft, Medium, High, and Best. The Low setting has been removed 
because with the speed of Raytracer and how it calculates renderings, there was no differ-
ence in the quality of the output between a rendering set to Draft and a rendering set to Low. 
Figure 11.65 illustrates the new render range for settings between Draft and Best.
Figure 11.65
(a) Draft setting; 
(b) Best setting
(a)
(b)
There is a drastic difference in the currently available options and what had been present through-
out many versions of Revit. Gone are the slider controls that controlled reflection, transparency, and 
indirect illumination; instead, the Render Quality settings provide five radio buttons grouped under 
two major categories:
◆
◆
Light and Material Accuracy: This grouping allows you to select one of two rendering 
accuracy settings.
◆
◆
Simplified – approximate materials and shadows: Speeds up the rendering passes at 
the cost of accuracy to materials and shadows in areas such as indirect illumination, 
soft shadows, reflection, and refraction.
◆
◆
Advanced – precise materials and shadows: Increases the accuracy of materials and 
shadow and with each rendering pass tightens the accuracy of real-world effects such 
as indirect illumination, soft shadows, reflection, and refraction. Using this setting 
increases the render time for each pass.
◆
◆
Render Duration: This grouping allows you to select one of three duration settings. 
Remember that with an iterative renderer, it is no longer a matter of whether you have 
enough time to complete the rendering; it becomes a question of what quality of rendering 
you can achieve with the available amount of time.
◆
◆
Render by Level: Selecting this option allows you to specify the number of render 
passes. The minimum setting is 1, and the maximum setting is 40.

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  459  
◆
◆
Render by Time: Selecting this option allows you to specify the number of minutes to 
be dedicated to the rendering process.
◆
◆
Until Satisfactory: Selecting this option will instruct the rendering process to con-
tinuously render pass after pass until it is instructed to stop rendering.
These settings will control the quality of the output, but remember, with Raytracer, time 
is now a correlation to the quality of the rendering achieved (you will always get a complete 
rendering) instead of a risky proposition of whether the available amount of time allows you to 
complete a rendering at the desired output (which may or may not be finished). Raytracer’s itera-
tive rendering capability and the ability to specify render duration takes away the stress of try-
ing to produce a rendering. We still recommend you perform a quick draft render to get a feel 
for your scene setup before committing to a rendering of longer duration.
Using Output Settings and Quality
We’ve discussed both Output Settings and Quality, but for a successful rendering, both must 
work together. As you start experimenting with your rendering exercises, pay attention to Output 
Settings and Quality. If you commit to a rendering with a high output resolution such as 600 dpi 
but have your Quality set to Draft, you will unnecessarily increase the render time for each itera-
tive pass. The end result is a high-resolution image of a low-quality render. The reverse is also true. 
If you set a low output resolution such as 75 dpi but have your Quality set to Best, you will once 
again increase the render time for each iterative pass. The end result is a low-resolution pixelated 
image trying to convey characteristics of a high-quality render. In both cases the results are subpar.
So, what is the right balance? Well, it’s probably better to render the output resolution a bit 
larger than the format in which it will be presented, which will give you some flexibility if you 
need to increase the size of your image later. Of course, you would want the best quality possible, 
but you should always consider the audience that is viewing your rendering. If it is an internal 
design meeting, the Medium setting is probably good enough. If it is a final presentation or a ren-
dering that will be published, you might want to use Best (which defaults to 20 passes) or even set 
it to Until Satisfactory and let it render overnight. There are many potential combinations, but now 
with Raytracer, you have been provided with a rendering process that is forgiving. So experiment!
Some Tips for the Resolution You Should Use
Estimating your image resolution is easy. If the image is going to be viewed on a screen, 150 dpi is 
likely sufficient and even gives you some flexibility if the image has to be slightly larger. If you need 
to print the image, 300 dpi will work the majority of the time. Now take the longest dimension of 
your image (height or width) and multiply the dimension by the needed resolution. That’s all you 
need to figure out your image pixel size. If you don’t know the size of the final image, guess big: 
Perform your necessary draft renderings and make the final 2000–4000 pixels. That will work for 
any large-scale presentation or high-res monitors.
Using Monochromatic Views to Examine Context and Lighting
Now that we have our geometry in a sample model and we have shown you how to create 
and manipulate camera views, we will move on to lighting before discussing materials. That 

460  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
said, it is difficult to review your design geometry with realistic lighting in Revit without also 
rendering component materials. If you want to examine spatial context and lighting quality in a 
monochromatic model, we’ll show you how to accomplish that technique in Revit.
Take a look at the rendering shown in Figure 11.66, which has been created by rendering a 
camera view with all the default materials active.
Figure 11.67
Abstract rendering
The challenge is that to get the materials correct, you’ll have to commit a significant amount 
of time to selecting, testing, editing, and refining many material selections for an otherwise 
simple view that’s quite early in the design stage. You don’t have time for resolving your design 
to this level of specificity early in the iterative process.
Figure 11.67 shows the same view rendered abstractly, with all the model objects set to a 
matte white material.

3.	 On the Manage tab in the ribbon, click the Phases button to open the Phasing dialog box. Select 
the Phase Filters tab. Click the New button to create a new row in the list of filters. Rename the 
new filter to Abstract. Change the New and Existing column values to Overridden, and then 
change the Demolished and Temporary column values to Not Displayed.
	
4.	 Switch to the Graphic Overrides tab, and then create a new material. You’ll do this by 
clicking inside any of the Material boxes and then clicking the Selector button on the 
right. (For this exercise use the Material box for Existing.) This will open the Material 
Browser. In this new dialog box, select the Create New Material icon at the lower-left 
corner. Switch to the Identity tab, change the Name to Abstract, and then click Apply 
(Figure 11.69).
Certiﬁcation
Objective
By selecting a matte material for everything in the view, you’re able to focus on form-space 
and light-shadow relationships. Using phase filters, you can create a rendering like this quickly 
and easily. This technique is much faster than trying to select neutral materials for each element 
type in your view. To begin the series of exercises in this chapter, download and open the file 
c11-Visualization-Start.rvt from this book’s web page. Here are the steps to create a matte 
rendering using the material overrides in Phasing:
	
1.	 From the Project Browser, activate the 3D view named OVERHEAD CAMERA. Press VG 
on the keyboard to activate the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. In the Model 
Categories tab, uncheck the Ceilings category and then click OK.
	
2.	 In the Properties palette, you should see the properties for this 3D view. Click the Edit button 
for Graphic Display Options to bring up the dialog box shown in Figure 11.68. Set Style to 
Shaded, and under Shadows check Show Ambient Shadows. Click OK to close the dialog box.

5.	 This will give you a generic material with some predefined settings. We’re going to cus-
tomize this slightly to make it the universal material we want. Switch to the Appearance 
tab and click the Open/Closes Asset Browser icon.
This will open the Asset Browser, which will allow you to select the attributes of a mate-
rial to match to your new material type. In the Asset Browser, type Porcelain in the 
search bar at the top. In the Asset Browser folder tree, click on Ceramic/Porcelain under 
the Appearance Library folder and double-click on Neutral Gray to replace the asset in 
the material definition (Figure 11.70).
This material will give the rendering a nice overall gray finish without too much reflec-
tivity. Click OK to close the Material Browser.

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  463  
	
6.	 Now assign this material to your Existing and New phase objects by selecting this same 
material for those phases (Figure 11.71). Click OK to exit the Phasing dialog box.
Figure 11.71
Assigning the Abstract 
material
	
7.	 This step is important. Because the material you created is associated as an override for 
the Abstract phase that was created in step 4, for the new material to take effect when you 
render, change the view properties’ Phase Filter setting to Abstract.
	
8.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, click the Render tool. In the Rendering dialog box, use 
the following settings:
◆
◆
Quality: Medium
◆
◆
Output Settings: Screen
◆
◆
Lighting: Exterior: Sun Only
◆
◆
Background Style: Color, with color set to White
	
9.	 Click the Render button and observe the results in the view window. To toggle back and 
forth between the rendered view and the shaded display, click Show The Model at the 
bottom of the Rendering dialog box.
That’s it! When you want to render a project view with this abstract material assignment, 
simply assign the Abstract material to the graphic overrides in the Phasing dialog box and apply 
the Abstract phase filter to the properties of the camera view.
Phasing Affects the Entire Project
In the previous exercise, you created a unique phase material override to generate a specific style 
of visualization. Be aware that phasing settings will affect the entire project; therefore, if you 
are working on a project with others, your team should be made aware of these changes so other 
documentation isn’t adversely affected.
Adjusting Lighting and Interior Renderings
Let’s take a closer look at an interior camera view and how to adjust natural and artificial 
­lighting. You will continue with the c11-Visualization-Start.rvt file from the book’s web 
page. From the Project Browser, activate the 3D view named RENDER - CONFERENCE ROOM. 
As you can see in Figure 11.72, we’ve already adjusted the shadows and sunlight as well as 
applied silhouette edge overrides to the live view.

464  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Now let’s render the view. Keep in mind that the rendered material applied to the Abstract 
phase override is solid white (which we set up earlier in this chapter), so you’ll want to turn off 
the visibility of your curtain panels if you want to see through the glazing. Open the Rendering 
dialog box by clicking the teapot icon in the view control bar and choose the following settings:
◆
◆
Quality: Medium
◆
◆
Output Settings: Printer, set to 300 dpi
◆
◆
Lighting: Exterior: Sun Only
◆
◆
Background Style: Color, with color set to White
The reason we’re using Printer as the Output Setting is that 300 dpi is sufficient for printing 
this page. And an 8” (200 mm) wide image will suffice for the anticipated width of this book.
Figure 11.73 shows the results of the rendering. The scene can be viewed beyond the imme-
diate space of the conference room. Take particular note of the shadows and how the lighting 
drops off from the edge of a shadow. If the rendering appears too dark or too bright, click the 
Adjust Exposure button to change the Exposure Value setting.

camera view in Hidden 
Line mode
Figure 11.73
Sun Only rendering
Of course, this image is being rendered with the sun, which doesn’t count for interior render-
ings; it’s just a benchmark. But you can begin to see the level of detail and materiality and the 

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  465  
“look and feel” of the space. Now that you know what it looks like, you can turn off the sun and 
start placing some artificial lights.
Because you’re rendering abstractly using a phase override, everything is going to be solid 
white. But if your light source is behind a solid lens, it’s not going to render very well. The best 
way we’ve found to handle this is to create a unique object subcategory for the lens that sur-
rounds the light source. Doing so allows you to control the visibility of the lens of the lighting 
fixture, thus preventing obstruction of the light source. Unfortunately, this approach will not 
give the most realistic effect because many lighting effects result from light passing through 
translucent objects (like lenses or shades). But it’s the best you’ll be able to do for now to resolve 
lighting before you resolve materials.
Before you can add lighting, you need to add a ceiling to the spaces. To keep things generic, 
we’ve added the default compound ceiling to all the spaces. It’s just a placeholder for your ceil-
ing that will change later. But the important thing is that you don’t get hung up centering ceiling 
tiles during your design process. Rooms will change dimensions, and all that time spent center-
ing will go to waste.
Placing Artificial Lighting
Activate the Level 1 ceiling plan and locate the room we have identified with a revision cloud. 
This is the room in which you will begin placing light fixtures to continue the exercise.
	
1.	 On the Architecture tab in the ribbon, click the Component tool, and from the Type 
Selector, choose the Downlight - Recessed Can family that has been preloaded from the 
default Revit library. You can use the 6” Incandescent - 120V type.
	
2.	 Place fixtures in the ceiling plan along the lower and right walls as shown in Figure 11.74. 
The exact dimensions aren’t important—just get the idea right.
Figure 11.74
Placing light fixtures 
in the ceiling
This light family doesn’t have a lens, so you don’t have to worry about the light source being 
obscured. Before you start to render these artificial lights, we need to explain the process and 
technique of using light groups.

466  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
Manipulating Light Groups
There are times when you’ll want to isolate the lights that are being calculated and rendered in 
a particular view. You might want to test the lighting that will result from having certain lights 
on and others off, just as in a real space. Revit software allows you to create light groups for 
this purpose. Doing so saves you a lot of time compared to turning individual lights off and on 
manually.
By default, whenever you place lights in your project, they’re not placed in any group. They’re 
“unassigned,” just like the lights shown in Figure 11.75. You access this dialog box by clicking 
the Show Rendering Dialog tool on the view control bar and then clicking the Artificial Lights 
button in the Rendering dialog box. Here you can assign and create all kinds of light groups.
Figure 11.75
Light groups
Besides the assignment for the light group, you also have the option of adjusting the 
Dimming value. One reason you might use this feature would be to dim some of the lighting 
and leave other lighting at full value to highlight a feature in the rendering. Let’s create two 
light groups for the conference room in this exercise. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Level 1 ceiling plan, select any one of the lights you placed during the previ-
ous exercise. From the Light Group drop-down in the Options bar, choose Edit/New. 
In the Artificial Lights dialog box, click the New button to create two groups named 
Conference - Right and Conference - Left (Figure 11.76).
	
2.	 Now assign the lights to the groups. Just select the lights in either the ceiling plan or any 
3D orthographic view, and then assign them to the light group from the Light Group 
drop-down menu in the Options bar, as shown in Figure 11.77. Place the lights in each 
group as indicated in the Level 1 ceiling plan.

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  467  
	
3.	 Return to the camera view named RENDER - CONFERENCE ROOM. Before you 
start to render the view, let’s test the light groups by rendering only the lights in the 
Conference - Right group. To do this, from the Properties palette, open the Rendering 
Settings dialog box, and then click the Artificial Lights button. Turn off the lights 
in the left group by simply clicking the check box for that group in the Artificial 
Lights dialog box. Figure 11.78 shows the results after you render with the following 
settings:
◆
◆
Quality: Draft
◆
◆
Output Settings: Printer, set to 96 dpi
◆
◆
Lighting: Exterior: Artificial only
◆
◆
Background Style: Color, with color set to White

4.	 Let’s complete the rendering of the space with the other light group turned on. Keep in 
mind that the more lights you have turned on in your view, the longer the calculations 
will take and, therefore, the longer it will take to render your view. Figure 11.79 shows the 
results of this second rendering.
Figure 11.78

groups

groups
	
5.	 By default, the image will have a sepia tone. You can remove the sepia tone by adjusting 
the White Point value in the Exposure Control dialog box. In the Rendering Settings or 
Rendering dialog box, click the Adjust Exposure button.
Keep in mind that what you’re looking for is how the lighting affects the space. Are the 
lights too close or too far apart? We’ve added lights to brighten the room by adding the 
same lighting to the remaining two sides of the ceiling.
	
6.	 After you render the space with all the lights, what becomes apparent is that the lights 
aren’t illuminating the conference table (Figure 11.80). You need to add a nice linear 

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  469  
lighting source above the table in order to understand the effect that light will have on 
the space. Again, it’s important that you do this without the distraction of materials.
Figure 11.80
Rendering without 
center lights
	
7.	 Return to the Level 1 ceiling plan. We’d like to see the conference table as a reference for 
placing a new light fixture in the context of a floor plan. In the Properties palette, set the 
Underlay value to Level 1, and then set the Underlay Orientation to Plan.
	
8.	 Start the Component tool again and from the Type Selector, choose the family named 
Pendant Light - Linear - 1 Lamp and use the type named 96” - 120V. Place one fixture 
over the conference table, as shown in Figure 11.81. You may need to rotate the fixture for 
proper alignment.
The pendant light fixture family has a lens, but it is not assigned to a subcategory that 
can be turned off when necessary. In the next series of exercise steps, you’ll assign the 
lens to a new subcategory in order to test a rendering with the lens turned off. First, open 
the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, and expand the Lighting Fixtures category. 
You will notice that the only subcategories are Hidden Lines and Light Source. This will 
change in a moment when you add Lens to the list.

9.	 Select the linear light you placed over the conference table and click Edit Family in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon to open the family in the Family Editor. Activate the 3D view 
named View 1.
	
10.	 In the 3D view, orbit the model so that you can see the bottom of the light fixture. Select 
the main cylindrical extrusion and from the view control bar, click the sunglasses 
icon and choose Hide Element. You will then see a rectangular extrusion that runs the 
length of the fixture. Select that extrusion and in the Properties palette you’ll see that 
the Subcategory value is None, but the material is set to Glass - White, High Luminance. 
Actually, it is assigned to a type parameter named Diffuser Material; however, this 
doesn’t help because we are overriding the material of all model objects using the abstract 
phasing filter we discussed previously in this chapter.
	
11.	 From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Object Styles. In the Object Styles dialog box, 
click the New button and create a new subcategory named Lens. Make sure that it is a 
subcategory of Lighting Fixtures. Click OK twice to close both dialog boxes.
	
12.	 Select the rectangular extrusion again, and from the Properties palette set the 
Subcategory value to Lens, as shown in Figure 11.82.

13.	 From the ribbon, click Load Into Project to reload the light family into your project. At 
this point, if you were to render the view, you’d notice that light is still obscured by the 
lens, as shown in Figure 11.83.
Eventually, the lens will use its assigned translucent material that will allow the light to 
shine through, but for rendering matte images, you don’t want the light blocked.
	
14.	 Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box for the RENDER - CONFERENCE 
ROOM camera view. Expand the Lighting Fixtures category and uncheck the Lens 
subcategory.
	
15.	 When you render the view again, the results will look like Figure 11.84. The lens for the 
linear light isn’t showing, but this is fine. You’re after the lighting effect of the lighting 
fixture. The lens will come back on when you render with all the materials showing.

If you want your rendering to seem more complete than just a rendering of the building ele-
ments, you’ll have to add entourage. But you don’t want to clutter all your views with the kinds 
of things that you want to add that will not be part of your document set.
Working with Entourage
Worksets are great for controlling this part of your project. By creating a workset called Entourage, 
you’ll be able to place your project content on a workset where all of its visibility can be quickly and 
easily controlled. But before creating and assigning elements to a workset, make sure the workset 
is turned off by default in other views.
This means that entourage will not show up in existing or new views until you turn it on; otherwise, 
you’ll have to turn this workset off in all present and future views. This will save you a lot of time 
as you add entourage to your project.
Assigning Materials
Now that you have determined the right lighting effects using matte materials, you can set the 
phase filter of the interior camera view back to Show Complete. You’ll also want to turn on the 

472  | CHAPTER 11  Visualization 
visibility for the curtain panels as well as the Lens subcategory of Lighting Fixtures. Keep in 
mind that with all the new materials, transparency, and reflectivity, it will take quite a bit longer 
to re-render the view (Figure 11.85).
Figure 11.85
Rendering with 
materials
Once you render the view and you can start to see the transparency and reflectivity in the 
curtain panels, the rendering takes on a much more realistic effect. You can also see the materi-
als in the table and chairs as well as the lens for the linear light above the conference table.
At the moment, all of the materials that are assigned to the walls in this view are based on 
the properties of the wall. And creating surface materials for every different wall would result 
in a very long list of wall types! A better method of assigning materials on a case-by-case basis 
is to use the Paint tool. Just be aware that your modeled walls might continue beyond the con-
fines of the space in which you are designing, and painting a material on a surface may affect 
other spaces.
To assign materials to host elements, select the Paint tool on the Modify tab in the ribbon. 
Select a material from the Material Browser, and then click on a surface in the model. If you 
need to remove a painted-on material, use the Remove Paint tool from the same flyout button 
you used for the Paint tool.
Rendering in the Cloud
In addition to rendering on your own computer, Autodesk offers the ability to render “in the 
cloud.” This term simply means that you will be sending data from your computer to remote 
computers operated by Autodesk for increased processing power and more flexibility. As we 

Understanding Photorealistic Visualization |  473  
mentioned previously in this chapter, the rendering process can be time-consuming—­especially 
when you can’t do any other work while renderings are being produced. The cloud option 
becomes quite compelling when you consider the benefit of gained productivity.
As of this writing, you can create a user account for free at 360.autodesk.com. With a free 
account, you will receive some amount of complimentary cloud credits; however, some cloud-
rendering processes are free. For example, you can process a still rendering at standard resolu-
tion without using any credits. This allows you to send many draft renderings until you are 
happy with the results and then use your credits to produce the final rendering.
After you create a user account, you will need to connect to the Autodesk® 360 service in the 
Info Center at the top of the application window, as shown in Figure 11.86.
Figure 11.86
Sign in to the Autodesk 
360 service.
Once you are connected, you can use the Render In Cloud command from the View tab in the 
ribbon. In the Render In Cloud dialog box, you can select multiple 3D views for rendering, the 
output type (still image, interactive panorama, or illuminance), image size, exposure (advanced 
or native), and file format. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can also choose to be notified via 
e-mail when the cloud rendering is complete. Once you click the Start Rendering button, a small 
amount of data will be uploaded, and then you can get back to work while the cloud works on 
your renderings!
After you have been notified that your renderings have completed, you can access and share 
the renderings from your Autodesk 360 web space (Figure 11.87). Each image has contextual 
commands that include the ability to download the file and adjust the exposure levels.

The Bottom Line
Create real-time and rendered analytic visualizations.    Analytic visualization is the 
concept of communicating information about your project in a nonliteral way, and it’s very 
important! It’s not about showing real materials in the project but about using filters to visu-
alize important metadata.
Master It    During the renovation of a space, you want to reuse the doors rather than 
throw them away. How would you illustrate this?
Render emotive photorealistic visualizations.    Photorealistic visualization is about com-
municating design ideas but in emotive ways that are much closer to how the space will be 
experienced, including real lighting, materials, and entourage. Just remember that the time it 
takes to calculate and render your views will change dramatically based on the quality and 
resolution of your views.
Master It    Would the rendering for a PowerPoint presentation differ from a rendering 
being printed for a marketing brochure?
Understand the importance of sequencing your visualization workflow.    The sequence 
of design—building, content, materials, and cameras—is not the same as the sequence for 
visualization (geometry/cameras, lighting, materials). Lighting is far more important than 
materials of actual objects. Get the lighting right and the materials will look great, but not the 
other way around.
Master It    How do you create a rendering environment that replaces the actual materials 
with matte materials in order to study the effects of lighting on your design?

 In Part 3 we covered a variety of topics that are primarily useful in—although not exclusive to—
the earlier design phases of a project. As you continue to develop your designs, there will be an 
increased specifi city to the elements required in the building information model. You will need 
to expand your knowledge of the fundamental components of a building model, including walls, 
fl oors, roofs, stairs, and railings. In addition, you will likely be required to understand and create 
your own families. This part will dig deep into the rich, component-building skills necessary for 
mastering Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software.

 Chapter  12 
 Creating Walls and Curtain Walls 
 According to the American Institute of Architects (AIA) document  G202-2013 Project BIM 
Protocol Form , there are fi ve levels of model development, ranging from 100 to 500. If you 
examine excerpts from the model content requirements describing each level of development 
(LOD) for the design professions—LOD 100, LOD 200, and LOD 300—the evolution of modeling 
granularity becomes apparent. Although LOD 100 represents a conceptual level of information 
defi ned as “overall building massing,” LOD 200 and LOD 300 are represented by “generalized 
systems or assemblies” and “specifi c assemblies,” respectively. This chapter will help you create 
walls that comply with both LOD 200 and LOD 300. 
 Four different kinds of walls can be created: basic walls, stacked walls, curtain walls, and 
in-place walls. In this chapter, you’ll explore the skills needed to create and customize walls 
to meet your design requirements. You will also dive into the new and exciting realm of com-
plex curtain wall and panel generation made possible with the conceptual massing tools in 
Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

◆

◆
 Create simple curtain walls 
 
◆
 Create complex curtain walls 
 Using extended Modeling techniques for Basic Walls 
 As you might already know, walls in the Revit environment are made from layers of materials 
that act as generic placeholders for design layouts to complete assemblies representative of actual 
construction. These layers are assigned functions that allow them to react to similar layers in 
other walls as well as in fl oors and roofs. The function assignments within object assemblies give 
you a predictable graphic representation when you join these types of overlapping elements. 
 After you become familiar with the basic modeling functions for walls, you’ll probably need to create 
your own wall types to achieve more complex designs. As you add more information into the source 
of your building model, you will be able to extract more useful results through intelligent tagging and 
schedules. In the following sections, we’ll show you how to get the most out of your basic wall types. 
 Creating Basic Wall types 
 Walls and curtain walls are  system families , which means they exist in a project or template but 
cannot be saved as individual families outside of the project fi le (as RFA fi les). Other system 
Certiﬁcation

478  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
families include floors, ceilings, roofs, stairs, railings, and mullions. There are only three ways 
to create or add new system families to your project:
◆
◆
Duplicate a type from one that already exists and modify its properties.
◆
◆
Copy and paste them in as objects from one project to another or group them from one 
project to another.
◆
◆
Use the Transfer Project Standards tool.
In Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards,” we discussed different strategies for 
managing standard content through the use of templates. If you have a series of standard wall 
types you use on every project, you have the option of either storing them in your main project 
template using the subtractive method or storing them in separate container project folders in 
an additive method. If you need to make new, custom types that are not part of your template, 
you can create new wall types on the fly at any stage of a project by duplicating existing types, 
adding or removing wall layers, and adjusting the parameters to meet your requirements. 
Regardless of which method you employ to manage templates and standard system families, we 
will show you how to create and customize your own wall types in the following sections.
Within a project file, you can access and edit a wall type in one of two ways:
◆
◆
In the Project Browser, scroll down to the Families category, locate any wall type, right-
click it, and select Type Properties, or simply double-click the wall type name.
◆
◆
Select a wall in the model or start the Wall command, open the Properties palette, and click 
Edit Type.
The Type Properties dialog box will appear (Figure 12.1). If you don’t see the graphic preview 
to the left, click the Preview button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Figure 12.1
The Type Properties 
dialog box for a wall

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  479  
Using Function and Graphics Type Properties
You can assign basic parameters to the type properties of a wall such as Type Mark, Assembly 
Code, Type Comments, Fire Rating, Cost, and so on. In addition to these parameters, there are 
two other type properties that are important to understand: Function and Coarse Scale Fill 
Pattern. The Function type property of walls is a simple list of values, but it can be used in very 
powerful ways. A wall’s function can be used to filter schedules or views—for example, if you 
wanted to hide interior walls for a series of drawings showing only core and shell (exterior) ele-
ments. The Function property also affects the default placement behavior when you create new 
walls. The behaviors associated with each function are as follows:
◆
◆
Interior—Default height for new walls is set to the level above the active level.
◆
◆
Exterior—Default height is Unconnected: 20′-0″ (8 m).
◆
◆
Foundation—Default height is determined as Depth, specified down from the active level.
◆
◆
Retaining—Default height is Unconnected: 6′-0″ (2 m).
◆
◆
Soffit—Default height is Unconnected: 1′-0″ (250 mm).
◆
◆
Core-shaft—Default height is Unconnected: 20′-0″ (8 m).
You can also use the Function type property when you export to CAD formats. You can 
export walls of different functions to specific layers assigned in the Modify DWG/DXF 
Export Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 12.2. Refer to Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working 
Multiplatform,” for more information on exporting.
Figure 12.2
Wall functions can be 
assigned to different 
layers for exported 
CAD files.
The Coarse Scale Fill Pattern type property (along with Coarse Scale Fill Color) defines a fill 
pattern to be applied to the wall type when a view’s Detail Level is set to Coarse. These settings 
are an important tool to help you communicate your designs more effectively. For example, you 

480  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
might want to set all the fire-rated wall types to display with a red solid fill for coarse views. 
Using these type properties for walls is a slightly different approach than you might use for 
design plans in which you want all wall types to display with a black solid fill. For the design 
plan approach, you can override the fill pattern for the Walls category in the Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides dialog box for a view or a view template.
When the Detail Level property of a view is set to Medium or Fine, the individual layers of 
a wall type’s structure are visible—including any fill patterns that are assigned to the materials 
in the wall structure (you’ll learn more about wall structure in the next section of this chapter). 
When Detail Level is set to Coarse, the wall type is displayed only with the pattern defined in 
the Coarse Scale Fill Pattern parameter—if one is defined. This property is best explored with 
the generic masonry wall types in the default project templates.
Create a new project with any Autodesk default project template, and then place a wall seg-
ment using the type Generic - 8″ Masonry (Generic - 225 mm Masonry) in a plan view that is 
set to Coarse. You will see that a fill pattern is displayed. What you are seeing is the fill pattern 
that is assigned to the Coarse Scale Fill Pattern type property of the wall—not the pattern that 
is assigned to the material within the wall structure. Select the generic wall segment you just 
created, and in the Properties palette click Edit Type. Change the Coarse Scale Fill Pattern to No 
Pattern, and then click OK to close all open dialog boxes. No fill pattern will appear for this wall 
type in a coarse view. From the view control bar, set the Detail Level to Medium, and you will 
then see the fill pattern as it is defined in the material within the wall structure.
Editing Wall Structures
We will first discuss editing a wall type’s structure. To access these settings, click the Edit but-
ton in the Structure parameter field. This will open the Edit Assembly dialog box, shown in 
Figure 12.3. From here you can add or delete wall layers, define their materials, move layers in 
and out of the core boundaries, and assign functions to each layer. You can also add sweeps and 
reveals or modify the vertical constraints of the layers.

Objective
Figure 12.3
The Edit Assembly 
dialog box lets you

layers of a wall type.

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  481  
This dialog box is divided into four zones: the Preview window, the Layers table, the Default 
Wrapping option, and the Modify Vertical Structure options (which are active only when the 
preview is set to section display). The area above the Layers zone holds basic reporting about the 
wall type: its family name, sample height in the Preview window, and thickness and thermal 
properties.
Preview Window    On the left side of the dialog box, you will see a graphic preview of the 
wall structure in plan or section. If you didn’t activate it in the Type Properties dialog box, 
click the Preview button at the bottom of the dialog box. To switch from the default plan 
view to the section view or vice versa, click the drop-down list next to View to choose an 
alternate viewing option. In the preview, the core boundaries of the wall are shown with 
green lines. Note that in the section preview, each wall layer is highlighted in blue when 
you select a row in the Layers table. Also note that you can change the height of the wall 
shown in the section preview by modifying the Sample Height value in the upper-right 
part of the dialog box. You can use any mouse-based navigation method to adjust the pre-
view as well as activate the SteeringWheels® feature by clicking the button at the bottom 
left of the dialog box.
Layers Table    The Layers Table is where you add, delete, move, and define layers of the 
wall structure. The makeup of the wall is organized in a table, and the Exterior and Interior 
orientation of the wall is identified at the top and bottom. Each wall layer is represented as 
a separate row of information. Two of the rows are gray, representing the core boundaries 
of the wall, which will be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter in the section 
“Creating a Wall Core.” The table is divided into five columns (Function, Material, Thickness, 
Wraps, and Structural Material):
Function    This column provides six choices for wall layer functions that relate to the 
purpose of the material in the assembly. Each of these functions defines a priority that 
determines how it joins with other walls, floors, and roofs. Note that the numeric priority 
is more important to understand than the name of the function itself.
◆
◆
Structure [1] defines the structural components of the wall that should support 
the rest of the wall layers. This function gives the highest priority to a wall layer 
and allows it to join with other structural layers by cutting through lower-priority 
layers.
◆
◆
Substrate [2] defines continuous board materials such as plywood or particle board.
◆
◆
Thermal/Air [3] defines the wall’s thermal insulation layer and/or an air gap.
◆
◆
The Membrane Layer is a zero-thickness material that usually represents vapor 
prevention.
◆
◆
Finish 1 [4] specifies a finish layer to use if you have only one layer of finish.
◆
◆
Finish 2 [5] specifies a secondary, weaker finish layer.
With the exception of the Membrane Layer, which has no priority assigned, all the other 
layers have a priority value from 1 to 5. These priorities determine how to clean up the 
intersections between various layers when two or more walls are joined. The principle is 
simply explained: Priority 1 is the highest and 5 is the lowest. A layer that has a priority of 
1 will cut through any other layer with a lower priority (2, 3, 4, or 5). A layer with priority 2 
will cut through layers with priority 3, 4, or 5, and so on. In Figure 12.4, layers with the same 

482  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
priority clean up when the two intersecting walls are joined. Notice the way the finish layers 
don’t join on the right side of the vertical wall, because one has a priority 4 and the other is 
priority 5.
Figure 12.4
Layers with the same 
priority clean up when 
joined.
Figure 12.5
Two layers with the 
same priority but 
different materials. The 
separation between the 
two layers is indicated 
with a thin line.
Material    Associating a material to a wall layer provides graphic (color, cut/surface 
patterns, and render appearance), identifiable (mark, keynote, description, and so on),  
and physical characteristics (for analysis purposes) of each wall layer. Using material 
takeoffs, you can calculate quantities of individual materials used in wall assemblies 
throughout your project. Keynoting and material tagging functionality are also 
supported through wall layers and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 18, 
“Annotating Your Design.”
A material definition also affects clean up between layers of joined walls. If the priority 
of the layers is the same and the material is the same, the software cleans up the join 
between these two layers. If the priority of the layers is the same, but the materials are 
different, the two layers are separated graphically with a thin line. In Figure 12.5 the 
structure layer of one of the joined walls was simply changed from Metal - Stud Layer to 
Metal - Stud Layer 2.
Thickness    This value represents the actual thickness of the material. Note that the 
membrane layer is the only layer that can have a thickness of zero.
Wraps    Wall layers rarely end with exposed edges at wall ends or wall openings, win-
dows, or doors. This option allows a layer to wrap around other layers when an opening 
or wall end is encountered. Figure 12.6 illustrates the layer wrapping of the outer wall 
layer based on the closure plane defined in the window family. Layer wrapping will be 
covered in greater detail later in this chapter.

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  483  
Structural Material    This value represents whether the material within the wall assem-
bly is load bearing or structurally significant in any way. In the example shown earlier 
in Figure 12.3, you can see that the Structure [1] functional material, Concrete Masonry 
Units, was given a check mark by default.
Default Wrapping    Although you can specify whether each wall layer will wrap in the 
Layers table, you must also specify whether these options are activated at all in the wall type. 
To use this option, you must decide whether the wrapping should occur at openings, wall 
ends, or both. For inserts, you can choose Do Not Wrap, Exterior, Interior, or Both. Similarly, 
for wall ends the options are None, Exterior, and Interior. The default wrapping parameters 
appear in both the Edit Assembly dialog box and the wall’s Type Properties dialog box. Refer 
to the “Creating Layer Wrapping” section in this chapter for more detailed information about 
wrapping.
Modify Vertical Structure    These settings are available only when you enable the 
section view in the Preview window. In this area of the Edit Assembly dialog box, you 
can add articulation to the wall type using any combination of cornices, reveals, trims, 
and panels. We will discuss these in the section “Adding Wall Articulation” later in this 
chapter.
In summary, editing a wall type’s structure begins with adding or deleting wall layers. Each 
layer is assigned a priority, material, thickness, and wrapping option. To move layers up and 
down in the table or to add and remove layers, use the buttons at the bottom of the Layers table. 
Next, we will cover some more complex aspects of wall structure in greater detail: wall cores and 
layer wrapping.
Creating a Wall Core
One of the unique functions of a basic wall is its ability to identify a core. The wall core 
is more than a layer of material; in fact, it can comprise several material layers. It defines 
the structural part of the wall and influences the behavior of the wall and how it interacts 
with other elements in the model. The core boundaries are references to which you can 
dimension or constrain sketch lines when you use the Pick Walls selection option for floors, 
ceilings, or roofs.
The example shown in Figure 12.7 illustrates a sample floor in Sketch mode where the outer 
core boundary of the wall was selected using the Pick Walls method. The core boundaries of the 
wall are shown as dashed lines for clarity.
Figure 12.6
Layer wrapping is a 
result of a coordinated 
approach between wall 
layers and hosted fami-
lies such as windows.

484  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
When floors generated with the Pick Walls method intersect the walls that were picked 
during Sketch mode, you will receive a prompt to automatically join the geometry and cut the 
overlapping volume out of the wall.
If you click Yes to this message and examine the intersection of the wall and floor in a sec-
tion view, you will see the result of the joined elements (Figure 12.8). Note that you can get 
the joining prompt to appear again simply by selecting the floor, clicking the Edit Boundary 
button in the ribbon, and then clicking Finish Edit Mode (green check mark icon). If any por-
tion of the selected floor and related walls still overlap, but are not joined, the prompt will be 
displayed.
Figure 12.7
A wall’s outer core 
boundary is used to 
define an edge of the 
floor.

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  485  
Creating Layer Wrapping
To create a layer-wrapping solution for openings that reflect real-world conditions, you must 
define two settings. First, select the layer(s) of the wall structure you want to wrap and check 
the boxes in the Wraps column of the Edit Assembly dialog box. You must then specify the 
default wrapping behavior for the wall type. These default settings can be set in either the Type 
Properties dialog box or Edit Assembly, as shown in Figure 12.9.

options can be set in 
Type Properties or Edit 
Assembly.

486  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Specifying the layer wrap settings in the wall type alone may not be sufficient to generate 
the graphic results you desire. Another set of rules established in hosted families allows you to 
further customize how layers in a wall will wrap to inserted objects. The following exercise will 
illustrate this functionality.
Begin by opening the file c12-Wall-Wrapping.rvt or c12-Wall-Wrapping-Metric.rvt 
from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. Activate the Level 1 floor 
plan, and you should see a wall with an inserted window.
Next, follow these steps to create the wall wrap:
	
1.	 Select the wall, open the Properties palette, and click Edit Type.
Notice that Wrapping At Inserts is set to Do Not Wrap, and Wrapping At Ends is set to None.
	
2.	 Click OK to close the Type Parameters dialog box.
	
3.	 Select the inserted window and click Edit Family on the Modify | Windows tab in the 
ribbon.
	
4.	 When the Window family opens, go to the Project Browser and activate the floor plan 
named Floor Line.
You will notice that this window family has been slightly modified from the original 
Fixed window family in the Revit default library. Two reference planes have been added 
that allow the depth of the window frame and the wall wrapping to be customized.
	
5.	 Select the reference plane that is parallel to the window and just below the window panel. 
Its name should be displayed at the right end of the plane as Closure. In the Properties 
palette find the parameter named Wall Closure and make sure the option is checked, as 
shown in Figure 12.10.
Figure 12.10
Assign the Wall 
Closure parameter to a 
reference plane.

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  487  
	
6.	 Create a dimension between the exterior face of the sample wall and the Wall Closure 
reference plane.
You may need to use the Tab key to ensure that you have selected the wall reference and 
not the centerline of the wall or any other extraneous reference plane.
	
7.	 Press the Esc key or click the Modify button to exit the dimension command, and select 
the dimension you just created.
	
8.	 On the Options bar, find the Label drop-down list and choose <Add Parameter…>.
	
9.	 In the Parameter Properties dialog box, type Exterior Wall Closure in the Name field and 
click OK to close the dialog box.
	
10.	 Click Load Into Project from the Family Editor panel in the ribbon. You may be prompted 
to select a project or family if you have more than the two sample files open. When 
prompted with the Family Already Exists dialog box, select Overwrite The Existing 
Version.
	
11.	 In the Level 1 floor plan of the example project, select the wall and click Edit Type from 
the Properties palette. From the Structure parameter, click Edit.
	
12.	 In the Edit Assembly dialog box, find row 1, which will have a function of Finish 1 [4], 
and the material Masonry - Brick. Make sure the Wraps option is checked.
	
13.	 Set the Wrapping At Inserts option to Exterior, and click OK to close both dialog boxes.
You should now see the masonry layer wrapping into the opening in the wall created by 
the inserted window. You can now customize the depth at which the brick will wrap.
	
14.	 Select the window and click Edit Type from the Properties palette. Find the Exterior Wall 
Closure parameter and change the value to 0′-6 5/8″ (170 mm).
	
15.	 Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box. Notice how the depth of the wrapped 
masonry layer changes in the plan view.
Adding Wall Articulation
If you need to develop more complex and articulated finishes expressed horizontally along the 
vertical surfaces of certain walls, you can customize wall types in a variety of ways to achieve 
just about any aesthetic effect. Reveals and sweeps can be added to a wall type, and you can edit 
the vertical extents of material layers. You can find a good example of this kind of wall in the 
default project template. The wall type Exterior - Brick and CMU on MTL. Stud (Figure 12.11) 
contains a variety of sweeps, reveals, and vertical modifications of material layers.

To access these settings, select any wall in your project and click Edit Type in the Properties 
palette. You can also find the wall type in the Project Browser; double-click it to open the Type 
Properties dialog box. Once it is open, make sure the preview pane is open and the view in 
the preview is set to Section. Within the Type Parameters options, click the Edit button in the 
Structure field to open the Edit Assembly dialog box, and begin modifying the layers and verti-
cal articulation of the wall type, as shown in Figure 12.12.

In the following sections, we’ll examine how to create these types of articulation in your 
wall type. To begin the exercises, download and open the file c12-Wall-Articulation.rvt 
or c12-Wall-Articulation-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page. There are two samples of 
the Exterior - Brick on Mtl. Stud wall type. You will create a new wall type based on this wall 
throughout the following exercises.
Assigning Two Different Materials on the Finish Face of a Wall
We will begin our series of exercises by creating a new wall type based on an existing layered 
wall structure. Activate the Level 1 floor plan, select the two wall segments in the exercise file, 
and then click Edit Type in the Properties palette. In the Type Properties dialog box, click the 
Duplicate button and create a new wall type named Mastering - Wall Exercise. Click OK to 
accept the settings, click OK to close the Type Properties.
Now let’s assume that you need to create a partial region of the finish face where the material 
is different but is of the same thickness. For example, you might want to use a split-face concrete 
block at the base of the wall instead of brick:
	
1.	 Activate the default 3D view and select one segment of wall in the view. From the 
Properties palette, click Edit Type, and in the Type Properties dialog box, click the Edit 
button in the Structure field to open the Edit Assembly dialog box.
Make sure the Preview pane is open and the view is set to Section.
	
2.	 In the upper right of the Edit Assembly dialog box, change the Sample Height value to 
6′-0″ (2000 mm).
Use either the Steering Wheels button at the lower left of the dialog box (also located in 
the upper-right corner of the Preview pane) or your mouse wheel to zoom into the shorter 
segment of wall in the Preview pane.
	
3.	 Click the Split Region button under Modify Vertical Structure, and move your mouse 
pointer along the inside face of the brick layer to a point 4′-0″ (1,200 mm) above the bot-
tom of the sample, as shown in Figure 12.13.
When you split the layer, the thickness value of the layer indicates it is variable.
	
4.	 Select row 2 in the Layers list, and then click the Insert button to add another row imme-
diately below the first exterior layer. Change its function to Finish 1 and its material to 
Concrete Masonry Units. To open the Material Browser, select the material assignment 
under the Material column. Using the Graphics tab, set the cut pattern to Masonry – 
Concrete Block. Then click OK to close the Material Browser dialog box.
	
5.	 Click the Assign Layers button, select the new row you created in the previous step, and 
then click inside the lower portion of the split region in the section preview.
When the layer is properly assigned to the split region, you will see the fill pattern 
change to diagonal crosshatch.
	
6.	 Click OK to close all open dialog boxes and save your project for additional exercises in 
this chapter.
After you assign a material row to a split layer, you’ll notice that the thickness values of the 
two layers are linked but you can’t change them in the table. To change the thickness of a split 
wall layer, click the Modify button and select one of the faces in the section preview. Edit the 
temporary dimensions in the section preview to change the thickness of the layer.

490  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
You may also notice that once a layer is split and an additional layer is assigned to the split 
portion, the resulting portions can only be the same thickness. In the previous exercise, you split 
a brick masonry layer to create a region of concrete masonry units (CMU). Although this may 
achieve the desired graphic result in an elevation view, does it accurately represent the construc-
tion of the wall if the CMU is intended to be thicker than the brick masonry? To create a similar 
result with a vertical layer of varying thickness, you will need to create a stacked wall. We will 
discuss this later in the section “Creating Stacked Walls.”
If you encounter a situation where you need to merge horizontal or vertical layers that 
already exist in a wall type, use the Merge Regions button and select a line in the section pre-
view between two layers. Once the mouse pointer is over a line between two layers, an arrow 
indicating which layer will override the other appears, as shown in Figure 12.14.

Adding Sweeps and Reveals
Many walls have horizontal articulations that are either attached to or embedded in the wall 
assembly. Cornices, soldier courses, and reveals are examples of elements that can be incorpo-
rated into wall types. To begin adding these, we will continue our previous exercise of creating 
a new wall type named Mastering - Wall Exercise. In the following exercise, you will add a bull-
nose sweep to the wall:
	
1.	 Return to the wall’s type properties and open the Edit Assembly dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the Sweeps button to open the Wall Sweeps dialog box. Click the Load Profile but-
ton and open the file c12-Profile-Bullnose.rfa or c12-Profile-Bullnose-Metric
.rfa, which can be downloaded from this book’s companion web page.
	
3.	 Click the Add button to insert a sweep row. Change the values in the row as follows:
◆
◆
Profile: c12-Profile-Bullnose: Type 1
◆
◆
Material: Concrete, Precast
◆
◆
Distance: 4′-0″ (1,200 mm)
◆
◆
From: Base
◆
◆
Side: Exterior
◆
◆
Cuts Wall: Checked
◆
◆
Cuttable: Checked
	
4.	 Click Apply and you should see the sweep appear just above the split region, as shown in 
Figure 12.15.
Figure 12.15

492  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Notice that the loaded profile was created for predictable results when placed in a wall 
assembly. For your own wall, you may need to adjust the offset, flip, and setback values to 
achieve the desired results. Next, you’ll add a different profile to the same assembly.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the Wall Sweeps dialog box. In the Edit Assembly dialog box, change 
the Sample Height value to 12’-0″ (3650 mm) so that the next sweep addition won’t 
conflict with the one you just added. Adjust the section view as required to see the 
whole wall.
	
6.	 Click Sweeps to reopen the Wall Sweeps dialog box. Click Load Profile again and navi-
gate to the default library. From the Profiles folder select the Walls folder, and select either 
Cornice-Precast.rfa or M_Cornice-Precast.rfa.
If you cannot locate these files in your default library, you can download them from this 
book’s web page.
	
7.	 Click Add to create another new row and change the values in the row as follows:
◆
◆
Profile: Cornice-Precast or M_Cornice-Precast (Metric)
◆
◆
Material: Concrete, Precast
◆
◆
Distance: 0′-0″
◆
◆
From: Top
◆
◆
Side: Exterior
◆
◆
Offset: –0′-3 5/8″ (–90 mm)
◆
◆
Cuts Wall: Unchecked
	
8.	 Notice that the order of the rows is automatically adjusted, based on the vertical relation-
ship of the sweeps added to the wall. Click OK to close the Wall Sweeps dialog box.
A negative value for Offset was specified to bring the cornice sweep into the exterior fin-
ish layer. Vertical adjustments can be made by assigning positive or negative values in the 
Distance column.
	
9.	 Click OK to close all open dialog boxes, and save the project file for additional exercises 
in this chapter.
The process to create reveals is almost identical to that used to create sweeps. Simply click 
the Reveals button to open the Reveals dialog box. Experiment with adding your own reveals to 
the wall type you’re creating throughout this chapter’s exercises. We’ve added two reveals to the 
wall assembly (Figure 12.16) using the default Reveal-Brick Course profile family.
In the default 3D view, switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, and in the Clipboard panel, 
choose the Match Type Properties tool. Click the Mastering - Wall Exercise wall segment. The 
mouse pointer will change to a filled paintbrush, indicating that an existing type is ready 
to be applied to another object. Select the other wall segment to apply the Mastering - Wall 
Exercise type. When the types of the two wall segments in the exercise file are matched, 
you’ll see how nicely the sweeps wrap around corners in a 3D or camera view, as shown in 
Figure 12.17.

Modifying Wall Sweep Returns
In the previous exercises, you learned how to include sweeps and reveals in the assembly of a wall 
type; however, you can also apply a sweep to a wall if it’s needed only in a limited location. For exam-
ple, you might need to create a chair rail molding in one special room. To accomplish this, go to the 
Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Wall and then Wall Sweep. You can place a sweep on a wall 
vertically or horizontally by changing the placement option in the ribbon while the Wall Sweep tool is 
active. Select a wall sweep type from the Properties palette, and pick the wall faces to which you’d like 
to apply the sweep. If necessary, the sweep can be adjusted vertically in an elevation or section view.

added to the compound 
wall assembly.

494  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
We created a sample chair rail sweep on the interior face of the walls in the c12-Wall-
Articulation.rvt exercise file. In the default 3D view, orbit the model to view the interior 
faces. Let’s take a look at how to customize the returns of a wall sweep:
	
1.	 Select the sweep and it will display grips at each end. Zoom the view closer to the end of 
the sweep that is aligned with the end of the wall segment.
	
2.	 Click the Modify Returns button in the contextual tab of the ribbon.
There are some additional settings in the Options bar.
You can change the angle of the return or return it to a straight cut, but for now leave the 
options as Return and Angle = 90°.
	
3.	 You’ll notice that the mouse pointer changes to a knife symbol. Click the end of the 
sweep and then press Esc or use the Modify tool to exit the command.
	
4.	 Select the sweep again, and drag the grip at the endpoint you just modified to adjust the 
length of the sweep return around the corner of the wall.
Figure 12.18 shows how the return can be wrapped around the edge of a wall.
Moving Wall Sweeps between Projects
Although profile families from RFA files can be used in wall sweep type properties, a wall sweep is 
a system family that exists only in a Revit project. New sweep types can be created only by using 
the Transfer Project Standards tool or by duplicating existing types within your active project. 
And keep in mind that once wall sweeps are added to your project, they can be scheduled like any 
other project component.

Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls
In the previous sections, we explored methods to create a variation within the structure of a 
basic wall type. When you begin to use these types to assemble your building model, you have 
still more methods at your disposal to further customize how walls are applied. Let’s take a look 
at techniques you can use for modeling basic walls once they are placed in a project. You can use 
some of these techniques for stacked walls and curtain walls as well.
Extending Wall Layers
In many types of construction, you’ll need layers of materials to extend within or beyond the 
constraints of the wall. Some common examples include the extension of sheathing and siding 
on an exterior wall or gypsum wallboard extending only slightly above the ceiling for interior 
partitions (Figure 12.19).
Figure 12.19
Examples of wall layers 
extending past or 
within the constraints 
of the wall
Enabling the extension of layers within a wall assembly requires you to unlock specific edges 
in the section preview of the Edit Assembly dialog box. Once layers have been unlocked, an 
instance parameter of the wall becomes active: either Base Extension Distance or Top Extension 
Distance (depending on which edges you unlocked). You can enter this value directly in the 
Properties palette or adjust it graphically in a section view by dragging the small blue tri-
angle control at the edge of the unlocked layer. Let’s go through an exercise to explore this 
functionality:
	
1.	 From the Architecture tab of the ribbon, click the Wall tool, and from the Type Selector, 
choose either the Generic - 5″ or Generic - 200 mm type. Click Edit Type to open the Type 
Properties dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the Duplicate button, and name the new type Exterior Siding.

496  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
3.	 Click Edit in the Structure field to open the Edit Assembly dialog box.
	
4.	 Add a new layer to the exterior of the wall, set its function to Finish 1 (4), use the material 
Siding, Clapboard, and assign a thickness of 3/4″ (18 mm).
	
5.	 Open the Preview pane and switch to section view. Zoom into the bottom of the wall.
	
6.	 Select the Modify button and click the bottom edge of the exterior siding layer. Click the 
padlock icon to unlock the layer (Figure 12.20).
Figure 12.20
Using the Modify 
button, click the padlock 
icon to unlock layers.
You can unlock as many layers as you like; however, the unlocked layers all need to be 
adjacent. For example, you cannot unlock wallboard layers on both sides of a framing 
layer.
	
7.	 The siding layer is now unlocked. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes. With the Wall 
tool still active, create a segment of wall in the project using the Exterior Siding type. 
Press Esc or click the Modify button, and then select the segment of wall you just created. 
In the Properties palette, you’ll see that the Base Extension Distance parameter is now 
enabled. Change the value to –10″ (–250 mm) for this parameter and observe the wall in 
the default 3D view.
You’ll see that the siding layer is now extending 10″ (250 mm) below the base of the wall, 
as shown in Figure 12.21.
	
8.	 Create a section view that intersects this wall segment, and then set the Detail Level in 
the section view to Medium or Fine. Select the wall, and you will see grips at the base of 
the wall indicating the layers that can be modified (Figure 12.22).
You can drag the controls to the required offset or use the Align tool to set the unlocked edge 
to another reference object. If you use the Tab key to select just the edge, you can use the Move 
tool to set a precise distance as well.
There are also controls for layers that are locked. Editing the wall with a control of a locked 
layer changes the Base Offset or Top Offset value and will automatically adjust any Base 
Extension or Top Extension distances you previously established.

Editing Wall Joins
In another common design and construction scenario, you may need to specifically control how 
two or more walls behave when they intersect. There are a number of ways to customize these 
occurrences. Let’s examine two scenarios where wall joins may need to be edited: phasing con-
ditions and acute angled corners.
When you create a model for a renovation of an existing building, you will likely create ele-
ments that are existing, demolished, and new. In the example shown in Figure 12.23, a new wall 
and a wall to be demolished are intersecting an existing wall. Notice that the walls are cleaning 
up with each other as they normally would if they were all in the same phase.

498  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
If you would like to change the graphic behavior of the new and demolished walls when they 
intersect the existing wall, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the new or demolished wall. Right-click the grip control at the end of the wall 
you’d like to modify and select Disallow Join.
This will cause the walls to overlap, as shown in Figure 12.24.
Figure 12.23
Wall joins will 
clean up by default 
regardless of phasing.
Figure 12.24
Walls with disallowed 
joins will overlap.
	
2.	 To complete the operation, you can use the Trim/Extend Single Element or Trim/Extend 
Multiple Elements tool, or simply drag the endpoints of the walls to create the most 
appropriate intersecting condition (Figure 12.25).
Figure 12.25
Use Trim/Extend or 
drag wall endpoints 
to complete the 
modification.

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  499  
For walls that meet at an acute angle, you can use the Edit Wall Joins tool to control the reso-
lution of the intersection:
	
1.	 From the Modify tab in the ribbon, locate the Geometry panel and select the Wall Joins 
tool.
	
2.	 Hover your mouse pointer over an intersection of two walls at an acute angle. You will 
see a box appear around conditions that can be modified with this tool (Figure 12.26).
Figure 12.26
Use the Wall Joins tool 
to modify intersecting 
wall conditions.
	
3.	 In the Options bar, you will see a number of choices to help you customize the joining 
condition between the walls related to the selection.
	
4.	 To cycle through the available options, choose one of the joining types (Butt, Miter, or 
Square Off), and then click the Previous or Next button. Some options are shown in 
Figure 12.27.

corner conditions with

500  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Modifying Wall Profiles
An important extended modeling technique for walls is the ability to customize the elevation 
profile of a wall segment. There are two ways you can accomplish this: by attaching the wall’s 
top or base to another element or by editing the sketch profile of the wall. You can apply these 
methods to basic walls, stacked walls, and curtain walls.
To attach a wall to another element, select a wall segment and you will see the Attach Top/
Base button in the contextual Modify tab. Once this command is activated, select either Top or 
Base, and then pick an object. Walls can be attached to roofs, ceilings, floors, reference planes, 
and even other walls. Figure 12.28 shows a stacked wall that has been attached to a curvilinear 
roof by extrusion.
Figure 12.27
(continued)

Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls |  501  
When you use the attach method, be mindful of how the software treats walls that are 
attached to other objects. After you use this method, the instance parameters Top Is Attached 
and Base Is Attached will show the status of the selected wall’s attachment. These are read-only 
parameters and are for information only. Be aware that the top constraint and any other offset 
or height value will not display the actual height of the wall when it is attached to something. 
For example, if a wall whose base constraint is Level 1 and top constraint is Level 4 is attached 
to a floor slab on Level 2, the wall’s top constraint will still be listed as Level 4 in the Properties 
palette. This anomaly does not affect other calculations such as wall length, area, and volume.

Automatically Attaching Walls to Floors
When you create a standard floor by sketching a boundary, the floor is hosted on a specific level. 
After you complete the boundary sketch and finish the editing mode, Revit offers you some help 
to attach walls to the floor. Any wall whose top constraint is the level on which the floor is hosted 
can be automatically attached to the bottom of the floor.
As a bonus, you can access this functionality at any time—not just when you create a floor. If you 
forgot to attach the walls to the floor when you first modeled the floor, simply select the floor and 
then click Edit Boundary. Click the Finish Edit Mode button, and you should be prompted to attach 
walls to the floor.

502  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
The other method of modifying wall profiles is to edit the sketch profile of the wall. To do 
this, select a wall and click the Edit Profile button in the contextual Modify tab. This will open a 
Sketch mode in which you can draw a new boundary for any edge of the wall shape, as shown 
in Figure 12.29. Click Finish Edit Mode to complete the operation.

Creating Custom In-Place Walls
If you are working on traditional architecture, restoration of historic buildings, or free-form design, 
you may need to create walls that are irregular in shape. The Model In-Place tool, found in the 
Component drop-down list on the Architecture tab, lets you create any wall style independent of the 
constraints of the layer structure described in the previous sections of this chapter. Figure 12.30 shows 
an example of such a wall created with the solid geometry tools also found in the Family Editor.

Creating Stacked Walls |  503  
You can refer to Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family Editor,” to explore the various 
modeling techniques available in the Model In-Place mode. Remember that the selection of the 
family category is important to the behavior of the custom geometry. Select the Walls category 
to allow your custom elements to be scheduled with other walls and to place hosted elements 
such as doors and windows.
Creating Stacked Walls
Walls in a building—especially exterior walls—are often composed of several wall types 
made out of different material combinations and with different widths that stack one on top 
of another over the height of the façade. Because these walls usually sit on top of a founda-
tion wall, you would likely want to establish an intelligent relationship among the different 
wall assemblies so the entire façade acts as one wall (for example, when the foundation wall 
moves and you expect walls on top of the foundation to also move). This is where stacked 
walls can help.
Stacked walls allow you to create a single wall entity composed of different wall types 
stacked on top of each other. Before you can create a stacked wall, you need to download some 
basic wall types into your project. So follow these steps to download a variety of stacked walls 
and then modify one of them:
	
1.	 Download and open the file c12-Stacked-Walls.rvt or c12-Stacked-Walls-Metric
.rvt from this book’s web page. Activate the Level 1 floor plan view.
	
2.	 From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, pick the Wall tool and select Stacked Wall: 
Exterior – Brick Over Block W Metal Stud (you can find stacked wall types at the bottom 
of the list in the Type Selector). Draw a segment of wall in the Level 1 floor plan, and then 
exit the Wall command.
	
3.	 Select the wall segment, and in the Properties palette click the Edit Type button. Click the 
Duplicate button to create a new stacked wall named Mastering Stacked Wall.
	
4.	 Click the Edit button in the Structure field to open the Edit Assembly dialog box. Open 
the preview pane and set the view to Section.
When you’re editing the stacked wall type, you’ll notice that the Edit Assembly dialog 
box (Figure 12.31) is slightly different than when you’re working with a basic wall. Rather 
than editing individual layers, in this dialog box you are editing stacked wall types and 
their relationships to each other.
	
5.	 Click the Insert button to add a new wall to the stacked wall assembly. A new row 
appears in the list and allows you to define a new wall. Select the Generic - 12″ (Generic - 
300 mm) wall type from the Name list, and enter a Height of 10′-0″ (3 m) (the Width value 
is not important in this exercise).
	
6.	 At the top of the dialog box, find the Offset drop-down list and change the setting to 
Finish Face: Interior.
This will align the interior faces of the stacked walls and allow you to use the Offset field 
in the Types table to adjust each stacked wall type in a predictable manner.

Objective

504  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
7.	 Select the row of the generic wall type by clicking the row’s number label at the left side 
of the table. Click the Variable button to allow the wall to vary in height to adjust with 
varying level heights.
Note that one row must have a variable height, but only one row in the assembly can be 
assigned as such. All others must have a specific height value.
	
8.	 Go back to the Level 1 floor plan and draw a new wall with the Mastering Stacked Wall 
type, setting its top constraint to Level 3 in the Options bar or in the Properties palette.
	
9.	 Cut a section through the model, and change the heights of Level 1 and Level 3 to see the 
effect this has on the wall (make sure the level of detail in the section is set to Medium so 
you can see the layers of the wall).
You’ll see that changing Level 2 does not change the bottom walls because they are of a fixed 
height; however, changing the height of Level 3 changes the height of the variable wall.
At any time, you can break down a stacked wall into its individual wall types. To do this, 
select a stacked wall, right-click, and select Break Up. Once a stacked wall is broken up, the 
walls become independent, and there is no way to reassemble them back to a stacked wall. The 
base constraint and base offset of each subwall are the same as the stacked wall. For example, if 
the stacked wall was placed on Level 1, the base constraint for an upper subwall would still be 
Level 1, with the height difference accounted for in the wall’s Base Offset parameter. This can be 
modified in the Properties palette if necessary.
The following important notes about stacked walls are from the Revit user’s guide (from the 
section “Vertically Stacked Wall Notes”):
◆
◆
When you create a wall schedule, vertically stacked walls do not schedule, but their subwalls do.
Figure 12.31
The Edit Assembly 
dialog box for stacked 
walls

Creating Stacked Walls |  505  
◆
◆
When you edit the elevation profile of a stacked wall, you edit one main profile. If you 
break up the stacked wall, each subwall retains its edited profile.
◆
◆
Subwalls can host sweeps; stacked walls cannot.
◆
◆
Subwalls cannot be in different phases, worksets, or design options from those of the 
stacked wall.
◆
◆
To place inserts such as doors and windows in a stacked wall, you may need to use the Pick 
Primary Host tool to switch between subwalls composing the stacked wall. For example, 
the door shown in Figure 12.32 is outside the upper wall because the main host of the door 
is the bottom subwall.
Figure 12.32
Inserts may not host 
correctly in vertically 
stacked walls.
Figure 12.33
Use the Pick Primary 
Host tool to adjust 
inserts in stacked 
walls.
To place the door properly, select it and then choose Pick Primary Host from the Modify | 
Doors tab in the Host panel. Place your mouse pointer over the wall and select the upper sub-
wall (you may need to press the Tab key to select the correct component). The door will then be 
properly hosted in the upper wall, as shown in Figure 12.33.

506  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Creating Simple Curtain Walls
Curtain walls and curtain systems are unique wall types that allow you to embed divi-
sions, mullions, and panels directly into the wall. They have a distinct set of properties 
yet still share many characteristics of basic walls. A curtain system has the same inherent 
properties as a curtain wall, but it is used when you need to apply a curtain wall to a face. 
Curtain systems are usually nonrectangular in shape, such as the glazed dome shown in 
Figure 12.34.
Figure 12.34
Glazed dome created 
with a curtain system
Before we explore the creation and modification of curtain wall types, you should become 
familiar with the fundamental components of this object type in Revit. A curtain wall is defined 
by the following elements and subcomponents:
The Curtain Wall    A curtain wall is drawn like a basic wall and is available in the Type 
Selector when the Wall tool is activated. It has top and bottom constraints, can be attached 
to roofs or reference planes, can have its elevation profile edited, and is scheduled as a wall 
type. When a curtain wall is selected in a model, the overall curtain wall definition is dis-
played as a dashed line with extensions at both ends of the segment.

Creating Simple Curtain Walls |  507  
The dashed line of the overall curtain wall definition represents the location line of the wall. 
This is important if you are placing a curtain system on a face because the placement will be 
based on the location line. The location line of a curtain wall also determines the measure-
ment of the room area. Even if the Room Area Computation option is set to Wall Finish, a 
room’s area will be measured to a curtain wall’s location line.
So how do you adjust the location line of a curtain wall? This is accomplished by modifying 
the offsets in the mullions and panels you assign to a curtain wall or system. We’ll cover this 
process in the section “Customizing Curtain Wall Types” later in this chapter.
Curtain Grids    These are used to lay out a grid, defining the physical divisions of the cur-
tain wall. You can lay out grids freely as a combination of horizontal and vertical segments, 
or they can be predefined in a curtain wall’s type properties in regular spacing intervals. 
Figure 12.35 shows a freely designed layout of curtain grids and expressive curtain panels 
in between.
Figure 12.35

regular orthogonal 
grids and expressive 
curtain panels
Mullions    These represent the structural profiles on a glass façade, and they follow the 
curtain grid geometry. Mullions can be vertical or horizontal and can be customized to any 
shape based on a mullion profile family. Offsets specified in a mullion’s type properties affect 
how the mullion is placed relative to the curtain wall’s location line.
Curtain Panels    These fill in the space between the curtain grids. Offsets in a curtain panel’s 
type properties determine how the panel is placed relative to the curtain wall’s location line. 
Curtain panels are always one of the following:
Empty Panels    No panel is placed between the grids.

508  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Glazed Panels    These can be made out of different types of glass that can have any color 
or transparency.
Solid Panels    Panels can be created with custom geometry in the Family Editor and can 
include anything from doors and spandrels to shadow boxes and solar fins.
Wall Types as Infill    When you have a panel selected, you can also choose a basic wall 
type from the Type Selector to fill the space between the curtain grids. All wall types in 
the project will be available for your selection. An example of this application would be 
interior office partitions in which the lower portion is a standard wall and glass panels 
fill the upper portion.
Designing a Curtain Wall
Let’s go through a quick exercise to become familiar with the creation of a simple curtain wall. 
To create a curtain wall, you can either model a standard wall and change its type to Curtain 
Wall or select a curtain wall type from the Type Selector when the Wall tool is active. To begin 
the exercise, create a new project and follow the steps:
	
1.	 From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, select the Wall tool. From the Type Selector (in 
the Properties palette) select Curtain Wall 1.
	
2.	 In the Level 1 floor plan, draw a single curtain wall. Go to a 3D view to see the result.
The basic curtain wall definition has no predefined grids or mullions. The wall segment 
you see is just one big system panel that you will need to divide. If you create a curved 
segment for a curtain wall, the panels are always straight segments. Thus, if you draw a 
curved segment in the plan with the Curtain Wall 1 family, there will be only one straight 
panel segment between the endpoints of the curve until you start to divide it up with cur-
tain grids. Revit doesn’t allow for curved glazing outside of a custom  
family.
	
3.	 Divide the wall into panels using the Curtain Grid tool from the Architecture tab. 
Position your mouse pointer over the edges of the wall to get a preview of where the grid 
will be placed (select a vertical edge to place a horizontal grid or select a horizontal edge 
to place a vertical grid).
There are some snapping options when you are placing curtain grids that will help you 
divide the panels and subsequent divisions at midpoints and thirds. Watch the status bar 
for snapping prompts because there are no graphic indicators of the snapped positions 
other than the mouse pointer pausing. Place grids on the wall segment so that you get 
something like the wall shown in Figure 12.36.
	
4.	 From the Architecture tab, select the Mullion tool.
Notice that you can select from a variety of mullion types in the Type Selector; however, 
the default choice is adequate for this exercise. At the right end of the ribbon, you will 
see the Placement panel with three options for placing mullions: Grid Line, Grid Line 
Segment, and All Grid Lines. You can place mullions on the curtain wall using any of 
these methods. Give them a try to see how they work.

Creating Simple Curtain Walls |  509  
Replacing Panels and Mullions
Next, you’ll replace panels in the wall you just created. As we explained earlier, panels are sub-
components of the overall curtain wall, so you may need to press the Tab key to select a panel 
and view its properties. Special selection tools for curtain walls are available in the context 
menu when you highlight a mullion or a panel.
In the following exercise, you will replace the narrow band of glazing panels with solid 
panels:
	
1.	 In a 3D view, select one of the glazing panels in the narrow horizontal band (press the 
Tab key to select it if necessary).
	
2.	 Right-click and choose Select Panels ➢ Along Horizontal Grid, as shown in 
Figure 12.37.
	
3.	 With all the glazing panels selected along the horizontal grid, go to the Type Selector and 
find the type named Solid under the Family System panel (note that the Glazing panel 
type is in the same family as the Solid panel).

Customizing Curtain Grid Segments
In the last part of this exercise, you will practice the techniques for adding or removing seg-
ments of curtain grids in order to refine your curtain wall design.
Figure 12.37

panels along a grid 
with commands in the 
context menu.
Understanding the Curtain “Grid”
One important fact to remember when working with curtain grids is that they are always implied 
across the extent of the curtain wall. When we say they are implied, we mean they are not neces-
sarily expressed on all panel segments. In other words, although a curtain grid is always expressed 
from one end of the wall to the other, you can decide if the grid divides every panel it crosses.

Creating Simple Curtain Walls |  511  
To become more familiar with this technique, you will add a curtain grid to the midpoint of 
the right-center panel and delete the division between the two panels to the left of the added 
grid, as shown in Figure 12.38.
Figure 12.38
Individual grid lines 
are added or deleted to 
further customize the 
design.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Begin by activating the Curtain Grid tool from the Architecture tab. In the Placement 
panel at the right end of the ribbon, click the One Segment button. Hover your mouse 
pointer over the bottom edge of the right-center panel and snap to the midpoint of the 
panel (Figure 12.39).
	
2.	 The second step is tricky. You do not continue creating another division in the short 
panel above the center panel. Instead, press the Esc key or click the Modify tool 
to exit the Curtain Grid command. Select the vertical grid line you created in step 
1 (you may need to press the Tab key until you see the dashed line indicating the 
curtain grid).
Notice that the grid extends the entire height of the wall (Figure 12.40).

or remove individual 
segments along it.

3.	 With the curtain grid selected, click the Add/Remove Segments button in the Modify | 
Curtain Grids panel of the Modify tab. Pick the segment of the curtain grid that passes 
through the short panel. Press the Esc key, and you should see that the short panel is also 
split in half.
	
4.	 Activate the Mullion tool and place mullions on the division between the two center pan-
els, as shown in Figure 12.41.
Figure 12.41
Mullions are applied to 
the segment added in 
the center panels.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key or click Modify. Select and delete the horizontal mullion between the 
two left panels (this step is optional).
	
6.	 Similar to the process of adding grid segments, select the horizontal curtain grid below 
the narrow band and click the Add/Remove Segments button in the ribbon. Click the 
segment in the left-center panel.
If you did not delete the mullion in step 5, a warning will appear prompting you to delete 
the mullion segment. The result should look like the wall shown in Figure 12.42.

514  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Placing Doors in Curtain Walls
In the next exercise of this topic, you will swap one of the curtain panels for a door panel. 
Door families for curtain walls can be found in the Doors folder of the Revit default library, 
but they behave differently than regular doors. The height and width of the curtain wall 
door are driven by the curtain grids—not the type properties of the door. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 From the Insert tab on the ribbon, locate the Load From Library panel and click the Load 
Family button. Navigate to the Doors folder of the Revit default library and load the 
Door-Curtain-Wall-Double-Glass.rfa or M_Door-Curtain-Wall-Double-Glass.rfa 
family.
If you can’t find these default families, you can download them from this book’s web 
page.
Figure 12.42
A segment was 
removed from the left 
panel to complete the 
customized design.

2.	 Zoom into the bottom-middle panel in your curtain wall. Delete the mullion 
under this segment, as shown in Figure 12.43. (You don’t want to have a tripping 
hazard at your door!) Remember, you may have to press the Tab key to select the 
mullion.
Figure 12.43
Delete the mullion 
below the panel where 
the door will be placed.
	
3.	 Select the bottom-middle panel and go to the Type Selector. Find the door family you just 
loaded and select it from the list so the results look like the wall in Figure 12.44. (Once 
hosted, if you only see the glass door panels and do not see the door hardware, change 
the view’s Detail Level to Fine.)
The door swing can be adjusted in plan as with any other door.

516  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Placing Corner Mullions
Revit includes special mullions to be used at the corners of two curtain walls. These mullion 
types are unique in that only one is needed to connect two wall segments. In the default 
project template, you will find four corner mullion types, as shown in Figure 12.45: (a) V 
Corner Mullion, (b) Quad Corner Mullion, (c) L Corner Mullion, and (d) Trapezoid Corner 
Mullion.
Figure 12.44

has been swapped for 
a double door panel 
family.
Figure 12.45
Available curtain wall

Creating Simple Curtain Walls |  517  
Corner mullions cannot be customized beyond the shapes included in the Revit project 
template; however, you can modify the material assigned to the mullions as well as the offset 
and depth dimensions in the type properties. When you use corner mullions between two 
segments of curtain wall, they will automatically adjust to the angle between the segments, as 
shown in Figure 12.46.
Figure 12.46
Corner mullions adapt 
to angles between 
curtain wall segments.
Before you place a corner mullion, make sure the endpoints of the two curtain wall 
segments are cleanly connected. You can drag the endpoint controls of the walls or use the 
Trim/Extend To Corner tool. To place a corner mullion, simply use the Mullion tool and 
select one of the corner edges of either one of the wall segments. If you have already placed 
a regular mullion at the end of a curtain wall segment, select the mullions along the vertical 
edge, and then use the Type Selector to choose a corner mullion type. Remember that 
you can use the context menu (right-click and select Mullions ➢ On Gridline) to make the 
selection easy.
Customizing Curtain Wall Types
In the previous exercises, you learned the fundamental techniques of building a simple 
but custom curtain wall design. To reap some additional productivity from the curtain 
wall tool, you can predefine almost all the properties necessary to generate a complete 
curtain wall assembly simply by placing the wall in your project. In the following 
sections, we will examine one of the curtain wall types included with the default project 
template.
Download and open the file c12-Simple-Curtain-Wall.rvt or c12-Simple-Curtain-
Wall-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page. Switch to a 3D view, and you will see that the wall 
already has vertical and horizontal divisions along with mullions placed on the divisions, as 
shown in Figure 12.47.

518  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Select the sample of storefront wall in the exercise file and click the Edit Type button in the 
Properties palette. The settings that drive the generation of this type of wall are relatively easy 
to understand. Let’s review some important options related to these properties:
Automatically Embed    When you enable this option, any instance of this curtain wall type 
will embed itself inside other wall segments. This is useful for modeling extended areas of 
ribbon or strip glazing (Figure 12.48) instead of using a window family.
Figure 12.47
Sample curtain wall

Figure 12.48
The Automatically 
Embed option allows 
curtain walls to be 
placed inside basic 
walls.

Creating Simple Curtain Walls |  519  
Join Condition    This option defines the behavior of the mullion joins. It can be one of the 
following:
◆
◆
Not Defined (join conditions can be overridden as necessary)
◆
◆
Vertical Grid Continuous
◆
◆
Horizontal Grid Continuous
◆
◆
Border And Vertical Grid Continuous
◆
◆
Border And Horizontal Grid Continuous
Display In Hidden Views    This option allows you to control the graphic display of indi-
vidual components over several views. The options for this can be one of the following:
◆
◆
Edges Hidden By Other Members (the default)
◆
◆
Edges Hidden By Element Itself
◆
◆
All Edges
◆
◆
None
Grid Pattern: Layout    There are four options to define how the vertical and horizontal grids 
will be arranged in your curtain wall:
Fixed Distance    The most common setting, which allows you to specify spacing between 
gridlines. Leftover panel segments must be accounted for in the overall length of the wall.
Fixed Number    Divides the wall segment into equally spaced panels. When you select 
this option, the Spacing parameter becomes disabled. In its place, a new integer param-
eter named Number will appear in the instance properties.
Maximum Spacing    Indicates the maximum spacing distance. Curtain panels will be 
equally divided over the length of the wall segment, not to exceed the Spacing value.
Minimum Spacing    Indicates the minimum spacing distance. Curtain panels will be 
equally divided over the length of the wall segment, no smaller than the Spacing value.
Mullions    This option allows you to specify the mullions that will be automatically applied 
to the curtain wall. Corner mullions can be applied to either Border 1 or Border 2 for the ver-
tical mullions, but use them carefully—their resolution at corners will depend on how you 
construct your wall segments. For example, if you define a corner mullion for Border 1 and 
none for Border 2, you must construct all curtain wall segments of this type in a uniform 
direction. If you model one wall segment from left to right and another from right to left,  
you will have overlapping mullions at one corner and none at the other corner.
Modifying Pinned Panels and Mullions
You may have already noticed that when a panel or mullion is selected from a predefined curtain 
wall type, it appears with a pushpin icon. This indicates that this element is part of a system and 
cannot be changed without additional action.
To change or delete a predefined panel or mullion in a curtain wall instance, select the element 
and click the pushpin icon. The icon will change to a pushpin with a red X next to it. At this point, 
you can change the element using the Type Selector or delete it (only mullions can be deleted).

520  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Creating Custom Curtain Panels
A curtain panel does not have to be confined to a simple extrusion of glass or solid material. You 
can create any kind of panel family to satisfy your design requirements. When creating a new 
panel, be sure to select the Curtain Wall Panel.rft or Metric Curtain Wall Panel.rft family tem-
plate file. The width and height of the panel are not explicitly specified in the family; instead, the 
outermost reference planes will adapt to the divisions in the curtain wall into which the panel is 
embedded. If required, you can adjust the panel geometry to offset within or beyond the refer-
ence plane boundaries in the family. This is useful for creating butt-glazed curtain wall assem-
blies. The following feature contains examples of situations where you might want to consider 
custom curtain wall panels.
Pin with Care
Be careful when you attempt to unpin elements from a curtain wall because you cannot re-pin 
back to the predefined system. Within the active Revit session, you may be able to return to an 
unpinned curtain wall element and still find the unpinned icon. This allows you to fix any acci-
dental unpinning, but once your project is closed and reopened, you can no longer re-associate the 
unpinned elements.
Spider Fittings and Sunshades
Generic models can be nested in a curtain panel family. In the example shown here, two instances 
of the spider component are placed on one edge of the panel. Visibility parameters are assigned to 
the two spider fittings that enable either the top or bottom spider to be displayed as needed. The 
spider fittings were downloaded from RevitCity.com, and the sunshade is a Kawneer model 1600 
SunShade – Planar, downloaded from Autodesk® Seek (http://seek.autodesk.com).

Creating Simple Curtain Walls |  521  
Spandrel and Shadowbox    Often in glazing applications, the spacing of horizontal mem-
bers will consist of a pattern including a narrow band or spandrel to mask the floor and 
ceiling sandwich. Revit software does not currently have the ability to define two spacing 
values, but you can create the spandrel or shadowbox in a single panel family. In the example 
shown here, the spandrel height is a type property of the custom panel family. Standard 
mullions are applied to the wall.
Louvers    Our last example shows how metal louvers can be embedded in a curtain panel 
family. The image shown here is a panel developed with a nested generic model. The louver 
fins are arranged in a parametric array within the generic model, and then the generic model 
is placed in the panel. The edges of the louver array are constrained to the reference planes in 
the panel. This parametric louver curtain panel was downloaded from RevitCity.com.

522  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Creating Complex Curtain Walls
Often at the early stages of design, as an architect or designer you need to be able to model 
curtain wall systems that indicate more complex design intent. These systems need to be flexible 
and light enough to allow you to explore design iteration, but they also need to be robust and 
detailed enough to be useful as your project moves from concept to design development and 
then on to fabrication.
In Revit you can build complex curtain walls using massing tools. There are two potential 
workflows. You can model your curtain wall system directly within the project environment 
from massing forms, or you can build it as a family within a conceptual design environment. 
Both of these methods are quite similar, but we prefer to use the conceptual design environment 
because the complexity of modeled elements, such as adaptive components, is better managed in 
a file that is separate from the project environment.
Project Environment    You can build your forms directly within your project environ-
ment using the in-place massing tools. When walls are constructed through the In-Place 
Mass tool, the conceptual design environment does not have 3D reference planes and 3D 
levels.
Essentially, to create a complex curtain wall within the project environment, you follow these 
simple steps:
	
1.	 Create an in-place mass in the project environment.
	
2.	 Divide the surface.
	
3.	 Apply a surface pattern.
	
4.	 Replace the surface pattern with a pattern-based curtain panel family.
Conceptual Design Environment    You create your curtain wall designs in the Revit 
conceptual design environment (CDE), which is a type of Family Editor. These forms 
reside outside the project environment. You can then reference these massing families 
into a project environment, allowing you to explore contextual relationships with the 
building form.
To create a complex curtain wall within the conceptual design environment, you’re going to 
follow these simple steps:
	
1.	 Build a new conceptual mass in the Family Editor.
	
2.	 Divide the surface.
	
3.	 Apply a surface pattern.
	
4.	 Replace the surface pattern with a pattern-based curtain panel family.
	
5.	 Load it into your project.
You start by designing a conceptual form that will represent the shape and form of the 
surface of the curtain wall. You are then able to subdivide the surface of this form using a 
grid system, referred to as a UV grid. Because surfaces are not always planar (flat), a UVW 
coordinate system is used to plot location across the surface. This grid system automatically 

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  523  
adjusts, following the natural contours of a nonplanar surface or form. The UV grid is then 
used as a guide for applying a pattern to the surface. You can investigate how you might 
panelize the surface to make it constructible by applying a geometric pattern to it. This pat-
tern provides a basic graphic representation of how the panel may look. These graphic pat-
terns can then be replaced with parametric components that automatically conform to the 
divided surface.
Dividing the Surface
Let’s take a look at the basic tools that will allow you to divide the surface of a conceptual form:
	
1.	 Start by opening c12-Square-Panel.rfa from this book’s web page.
This file represents a simple conceptual shape for a curtain wall design (Figure 12.49). 
The form was constructed by drawing two curves at varying reference levels, and then a 
surface was generated between them.
Figure 12.49
Conceptual shape to 
be used as a basis for a 
complex curtain wall 
design
	
2.	 Select the form and then click Divide Surface on the contextual tab in the ribbon.
This will divide the surface of the form, and you will see horizontal and vertical grids 
displayed. This is the UV grid.
You can control the display of the UV grid when it is selected (Figure 12.50). To modify 
the display, click the U Grid or V Grid button in the UV Grids And Intersects panel on the 
Modify | Divided Surface tab of the ribbon.

524  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
3.	 With the surface selected, make sure the U Grid and V Grid icons are highlighted in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon.
Notice how the Options bar provides a number of settings for you to modify the divided 
surface. You can control the U grid and V grid by a number or with a specific distance. 
If you select the Number option, you can enter a number of divisions that will distribute 
evenly across the surface.
	
4.	 Select Distance, which will allow you to enter a specific absolute distance between grids 
across the divided surface. Under the Distance setting, there is a drop-down menu that 
also allows you to specify a Maximum Distance or a Minimum Distance value; these are 
similar to the constraints described earlier in this chapter for basic curtain walls. Make 
sure the surface is divided by number, with a U grid of 10 and a V grid of 10.
	
5.	 With the UV grid selected, you will see a 3D control (x-, y-, and z-axis arrows), and an 
icon appears in the center of the surface. Click the icon to enable the Configure UV Grid 
Layout command. The display will change (Figure 12.51), and you can now apply specific 
settings to control the UV grid even further.
Figure 12.50
A surface of the 
conceptual form has 
been divided and the 
UV grid is displayed.
Figure 12.51
To configure the UV 
grid, click the icon 
at the center of the 
surface.

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  525  
You have the ability to alter the rotation of the grid, the UV grid belt, and the justification 
of the UV grids at the surface borders. These grid configuration parameters can also be 
found and modified in the Properties palette.
	
6.	 In the Properties palette, set the U Grid Rotation value to 45 degrees and the V Grid 
Rotation value to 45 degrees; then click Apply.
Notice how the modified values are updated in the 3D view with the Configure UV Grid 
Layout command activated.
In the Configure UV Grid Layout mode (Figure 12.52), you will see a number of controls—all 
of which relate to parameters you can also access in the Properties palette. The arrow cross in 
the middle of the grid is the grid justification marker. You can drag it to any side or corner or the 
center of the grid, which will adjust the value of the Justification property of both U and V grids.
Figure 12.52
The UV grid can be 
modified directly or 
via the values in the 
Properties palette.
The belts represent the lines along the surface from which the distance between grids is mea-
sured. The distance is measured by chords, not curve lengths, and can be seen in the Properties 
palette as the Belt Measurement parameter for both U and V grids.
Dividing the Surface with Intersects
As you saw in the previous exercise, the Divide Surface tool allows you to divide the surface of a 
form using the natural UVW grid of the surface. However, if you want to divide the surface with 
a customized grid pattern, you divide it by intersecting geometry. By using the Intersect feature, 
you can divide the surface based on the following:
◆
◆
Intersecting levels, reference planes, and even lines drawn on a reference plane
◆
◆
A mixture of U or V grids and intersects

526  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Let’s take a look at an example based on our previous file, which will demonstrate how you 
can use a series of defined reference planes to divide a surface:
	
1.	 Start by opening the file c12-Square-Panel-Intersects.rfa from this book’s web page.
Notice that a series of reference lines are now drawn in the X plane; you will use these 
reference lines to divide the surface of the form.
	
2.	 Select the surface and choose Divide Surface from the ribbon. Click the U Grid tool on the 
ribbon to disable the display of the U grids.
	
3.	 With the surface still selected, click the Intersects button on the ribbon. Select all the 
reference planes in the X plane, and then click the Finish icon in the Intersects panel on 
the ribbon.
This will divide the surface based on where the reference planes intersect the surface of 
the form. You could also select Intersects ➢ Intersects List to choose named references 
such as levels or named reference planes instead of picking them in the model view.
	
4.	 Go to the Project Browser and open the 3D view named 3D Surface to review the results 
(Figure 12.53).
Figure 12.53
The surface is divided 
by intersecting planes 
and lines.
Applying Patterns
Surface patterns allow you to quickly preview in a graphical manner how a panel will work 
across the surface of the form. Because you are not working with complex geometry at this 
stage, the editing and adjustment to the design concept are quick. Revit provides a number of 
predefined patterns that are available from the Properties palette, and they can be applied to 
your divided surface. You will now apply a surface pattern to a form:
	
1.	 Start by opening c12-Square-Panel-Pattern.rfa from this book’s web page. Divide the 
surface following the steps from the previous exercise.
	
2.	 With the UV grid on the form selected, you will notice in the Type Selector that the 
default empty pattern named _No Pattern is applied to the surface. Open the Type 

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  527  
Selector, and you will see that you can apply one of a number of predefined patterns to 
the surface. Click the Rectangle Checkerboard Pattern type to apply it to your surface 
(Figure 12.54).
Figure 12.54
Surface with Rectangle 
Checkerboard Pattern 
applied
	
3.	 Experiment with the various predefined patterns and adjust the UV grid as required to 
play with the proportions of the patterns.
At any time, you can display both the underlying surface divisions and the pattern surface. 
With the grid selected, click the Surface button in the Surface Representation panel on the 
Modify | Divided Surface tab. This display should give you a better understanding of the 
relationship between the pattern definition and the spacing of the surface divisions.
Editing the Pattern Surface
There will be situations where you will want to edit and control the border conditions for pat-
tern surfaces. Patterned surfaces may have border tiles that intersect the edge of a surface, and 
they may not end up as complete tiles. You can control the border tile conditions by setting them 
to Partial, Overhanging, or Empty in the Border Tile instance property of the patterned surface. 
You will now modify a conceptual curtain wall to examine how the different border conditions 
affect the surface:
	
1.	 Start by opening c12-Square-Panel-Border.rfa from this book’s web page.
	
2.	 Select the surface, and in the Properties palette, locate the Border Tile parameter under 
Constraints. Set the value to Empty, and click Apply or drag the mouse out of the 
Properties palette.
Notice that the tiles at the borders are no longer visible, as shown in Figure 12.55.

528  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
3.	 Next, change the Border Tile parameter to Overhanging and click Apply.
The border tiles will now show in their entirety, extending beyond the edge of the surface.
Editing a Surface Representation
When editing a surface in the conceptual design environment, you have the option to choose 
how surface elements will be displayed. A number of options are available to you, allowing 
you to customize how you show or hide the various elements that make up a divided surface 
in a view. If you select either the U or V Grid icon, this will enable or disable the UV grid in 
the view. The Surface icon allows you to display the original surface, nodes, or grid lines. The 
Pattern icon allows you to hide or display the pattern lines or pattern fill applied to the sur-
face. The Component icon allows you to hide or display the pattern component applied to the 
surface. If you decide to make any changes to the display using the Surface Representation 
tools, these changes will not carry through into the project environment. To globally show 
or hide surface elements, you will have to alter this from the Visibility/Graphic Overrides 
dialog box.
In the Surface Representation panel, you will also notice a small arrow in the bottom-right 
corner. Clicking this arrow will open the Surface Representation dialog box, where you will find 
additional display options for the surface, patterns, and components. You also have the ability 
to display nodes and override the surface material of the form. Let’s practice controlling the 
surface representation of your form:
	
1.	 Start by opening c12-Square-Panel-SurfaceRep.rfa from this book’s web page.
	
2.	 With the surface selected, go to the Surface Representation panel in the ribbon, and 
click the arrow in the bottom-right corner to open the Surface Representation dialog box 
(Figure 12.56).

Adding Definition
So far, you have created a surface, subdivided it, and applied a graphical representation to 
the form. You can now begin to add actual component geometry similar to mullions and 
panels. Although the underlying graphic pattern will remain, the component geometry 
will take precedence. To begin this process, you will create special curtain panel families 
using the Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft fam-
ily template. This type of panel family can be applied to the divided surface to populate it 
with architectural components, adding realistic definition to your conceptual curtain wall 
surface.

Representation dialog 
box to further custom-
ize the display of your 
form.

Nodes are displayed at 
the intersections of the 
U grids and V grids.
	
3.	 On the Surface tab, enable Nodes if is not already enabled; this will display a node at each 
intersection of the UV grid, as shown in Figure 12.57.

Building a Pattern-Based Panel Family
In the following exercise, you will build a simple rectangular panel and apply it to your divided surface:
	
1.	 Click the Application menu, choose New ➢ Family, and select the Curtain Panel Pattern 
Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft family template.
Figure 12.58 shows the pattern-based curtain wall family template, which consists of a 
grid, a series of reference lines, and adaptive points. The grid is used to lay out the pat-
tern of the panel. The adaptive points and reference lines act as a rig, defining the layout 
of the panel. You can construct solid and planar geometry within and around the refer-
ence lines to form the panel.
When a panel is applied to a divided surface, the points in the panel adapt to the UV grid 
and the panel will then flex accordingly. As a general rule, the grid pattern in your cur-
tain panel family should match the pattern on the divided surface to which it is applied. 
For example, if you have applied a hexagonal pattern to your divided surface, make sure 
the curtain panel family is also using a hexagonal pattern.
Figure 12.58
The rig in the pattern-
based curtain panel 
family
	
2.	 You now need to decide what pattern you will use for the component. To change the 
pattern, select the grid, go to the Type Selector, and change the pattern to Rhomboid. 
Notice how the adaptive points and reference lines update to reflect the change. Review 
the various patterns that are available to you. Revert to the Rectangular pattern.
Modeling a pattern-based curtain panel is similar to how you would sketch and construct 
a form within the conceptual design environment. You use points, lines, and reference 
lines to construct geometry.
	
3.	 Select one of the adaptive points and drag it. These points move only vertically, not horizontally.
As you move the point, the reference lines attached to the point will alter the shape. 
Therefore, as you build geometry on the defined reference lines and an adaptive point is 
moved or adjusted, the reference lines are altered, and the geometry constructed along 
the reference lines updates to reflect the change.
	
4.	 To reset the adaptive points back to the grid, select the grid and you will notice a Reset 
Points To Grid button in the Options bar. Click the button to reset the points.

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  531  
Figure 12.59
Geometry options are 
presented when you are 
using the Create Form 
tool.
	
6.	 Next, you will flex the geometry to test its consistency. Select one of the adaptive points 
and move it vertically. Observe how the geometry flexes, as shown in Figure 12.60, and 
then reset the points to grid.
Figure 12.60
The panel form will flex 
when the points are 
dragged vertically.
	
7.	 Switch to the Architecture tab in the ribbon, and from the Draw panel, select the Point 
Element tool. Place a point on one of the reference planes, as shown in Figure 12.61. This 
point becomes a hosted point; observe how its symbol is smaller than the symbol for the 
adaptive points. Select the point, and from the Properties palette change the value of the 
Show Reference Planes parameter to Always.
	
5.	 Select the four reference lines and click the Create Form ➢ Solid Form button in the ribbon. 
Two icons now appear in the middle of the model view (Figure 12.59), giving you the option 
to create an extruded form or a flat planar surface. Select the icon for the planar surface.

532  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
8.	 From the Architecture tab and the Work Plane panel, click the Set button (Set Work Plane 
tool) and pick the work plane of the hosted point.
	
9.	 Draw a circle with a radius of 6” (150 mm) on the work plane of the hosted point, as 
shown in Figure 12.62.
It can be a little tricky drawing the circle onto the active work plane of the hosted point. 
Therefore, use the Show Work Plane tool to display the active work plane for the point. 
This will make the process of sketching the circle easier.
Figure 12.61
A reference point is 
placed on one of the 
reference lines.
Figure 12.62

vertical work plane of 
the hosted point.
	
10.	 Select the circle and the four default reference planes, and then choose Create Form ➢ 
Solid Form.
This will sweep the circle profile along the four reference planes, as shown in Figure 12.63.
This will make it easier to build geometry using the hosted point in later steps.

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  533  
When building your curtain panels, consider how you will assign geometry to appropri-
ate subcategories. This will ensure that you have full control over the elements from a 
visual and graphical point of view. For details on assigning geometry to subcategories, 
refer to Chapter 15, “Creating Stairs and Railings.”
	
11.	 Save the family as Square-CWPanel.rfa.
Figure 12.63

a circle and four 
reference lines
Changing Patterns with Geometry
It is important to understand that if you decide to switch your curtain panel grid pattern after 
creating solid forms, the geometry will not automatically adapt to the new pattern you choose. 
The geometry will be left orphaned, and you will need to delete any geometry and remodel, based 
on the new pattern.
Applying Components to a Divided Surface
Now that you have created a pattern-based curtain panel family, you’ll need to load this family 
into your conceptual mass family and apply it to the divided surface, replacing the graphical 
pattern with the actual component.
	
1.	 Download and open the file c12-Square-CWSystem.rfa from this book’s web page.
	
2.	 Load the family file Square-CWPanel.rfa you created in the previous exercise into this 
file by clicking Load Family on the Insert tab of the ribbon, or switch to that file and click 
the Load Into Projects button.
	
3.	 In the conceptual mass file, select the pattern and divided surface. In the Properties 
palette, click the Type Selector, and scroll down the list until you find the name of your 
pattern-based curtain panel family.

534  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Your new panel family will be listed under the pattern within which it was designed. The 
component will now be applied to the patterned surface, as shown in Figure 12.64. Note 
that the more complex the surface and component, the longer it will take to load.
Figure 12.64

tain panel component

Creating a Pyramid Curtain Wall Pattern-Based Family
Now that you have mastered the technique of constructing a simple planar curtain panel, let’s 
look at how to create a pyramid type panel. You will add a type parameter to your pyramid 
curtain panel so that you can vary the apex of the panel:
	
1.	 Start a new family using the Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel 
Pattern Based.rft family template.
	
2.	 Place a reference point, ensuring that it snaps to the middle of one of the reference lines 
included within the template. Place another reference point on the reference line opposite 
the one you previously placed, as shown in Figure 12.65.
	
3.	 From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, click the Reference tool and ensure that 3D 
Snapping is activated in the Options bar. Draw a reference line between the two newly 
placed hosted reference points, as shown in Figure 12.66.
	
4.	 Place another reference point, so that it becomes hosted, at the midpoint of the 
previously created reference line (Figure 12.67). Select this reference point, and 
from the Properties palette, make sure that Show Reference Planes is set to  
Always.

536  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
5.	 From the Architecture tab, choose the Set Work Plane tool and select the work plane of 
the hosted point at the middle of the previously drawn line. Activate the Reference Line 
tool and uncheck the 3D Snapping option. Draw a reference line vertically in the Z plane 
from the hosted point.
Ensure that the start point of the reference line is locked to the hosted point. You may 
need to drag the end of the reference line, nearest to the point, in the Z direction before 
dragging it back to the hosted point. This will ensure that the lock symbol will appear.
	
6.	 Select the vertical reference line to display the temporary dimension, and turn this into a 
permanent dimension by clicking the dimension icon.
	
7.	 Select this dimension and then choose <Add New Parameter…> from the Label 
pull-down in the Options bar. Assigning this dimension to a parameter will allow 
you to alter the apex of the pyramid panel as needed. In the Parameter Properties 
dialog box, name the parameter Apex_Height. Click OK to close all open dialog 
boxes.
	
8.	 Add a series of reference lines using the 3D Snapping option from the apex to the four 
points on the base of the pyramid, as shown in Figure 12.68.
Figure 12.68
Reference lines are 
created from the 
corners to the apex.
	
9.	 You will now create faces on each slope to complete the pyramid shape. To do this, select 
one reference line from the base and two reference lines on the sloping edges (use the  
Ctrl key to add lines to your selection), and click the Create Form button. Select the planar 
triangular face rather than the extrusion (Figure 12.69).

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  537  
	
11.	 It is important that you flex the pyramid to check that you can control the height of the 
apex. Open the Type Properties dialog box, and you will see the parameter named Apex_
Height. Change the value a few times and click Apply after each change. The pyramid 
panel should change in height. Save your file as Pyramid-Panel.rfa.
	
12.	 Open the file c12-Pyramid-Project.rfa from this book’s web page. Load your Pyramid-Panel
.rfa family into the c12-Pyramid-Project.rfa. Select the surface, go to the Type 
Selector, and choose Pyramid-Panel.

Select three reference 
planes, and then use 
Create Form to generate 
each face of the 
pyramid.

All four sides of the 
pyramid have been 
created.
	
10.	 Repeat step 9 for the three remaining faces until you have a completed pyramid, as shown 
in Figure 12.70.

538  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Creating Custom Patterns
Although Revit includes a variety of patterns you can use for conceptual curtain walls, 
at present there is no way to create your own pattern-based curtain panel template. The 
current patterns shipped with the software are hardwired, so there is no way to modify 
them either; however, with a bit of creative thinking, you can use the provided templates to 
construct panels that will conform to a custom pattern concept. When you consider build-
ing a custom panel, it is important to take into account how it will repeat vertically and 
horizontally. You will need to break it down into its smallest module. If you think about a 
repeating architectural pattern such as a masonry wall, its individual component can be 
broken down into the brick that forms that pattern, which is in essence is a rectangle. An 
example of a hexagon-shaped panel, constructed within a rectangular pattern, is shown in 
Figure 12.72.
Figure 12.71
The pyramid panel is 
populated across the 
entire surface.
Figure 12.72
A hexagonal panel is 
constructed within a 
standard rectangular 
pattern.
Your pyramid shape curtain panel will now be populated across the divided surface, as 
shown in Figure 12.71.

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  539  
Once you have decided on the design for your panel, look at how the panel could be 
modularized. To do this, consider laying out the pattern utilizing graph paper. This will 
certainly help you better understand the layout before attempting to construct the panel using 
an appropriate template. In Figure 12.73, you can see the hexagonal panel applied across a 
divided surface.
Limiting the Size of Pattern-Based Families
When designing complex curtain wall systems, the goal is to limit the variety of panels. The 
more variety you have, the higher the cost because you have to create a greater number of 
unique panels. When you divide a surface, the panel sizes can vary quite dramatically. Although 
you do not actually have the ability to limit panel sizes, you can start to reduce the size and vari-
ety of panels by nesting curtain panels inside other panels. In the following exercise, you will 
learn how to nest panels to limit size variation:
	
1.	 Start by creating a simple pattern-based curtain panel family (use either Curtain Panel 
Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft). Make sure the grid is set to 
the Rectangular type.
	
2.	 Select the four reference lines and use the Create Form tool to generate a planar 
surface.
	
3.	 Similar to the previous exercise, place a hosted point on one of the edges of the surface, 
and then draw a circle with a 6” (150 mm) radius on the point’s work plane. Use Create 
Form to generate a swept profile on two edges to represent a mullion, as shown in 
Figure 12.74. Save this panel as Limit-Panel-1.rfa.
	
4.	 Start another new pattern-based curtain panel family, again using the Rectangular grid 
pattern. Select the four reference planes, and use Create Form to generate a planar surface 
rather than an extrusion.
Figure 12.73

surface

540  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
	
5.	 Select the planar surface and click the Divide Surface tool from the ribbon. You will 
divide this surface and set the UV grid by number; set U Grid to 2 and V Grid to 2, as 
shown in Figure 12.75.
Figure 12.74
A panel with a swept 
profile is created to be 
nested into another 
panel family.
Figure 12.75

pattern-based family 
and divide the surface 
into a 2×2 grid.
	
6.	 Load the Limit-Panel-1 family into the divided surface panel.
	
7.	 Select the divided surface and apply your panel to the divided surface by choosing 
Limit-Panel-1 from the Type Selector. This will nest the panel into the subdivisions of the 
divided surface (Figure 12.76). Save this panel as Limit-Panel-2.rfa.
You can now apply this nested panel into any divided surface. Download and open the 
file c12-Limit-Panel-Project.rfa from this book’s web page.

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  541  
	
8.	 In the c12-Limit-Panel-Project.rfa file, select the pattern and divided surface. From 
the Type Selector, select the name Limit-Panel-2.
Your new panel family will be listed under the pattern within which it was designed. It 
will take a few seconds for the software to replace the pattern with the real geometry of 
the panel. But observe that by nesting the panel inside other panels, you have been able to 
limit the size and variety of the panels (Figure 12.77).

nested into the divided 
surface of the host 
panel.

Using the Adaptive Component Family
So far, the examples look at using the UV grid to nest in curtain wall pattern–based families; 
however, there will be situations where you may want to manually place a panel, specifically at 
border conditions where you may need to construct custom panels. To do this, use the Adaptive 

542  | Chapter 12  Creating Walls and Curtain Walls  
Component functionality that is available to you in the pattern-based curtain panel. This func-
tionality is designed to handle cases where components need the flexibility to adapt to many 
unique, related conditions. This new functionality also addresses the problems of creating and 
placing pattern component panels (triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, and so on) on nonrectan-
gular and irregularly spaced grids. In the following exercise, you will create an adaptive panel 
and manually place it along the border of a divided surface:
	
1.	 Create a simple pattern-based curtain panel family (Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft or 
Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft) and use the rectangular grid pattern. Select each 
of the four adaptive points and notice that each point has a number from 1 to 4.
	
2.	 Select one of the points; from the Properties palette, change the Show Placement Number 
parameter to Always.
	
3.	 Select all the reference planes in the family and choose Create Form; select the Planar 
Surface option. Save this panel as My Adaptive Panel.rfa.
	
4.	 Download and open the file c12-StitchSurface-Project.rfa from this book’s web 
page.
	
5.	 Load the My Adaptive Panel.rfa family into c12-StitchSurface-Project.rfa.
Notice that in c12-StitchSurface-Project.rfa the UV grid has been enabled, as well 
as the nodes at the intersections of the UV grid (Figure 12.78). You will use these nodes to 
snap your panel.
Figure 12.78
Sample surface with 
nodes displayed
	
6.	 Locate the Families category in your Project Browser and expand the Curtain Panel tree. 
You will find the My Adaptive Panel type in this list. Drag it into the 3D view window.
	
7.	 With the panel attached at your mouse pointer, place the pointer onto one of the nodes on 
the subdivided surface to place the first point. Place the remaining points onto the corre-
sponding nodes, as shown in Figure 12.79.

Creating Complex Curtain Walls |  543  
Observe how the panel will adapt based on its placement in the surface division.
Scheduling Pattern-Based Panels
Now that you have completed the design of your pattern-based curtain wall families, you may 
want to use Revit scheduling capabilities to assess the quantity and area of panels in your con-
ceptual curtain wall system. This can be useful for calculating approximate costs at the early 
stages of design. You can schedule panels that have been applied to an in-place mass directly in 
the project environment; however, it is not possible to schedule panels in the conceptual design 
environment. You will first have to load your concept mass into a project, where you will then 
be able to schedule the panels. In this example, you will open a sample file, load it into a project, 
and then create a schedule, which will list all the panels that make up your conceptual curtain 
wall:
	
1.	 Download and open the file c12-Square-Panel-Schedule.rfa from this book’s web 
page.
	
2.	 Start a new project using either default.rte or MetricDefault.rte; then load the file 
c12-Square-Panel-Schedule.rfa into your new project.
	
3.	 From the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, click the Place Mass button and select c12-
Square-Panel-Schedule from the Type Selector. Make sure that the Place On Workplane 
icon is selected in the Placement panel, and place the massing component in the Level 1 
floor plan.
	
4.	 Open the default 3D view to view your model (Figure 12.80).
	
5.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules and then click Schedules/Quantities. 
This will open the New Schedule dialog box. Select Curtain Panels from the Category list 
and click OK.
Figure 12.79

panel into a divided

6.	 You will now define the fields that will be included within your panel schedule. Choose 
Family in the left column and click the Add button to add this field to your schedule. 
Next, add Area and then Count.
	
7.	 Click the Sorting/Grouping tab and check the options for Grand Totals and Itemize Every 
Instance.
	
8.	 Click the Formatting tab and select the Area field. Make sure the Calculate Totals option 
is selected. Do the same for Count.
	
9.	 Click OK, and your schedule will be created. If you scroll down to the bottom of the 
schedule, the total area and the number of custom panels in your conceptual curtain wall 
will be listed.

 Chapter  13 
 Modeling Floors, Ceilings, 
and roofs 
 Floors, ceilings, and roofs, which may seem like simple building components, can sometimes 
prove to be diffi cult to model and detail in your project designs. In the previous chapter, you 
learned about creating and customizing walls. Many of the objects in this chapter depend on 
walls and curtain walls to defi ne their boundaries, but both groups of object types are system 
families that use a built-up set of layers that are applied to a sketched form. Whereas walls 
mostly rely on a linear path, fl oors, ceilings, and roofs rely on a boundary sketch. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

 Understand fl oor modeling methods 
 
◆
 Model various fl oor fi nishes 
 
◆
 Create ceilings 
 
◆
 Understand roof modeling methods 
 
◆
 Work with advanced shape editing for fl oors and roofs 
 Understanding Floor types  
 Floors are likely to be one of the fi rst sketch-based elements you will encounter in Autodesk ® 
Revit ® software. Some families in the default libraries are fl oor hosted, so you must fi rst have 
a fl oor before you’ll be able to place such components. Consequently, fl oor-hosted components 
will be deleted if the fl oor that hosts them is deleted. You can fi nd a more detailed discussion on 
creating families in Chapter  14 , “Designing with the Family Editor,” but for now let’s review the 
fundamental types of fl oors that can exist in a project: a fl oor, a structural fl oor, a fl oor by face, 
and a pad. 
 Modeling a Floor  
 The traditional fl oor object is a sketch-based element that comprises any number of material lay-
ers as defi ned by the user. The top of the fl oor object is its reference with respect to the level on 
which it was created. As such, changes to a fl oor’s structure will affect its depth down and away 
from the level. You can start modeling fl oors with generic types, which contain a single layer, 
and then change the generic fl oors to more specifi c assemblies later in the development of your 
project. You can use fl oors in a variety of ways to meet the needs of a specifi c phase of design. In

early phases, for example, you can create a floor type to represent the combined floor, structure, 
plenum, and ceiling assemblies of a building. Commonly referred to as the sandwich, a sample is 
shown in Figure 13.1.
Figure 13.1
You can use a single 
floor type to show 
the entire floor/ceil-
ing sandwich in early 
design.
During intermediate phases of design, you can model ceilings so the floor types can include 
only the floor and a structural layer, as shown in Figure 13.2. Columns may be created, but more 
precise horizontal structural framing may not be modeled yet. The layer within the floor type 
represents an assumption of the maximum depth of structural framing.
Figure 13.2
This floor assembly 
includes an assump-
tion for the depth of 
structural framing.

Understanding Floor Types |  549  
In later phases of documentation approaching and including construction, floors should 
be modeled as close to actual conditions as possible. You should accommodate detailed finish 
conditions for floors as well as coordination with a resolved structural system. Accurate 
modeling of these conditions will help support consistent quantity takeoffs and interference 
detection. Figure 13.3 illustrates an example of a more accurate floor slab.
Figure 13.3
Floor assemblies for 
construction should 
be accurate and sepa-
rate from structural 
framing.
These floor assembly types are offered as suggestions for the sake of increased productiv-
ity. As such, they should be used with care, especially when performing quantity takeoffs for 
estimating. For example, the area of a floor will be the only accurate value to be extracted from 
a floor sandwich model in early design, not a volumetric material takeoff. For more information 
on the use of models by other disciplines, we recommend referring to the AIA document G202-
2013 Project BIM Protocol Form, which lists authorized uses of a model at various levels of devel-
opment. You can learn more about AIA contract documents at www.aia.org.
Collaboration and the Ownership of Floors
Whether or not you are working under an integrated project delivery (IPD) contract, the so-called 
ownership of floors should be carefully considered for the collaboration process between an architect 
and a structural engineer. Floors can be one of the most contentious elements of a building design 
because they can be simultaneously construed as architecture and structure.
The model element author (MEA) for floors should be discussed and clearly defined for each phase in 
your project BIM execution plan. Remember that element ownership can pass between the architect 
and the structural engineer when it is appropriate for a given phase. For example, the architect may 
choose to be the MEA for floors in schematic design but pass ownership to the structural engineer 
in design development and construction documentation.

550  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
With a basic understanding of floors as elements of the building, let’s look at some properties 
of floors that allow expanded uses in the project model. These properties and floor types can 
help expand your use of floor systems to create better documentation.
Creating a Structural Floor
The structural floor is similar to a traditional floor but has structural functionality, such as the 
ability to indicate span direction and to contain structural profiles. For example, you can specify 
a composite metal deck profile, which will display in sections and details generated within your 
project. You can create a structural floor by selecting the floor element and clicking the instance 
property called Structural (Figure 13.4). Because Structural is an instance property, any floor 
type can become a structural floor.
Figure 13.4
Structural parameter 
in a floor’s instance 
properties
After you select the Structural parameter check box for a floor, you can edit its type properties to 
add a structural decking layer. Let’s create a new structural floor so you can explore how this is done:
	
1.	 Open the file c13-Floors-Start.rvt or c13-Floors-Start-Metric.rvt from the 
book’s web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017), and activate the Level 3 
floor plan.
	
2.	 Go to the Architecture tab in the ribbon, and from the Build panel, select Floor ➢ Floor: 
Structural.
	
3.	 In the Draw panel of the contextual tab in the ribbon, make sure your options are set to 
Boundary Line with the Pick Walls tool, as shown in Figure 13.5.

Understanding Floor Types |  551  
	
4.	 In the Options bar, specify an offset of 0′-3″ (75 mm).
This setting will place the floor boundary just within the inner face of the curtain wall 
mullions because the location line of the curtain wall is at the center of the mullions that 
are 5″ (125 mm) deep.
	
5.	 Begin picking the exterior curtain walls by selecting one of the north-south–oriented walls first.
The first wall that you pick will determine the span direction of the structural floor. You 
can change this at any time by picking the Span Direction tool from the Draw panel and 
then selecting one of the boundary lines in the floor sketch.
	
6.	 Pick the remaining exterior walls to complete the floor boundary.
After you finish defining the boundary lines of the floor, you will create a new floor type. 
If the Properties palette isn’t open, press Ctrl+1 on the keyboard, type PP, or click the 
Properties icon in the ribbon.
	
7.	 Click Edit Type in the Properties palette. Select Generic - 12″ or Generic - 300 mm as the 
active type and click Duplicate. Name the new type Structural Slab.
	
8.	 In the Edit Type dialog box, click the Edit button in the Structure row to open the Edit 
Assembly dialog box.
	
9.	 In the Edit Assembly dialog box, find the layer of the assembly that represents the generic 
floor you duplicated. This should be row 2. Change the material of this layer to Concrete 
– Cast-In-Place Concrete and change the thickness to 0′-6″ (150 mm).
	
10.	 Select row 3 and click the Insert button. There should now be four layers. Select the new 
row 3 and set its function to Structural Deck [1].
The new Structural Deck properties appear below the layers, as shown in Figure 13.6.

11.	 The value for Deck Profile should default to Form Deck_Non-Composite: 2′ × 6″ or 
M_Form Deck_Non-Composite: 50 × 150 mm, but this depends on whether you have a 
structural deck profile loaded into your project.
If you don’t have a structural deck profile loaded, finish the floor, select the Insert tab 
of the ribbon, and click Load Family. In your default Autodesk content library, find the 
Profiles folder and open the Metal Deck subfolder. Pick an appropriate deck pro-
file and click Open to load it. Select the Structural Slab floor and click Edit Type in the 
Properties palette to continue the exercise.
	
12.	 Activate Wall Section 1 and you should see the completed slab at Level 3.
Notice that you do not see the details of the structural decking when Detail Level is set to 
Coarse.
If you activate the callout at Level 3 (Detail At Level 3), you will see the structural deck-
ing because the callout’s detail level is set to Medium. This difference is illustrated in 
Figure 13.7.

Cantilevered Metal Decking
In Figure 13.7, you can see the metal decking profile shown in a section view; however, when metal 
deck runs parallel to a support member, the decking cannot cantilever as shown by default when 
you model a floor. You must customize these slab edges in order to show a more accurate represen-
tation of the decking condition.
One easy way to accomplish this is to use the Cantilever options when you are creating or editing 
the boundary lines of the floor. If you are using a floor type that includes a Structural Deck layer, 
select any of the boundary lines and you will see Cantilever settings in the Options bar.

Understanding Floor Types |  553  
If you define the boundary line at the centerline of the supporting member, define the cantilever 
value for Steel to be 0′-0″ (0 mm) and Concrete to the value appropriate to your engineered design. 
Sometimes these values may need to be negative distances to achieve the desired cantilever condi-
tion. When you finish the sketch and observe the slab edge in a section view, you will see a more 
accurate representation of the appropriate construction technique for the floor element.

554  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
Modeling Floor by Face
This floor modeling method is used when you have generated an in-place mass or loaded a 
mass family. After you assign mass floors to a mass, you can use the floor-by-face method to 
assign and manage updates to floors, as shown in Figure 13.8. This type of face-based modeling 
is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8, “Advanced Modeling and Massing.”
Defining a Pad
A pad is technically not a floor but has properties similar to a floor. What differentiates a pad is its 
ability to cut into a toposurface or ground plane and define the lowest limits of a building’s base-
ment or cellar. If desired, you can configure the pad to represent a slab on grade, as shown in Figure 
13.9. The Pad tool can be found on the Model Site panel of the Massing & Site tab. If you don’t see 
this tab, you can access it by clicking the Application button and choosing Options ➢ User Interface.
For a more detailed exercise on creating building pads, refer to Chapter 3, “The Basics of the 
Toolbox.”

You can use the Floor 
By Face tool to manage 
slabs in more complex 
building designs.

Also notice in Figure 13.10 that the illustrated roof was generated with overhangs beyond the 
exterior faces of the walls. You can specify an overhang or offset value for a floor, ceiling, or roof 
in the Options bar before picking walls to define the sketch.
If your building design is using curtain walls, be careful with the location lines of these 
walls. The location line of a curtain wall is defined relative to the offsets specified in the mullion 
and panel families that make up the curtain wall type. As discussed in Chapter 12, “Creating 
Walls and Curtain Walls,” you have many options when defining the relative location line of 
your curtain wall types. Refer to the exercise in the section “Creating a Structural Floor” earlier 
in this chapter for an example of picking curtain walls with an offset based on a centered 
location line.
Modeling Slab Edges
Slab Edge is a tool that allows you to create thickened portions of slabs typically located at the 
boundaries of floors. A slab edge type is composed of a profile family and a material assign-
ment. It is important that the material assignment of the slab edge match that of the floor to 
Sketching for Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs
Because floors, ceilings, and roofs are sketch-based objects, the method you use when creating 
the boundary lines is critical to the behavior of the element to those around it. The recommended 
method is to use the Pick Walls option, as shown earlier in Figure 13.5.
By selecting the walls to generate the sketch for the roof, you are creating a parametric 
relationship between the walls and the roof. If the design of your building changes and the 
wall position is modified, the roof will follow that change and adjust to the new wall position 
without any intervention from you (Figure 13.10).

which you will apply the slab edge in order to ensure proper joining of geometry. Let’s explore 
the application of a slab edge to a floor at grade:
	
1.	 Open the file c13-Design-Floor.rvt from the book’s web page and activate the 3D view 
named Floors Only.
	
2.	 Click the Architecture tab in the ribbon and select Floor ➢ Slab Edge from the Build 
panel.
This tool is also available from the Structure tab.
	
3.	 If necessary, orbit the 3D view so that you can see the bottom of the lowest floor slab. Pick 
all four bottom edges of the floor slab at the level named Ground.
	
4.	 Activate the view Section 1 and you will see the slab edge applied to and joined with the 
floor, as shown in Figure 13.11.
Remember that the material in the slab edge type must match the material in the floor 
type properties for the geometry to join properly.

Making Early Design Models
When we first started implementing Revit in early phases of the design, the need to emulate 
drafting methods was readily apparent. As a design idea for a building was formulated, we would 
usually make some generic assumptions about more complex systems in order to make the overall 
design intent as clear as possible. How do you translate this so-called fuzzy design into a building 
information modeling process?
To bridge the gap between fuzzy design and a highly accurate model, we created a single floor type 
that contained assumptions not only for the floor but also for the structure and ceiling assembly 
below. This larger assembly gives a graphic emphasis to building sections without the burden of 
modeling three different systems before they are close to being resolved. The design floor type also 
gave us the opportunity to create custom slab edges that are voids instead of solids—voids that 
approximate a design for ceiling shade pockets or other interface conditions.

Modeling Slab Edges |  557  
Creating a Custom Floor Edge
You can apply a great deal of flexibility to a floor assembly in early design. As we described 
previously, you can create a floor for early design phases that accommodates the floor, structure, 
plenum, and ceiling in a single floor type. You can also apply a customized edge to this type of 
assembly for more creative soffit conditions at exterior walls, as shown in Figure 13.12.

Let’s run through a short exercise so you can practice this skill:
	
1.	 Open the file c13-Design-Floor.rvt from the book’s web page or continue with the file 
from the previous exercise and activate the view Section 1.
	
2.	 Select the floor at Level 1 and open the Properties palette. Change the type to Design

3.	 Begin a new in-place component by going to the Architecture tab and selecting 
Component ➢ Model In-Place from the Build panel.
	
4.	 Set the Family Category to Floors and specify the name as Floor Edge-L1.
You are now in Family Editing mode, and the ribbon will have different tabs and panels.
	
5.	 Click the Create tab and select Void Forms ➢ Void Sweep from the Forms panel.
	
6.	 Click the Pick Path tool from the Sweep panel and choose all four top edges at the 
perimeter of the floor at Level 1.
You can activate the 3D view Floors Only to complete the picking of all four edges, as 
shown in Figure 13.13.

7.	 Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the Mode panel when all four edges of the floor have 
been picked.
	
8.	 Open the Properties palette if it isn’t already visible.
You might need to reactivate the Select Profile mode if the Properties palette lists only 
Family: Floors. To do this, click Select Profile in the contextual tab of the ribbon.
	
9.	 In the Profile parameter, select SD Sandwich Edge : Type 1 from the drop-down list, as

Modeling Floor Finishes
You can apply floor finishes in a variety of ways. Most methods are based on the thickness of the 
finish material. For example, a thin finish such as carpet might be applied with the Split Face and 
Paint tools, whereas a thicker finish such as mortar-set stone tile might be a separate floor type.
Using a Split Face for Thin Finishes
One of the easiest ways to divide a floor surface for thin finishes is to use the Split Face and 
Paint tools. This method will require a floor to be modeled and an appropriate material defined 
with at least a surface pattern. You can schedule finishes applied with the Paint tool only 
through Material Takeoff schedules. Let’s explore this method with a quick exercise:
	
1.	 Open the file c13-Design-Floor.rvt from the book’s web page or continue with the file 
from the previous exercise and activate the Level 1 floor plan.
You will see an area of the floor that is bounded by a wall and two reference planes.
	
2.	 Click the Modify tab in the ribbon, activate the Split Face tool from the upper-right corner 
of the Geometry panel, and pick the floor in the Level 1 floor plan.
	
3.	 Draw a rectangle in front of the three interior walls, as shown in Figure 13.17.
You can constrain—or lock—the sketch lines to the interior walls, reference planes, and 
floor edge. You may do so in this exercise, but use constraints sparingly in larger projects 
to avoid slower model performance and updating calculation time.
Also notice that you generated a complete rectangular sketch instead of only three 
bounding lines. You do not need to draw the boundary line at the edge of the floor; how-
ever, if you don’t include that line and the floor shape is modified in the future, the split 
face may be deleted because it is no longer a closed-loop sketch.

boundary with the 
Split Face tool.
	
4.	 Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the Mode panel.
	
5.	 Return to the Modify tab in the ribbon and activate the Paint tool in the Geometry panel, 
just below the Split Face tool.
	
6.	 In the Material Browser, type carpet in the filter search at the top.

Modeling Thick Finishes
Thicker finish materials such as tile, stone pavers, or terrazzo can be applied as unique floor 
types and modeled where required. For large areas of finish such as a public atrium or airport 
terminal, you can assign these materials within the layers of a floor assembly. When you need 
to add smaller areas of thick floor finishes, you may encounter one of two scenarios: with a 
depressed floor and without.
In areas such as bathrooms, a thick-set tile floor may require the structural slab to be 
depressed in order to accommodate the thickness of the finish material. In Figure 13.20, the 
main floor object has been cut with an opening at the inside face of the walls. Another floor has 
been modeled with a negative offset value to accommodate the thickness of the tile material, 
and the tile has been placed as a unique floor element.
This will minimize your choices, allowing you to select Carpet Tile from the filtered list 
(Figure 13.18).

562  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
Figure 13.20
The thick tile finish 
and depressed slab are 
modeled as separate 
elements.
If you don’t need a finish but just a slab depression, you can create it with an in-place void 
extrusion. Select the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Component ➢ Model In-Place. 
Choose the Floors category and create a void extrusion where you need a slab depression. 
Remember to use the Cut Geometry tool to cut the void from the floor before finishing the fam-
ily. As an alternative, you can create a floor-based generic family that contains a parametric void 
extrusion. You can download the file c13-Slab-Depression.rfa as an example of this type of 
family from the book’s web page.
Finally, if the structural requirements allow a thick finish to be applied to a floor without 
dropping the structural slab, a finish floor element can be modeled directly in place within the 
structural slab. As shown in Figure 13.21, the tile floor has been graphically embedded in the 
structural floor using the Join Geometry tool. To do this, click the Modify tab in the ribbon and 
click Join Geometry. Be sure to pick the finish floor before the structural floor or you will get an 
error.

Creating Ceilings |  563  
Creating Ceilings
Ceilings are system families composed of sketch-based elements that also serve as hosts for 
components such as light fixtures. Like other host elements such as floors and roofs, if a ceiling 
is deleted, hosted elements on that ceiling are also deleted.
Ceilings are classified as either Basic Ceiling or Compound Ceiling. The Basic Ceiling family 
does not have a layered assembly and is represented in a section as a single line; however, it 
does have a material parameter that can display surface patterns in reflected ceiling plans and 
3D views. The Compound Ceiling family allows you to define a layered assembly of materials 
that are visible when displayed in a section view. As with floors, you can change ceiling types 
by selecting a ceiling in your project and choosing another type from the Type Selector in the 
Properties palette or with the Match Type Properties tool.
Both the Basic Ceiling and Compound Ceiling types can serve as a host to hosted family 
components. Ceilings also serve as bounding elements for the volumetric calculation of 
rooms. This is critical when using environmental analysis programs. For more information 
about analysis for sustainable design, see Chapter 9, “Conceptual Design and Design 
Analysis.”
You can create a ceiling in one of two ways: automatically or by sketching a boundary. When 
you select the ceiling tool from the Architecture tab of the ribbon, you can switch between the 
Automatic Ceiling and Sketch Ceiling modes at the right end of the ribbon.
In Automatic Ceiling mode, the software will try to determine the boundaries of a ceiling 
sketch when you place the cursor inside an enclosed space. If an enclosed space cannot be deter-
mined, the cursor will still indicate a circle/slash and you must switch to Sketch Ceiling mode. 
In this mode, you can use the Pick Walls method as discussed earlier in this chapter to create 
intelligent relationships with the bounding walls of the ceiling.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Check Your Ceiling Height
When you are using Automatic Ceiling mode, be aware of the Height Offset From Level property 
when placing a ceiling within a space. If the Height Offset From Level value is higher than the 
height of the bounding walls, the ceiling cannot be placed in the space.
Ceilings are best modeled in ceiling plans even though they can be created in a floor plan. 
When you place a ceiling, its elevation will be based on the level of the current plan with an off-
set from that level. With the Properties palette open, the Height Offset From Level value can be 
modified as you create ceilings.

Understanding Roof Modeling Methods
In today’s construction environment, roofs come in a great number of shapes and sizes. They 
can be as simple as a pitched shed roof or can involve complex double-curved surfaces or inter-
secting vaults. Once you understand the fundamental concepts, tools, and logic pertaining to 
roofs, you will be able to design almost any roof shape.
Roofs are similar to floors and ceilings because they are sketch-based elements and can 
be defined in generic types or with specific material assemblies. You can also change a roof 
element from one type to another in the same manner as you can a floor or ceiling. A fun-
damental difference between floors and roofs is that a roof’s thickness is generated above its 
referencing level, not below. You can also easily create slopes in roofs by defining slopes in the 
roof’s sketch lines.
In general, roofs can be constructed in four different ways:
◆
◆
By footprint
◆
◆
By extrusion
◆
◆
Modeled in place
◆
◆
By face
Before we start into how to create the roofs themselves, let’s take a look at some of the 
important instance properties for the roof family. These properties will need to be set 
properly to get the desired roof type, and they are all found in the Properties palette  
(Figure 13.22).
Base Level    As in other Revit elements, this is the level at which the roof is placed. The roof 
moves with this level if the level changes height.
Room Bounding    When this is checked, the roof geometry has an effect on calculating room 
area and volume.
Related To Mass    This property is active only if a roof has been created with the roof-by-
face method (Conceptual Mass tools).
Base Offset From Level    This option lowers or elevates the base of the roof relative to the 
base level.
Cutoff Level    Many roof shapes require a combination of several roofs on top of each 
other—for this you need to cut off the top of a lower roof to accommodate the creation of the 
next roof in the sequence. Figure 13.23 shows an excellent example of this technique.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Room Bounding Performance
Floors, ceilings, and roofs all have the ability to be room-bounding elements. This parameter can be 
found in the instance properties of each object. If you are not using volume calculations for rooms 
or you don’t intend to use the model for environmental analysis, you might consider turning off the 
Room Bounding parameter in horizontal objects. In larger Revit projects, unnecessary applications 
of the Room Bounding parameter may lead to reduced model performance.

566  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
Cutoff Offset    When the Cutoff tool is applied, the Cutoff Offset value also becomes active 
and allows you to set the cutoff distance from the level indicated in the Cutoff Level parameter.
Rafter Cut    This defines the eave shape. You can select from Plumb Cut, Two Cut–Plumb, 
or Two Cut–Square. When either Two Cut–Plumb or Two Cut–Square is selected, the Fascia 
Depth parameter is activated, and you can set the value for the depth.
Rafter Or Truss    With Rafter, the offset of the base is measured from the inside of the wall. 
If you choose Truss, the plate offset from the base is measured from the outside of the wall. 
Figure 13.24 illustrates the difference between the Rafter and Truss settings.

The following sections provide a closer look at the different approaches to modeling roofs.
Constructing a Roof by Footprint
Use the roof-by-footprint method to create any standard roof that more or less follows the shape 
of the footprint of the building and is a simple combination of roof pitches (Figure 13.25).
Figure 13.25

using the roof-by-
footprint method

Understanding Roof Modeling Methods |  567  
These roofs are based on a sketched shape that you define in plan view at the soffit level and 
that can be edited at any time during the development of a project from plan and axon 3D views. 
The shape can be drawn as a simple loop of lines, using the Line tool, or can be created using the 
Pick Walls method, which also should result in a closed loop of lines.
To guide you through the creation of a roof by footprint and explain some of the main 
principles and tools, we offer a brief exercise demonstrating the steps:
	
1.	 In a new project using any default template, open a Level 1 plan view and create a building 
footprint similar to Figure 13.26.
Make sure the height of the walls is set to Unconnected: 20′-0″ (6000 mm).
Figure 13.26
Sample building 
outline to be sketched 
on Level 1
	
2.	 Activate the Level 2 plan; then select the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Roof ➢ 
Roof By Footprint.
	
3.	 From the Draw panel in the Modify | Create Roof Footprint tab, select the Pick Walls tool 
(this should be the default).
	
4.	 When you’ve chosen to create a roof by footprint, the Options bar displays the following 
settings (change the Overhang value to 1′-0″ (300 mm)).
To define whether you want a sloped or flat roof, use the Defines Slope check box in the 
Options bar. The Overhang parameter allows you to define the value of the roof overhang 
beyond the wall. When the “Extend into wall (to core)” option is checked, the overhang is 
measured from the wall core. If the option is deselected, the overhang is measured from 
the exterior face of the wall.
	
5.	 After defining these settings, place the cursor over one of the walls (don’t click), and 
using the Tab key, select all connected walls.
Your display should look like Figure 13.27.

568  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
	
6.	 Select the three walls within the alcove, open the Properties palette, and uncheck the 
Defines Roof Slope parameter, as shown in Figure 13.28.
Figure 13.27
Roof sketch lines are 
automatically drawn 
after Tab+selecting the

7.	 Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the Mode panel of the ribbon. If you are prompted 
with the question, “Would you like to attach the highlighted walls to the roof?” click the 
Yes button. Activate a 3D view, and your roof should look like the image in Figure 13.25 
shown previously.
If the shape of the roof doesn’t correspond to your expectations, you can select the roof and 
select Edit Footprint from the Mode panel in the Modify | Roofs tab to return to Sketch mode, 
where you can edit lines, sketch new lines, pick new walls, or modify the slope.
To change the slope definition or angle of individual portions of the roof while editing a 
roof’s footprint, select the sketch line of the roof portion for which you want to change the slope 
and toggle (check) the Defines Slope button in the Options bar, toggle the Defines Roof Slope 
parameter in the Properties palette, or right-click and choose Toggle Slope Defining. If you 
mistakenly made all roof sides with slope but wanted to make a flat roof, you can Tab+select all 
sketch lines that form the roof shape and clear the Defines Slope box in the Options bar. You can

dynamically change the roof slope by selecting the roof and then selecting the blue grips  
(Figure 13.29) and dragging them either up or down to make the roof pitch steeper or shallower. 
This is a great way to make quick (although not precise) edits to the roof pitch.
Figure 13.29
Select the roof and 
use the blue grips to

Roof slope can be measured in two different ways: as an angle or as a percentage rise. You 
can find all slope-measuring options in the Manage tab by selecting Project Units in the Project 
Settings panel and then selecting Slope to open the Format dialog box (see Figure 13.30). If the 
current slope value is not in units you want to have (suppose it displays percentage but you 
want it to display an angle), change the slope units in the Format dialog box—you will not 
be able to do that while editing the roof slope. Setting it here means specifying the way you 
measure slopes for the entire project.

Applying a Roof by Extrusion
The roof by extrusion method is best applied for roof shapes that are generated by extrusion of 
a profile, such as sawtooth roofs, barrel vaults, and waveform roofs. Like the roof-by-footprint 
method, it is based on a sketch; however, the sketch that defines the shape of the roof is drawn 
in elevation or section view (not in plan view) and is then extruded along the plan of the build-
ing (see Figure 13.31).
Figure 13.31
An extruded 
spline-shaped roof
Roofs by extrusion do not have an option to follow the building footprint, but that is often 
needed to accommodate the requirements of the design. To accomplish this, you can use the 
Vertical Opening tool to trim the edges of an extruded roof relative to the building outline.
Let’s briefly review the concept behind the Vertical Opening tool: You create a roof by 
extrusion by defining a profile in elevation or 3D that is then extruded above the building. The 
extrusion is usually based on a work plane that is not perpendicular to the building footprint, 
as shown in Figure 13.32. If the shape of the building is nonrectangular in footprint or the shape 
of the roof you want to create is not to be rectangular, this tool will let you carve geometry from 
the roof to match the footprint of the building or get any plan shape you need using a plan 
sketch.

With sketch-based design, any closed loop of lines creates a positive shape; every loop inside 
it is negative, the next one inside that negative one will be positive, and so on. In Figure 13.33, a 
roof by extrusion was drawn at an angle to the underlying walls, but the final roof shape should 

Understanding Roof Modeling Methods |  571  
be limited to a small offset from the walls. To clip the roof to the shape of the building footprint, 
the Vertical Opening tool was used to draw, in plan view of the roof, a negative shape that will 
remove the portions of the roof that extend beyond the walls.

The Vertical Opening 
tool with two sketch 
loops trims the roof to 
the inner loop.
Roof In-place
The roof in-place technique accommodates roof shapes that cannot be achieved with either of 
the previously mentioned methods. It is the usual way to model historic roof shapes or challeng-
ing roof geometries such as those illustrated in Figure 13.34. The figure shows a barrel roof with 
a half dome (Extrusion + 1/2 Revolve), a dome roof (Revolve only or Revolve + Extrusion), and a 
traditional Russian onion dome (Revolve only).

Examples of modeled 
in-place roofs
To create an in-place roof, select the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Component ➢ 
Model In-Place from the Build panel. Select Roofs from the Family Category list and click OK. 
While you remain in the In-Place Family editing mode, you can create any roof shape using 
solids and voids of extrusions, blends, revolves, sweeps, and swept blends (Figure 13.35). More 
advanced editing techniques are discussed later in this chapter, in the section “Using Advanced 
Shape Editing with Floors and Roofs.”

Creating a Roof by Face
The Roof By Face tool is to be used when you have created an in-place mass or loaded a mass 
family. These types of roofs are typically more integrated with the overall building geometry 
than the examples we’ve shown for in-place roofs. You can find more detailed information about 
using face-based methods in Chapter 8.
Creating a Sloped Glazing
In Chapter 12, you learned that a curtain wall is just another wall type made out of panels and 
mullions organized in a grid system. Similarly, sloped glazing is just another type of a roof that 
has glass as material and mullions for divisions. Using sloped glazing, you can make roof lights 
and shed lights and use them to design simple framing structures.
To create sloped glazing, make a simple pitched roof, select it, and use the Properties palette 
to change the type to Sloped Glazing (see Figure 13.36).

Once you have done that, activate a 3D view and use the Curtain Grid tool from the Build 
panel of the Architecture tab in the ribbon to start applying horizontal or vertical grids that 
define the panel sizes; then you can apply mullions using the Mullion tool in the Build panel. 
Figure 13.37 illustrates an example of a standard gable roof that has been converted to sloped 
glazing. Refer to Chapter 12 for more information on using the Curtain Grid and Mullion tools.

and assigning grids 
and mullions.
Using Slope Arrows
If your design calls for a sloped roof with an unusual footprint that does not easily lend itself 
to using the Defines Slope property of boundary lines, slope arrows can be added within the 
sketch of the roof. First, create the sketch lines to define the shape of a roof, but don’t check 
Defines Slope in the Options bar. Instead, choose the Slope Arrow tool from the Draw panel. 
Draw the slope arrow in the direction you want your roof to pitch. Select the arrow, and in the 
Properties palette, you can set any of the parameters, as shown in Figure 13.38. The Specify 
parameter can be set to either Height At Tail or Slope. If you choose Height At Tail, be sure to 
specify the Height Offset At Head parameter as the end result of the desired slope.

Using Additional Roof Tools
The following three roof tools (Figure 13.39) can be found under the Roof flyout:
◆
◆
Roof : Soffit
◆
◆
Roof : Fascia
◆
◆
Roof : Gutter
Each of these tools behaves in a similar fashion—it uses a profile that is swept along the edge 
of the roof.
Figure 13.39
Edge condition roof 
tools
The difference between these tools is fairly simple. The Soffit tool will sweep a profile to the 
underside of a roof overhang parallel to the ground. The Fascia tool will sweep a profile along 
the vertical face of the roof edge, and the Gutter tool will sweep a profile along one of the edges 
of the roof. Try these tools on the roofs you’ve created in this chapter to better understand how 
they react to roof conditions. You can see how the Gutter tool looks using the default profile in 
Figure 13.40.
Figure 13.40
The Gutter tool
Don’t feel you’re limited to residential uses with these tools—as an example, the Gutter 
tool can be used to create a break metal cap for a flat roof parapet. Do be careful when you are 
picking an edge to apply the Gutter tool. The best approach is to pick in-plan views because 
the Gutter tool will default to the lower of the two edges so your gutters will be all placed at a 
consistent level.

Creating a Dormer Step by Step
Roofs with dormers generally cause grief for architects, so we’ll guide you through the creation 
of one:
	1.	 Create the base of a building, set up three levels, and create a roof by footprint with Defines Slope 
checked for all sides.
	2.	 Approximately in the position indicated in the following illustration, on Level 2 create the four 
walls of a dormer. Set their height to a value that makes them extend above the roof.
For easier verification, create a cross section through the dormer to check the height of the 
dormer walls and, if necessary, modify their height in the Properties palette so that they 
extend above the roof.
	3.	 Using the Roof By Footprint tool, create a pitched roof on top of the dormer walls.
	4.	 If you switch to a side elevation view, you will notice that the dormer roof probably does not extend 
to meet the main roof, so you will need to use the Join/Unjoin Roof tool, located in the Modify 
tab in the Edit Geometry panel, to join the main roof and the dormer. Select the Join/Unjoin Roof 
tool, select the main roof as the target, and then select the edge of the dormer roof to extend it.
Continues

576  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
	5.	 From the Opening panel on the Architecture tab, select Dormer. Now pick first the main roof 
and then the dormer roof, and then select the sides of the walls that define the dormer. Select the 
inside faces of the walls.
Unlike most sketches, you will not need to provide a closed loop of lines in this case. Finish 
the dormer opening.
	6.	 Finally, go back to the section view you previously created and edit the elevation profile of the side 
walls to make sure they don’t extend below or above the roofs.
You should not use the Top/Base Attach tool for tricky modeling scenarios such as the roof dor-
mer, as the attachment may fail. Instead, select the wall and use the Edit Profile tool available 
in the Mode panel of the Modify | Walls tab to edit its elevation profile and manually resketch 
the edge lines of the walls to get the triangular elevation profile as shown.
As a final option, you can convert the front wall of the dormer to a storefront wall type or add 
a window.

Using Advanced Shape Editing with Floors and Roofs
No flat roof is ever really flat! Fortunately there are tools that allow you to model tapered insula-
tion over a flat roof and similar conditions to give the roof a small pitch. These powerful tools 
are modifiers that are applicable to roofs and floors and will allow you to model concrete slabs 
with multiple slopes for sidewalks or roof assemblies with tapered insulation (see Figure 13.41).
Figure 13.41
Roof with sloped 
drainage layer
The set of tools available for editing floor and roof shapes appears in the ribbon when you 
select a flat floor or roof. If the Reset Shape command is inactive, that means the selected ele-
ment has not been modified with the shape editing tools.
Let’s look at what each tool does:

578  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
Modify Sub Elements    This tool allows you to directly edit element geometry by selecting 
and modifying points and edges. If you don’t create any additional points or split lines before 
activating this tool, the object’s outer edges and corners will be available for editing.
Add Point    This tool allows you to add points on the top face of a roof or floor. Points can 
be added on edges or surfaces and can be modified after placement using the Modify Sub 
Elements tool.
Add Split Line    This tool allows you to sketch directly on the top face of the element, which 
adds vertices so that hips and valleys can be created when the elevations of the lines are 
modified using the Modify Sub Elements tool.
Pick Supports    This tool allows you to pick linear beams and walls in order to create new 
split edges and set the slope and/or elevation of the floor or roof automatically.
Once a floor or roof has been modified using any of these tools, the Reset Shape button will become 
active. You can use this tool to remove all modifications you applied to the selected floor or roof.
Creating a Roof with a Sloped Topping
Let’s work through an exercise that shows you how to make a roof with a sloped topping like 
the one shown in Figure 13.42 (shown in plan view).
Figure 13.42
A roof plan show-
ing a roof divided 
in segments, with 
drainage points
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open c13-Roof-Edit.rvt or c13-Roof-Edit-Metric.rvt from the book’s web page. 
Activate the Roof floor plan.
	
2.	 Select the roof that has already been prepared for you.
	
3.	 Activate the Add Split Line tool (the color of the rest of the model grays out while the roof 
lines are dashed green).
	
4.	 Sketch two ridge lines to divide the roof into three areas that will be independently 
drained.
The ridge lines will be drawn in blue.
	
5.	 Using the same tool, draw diagonal lines within those areas to create the valleys.

Using Advanced Shape Editing with Floors and Roofs |  579  
Make sure you zoom in closely when drawing the diagonal lines, and be sure that you 
are snapping in the exact same dividing points. (If you notice that the split lines are not 
snapped to the correct points, select the Modify Sub Elements tool, pick the incorrect 
lines, delete them, and try again.)
You have split the roof surface into many regions, but they are still all at the same height 
and pitch. You should have a roof that looks like Figure 13.43.
Press the Esc key or click the Modify button to stop the editing mode.
Figure 13.43
Using the Add Split 
Line tool, you can 
create ridges and 
valleys.
	
6.	 Switch to a 3D view.
	
7.	 To add a slope, you need to edit the height of the drainage points or the heights of the 
edges and ridges created by the split lines. For this exercise, you will raise the elevation of 
the boundary edges and ridges. Activate the Modify Sub Elements tool and select an edge 
of the roof (dashed green line). New controls that allow you to edit the text will appear, 
and you can either move the arrows up and down or type in a value for the height. Type 
in 1′-0″ (300 mm).
	
8.	 Repeat step 7 for all boundary edges and the two north-south split lines forming the 
ridges between the drainage areas.
	
9.	 Make a section through the roof—if possible, somewhere through one of the drainage 
points. Open the section; change Detail Level to Fine to see all layers.
The entire roof structure is now sloped toward the drainage point.
Applying a Variable Thickness to a Roof Layer
What if you wanted the insulation to be tapered but not the structure? For that, the layers of the 
roofs can now have variable thickness. Let’s see how to apply a variable thickness to a layer of 
the roof assembly.
	
1.	 Continuing with the c13-Roof-Edit.rvt or c13-Roof-Edit-Metric.rvt file from the 
previous exercise, select the roof, and in the Properties palette select Edit Type to view the 
roof’s type properties. Click Edit in the Structure row to edit the layers of the roof assembly.

580  | Chapter 13  Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs   
	
2.	 Activate the preview. You will notice that in the roof-structure preview, you do not see 
any slopes. That is correct and will not change. This preview is just a schematic preview 
of the structure and does not show the exact sloping. Look for the Variable column under 
Layers, as shown in Figure 13.44. This allows layers of the roof to vary in thickness when 
slopes are present. Check the Variable option for the insulation material.
Figure 13.44
Specify variable lay-
ers of material in the 
Edit Assembly dialog 
box.
	
3.	 Go back to the section view and observe the changes in the roof assembly.
As you can see, only the insulation is tapered, while the structure remains flat.
You will only be able to modify an adjustable layer of a floor or roof with a negative value to 
the next nonadjustable layer of the assembly. In the previous exercise, for example, if you modi-
fied the drainage points by more than –0′-5″ (–130 mm), an error would be generated, and the 
edits to the roof would be removed. You must think about the design requirements of your roof 
or floor assembly when planning how to model adjustable layers. An alternative approach to the 
previous exercise might have been to increase the thickness of the insulation layer in the roof 
assembly to that required at the high pitch points. The drainage points could then be lowered 
relative to the boundary edges and ridge lines.

 Chapter  14 
 Designing with the Family Editor 
 In previous chapters, we discussed the modeling techniques for system families such as walls, 
roofs, fl oors, and ceilings. Although system families are essentially rule-based assemblies 
applied to sketch-based forms, component families are more self-contained. Another way to 
explain the difference is that system families are the objects you usually quantify in terms 
of linear units, surface area, or volume, whereas component families are most often counted 
objects. Such families include doors, windows, furniture, light fi xtures, plumbing fi xtures, spe-
cialty equipment, and so on. 
 In Autodesk ® Revit ® software, the Family Editor is where you’ll create these component fami-
lies. If you’re familiar with other 3D modeling applications, the good news is that it will be easy 
to get started. But the really great news is that if you’ve never modeled in 3D, learning to create 
3D content for the fi rst time in Revit is a very satisfying process. 
 So relax, and prepare yourself for getting excited about design. Once you understand how 
to create parametric content in the Family Editor, you’ll probably realize you can do anything 
in Revit. We’ll begin this chapter by discussing some of the general topics that are important to 
understand about the Family Editor and creating component families. Then you will use some 
of this knowledge to create your own component family in a detailed exercise. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

◆
 Create the framework for a family component 
 
◆
 Understand family modeling techniques 
 
◆
 Apply extended family management techniques 
 Getting Started with a Family 
 Many generic 3D modeling applications allow you to create content that can be used in design-
ing your buildings, and modeling in 3D is certainly a big part of the Family Editor. But the key 
to the Family Editor is that you’re not just modeling but also modeling something specifi c. The 
thing that you’re trying to design is meant to be a particular thing and behave in a particular 
way. 
 So when you’re modeling in the Family Editor, you’re not just trying to model  how and  what 
something is but also trying to predict how it might change. Anticipating change is essential to 
creating great, fl exible content that is able to quickly and easily refl ect your design changes. 

584  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
For example, take a simple table. If you were to model this table in a program like Rhino, 
what you’d have when you’ve finished is exactly what you’ve modeled. But think about the 
design process and how often during design you’ll need to iterate something like height, length, 
width, or material. In the real world, each of these parameters is critical. Suppose you have only 
three options for each of these values—this results in 81 permutations! Who has time to manu-
ally create each of these options? But this is what you’d have to do if you were using a generic 
modeler rather than Revit, where these options are driven by rules. By using parameters to 
define dimensions, materials, nested elements, and more, you can create additional permuta-
tions on the fly.
Understanding In-place Families
In the previous chapter, you learned how to create an in-place void family in order to custom-
ize the edge of a floor slab. Although some truly unique content in your project can be modeled 
using in-place families, it is often a dead-end process that robs you of hours of otherwise pro-
ductive time for a number of reasons.
First, an in-place family should be used only in cases where the object that you’re making is 
not likely to be moved, rotated, or copied. Any attempt to move, rotate, or copy an in-place fam-
ily can often have unintended consequences that are difficult to remedy. For example, if you 
model an in-place family and then create copies in your project, they may all initially look the 
same, but in fact you’re creating new unique families—not just copied instances of the same 
family. Therefore, if you modify one of the copied instances of an in-place family, the other copy 
will remain unchanged.
Second, each copied instance will schedule independently from the other instances as sepa-
rate line items. This is often not desirable because you may want to group like elements together 
in a schedule.
Finally, there’s no way to convert an in-place family into a component family. In some cases, 
you can copy and paste sketch lines or other 2D elements between the project and family envi-
ronments. But if you try to copy and paste geometry from the project environment to the Family 
Editor, you’ll get an error stating that you can’t copy between family and project. The only way 
to proceed is to start again in the Family Editor.
Because of these reasons, it is common practice to create in-place families only for conditions 
that are one-offs, and it is advantageous to model the element in context to the overall design 
considerations within the project file. An example of this could be a solitary custom reception 
desk that incorporates its design aesthetics in the surrounding lobby or a unique sculptural ele-
ment that is part of the environment.
Content Guidelines and Standards
Before you begin to create your own custom content, you should be aware of the vast number of 
online content providers in the AEC industry. As of this writing, there are over 1000 building prod-
uct manufacturers providing Revit families. There are also over 20 online content-hosting providers 
such as Autodesk Seek, RevitCity, National BIM Library, BIMstore, and ARCAT BIM Objects (just 

Getting Started with a Family |  585  
Choosing the Right Family Template and Category
The first thing you’ll want to consider in creating a component family is to determine what 
kind of component you want to build—in other words, you need to select an appropriate cat-
egory. As we discuss in various chapters throughout this book, there are many predefined 
categories within a Revit project. You can create a new family from the Application menu by 
clicking New ➢ Family. This command will open a dialog box where you can choose from a 
vast selection of family templates (Figure 14.1). Templates for component families use the RFT 
file format.

to name a few). Because most of these providers offer content for free, how can you be sure that the 
content you download will be usable or will support extended interoperability and collaboration?
A few of the content-aggregating sites offer content standards or guidelines. One example can be 
found on the Autodesk® Seek site:
http://seek.autodesk.com
In the “For Manufacturers” Area, click on Resources and you will find the Revit Model Content 
Style Guide. The Style Guide contains very detailed information, including standardized shared 
parameters, model-object subcategories, and naming conventions. These guidelines are quite thor-
ough, but they only ensure that content is consistent when it is hosted and downloaded from the 
Autodesk Seek site. There are no international, platform-independent content standards to help 
you develop content that will offer maximum potential for data interoperability. That said, efforts 
are under way within the buildingSMART International community (www.buildingsmart.org) 
to help set a standard in the future.
Figure 14.1
Select a family 
template to begin 
creating a component 
family.

586  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
From the New Family dialog box, select Generic Model.rft or Metric Generic Model.rft 
and then click Open. (If you can’t find either template file, you can download them from this 
book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.) Selecting the right family tem-
plate is important because it determines a lot of the family’s behavior. For example, a baluster 
template contains default datum objects that relate to the geometry of a railing (Figure 14.2).
Figure 14.2
A baluster family template 
contains predefined datum 
objects to manage the geo-
metric behavior.
Aside from some specific cases like balusters, the family template’s primary function is to 
assign a category. In some cases, you can change the category of the family after it has been 
­created. In the family you just started to create, switch to the Properties panel in the Create tab 
in the ribbon, and then click the Family Category and Parameters button.
In the dialog box shown in Figure 14.3, you will see that this Generic Models family is capa-
ble of being assigned to another category. This is helpful if you need to schedule a family in a 
category different from the one you initially selected. But in many cases, categories cannot be 
switched, and hosted or face-based components cannot be changed to unhosted (and vice versa). 
It is also difficult to convert a family that has many modeled elements to another category 
because you may be forced to reassign all the modeled elements to new subcategories.
Some categories are hardwired for specific behavior, and if you change from one such cat-
egory to another, you can’t go back. For example, if you start a family in one of the baluster 
templates, you can switch to another category. But after having done so, you cannot switch the 
family back to being a baluster. Knowing what you want to create before you begin helps you 
minimize the amount of switching you need to do later in the process.
You should become familiar with the following characteristics that relate to a family’s 
assigned category.
Scheduling
Remember that as you start a new component, the category you select controls how the family 
component will schedule. For example, you wouldn’t select the Furniture category to develop 
a family that you want to schedule as a plumbing fixture. Most of the categories you will use 

Getting Started with a Family |  587  
as you develop custom content will be self-explanatory; however, there may be some building 
elements for which you may need to think about categorization. One example is a vertical circu-
lation component such as an elevator or escalator. You might select the Specialty Equipment cat-
egory, but that category does not allow the geometry to be cut in a plan or section view. Perhaps 
you would use the Generic Models category instead, but you would need to use other parameters 
to schedule these types of families separately from other generic model families in your project.
Figure 14.3
Switching between 
family categories
Using Projection and Cut Values
Another important characteristic of the family category is that it will control whether a family 
will “cut” when intersecting a view plane (plan, section, elevation, and so on). For example, con-
vention dictates that when furniture encounters a cut plane, you should show a projected view 
rather than a sectional view.
Revit respects this convention by cutting some categories while not cutting others. You can 
figure out which categories cut or don’t cut by going to the Manage tab and clicking Object 
Styles. As you can see, categories such as Casework, Ceilings, and Columns have line weight 
values in the Cut column, whereas categories such as Electrical Equipment, Furniture, and 
Lighting Fixtures do not.
Assigning Parameters
As you start to get into the parameters that can control a family’s geometry, material, or other 
value, keep in mind that it’s not always necessary to create components as fully parametric. This 

588  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
is especially true of the first pass. The location and spacing of content are often more important 
than whether the family can flex geometrically.
Nonparametric families often occur when the component being modeled is specific and 
highly unique. It may have parameters that control materials or a few other values, but not much 
more. At this point, little more than selecting the right category and insertion point is necessary. 
It’s often far more efficient to maintain design relationships by modifying the component in 
the Family Editor and then reloading it into the project—at least until more is known about the 
design. When more is known, you can open the family and embed more parameters.
Choosing between Hosted and Nonhosted Family Types
The next important question you need to ask yourself as you select your family template is 
whether the family is meant to be hosted or nonhosted. If you make the wrong decision here, 
you’ll have to start over to switch between these types. To identify the difference between hosted 
and nonhosted family types, examine the family templates shown previously in Figure 14.1. Some 
of the filenames are indicated as “ceiling based” or “wall based.” These templates are used to 
­create hosted families. Most of the other templates such as Casework.rft, Furniture.rft, Metric 
Casework.rft, Metric Furniture.rft, and Metric Generic Model.rft are nonhosted.
First, keep in mind that hosted objects are meant to cut or create an opening or depression 
in their host. Obviously, a window needs to cut the wall into which it will be placed, or a fire 
extinguisher case will often need to generate a recess in the host wall. Second, if the component 
is to be hosted and you’re certain that it needs to create an opening in its host, it can cut only one 
type of host. For example, a lighting fixture that is wall-based may not be hosted by a ceiling.
Want to see a bad example of this? Download and open the Tub-Rectangular-3D.rfa family 
from this book’s web page (Figure 14.4).
Figure 14.4
Wall-hosted plumbing 
fixtures
What’s wrong with this picture? First, this tub is wall hosted and not all tubs need walls, so 
you’ll have to make another family that has no host in order to place the tub where there is no 
wall. This seems a bit redundant because one tub will do.

Getting Started with a Family |  589  
Second, if you delete a host, all the hosted elements are deleted as well. This makes some 
sense when you delete a wall that hosts windows or doors. But it will certainly lead to a lot of 
frustration if you delete a wall that hosts bathroom fixtures!
We can’t stress this enough: As a best practice, avoid creating hosted relationships between 
objects that do not require hosting (that do not cut or otherwise modify the host). This discus-
sion brings up an interesting point. Rather than use hosted elements, why not make elements 
face-based? There are some advantages:
◆
◆
You don’t have to decide on a particular host. Any surface will do: Wall, Ceiling, Top of 
Casework, anything that has a face. This is great if the lighting component you’re creating 
needs to cut into a wall, floor, and ceiling!
◆
◆
A face-based element can cut the face of geometry in both the project and family editing 
environment. So the light fixture that cuts a wall in a project can cut the face of a piece of 
casework in the Family Editor.
◆
◆
Deleting the host will not delete the component. Is this desirable? Maybe sometimes, but 
not always. What’s important is that you have the option if the component is face-based. 
You won’t have the option if the component is hosted.
◆
◆
You can place face-based families on host elements from a linked project model. This 
works great when an architectural model is linked into an engineer’s model for placement 
of electrical or plumbing fixtures.
Creating Other Types of Families in the Family Editor
Now that you understand the importance of selecting between a hosted and a nonhosted family 
template, you should become familiar with some other types of families you can create in the 
Family Editor.
Placing Line-Based Components
This is a less common type of family that allows you to place components in the project environ-
ment as lines. Line-based families can take advantage of line-based tools such as Trim/Extend 
and Split and can also support parametric arrays.
Generic model, detail item, and structural stiffener are the only family categories currently 
available to be used as a line-based component. An example of one is a generic model created by 
Steve Stafford for his Revit OpEd blog (Figure 14.5). This family is used to lay out egress paths 
and then calculate the total travel distance in a schedule. You can download this family here:

Using Detail Components
Some types of families consist of only 2D elements—these are called detail components. They 
are most often used in drafting views; however, detail components can also be placed in plan, 
elevation, and section views. The benefit of using detail components, as compared to individual 
lines and filled regions, is that a detail component can be reused many times, thus increasing 
drafting productivity; quality is increased by allowing control of repetitive detail elements and 
they support keynote and tagging abilities. We discuss detail components further in Chapter 16, 
“Detailing Your Design.”
Placing Annotation Symbols
Much like detail components, annotation symbols are families that contain only 2D graphics, 
including lines, text, and fill or masking regions. They are different from detail components 
because annotation symbols will react to the scale of the view in which they are placed. Aside 
from the common uses of annotation symbols such as tags, north arrows, or graphic scales, you 
can nest annotation symbols in other types of model families to customize and better manage 
your approach to project documentation. Consider some of the families for electrical terminal 
fixtures in the default library. These families include a 3D representation of a small element, 
such as a receptacle plate that will be seen in an elevation view, but they also include a generic 
annotation to represent the object with a scaled symbol in a plan view, as shown in Figure 14.6.
Figure 14.6

illustrating a nested 
annotation symbol
In Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards,” we showed you how to build custom 
annotation symbols for use in your own projects or templates.
Creating Mass Families
Mass families are special components that are created in a slightly different environment of the 
Family Editor called the conceptual design environment (CDE). Within this environment, you use 
tools to sketch lines that are used to generate forms almost automatically. As shown in Figure 14.7, 
the line tools in the ribbon of the CDE allow you to sketch first, select lines, and then use the 
Create Form button. After a form has been created, it can be subdivided for additional articulation.
Figure 14.7

the conceptual design 
environment

Getting Started with a Family |  591  
Using Mass Families with an Application
We discuss using mass families with greater detail in Chapter 8, “Advanced Modeling and 
Massing.” If you have an Apple iPad or Android tablet, you might also want to experiment 
with the free Autodesk® FormIt mobile application. It’s also available as a web application here: 
http://formit360.autodesk.com. With this design application, you can quickly generate and 
study forms—including the ability to analyze gross floor area and shadows (Figure 14.8). When 
the app synchronizes with your Autodesk® A360 cloud account, it will automatically convert the 
designs to RVT project files where the modeled geometry is represented as in-place masses.
Figure 14.8
The Autodesk FormIt 
application can be 
used to generate 
mass forms.
Using Adaptive Components
Finally, a special type of dynamic family that is used in the CDE is known as an adaptive com-
ponent. These families are an adaptation of the pattern-based curtain panel concept, but you 
can use them in geometry other than divided surfaces. You can learn more about creating and 
using adaptive components in Chapter 12, “Creating Walls and Curtain Walls,” and Chapter 9, 
“Conceptual Design and Design Analysis.”
Understanding the Family Editor
The Family Editor isn’t a different software application that you need to install. It is simply a 
unique mode within Revit that has tools and commands specifically designed to create com-
ponent content. After you launch the command to make a new family and you choose a fam-
ily template, you will enter the Family Editor. If you happen to have a project file open, you 
can switch back and forth between a family file and the project just the same way you’d toggle 
between the open views of a project.

592  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
Depending on the type of family you are building, the Create tab in the ribbon will have 
slightly different tools. In this chapter, you will be using the Furniture family template, and the 
Create tab will have specific 3D modeling tools, as shown in Figure 14.9.
Figure 14.9
The Create tab for 
model families
If you were creating a detail component or annotation family, neither of which can con-
tain 3D geometry, the Create tab displays only 2D tools such as Line, Filled Region, and Label 
(Figure 14.10).
Figure 14.10
The Create tab for 
detail and annotation 
families
Within the Family Editor, you also have the ability to include imported CAD data. From the 
Insert tab in the ribbon, you can use the Import CAD tool to utilize 2D or 3D information from 
another source. You cannot use the Link CAD tool in the Family Editor; therefore, any data 
imported to a family will not update if the original CAD file is changed.
A feature in Revit is the ability to explode and then manipulate imported 3D solid CAD 
geometry. You can experiment with this feature by downloading the file ImportCAD.sat from 
this book’s web page.
Switch to the Insert tab, click the Import CAD tool, and then browse to the location where you 
downloaded the sample SAT file. You’ll have to change the Files Of Type drop-down list to ACIS 
SAT Files. Use the default settings and click Open. After the model has loaded, go to the default 
3D view and press ZF for the Zoom To Fit command. Select the imported geometry, and from the 
contextual tab in the ribbon choose Explode ➢ Full Explode. Select the solid geometry again, and 
you’ll notice that the imported model is now ready to be manipulated with a series of grip controls 
(Figure 14.11). Delete the imported geometry before continuing with the exercise in this chapter.
Another tab in the Family Editor that might seem familiar is the Annotate tab. Here you will 
find tools for dimensions, symbolic lines, and text. In a model component, dimensions and text 
placed in the Family Editor are not visible when the family is loaded and placed in a project. 
Although text can be used for reference notes in the Family Editor, dimensions are used to control 
and drive the geometry. You’ll learn much more about parametric dimensions later in this chapter.
The tools in the Detail panel of the Annotate tab in the ribbon allow you to create some 2D 
geometry within a 3D family. This is especially useful if you have a somewhat complex model 
that you would like to display as a simplified graphic in a plan view. For example, you may 
have a detailed 3D model of a bathroom water closet (toilet) fixture. If such a model was com-
posed of complex curved surfaces and solids, displaying many of these components in a project 
view might ultimately begin to degrade visual performance. Instead, the 3D geometry can be 

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  593  
assigned to not display in a plan view, while you include a simple sketch of the fixture in the 
plan view of the family. Your renderings, sections, and elevations will display the 3D family 
geometry, while your plan views will remain simple and fast.
Figure 14.11
Imported solid geom-
etry can be exploded 
and manipulated.
One final aspect to understand about the Family Editor is its ability to use multiple views to 
visualize your design. Similar to the project environment, it lets you create as many views as 
you need to help visualize the content in your family. The Ref. Level plan view can be dupli-
cated if you need to examine your family at different elevations. Simply change the View Range 
properties of each plan view to control the height of the view’s cut plane. From the View tab in 
the ribbon, you can also create camera views and sections within the family.
Developing the Framework for a Family Component
Now that we’ve discussed some of the basic definitions and rules of the Family Editor, we’ll talk 
about the hierarchy of creating a family component.
In this section you will work through the fundamentals of creating a family in terms of 
datum objects, constraints, parameters, materials, subcategories, and visibility settings. Later in 
the chapter, you will learn more advanced modeling and parametric techniques.
Click the Application menu and then select New ➢ Family. Use the Furniture.rft or Metric 
Furniture.rft family template, which is available for download with this chapter’s exercise 
files from the book’s web page.
Creating the Necessary Reference Planes, Lines, and Points
In the project environment, datum objects are available for you to control and manage the loca-
tion and behavior of modeled geometry. In previous chapters, we discussed the use of grids, 
levels, and reference planes, but these data are also extremely important in a component family. 

594  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
When used in the Family Editor, reference planes, lines, and points will function as the skeleton 
for the solid and void geometry you build.
To be clear about the usage of datum objects in families, they are not required to construct 
geometry; however, if you’re confident that what you’re about to model in the Family Editor will 
need to flex (have a modifiable length, angle, location, and so on) from within the rules of the 
family, then it’s important that you begin by first creating the rules that will allow the geometry 
to move.
With few exceptions, you don’t want to give parameters to the geometry itself. Instead, you’ll want 
to create the necessary reference planes, lines, and points first. Then associate the parameters 
to these references and whenever possible test the parameters to make sure the references are 
flexing properly. Once you’re confident the references are flexing, you can build the geometry in 
context to the references, again testing to make certain that when the references flex, the geom-
etry is flexing as well.
The type of datum object you use is based on how you want the geometry to flex:
Reference Planes    These define a single plane that can be set to host sketch lines or geom-
etry. They’re best for controlling linear geometric relationships—that is to say, geometry that 
will flex in a linear fashion. Reference planes don’t have endpoints. This is important because 
you don’t want to use reference planes for controlling angular or directional relationships.
As illustrated in the plan view of the Desk.rfa family, the linear parameters of Depth and 
Width are appropriately assigned to reference planes. All of these geometric constraints are 
parallel to one another (Figure 14.12).
Figure 14.12
Reference planes 
controlling the 
parameters of the 
default Desk.rfa 
family
Reference Lines    By definition these datum objects have endpoints and are great for con-
trolling angular and directional relationships. They can have four axes of reference, two 
along the length of the line (which are perpendicular to each other) and one at each end that 
is perpendicular to the line.

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  595  
You can also create curved reference lines, but they have only planes that may be used 
for hosting at each end. There are no references along the curved line, as shown in  
Figure 14.13.
Figure 14.13
Straight and curved 
reference lines
As an example, reference lines can be established in a family with length and angular dimension 
parameters to control path geometry for sweeps such as the iterations shown in Figure 14.14.
Figure 14.14
Sweep geometry using 
reference lines
Reference Points    This type of datum object is available only in certain family templates, 
including Mass, Generic Model Adaptive, Generic Model-Pattern Based, and Curtain 
Panel-Pattern Based. Reference points have three planes that can be set to host sketch 
lines or geometry. You can also use a series of points to control a line or even a spline. 
Other objects, such as reference lines or other geometric surfaces, can also host reference 
points. You can select reference points from the Draw panel in the ribbon as shown in 
Figure 14.15.

596  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
Setting the Behavior of Reference Planes and Lines
When you place a new reference plane or line or select one already in your family, you will 
notice a property in the Properties palette called Is Reference. This setting is an important factor 
in how the family will behave when it is placed in a project. It affects how you can dimension or 
align to the family as follows:
◆
◆
Not A Reference—The reference will be used only to control geometry in the Family Editor.
◆
◆
Weak Reference—The reference can be accessed for measurement in the project environ-
ment only by pressing the Tab key on the keyboard.
◆
◆
Strong Reference—The reference has the highest priority for dimensions and alignment. 
Temporary dimensions are displayed at the strong reference data.
In the Family Editor, reference planes also have other available values for the Is Reference 
property including Top, Back, Bottom, Left, Right, and Front. These values are all strong refer-
ences and are provided to help you better organize your family geometry.
You will also notice that symbolic lines have a property called Reference with settings identi-
cal to those for the Is Reference property of reference planes and reference lines. We recommend 
that you treat symbolic lines with the same care as the datum objects.
Use the strong and weak references sparingly throughout your family. The default setting for 
the Is Reference property is Weak Reference; therefore, there could be a large number of possi-
bilities for measurement within every component in your project. For every strong or weak refer-
ence, Revit must analyze the reference when you are annotating or designing.
Setting the Insertion Point
After you’ve chosen an appropriate family template, the rest is pretty flexible. If you make any 
mistakes, you’ll probably be able to recover most if not all of your work to correct the problem. 
But some considerations should come before others, which is why we believe that the insertion 
point is the next most critical criterion on your list for family creation.
First, the insertion point determines the location about which the family will geometrically 
flex. But second (and often more important), the insertion point is the point of reference when 
two family components are exchanged. This is critical if the “design” family that you’ve used as 
a placeholder is being swapped out for something more specific at a later date. If the insertion 
points are not established similarly between families, the location of the new family will not 
agree with the location of the old one.
Figure 14.15
Reference points in the 
Draw panel

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  597  
For example, most of the tables in the default Revit furniture library define the insertion 
point at the center of the geometry, as shown in Figure 14.16. If you place one table family in 
your project and then later decide to swap it for a different table family, there should be mini-
mal disruption to the layout of other furniture in your design. The new family will appear in 
roughly the same spot as the originally placed family. Now what happens if you were to down-
load a table family from a web-based content provider? Will that table also follow the same 
convention for the location of the insertion point? This concern illustrates the importance of fol-
lowing published guidelines or standards for content creation.
Figure 14.16
Insertion point for default 
table families
Keep in mind that changing the insertion point is easy. As you might expect, you don’t move 
the geometry to the insertion point. Rather, you simply select two reference planes and then 
make sure the Defines Origin parameter is selected in the Properties palette. Continuing with 
this chapter’s exercise using the Furniture.rft or Metric Furniture.rft template, the two 
reference planes provided already are assigned the Defines Origin property. You will now start 
to build a geometric framework around these reference planes.
Let’s place some reference planes in the new family to officially begin the chapter exercise.
	
1.	 Activate the Ref. Level floor plan in the Project Browser. From the Create tab in the rib-
bon, click the Reference Plane command and sketch four new reference planes around 
the two existing reference planes, as shown in Figure 14.17.
The exact placement of the new planes doesn’t matter for now.
	
2.	 Select the reference plane you added to the left of the center plane, and in the Properties 
palette set its Name parameter to Left. (In Revit 2017, you can select the reference plane, 
and on both ends you will see the words “Click to name” or the predefined name for the 
reference plane. Click this area and input the name.)
Assigning a name to a reference plane will allow you to use it later as a work plane for 
creating solid forms.

598  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
	
3.	 Select the reference plane you added to the right and set its Name parameter to Right. 
Select the one near the top of the view and name it Back, and then select the one near the 
bottom of the view and name it Front.
	
4.	 Activate the Front elevation view and add another reference plane above and parallel to 
the Ref. Level. Again, the exact placement doesn’t matter for now—just make sure it is 
parallel to the level. In the Properties palette, set the Name parameter for this reference 
plane to Top.
Figure 14.17
Adding new reference planes to 
the exercise family
The Is Reference property for these new reference planes will be set to the default value of 
Weak Reference. That is acceptable because these will be the major geometrical references of 
the table family. As an option, you can set the four reference planes in the plan view to Strong 
Reference and observe later how they behave in the project environment.
Using Dimensions to Control Geometric Parameters
Dimensions are useful for controlling the geometric parameters of your families; however, we 
recommend they be placed directly on reference planes and lines and not within the sketches 
of solid or void forms. When you start to construct a component family, you should first lay out 
any reference planes or lines and then add dimensions to the references—all before you create 
any solid geometry.
As you complete the exercise steps in this section, you will be creating the framework for 
solid geometry that you will build in subsequent sections of this chapter.
	
1.	 With the Front elevation view still active, start the Aligned Dimension command. You 
can access this command in the Measure panel of the Create tab in the ribbon, in the 
Annotate tab, or by pressing DI to activate the default keyboard shortcut. Place a dimen-
sion from the Ref. Level to the reference plane you previously created.
This process will consist of three mouse clicks: one on the Ref. Level datum object, one on 
the reference plane above, and a final click in open space to place the dimension string.
	
2.	 Press the Esc key or click Modify in the ribbon to exit the Dimension command, and 
then select the dimension you just placed. To make this dimension parametric, locate the 

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  599  
Label drop-down list in the Options bar and choose <Add Parameter…>. The Parameter 
Properties dialog box will appear, as shown in Figure 14.18. In the Name field type 
Height, and make sure the Type radio button is selected.
	
3.	 Click OK to continue. The dimension will now display with the prefix Height =.
The exact height doesn’t matter because you can control it later on through parameter 
manipulation.
	
4.	 Activate the Ref. Level floor plan. You now need to ensure that the four new reference 
planes are equally placed around the two planes that define the family origin. After 
the equality constraints are established, you will place dimensions to control the over-
all length and width of the shape. The order of this procedure—equality, then overall 
dimension—should be followed to establish the correct relationship with a center-based 
origin.
	
5.	 Place an aligned dimension between the three vertical reference planes, and then click 
the EQ symbol near the dimension string. Repeat this process for the horizontal reference 
planes so that the result looks like Figure 14.19.
	
6.	 Next, you will add the dimensions that will actually control the overall size of the shape 
in plan. Place an aligned dimension between the outer two vertical reference planes, and 
then place a dimension between the outer two horizontal reference planes.
Figure 14.18
Assign your first dimension 
to a new parameter.

on reference planes first.
	
7.	 Exit the Dimension command and select the horizontal dimension string. From the Label 
drop-down list in the Options bar, select <Add Parameter…>. Name the new parameter 
Length, and then click OK. Repeat this process for the vertical dimension string, and 
name the parameter Width.
The result should look similar to Figure 14.20.

Should Everything Be Parametric?
When you start assigning dimensions to datum objects in your families, take a moment to think 
about whether you will need to modify those dimensions to create iterations of the component. 

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  601  
Modifying Parametric Dimensions
Now that you have established some dimensions and assigned them to family parameters, 
it is time to “flex” the geometry—a term that has become popular with Revit users since the 
early adoption years of the software. You flex your references by applying varying dimension 
values to confirm that no errors are generated and that the references are behaving the way 
you intended. Doing this early and often in the family-building process reduces the chance of 
encountering a problem that you can’t solve later on. When you have more forms and more com-
plex parametric relationships, it becomes more difficult to unravel problematic geometry.
There are two ways you can modify the parametric dimensions, thus flexing your family 
geometry. First, you can simply select a labeled dimension in the drawing area and enter a new 
value. The second way is different than in the project environment, where you must first select 
one of the objects a dimension references before editing the value. Although this method seems 
to be the easiest and most intuitive, you must be careful after you have established defined types 
within the family because direct manipulation of labeled dimensions will change the value 
of the active type. For this reason, we recommend that you become accustomed to using the 
Family Types dialog box to flex your families.
You can create a new reference plane and dimension from the Create panel in the ribbon and 
then click the Family Types command. Move the dialog box off to the side so you can still see 
the drawing area and observe the reference planes and dimensions. In the Family Types dialog 
box, click the New button and create a new type named Type 1. Set the dimension parameters 
as follows, and then click Apply:
Width = 2′-6″ (750 mm)
Length = 6′-0″ (1800 mm)
Height = 2′-6″ (750 mm)
Click the New button again and create a new type named Type 2. Set the dimension param-
eters as follows, and then click Apply:
Width = 3′-0″ (900 mm)
Length = 8′-0″ (2400 mm)
Height = 2′-6″ (750 mm)
If the reference planes and dimensions were created properly, you should not receive any 
error messages while you are flexing the parameters. In case you do receive any errors, you 
could delete the dimensions and even the reference planes and start over. If this were to hap-
pen later in the process, it would be more difficult to resolve the problem, and many more hours 
would be lost if you had to start over.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Creating too many unnecessary labeled dimensions can make a family more complex, thus poten-
tially degrading performance of your project files. If the dimension is a fixed dimension that will 
not change between types, then either use an unlabeled dimension or don’t dimension it at all. For 
example, in our table-building exercise, the height might be fixed at 2′-6″ (750 mm); therefore, the 
Height parameter would not be needed.

602  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
Reviewing the Differences between Type and Instance Parameters
In the previous exercise, you created a few dimension-based parameters that were set to be type 
parameters. Let’s review the difference between a type parameter and an instance parameter—
keeping in mind that they can be switched at just about any time.
The key difference between the two is that modifying a type parameter always modifies all 
instances of the type. Think of a type as a set of identical elements. Change one item in the set, 
and all the other items of that type in the model change to match. Door sizes are a good example 
of this. Doors come in standard sizes: 32″, 34″, 36″ (800 mm, 850 mm, 900 mm). On the other 
hand, an instance parameter modifies only the instances that you have selected. A good use of 
an instance parameter would be the fire rating on a door. Not every 36″ (900 mm) door will be 
fire rated, so you’ll need to individually identify which ones are. Figure 14.21 shows the param-
eters of a default curtain wall door family.
In Figure 14.21, the parameters that have the notation (Default) are instance parameters. 
There are other parameters that can be used to report dynamic values from within the fam-
ily. These are shown with the (Report) notation. In the example of a standard door, dimensions 
such as Width, Height, and Thickness would be best established as type parameters because 
you wouldn’t want users to create random or arbitrary values. Also be aware that once a param-
eter is created, only some aspects of the parameter can be modified. You cannot change the 
Discipline or Type Of Parameter value after the parameter has been created.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Type Naming
In the previous exercise, you created two types within the family simply named Type 1 and Type 2. 
You might have also noticed that other families in the default libraries have type names that indicate 
some sort of size information. For example, the door family Single-Flush has types named according 
to the respective length and width such as 36″ × 84″. The problem here is that the type name is not 
automatically linked to any parameters in the family; therefore, if a parameter value is modified 
and the type is not renamed, the situation can become confusing to users working in your project.
There is no single, correct answer to the type-naming conundrum. You can use specific type names 
(36″ × 84″) to help the users of your content decide which type to select, or you can choose generic 
names (Type 1) to avoid conflicts. One possible conflict could arise if you use the type name of a 
family in a schedule. For example, if you generated a door schedule that used the type name instead 
of the actual width and height parameters, there might be inconsistency with the actual dimensions 
versus those in the user-defined name.
A relatively safe methodology is to use more detailed type-naming conventions such as Material - 
Nominal Size to help content users better understand the available choices. An example for a door 
family might be Wood - 36 × 84. And then, as a standard practice, do not use the type name in any 
schedules for production documentation.
Sorting Parameters
Complex families can have many parameters that control geometry, information, materials, and so 
on. To make it easier for your team to find parameters efficiently, you can sort them in any way that 
you deem appropriate for use. When the Family Types dialog box is open in the Family Editor, use 

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  603  
On the other hand, each new option can create a lot of new types. By default, loading a family 
into your project will also load all the types. If you want to create the potential for many types 
but be selective about which types are loaded, you can use a type catalog to load only specific 
types.
Using Type Catalogs
If you are creating a family that will have many different type iterations, you can consider using 
a type catalog instead of creating each iteration within the Family Editor. A type catalog is a text 
file that contains all the iterations of the parameters specified within a family. When you load a 
family into a project that has an associated type catalog, such as steel framing families, you are 
presented with a dialog box within which you can select one or more types (Figure 14.22). You 
can select multiple types by pressing the Ctrl or Shift key.
Figure 14.21
Parameters of a 
default curtain wall 
door family
the Move Up and Move Down buttons to organize your parameters. When the family is loaded into a 
project, this sorting order will be seen in the Properties palette and in the Type Properties dialog box.

604  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
If you ever need to load additional types from a family you’ve already loaded in your project, 
you don’t have to locate the original family file. Instead, locate the family in the Project Browser, 
right-click it, and then select Reload.
When you generate a type catalog, the easiest method is to first use the Export Types com-
mand from the Application menu. This process will export all available parameters and any 
types you have established in your family to an appropriately formatted syntax. Save the TXT 
file in the same location as the associated RFA file and with the same filename. For example, the 
type catalog associated with the W-Wide Flange.rfa family file is named W-Wide Flange.txt. 
Using the exact same filename is critical to using a type catalog because that is how Revit will 
associate the two files.
Open the TXT file with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. Or you can open the file 
as a comma-delimited table in Microsoft Excel—as long as you save the file back to TXT format 
when you finish editing.
The first row of the type catalog will be a header that establishes the purpose for each column 
in the table. The syntax for the header is as follows:
ParameterName##ParameterType##ParameterUnits
Valid entries for Parameter Type are listed in Table 14.1 with the proper method for declaring 
them in the type catalog header. For measurement parameters such as Length and Area, the 
units can be adapted accordingly. Where the parameter declaration is listed as ParameterName, 
you will substitute a user-defined parameter name. Otherwise, the parameter name is built into 
the family and cannot be changed.

For Yes/No parameters in type catalogs, the value is defined as 1 = Yes and 0 = No. For the 
<Family Type> parameter, enter the complete name of the family with the type designation as

The first column in the table is where you will list the types within the family. In the first 
row of the table, the first value is blank—that is, the first row will begin with a comma delimiter 
when it is saved as a TXT file. After the header row is filled with parameter declarations and a 
list of type names is entered in the first column, you can start populating the values in the rest 
of the catalog. A sample of a type catalog opened in Excel is shown in Figure 14.23.

Organizing Solids and Lines in a Family Editor
When you get beyond the basic geometric controls in families that are dictated by datum objects 
and dimensions, there are three other ways you can organize the solids and symbolic lines you 
create in a family:
◆
◆
Object styles and subcategories
◆
◆
Visibility settings
◆
◆
Materials
Each of these three methods of control is directly related to the 3D and 2D content you gener-
ate. In other words, you must apply these settings directly to the solids and lines in a family. We 
will first review each method, and then you will learn about family-modeling techniques in the 
next section.
Using Object Styles and Subcategories
Let’s get back to the exercise file and discuss object styles and subcategories. As mentioned ear-
lier in this chapter, Revit has predefined a number of family categories. These categories define 
how elements display, schedule, export, and so on. Even though these main object categories 
can’t be modified, you can create subcategories for model, annotation, and imported objects.
Although you can use subcategories to control the visibility of some part of the family, keep 
in mind that the detail level and visibility settings already manage visibility. The subcategories 
are most important when you’re exporting your project because each category and subcategory 
is permitted its own CAD layer or IFC classification (Figure 14.24).
So if your project is being exported to CAD in such a way that you’ll need to associate objects 
with granular layer settings, creating and assigning subcategories to elements is necessary. 
Although it’s best not to rely on subcategories to manage visibility, we will show you how to  
create a new subcategory in the exercise file and then assign geometry to it.
In your exercise file, switch to the Manage tab and choose Object Styles. In the Object Styles 
dialog box, click the New button and create a new subcategory named Tables, as shown in 
Figure 14.25. Click OK to close both dialog boxes.

subcategories

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  607  
Remember that unless you specifically need to isolate tables from other types of furniture in 
your project, you shouldn’t create too many subcategories because doing so creates an opportu-
nity for inconsistency. What if someone else on your team created a different table family and 
added a subcategory called Table? When both families are loaded into a project, you will have 
two subcategories: Tables and Table.
Subcategories must be assigned to solid geometry or symbolic lines in the family in order to 
be utilized in the project environment. We will discuss this in the “Modeling Techniques in the 
Family Editor” section later in this chapter.
Assigning Visibility Settings
The time it takes for Revit to generate or regenerate a view depends on how much stuff in the 
view needs to be displayed. When you’re building smaller parts of a larger component (or if 
the elements are not visible in certain orientations), you should assign those elements to reveal 
themselves only at a certain level of detail (or in certain views). Doing so prevents the software 
from managing more information than necessary and helps you keep your views uncluttered.
The Revit Model Content Style Guide published by Autodesk lists guidelines for assigning 
geometry to the three detail levels available in project views (Table 14.2).
Table 14.2:	
Guidelines for Assigning Detail Level
If the Geometry Is:
Set the Detail Level to:
Smaller than 1′ (300 mm)
Fine
Between 1′ and 3′ (300–900 mm)
Medium
Larger than 3′ (900 mm)
Coarse

608  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
To practice using these visibility settings, download and open the file c14 Desk Project.rvt 
from this book’s web page. The sample project contains the default Desk.rfa family that is 
loaded in the Revit default project template. We have created a working sheet in which three 3D 
views have been placed with different Detail Level properties. Notice that all of the drawer faces 
and hardware are displayed in every view, despite the Detail Level assignments.
Starting with Existing Content
Many of us have downloaded Revit families from a number of widely available online sources to 
get a first design pass at a piece of content. Autodesk Seek, Revit City, and the AUGI forums are all 
great places to start. But when you download a family component, take a moment to make sure 
that the detail level and orientation of detail are appropriate.
Double-click any one of the viewports you see in the sample sheet view to activate a view. 
Select one of the desks, and then from the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Edit Family. You 
should be in a 3D view once the Desk.rfa family opens. If not, activate the default 3D view. 
Select the two sets of drawer handles; press the Ctrl key to select multiple items. From the con-
textual tab in the ribbon, choose Visibility Settings. In the Family Element Visibility Settings 
dialog box (Figure 14.26), uncheck the boxes for Coarse and Medium. Because these handles 
are smaller than 1′ (300 mm), they should be seen only when a view’s Detail Level is set to Fine. 
Also uncheck the Left/Right option because viewing the handles from the side might not be 
that valuable in a section or interior elevation view.
Figure 14.26
Family Element 
Visibility Settings 
for drawer handles
Notice that the box for the Plan/RCP option is unchecked. This is appropriate for the desk 
because little more than the surface of the top of the desk needs to show up in the plan. The legs, 
the hardware, and even the faces of the drawers don’t need to show up in the plan. Click OK to 
close the dialog box.
Next, select the drawer faces and then click the Visibility Settings tool. This geometry range 
is 1’– 3’ (300–900 mm), so it should display at Medium and Fine detail levels. Also uncheck the 
Left/Right option (Figure 14.27), and then click OK to close the dialog box.

Developing the Framework for a Family Component |  609  
From any tab in the ribbon, choose Load Into Project and then select the c14 Desk Project.rvt 
file if you are prompted. Choose the option to overwrite the existing version, and return to the 
sample sheet view. You will now see that the appropriate geometry is displaying only at the 
most appropriate detail levels in each view (Figure 14.28).

Using Materials
Materials are crucial to a family. But what are often more important are the Shading setting and 
the Transparency value of the material because they communicate much about the intent of your 
design in the early stages (Figure 14.29).
Figure 14.29

Transparency set-
tings in the Material 
Browser dialog box

610  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
In addition, material options are often not easily created in Revit. Yes, a family can have a mate-
rial parameter. But expressing many different materials for visualization purposes is probably best 
left to visualization specialists, who understand the subtleties of creating a compelling image, not 
just a rendering of a working model—and it’s unlikely they’ll be using Revit for this purpose.
Beyond visualization, however, materials in Revit are used for a host of other things. Graphic 
representation in construction documents and material takeoffs are two examples. If the materials 
in your families are something you will need to schedule or view graphically, it’s a good idea to 
define them.
Multiple materials can be assigned to a family. They are assigned based on model solids, so if 
you have multiple solids (sweeps, extrusions, and the like), each one can be given a unique material.
You have two options to define a material within a family, both being handled in the 
solid’s object properties shown in the Properties palette. By default, the material is set to <By 
Category>. Select this option and you can change the material to any material shown in the 
Material Browser dialog box, or you can load a new one from any material library. This is a great 
use for the family if you know the material is not going to change. If you know that your case-
work is not going to be anything but blonde maple, for example, go ahead and set the material 
within the family. Your other option is to use the tiny button […] to the right of the Material field 
in the Properties palette to define a new parameter. In this case, you can call the material some-
thing like Casework Material. If you were to use this same parameter for all your casework 
families, once it’s placed in the model you can change that material via the Material Browser 
dialog box, and it will update all your casework families at once.
Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor
Creating complex geometry isn’t always as easy as opening the Family Editor and starting to 
model the shape that you think you’re trying to create. Sometimes you need to model one form 
in order to create another form. And sometimes you need to model a complex, parameterized 
form in order to parameterize the actual shape that you’re trying to create. So that you under-
stand these advanced techniques, we’ll first cover the available geometry types that can be 
­created in Revit.
There are five discrete geometry types in the Family Editor: Extrusion, Blend, Revolve, 
Sweep, and Swept Blend. Both solid and void forms can be modeled from these shapes. In this 
section you’ll learn how to create all of these types, along with the Family Editor technique of 
nesting families.
Which type you select is important, but our advice is to use the simplest form that will 
express what you’re trying to model, keeping in mind how the geometry is likely to change.
Creating an Extrusion
Let’s get back to the furniture exercise where we are constructing a table. Activate the Ref. Level 
floor plan, and from the Create panel in the ribbon click Extrusion. The first action we will take 

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  611  
is to specify a work plane to host the extrusion. If you don’t specify a work plane, the default 
plane will be the level associated with the current view.
	
1.	 In the Work Plane panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Set. In the Name drop-
down list within the Work Plane dialog box, choose Reference Plane : Top, as shown in 
Figure 14.30.
Figure 14.30
Set a named reference 
plane as the work plane.
	
2.	 In the Options bar, set the Depth to –0′-2″ (–50 mm).
This will allow the top of the extrusion to be aligned with the Top reference plane, with 
its thickness extruding downward—away from the work plane.
	
3.	 In the Properties palette, set Subcategory to Tables. For the Material parameter, click the 
small button to the right of the parameter value field.
This button will allow you to associate a family parameter to the property instead of sim-
ply choosing one material to be assigned to the solid.
	
4.	 Click the Add Parameter button and create a new parameter named Tabletop Material. 
Click OK to close both open dialog boxes, and then you will see that the Material field is 
now inactive and the small button now has an equal sign label.
This means that the property is now being controlled by a family parameter.
	
5.	 In the Draw panel, choose the Rectangle tool, and then sketch a rectangle that snaps to 
the intersections of the outer reference planes (Left, Front, Right, and Back). Immediately 
after your second click to complete the sketch, you will see padlock icons at each of the 
four sides of the sketch. Click each one to establish an alignment constraint with the 
respective reference plane (Figure 14.31). If you click away and the constraint icons disap-
pear, you will either have to delete and redraw the sketched lines or use the Align tool to 
reestablish the constraint.

612  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
Click Finish Edit Mode from the contextual tab in the ribbon, and you’ll see the first solid 
piece of your exercise family. Activate a 3D view and open the Family Types dialog box. 
Switch between Type 1 and Type 2, and click Apply to verify that the extrusion flexes like 
the reference planes did previously in the chapter.
	
6.	 Activate the Front elevation view, and add an aligned dimension from the Top reference 
plane to the bottom of the tabletop extrusion.
	
7.	 Select the dimension, and from the Label drop-down list in the Options bar, choose <Add 
Parameter…>. Name the new parameter Tabletop Thickness, and then click OK.
	
8.	 Open the Family Types dialog box again, and set the Name drop-down list to Type 2. In 
the Tabletop Material parameter, click the ellipsis button to launch the Material Browser.
	
9.	 From the Material Browser, make sure the library panel is displayed by clicking the icon 
at the top of the document materials list. Search for “oak” at the top of the dialog box, 
and then select the material Wood (Oak) from the library panel. Click the up-arrow icon 
to load the material from the library into the family. In the Graphics tab of the Material 
Browser, check the box Use Render Appearance (Figure 14.32), and then click OK.
	
10.	 Set the Tabletop Thickness value to 4″ (100 mm) and then click Apply in the Family Types 
dialog box. Repeat steps 8, 9, and 10 for Type 1, but search for “glass” and load the mate-
rial named Glass, Green. Set the Tabletop Thickness for Type 1 to 1″ (25 mm), and then 
click OK to close the Family Types dialog box.
Creating a Sweep
Let’s have a little fun and assign a void sweep to the edge of the tabletop. It will be unique 
because we only want the sweep to cut the tabletop when Type 2 is selected—it will not cut the 
top for Type 1.
Figure 14.31
Set the constraints 
of the extrusion 
sketch to reference 
planes.

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  613  
A sweep is a 2D profile that follows a path. The magic behind sweeps in the Family Editor 
is that a sweep path can be set to automatically follow other model geometry. A great example 
is the continuous tubular structure of the chair shown in Figure 14.33. As you can see in the 
sequence of images, a simpler solid form is generated and then converted to a non-cutting void, 
a path is generated along the edges of the void geometry, and a tube profile is applied to the 
path. To explore how this family was made, download the file c14 Tube Chairs.rvt from this 
book’s web page.

In this part of the chapter exercise, you will create a void sweep along the outer edge of the 
tabletop using the Pick Path tool. You will then assign a parameter to drive the void into or away 
from the solid extrusion, depending on which type is specified.

614  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
	
1.	 Activate the default 3D view and set the graphic style in the view control bar to Shaded. Open 
the Family Types dialog box, select Type 2 in the Name drop-down list, and then click OK.
	
2.	 From the Create tab, choose Void Forms ➢ Void Sweep. From the contextual tab in the rib-
bon, click Pick Path. In the 3D view, pick each of the four upper edges of the tabletop solid 
(Figure 14.34).
	
3.	 Click Finish Edit Mode (the green check mark) in the contextual tab of the ribbon to com-
plete the Pick Path command.
	
4.	 In the Sweep panel of the contextual tab, set the Profile drop-down list to c14 Table Void Profile.
This is a profile family we created and preloaded in the exercise file. You can also down-
load it with the rest of this chapter’s exercise files for further exploration.
	
5.	 Zoom into the area where the profile is applied to the path, and make sure the curved 
part of the profile is facing toward the tabletop solid (Figure 14.35). If it isn’t, click the Flip 
button in the Options bar.
	
6.	 Click Finish Edit Mode in the contextual tab in the ribbon, and the void will automati-
cally cut the tabletop solid.

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  615  
When you create a void in the Family Editor, it will automatically cut any existing sol-
ids. If you don’t want a void to automatically cut other geometry, you can create the ele-
ments as solids first. When you are satisfied with the forms, select the appropriate solids 
and change them to voids in the Properties palette. Note that once a solid or a void is being 
cut by another object, you cannot change the solid/void property. You must use the Uncut 
Geometry tool first.
Because you used the Pick Path method to define the sweep path, the sweep will automati-
cally update as the shape of the tabletop changes. This exercise is a simple example of a power-
ful tool with a plethora of applications.
Now that you have created a void that cuts the solid geometry of the wood tabletop type, you 
need to adjust it so that the profile does not cut the solid when the glass tabletop type is speci-
fied. Unfortunately, you can’t simply turn the void sweep on and off, but you can adjust its hori-
zontal offset so it cuts like a virtual sliding saw.
	
1.	 In the 3D view, select the void sweep. In the Properties palette, you will see the param-
eters that drive the profile within the sweep. Click the Associate Family Parameter button 
next to the Horizontal Profile Offset value.
	
2.	 Click the Add Parameter button. Create a new parameter named Trigger Cut, and then 
click OK to close both dialog boxes.
	
3.	 Open the Family Types dialog box, and for Type 2, set the Trigger Cut value to 0′-0″ and 
then click Apply.
	
4.	 Switch to Type 1 and set the Trigger Cut value to –0′-4″ (–100 mm), and then click OK 
to close the dialog box. Figure 14.36 shows the difference between the two types just 
defined.

616  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
Adding Tooltips
There have probably been times when you have pulled a family out of your library or a previous 
project to add to your model and you can’t remember what the parameters actually control. 
Parameters like Height or Length are pretty easy, but will you remember what the Trigger Cut 
does?
In the Family Editor you can add tooltips to your parameters. You can add up to 250 characters 
to describe your parameter and add some additional notes to how it is intended to be used. In the 
Parameters Properties dialog box you’ll see the Edit Tooltip button.
Clicking this button will allow you to add a message or description to your parameter to help 
explain its functionality.
Hovering your mouse over the parameter in the Parameter Properties dialog box will show the 
tooltip you’ve created.

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  617  
You’ll see that adding the negative value to the Horizontal Profile Offset allows you to con-
trol whether the void cuts the solid tabletop. We simply assigned the offset value to each family 
type, but you could explore methods of using formulas with logic such as this:
If Tabletop Thickness < 4″ then Trigger Cut = − 4″ else Trigger Cut = 0″
The actual syntax of this formula to be applied in the Family Types dialog box would be: 
if(Tabletop Thickness < 0′ 4″, -0′ 4″, 0′).
Creating a Revolve
Let’s move on to the process of creating the legs for the table. You’ll use the Revolve tool to cre-
ate this shape; however, you will create the shape only once in a separate family that will be 
loaded into the table family and placed multiple times.
We have created a preloaded family for the purpose of this segment of the exercise. 
Download and open the file c14 Table Leg.rfa from this book’s web page. You’ll create a 
revolve form, assign height and material parameters, and then load it into the table family.
	
1.	 In the c14 Table Leg file, activate the Front elevation view. You will see that we have 
sketched a 2D profile consisting of invisible lines.
These will not display when the leg family is loaded into the table family.
	
2.	 From the Create tab in the ribbon, click Revolve. From the Draw panel in the contextual 
tab, make sure the Pick Lines tool is selected. Hover the mouse pointer over one of the 
provided profile lines and press the Tab key once, and then click to select all the lines of 
the profile.
Don’t worry about constraining any of the sketch lines, because this shape won’t be 
dependent on adjacent geometry.
	
3.	 Click the Axis Line tool in the contextual tab, select the Pick Lines mode, and then click 
the vertical reference plane in the drawing area.
	
4.	 Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the contextual tab to complete the Revolve command.
	
5.	 Add an aligned dimension between the Ref. Level and the reference plane above the 
revolve. Select the dimension, and in the Options bar choose <Add Parameter…> from 
the Label drop-down list. Name the new parameter Leg Height, and make sure it is a 
type parameter.
	
6.	 Select the solid revolve, and in the Properties palette click the Associate Family Parameter 
button for the Material property. Create a new parameter named Leg Material, and click 
OK to close the open dialog boxes.
Before you save the leg family and load it into the table family, you should consider whether 
the nested family needs to be scheduled—in the case of a table leg, probably not. However, you 
will load some chairs into the table family later and those will surely need to be scheduled.
Switch to the Create tab, and from the Properties panel click the Family Category And 
Parameters button. In that dialog box, you will see a list of Family Parameters that contains a 
parameter called Shared. When this box is checked, the nested family can be scheduled. For 

618  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
example, if you checked the box for the table leg family, loaded it into the table family, loaded 
the table family into a project, and then placed several instances of the table, you could create a 
schedule to count the total number of table legs in the project.
Creating a Blend and Swept Blend
When you create a blend, you are essentially combining two different shapes. Say you have a 
circle and want to transition it to a square. Creating that geometry by using an extrusion and 
voids would be complicated, but creating it with a blend is simple (see Figure 14.37).
Figure 14.37
A simple blend of a square 
and circle
The only difference between a blend and a swept blend is that a blend is defined along a 
straight line starting on a work plane. A swept blend is along a user-defined path. Figure 14.38 
demonstrates a swept blend between a circle and a square along a user-defined path.
Figure 14.38
A swept blend

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  619  
Both types of blends can incorporate a variety of shapes and profiles. Using the context of 
furniture that we’ve established, you’ll create a swept blend. You’re going to create a wooden 
stool.
	
1.	 To begin, open the default furniture family. You’re going to create a three-sided stool, 
starting with the legs. When you open the default furniture family, you’ll be in the Ref. 
Plane view. In this view, choose the Swept Blend tool from the Create tab.
The Swept Blend tool has its own contextual menu, shown in Figure 14.39. You will cre-
ate a path for the sweep and the starting and ending shapes. As you can see, the software 
first wants you to define a path.
Figure 14.39
The Swept Blend 
contextual menu
	
2.	 Choose the Front elevation view to start the path, and pick the Sketch Path button from 
the Swept Blend panel. Using the Line tool (which is selected by default), start a line from 
10″ (250 mm) to the left of the base and continue until it intersects with the vertical plane 
at a 73° angle. You’ll have a measurement roughly 2′-10″ (865 mm) across the hypotenuse 
of the triangle (Figure 14.40). Click the green check mark to accept the sweep.
Figure 14.40
Creating the leg sweep

620  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
Now you need to make the base of your leg.
	
3.	 Open the Ref. View and you’ll see two red dots and a line connecting them. The dot on 
the left is the base of the leg, the dot on the right is the top of the leg, and the line between 
is the path you just created. Starting with the base, choose the Select Profile 1 button and 
then the Edit Profile button (Figure 14.41).
Figure 14.41
Modify the two profiles to 
create the swept blend.
	
4.	 Using the left red dot as a center point, create a circle 1″ (25 mm) in diameter. Click the 
green check mark, then the Finish Edit Mode button, to complete the shape.
Next, you need to create the top of the leg.
	
5.	 Select the Select Profile 2 button and then Edit Profile from the Swept Blend panel. Using 
the Y-reference plane as the right side of the box, create a rectangle centered on the X-axis 
1″ × 3″ (25 mm × 75 mm). Click Finish Edit Mode when you’ve finished. The two shapes 
will look like Figure 14.42.
Figure 14.42
Finishing the two 
shapes of the blend
	
6.	 With those two profiles and a path complete, click Finish Edit Mode again to complete the 
sweep. You now have one leg of your stool.
	
7.	 To finish the base, select the leg and choose the Array tool. In the Options bar, set these 
options:
◆
◆
Choose a radial array.
◆
◆
Leave the Number of arrayed items at 3.
◆
◆
Change the Angle to 360.

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  621  
◆
◆
Change the rotation center to the middle of the X-Y reference planes.
◆
◆
Click OK to finish the array.
You should now have a set of stool legs (Figure 14.43).
Figure 14.43
The completed stool legs
	
8.	 From this point, use the techniques explained earlier in the chapter to add a round stool 
seat and a bar near the base for your feet.
Our finished stool is shown in Figure 14.44. There are a few ways to create the seat and 
bar—it can be with a swept blend, an extrusion, or even a revolve.
Figure 14.44
The completed stool
The finished family can be found on the book’s web page. The file is called c14-WoodenStool.rfa. 
Before we continue with the table-modeling exercise, let’s take a moment to discuss the impor-
tance of nested families in comparison to modeling repetitive geometry all within one family. 
Families are used to create individual components. By combining those components, you can 
use a nested family to add parameters to better define the relationships between those compo-
nents and best leverage the families within your project.
Nesting Families
Geometry from one family can be loaded into another family. This process is called nesting, 
and it allows you to create a single element that will be used many times in another family. 
This method is much more efficient than creating an element and then grouping and copying it 
around the same family. Let’s review some benefits of using nested families.

622  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
When one family is loaded into another, the nested family behaves as a single, unified com-
ponent. This means that it will be much easier to change and control the instance placements 
of a nested family. Even though the nested family may seem like a static component, references 
and parameters in nested families can be driven by controls in the host family.
A nested family can also be controlled by a Family Type parameter, which will allow you 
to select from multiple nested families as another parameter in the host family. This feature is 
incredibly powerful for creating design iteration within families that are in your projects. You 
will see this functionality later in this chapter when you load two different chair families into 
the table family and use a Family Type parameter to select between them.
As a final note about nested families, you should always be aware of the insertion point 
defined in the families you load into other families. As we mentioned previously in this chapter, 
a consistent insertion point will ensure that a nested family doesn’t “flip-flop” in unintended 
directions when you switch between family types.
Let’s get back to the exercise for which you should still be working in the c14 Table Leg family file:
	
1.	 Save the leg family and then click the Load Into Project button in the ribbon. The table 
family should still be open and the leg will be loaded (nested) into it. You will now place 
multiple instances of the leg family, associate the parameters, and adjust the visibility for 
control of an optional leg instance.
	
2.	 Switch to the c14 Table file, and activate the Ref. Level floor plan. From the Create tab, 
click the Component tool, and the c14 Table Leg family should be the active component in 
the Type Selector. Look in the Properties palette at the Host property, and make sure that 
it is Level: Ref. Level. Place four instances of the leg near the corners of the table and one 
exactly at the crossing of the center reference planes.
	
3.	 Add dimensions for each of the four corner legs, and adjust the legs as necessary so that 
they are offset exactly 6″ (150 mm) from each edge reference plane (Figure 14.45). Lock 
these dimensions to preserve the offset.
Figure 14.45
Leg families are 
placed and dimen-
sioned in a plan 
view.

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor |  623  
	
4.	 Select the middle leg, and in the Properties palette click the Associate Family Parameter 
button for the Visible property. Click the Add Parameter button, and name the new 
parameter Middle Leg. This will be a Yes/No parameter that can be controlled with a 
logic formula that will be driven by the length of the table.
	
5.	 Open the Family Types dialog box, and in the Formula field for the Middle Leg param-
eter type the following: Length > 7′ (for metric, type Length > 2000 mm).
This simple formula will make the middle leg visible when the Length parameter exceeds 
7′ (2000 mm) and invisible when it doesn’t.
	
6.	 Switch to a 3D view, and now you’ll need to assign dimensional parameters to drive the 
leg heights in relation to the table.
You can do this a few different ways, but when you’re dealing with multiple instances of 
an object, we recommend you feed a value into a nested type parameter rather than align 
and lock each instance to reference planes within the host family.
	
7.	 Select one of the legs, and then click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette. In the 
Type Properties dialog box, click the Assign Family Parameter (AFP) button for the Leg 
Height parameter. Add a new parameter named Nested Leg Height.
	
8.	 Click the AFP button for the Leg Material parameter, and add a new parameter named 
Nested Leg Material. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
You must associate the parameters in nested families with parameters in the host 
­family—even if it is simply to allow materials to be assigned to the nested elements.
	
9.	 Open the Family Types dialog box. In the Formula field for the Nested Leg Height param-
eter, type the following: Height - Tabletop Thickness.
Make sure that the parameters are spelled exactly because they are case sensitive. This 
formula will use the overall height of the table minus the thickness of the tabletop to 
drive the height of the nested legs.
	
10.	 Switch between Type 1 and Type 2 to verify the behavior of the legs. Even though the 
middle leg is still visible in the Family Editor, it will be invisible when the family is 
loaded into the project environment.
Save the table family and load it into the c14 Desk Project file, referenced previously in 
this chapter. Place some instances of each type and observe the differences in size and 
number of legs (Figure 14.46).

11.	 Select one of the Type 1 instances of the c14 Table family, and then click Edit Type from the 
Properties palette. Locate the Nested Leg Material parameter and launch the Material Browser.
	
12.	 Search for “white,” and load the material named Metal, Paint Finish, White, and 
Matte from the library into the project. In the Graphics tab, check the box Use Render 
Appearance, and then click OK in the Material Browser to assign it to the Nested Leg 
Material. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
	
13.	 Select one of the Type 2 instances and assign the Wood (Oak) material to the Nested Leg 
Material parameter.
Troubleshooting Techniques
Now that you have created a basic component and explored some of the fundamental modeling 
techniques, let’s look at some additional methods and troubleshooting you might experience 
working on a real project.
Doing a Visibility Check
In the c14 Desk Project.rvt file, open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and 
expand the Furniture category. Uncheck the box for the Tables subcategory, and then click OK 
to close the dialog box. You’ll notice that only the tabletops have been turned off in the drawing 
area, as shown in Figure 14.47.
Figure 14.47
Visibility settings 
applied to a subcategory

Troubleshooting Techniques |  625  
Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box again and uncheck the box for the 
Furniture category. Click OK, and you will see that the desks and even the table legs have been 
turned off in the view. Even though the nested table leg family was created with the Generic 
Model family template, it will behave according to the main category of the host family; how-
ever, this does not apply to subcategories. Let’s go through the process to fix the problem:
	
1.	 Go back to the c14 Table Leg family, and from the Create tab, click the Family Category 
And Parameters tool. Change the Family Category to Furniture, and then click OK.
The family category must be changed to Furniture to avoid confusion with object style sub-
categories. If you create a subcategory under Generic Models named Tables and then reload 
the nested leg family in the table, there will be two separate subcategories named Tables.
	
2.	 Switch to the Manage tab, and then choose Object Styles. In the Object Styles dialog box, 
click the New button and name the new subcategory Tables.
Remember to use careful planning when naming subcategories within your custom fami-
lies. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, inconsistency with subcategories can lead to 
problems with view templates, graphics, exporting, and printing.
	
3.	 In the drawing area, select the solid revolve, and in the Properties palette, set the 
Subcategory parameter to Tables.
	
4.	 Save the family, and then click the Load Into Project command in the ribbon. First, reload 
the leg family into the table family, and then reload the table family into the c14 Desk 
Project.rvt file. When prompted, choose the option to overwrite the existing family.
You will now notice in c14 Desk Project.rvt that the table legs are turned off along with 
the other elements of the tables.
When you are editing a nested family, you could reload the family directly into the project 
without reloading it into the host family. We recommend working your way back through each 
family so that the original host family RFA file is maintained in your project content library.
Applying Parametric Arrays and Family Type Parameters
For the final exercise, you will work with additional nested families, but you will now learn how 
to apply a Family Type parameter and use parametric arrays. The steps in the following exer-
cises must be carefully applied in the correct order or the flexibility in the family may be dis-
rupted. More complex families are prone to errors if you build them quickly and without care, 
so take your time and review each step along the way.
You will begin by loading two different chair families into the c14 Table.rfa family. 
Download the files Chair-Dining-1.rfa and Chair-Dining-2.rfa from this book’s web page. 
These modified families were originally downloaded from the RevitCity.com website.
	
1.	 In the c14 Table.rfa file, activate the Ref. Level floor plan. From the Create tab in the 
ribbon, click the Component tool. If you haven’t already loaded the two chair families, 
click the Load Family command in the ribbon.
	
2.	 From the Type Selector, choose the Chair-Dining-1 family and place one chair along the 
upper edge of the table.
Remember to press the spacebar to rotate the chair as needed before you place it.

626  | CHAPTER 14  Designing with the Family Editor  
	
3.	 Exit the Component command and select the chair you placed in the previous 
step. In the Options bar, choose <Add Parameter…> from the Label drop-down 
list. Create a new parameter named Chair Type. Note that the parameter type is 
<Family Type>.
This kind of parameter will let you apply different families that are nested in the host 
family.
Also, it is important that all nested families with which you intend to use a family type 
parameter must be of the same category. For example, one of the chairs originally down-
loaded from the RevitCity.com website was assigned to the Furniture Systems category, 
whereas the other was in the Furniture category. Therefore, the two nested families could 
not be assigned to the same family type parameter.
	
4.	 With the chair still selected, click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette. Click the 
AFP button for the Chair Material parameter. Create a new parameter named Nested 
Chair Material, and then click OK to close the open dialog boxes.
	
5.	 From the Modify tab in the ribbon, click the Align tool. As shown in Figure 14.48, click 
the Back reference plane (1) and then the reference within the chair (2). Finally, click the 
padlock icon to establish a constraint (3).
	
6.	 Add an aligned dimension from the Right reference plane to the center reference of the 
chair. Set the value to 1′-8″ (500 mm), and click the padlock to establish the dimension as 
a constraint.
	
7.	 Select the chair, and then from the Modify tab in the ribbon, click the Array tool. In 
the Options bar, choose the Group And Associate option and the Move To: End radio 
button.
	
8.	 Click once near the chair and then click a second time 2′-8″ (800 mm) to the left. Press the 
Enter key to accept the number of entities in the array.
	
9.	 Use the Align tool to constrain the arrayed chair to the Back reference plane, add an 
aligned dimension, and then lock the dimension—similar to the previous steps. The plan 
view should look like the image in Figure 14.49.
	
10.	 Select one of the arrayed chairs, and you will again see a line connecting the arrayed 
objects displaying the number 2. Click this line and then choose <Add Parameter…> 
from the Label drop-down list in the Options bar. Create a new parameter named Chair 
Array. Click OK to close any open dialog boxes.
	
11.	 Open the Family Types dialog box. In the formula field for the Chair Array parameter, 
type (Length - 2′) / 2′ (for metric, type (Length - 600) / 600).
This will automatically increase or decrease the number of elements in the array based on 
the length of the table.
	
12.	 Repeat steps 1–10 to place another parametric array along the Front reference plane. 
When you get to step 3, instead of choosing <Add Parameter…> from the Label drop-
down list, you will simply choose the Chair Type parameter, and in step 10 you will 
choose the Chair Array parameter.

Troubleshooting Techniques |  627  
Before you continue with the exercise, take a moment to open the Family Types dialog 
box and switch between Type 1 and Type 2. Verify that the chairs maintain alignment with 
the edges of the tabletop. When you select Type 2, there should be six chairs instead of four. 
Compare your results to the image shown in Figure 14.50.
With Type 2 still active in the Family Type dialog box, set the Chair Type parameter to Chair-
Dining-2 and then click the Apply button. You should see all the nested chairs change to the 
alternate chair family. Save the family and reload it into the c14-Desk-Project.rvt file, and 
choose the option to reload the family and overwrite any parameter values. If the Tables sub-
category is still turned off in the view, you may notice that the chairs appear but not the tables. 
There is likely no realistic need to create another subcategory for chairs, so open the Visibility/
Graphic Overrides dialog box and turn on the Tables subcategory.

The Bottom Line
Get started with a family.    Before you start to create your own family components, take a 
moment to think about how you expect that component to “behave” in your project. The role 
of the Family Editor isn’t just an environment to model geometry; it also determines how the 
content that you create will behave in the project environment.
Master It    Choosing the right template is critical. You can convert from one family tem-
plate to another, but this is not always the case. Why would you want to choose a door 
template rather than a Generic Model template?

The Bottom Line |  629  
Create the framework for a family component.    Reference planes, points, and lines are the 
“bones” of your component. Assign parameters to the skeleton, and the geometry will follow 
along. Be sure to test the parameter and reference relationships before you start to create any 
solid model geometry.
Master It    Why should you build, assign parameters to, and test the references first? 
Why not just model the geometry?
Understand family modeling techniques.    Although the Family Editor contains a wide 
assortment of modeling and editing tools, you don’t always need to build everything in one 
file. You can use a number of techniques to reduce redundancy and manage complex geom-
etry for a component family.
Master It    When would you consider using the technique of nesting families? How 
could this method improve the efficiency of a component family?
Apply extended family management techniques.    Sometimes parametric behavior 
will depend on the parameters that directly control it, but often these parameters will be 
expressed as a relationship to something else.
Master It    Why are formulas so important? Why not just create the parameters you need 
and then modify them as needed in the project environment?


 Chapter  15 
 Creating Stairs and Railings   
 Creating stairs and railings in Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software can be challenging. In 
addition, stairs and railings are often sculptural as well as functional, and there’s a limit to the 
amount of customization you can design with the provided tools and commands. 
 An entire book can be written about mastering stairs and railings in Revit, considering the 
breadth of functionality in these tools and the unlimited number of design confi gurations they 
can be used to create. Instead of walking through a few examples of creating stairs and railings, 
this chapter will give you foundational knowledge about the rules, parts, and key functionality 
of these tools so that you can use them in the most effective way possible for your own designs. 
We will also give you some ideas to tackle tougher design challenges by thinking beyond the 
default tools. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Understand the key components of stairs and railings 
 
◆
 Understand the different stair tools and apply them to custom designs 
 
◆
 Design railings and use the Railing tool for other model elements 
 
◆
 Implement best practices 
 Designing Stairs and Railings 
 Designing and iterating complex stairs and railings in any software application can be diffi cult. 
You will need to thoroughly understand the rules and constraints of the application—in effect, 
learn the  language of the application. To communicate fl uently in that language, you need to 
be able to think fl uently. You almost have to be able to think beyond the individual words and 
begin to arrange whole ideas. 
 Regardless of how well you know how to use a particular application, you have to incorpo-
rate imagination and complex design issues. Sometimes stairs and railings are straightforward 
and functional (for example, a steel or concrete egress stair), and there’s not much room for cre-
ative thinking. But in many cases, stairs and railings are conceived as feature elements within a 
space. They’ll be touched and experienced up close. They may be extraordinarily complex and 
spatial—almost an inhabited sculpture (Figure  15.1 ). 

632  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Revit is purpose-built for designing building elements and relating them to the rules of 
commonly constructed relationships (doors associate with walls, furniture associates with 
floors, and so on). The software is biased toward relationships specific to designing a building 
and maintaining those relationships as the design changes. To make things a bit more compli-
cated, there’s a specific language for creating stairs and railings in Revit Architecture. For exam-
ple, Figure 15.2 illustrates the Edit Baluster Placement dialog box for a baluster condition.

Reviewing the Key Components of Stairs and Railings |  633  
Before we begin detailed exercises for creating stairs and railings, let’s review the main com-
ponents of each object type and how they are organized within Revit.
Reviewing the Key Components of Stairs and Railings
Stairs and railings are system families, so they exist only within the project environment. 
As you should already know, these types of families can be shared between projects only by 
copying and pasting, using the Transfer Project Standards tool, or including them in your 
project templates. There are several component family templates that serve as subsets of stair 
and railing system families, such as profiles, posts, and panels.
Reviewing the Basic Rules of Stairs
Before you start to create any stairs in a project, you should become familiar with the basic rules 
related to these special elements in Revit Architecture. We will discuss the actual geometric 
components later, but first let’s review the parameters that drive the geometry. When you launch 
the Stair tool, it is assumed that you want a stair to be generated between two levels. If you 
start the tool from a floor plan view, the base level will be the level associated with the floor 
plan view and the top will be the next level above. Keep in mind that this may be a level that is 
not the next major level above; it could be a minor level such as a mezzanine. Always check the 
instance parameters in the Properties palette when you are creating a new stair (Figure 15.3). 
You can also assign top- and base-level offsets in the instance parameters the same way you can 
for walls.
Figure 15.3
Instance parameters 
for a stair
Using the overall height determined by the base and top levels, the stair object will be equally 
divided into risers. The maximum riser height is defined in the type properties of every stair 
type. The overall height of the desired stair will be equally divided into risers not exceeding the 
defined maximum riser height. Tread depth is specified in the stair’s type properties as well, but 
that may be overridden if you manually lay out the treads in Sketch mode.
In addition to the simple rule of overall riser height, some public agencies require a stair 
calculation to be employed for dimensional compliance. This type of calculation can be enabled 
from the stair’s type properties as well. With either of the stair commands activated, click the 
Certiﬁcation

634  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Edit Type button and then the Edit button in the Calculation Rules parameter. This will give you 
the Stair Calculator dialog box (Figure 15.4), which will allow you to enter the code-based values 
driving the creation of new stairs.
Figure 15.4
The Stair Calculator 
dialog box
Whether you use Stair By Component or Stair By Sketch, the stairs you create will 
be associated with a base level and top level. You can also assign offset distances to the 
base and top levels, which allow the stairs to start or end later or sooner depending on 
the design. Because the stairs remain associated with these datum objects, if the datum 
objects are adjusted or the offsets are redefined, the stairs will automatically adjust within 
the calculated rules. This means that if the height reduces, the riser count will remain but 
each riser will be shorter. In other words, the footprint or plan of the stair will remain 
unchanged. If the height of a stair run increases and an automatic adjustment would violate 
the maximum riser height, you will receive a warning that the actual number of risers is dif-
ferent from the desired number of risers. In other words, the footprint of the stair will not 
change automatically. It is up to you to edit the stair to add more risers where you feel they 
are appropriate.
Before we discuss the basic component of stairs and railings, download and open the file 
c15-00-Stair-Rail.rvt or c15-00-Stair-Rail-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page at 
www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.

Reviewing the Key Components of Stairs and Railings |  635  
Working with Stair Components
With either the Stair By Sketch or Stair By Component tool, the basic elements of a stair are 
similar. The main part of the stairs—the risers and treads—is called the run in Revit. The 
structural elements that hold the run in place are known as stringers in the Stair By Sketch tool, 
and they are called supports in the Stair By Component tool. Finally, landings are addressed as 
unique elements in the Stair By Component tool. In the Stair By Component tool, each of these 
three basic elements (run, support, landing) is defined with its own unique type properties. 
When you use Stair By Sketch, they are all defined in the properties of each stair type.
◆
◆
Run: The critical parts of a run are the construction, material definitions, and tread and 
riser settings. There are two system families for runs in the default project template: 
Monolithic Run and Non-Monolithic Run. A monolithic run is essentially a single material 
for the stair, stringer, tread, and riser. Typically, monolithic runs are used for cast-in-place 
and precast concrete stairs, whereas non-monolithic runs are for stairs made of wood, 
metal, and various other materials.
◆
◆
Support: The supports for an assembled stair usually take one of two forms. In Revit, these 
are referred to as carriage (open) or stringer (closed), as shown in Figure 15.5. Carriage and 
Stringer are system families you can find in the Project Browser under Families ➢ Stairs. 
After you select either the Carriage or Stringer option in the stair type properties, you can 
select one of the respective support types. For example, the Right Support property may 
be Carriage (open) and the Right Support Type value would be Carriage – 2″ Width. You 
cannot customize a stringer or carriage profile when you use the Stair By Sketch tool.
Figure 15.5
Stair support options
Stringer (closed)
Carriage (open)

◆
◆
Landing: Landings are the transitional elements between runs. As such, one of the main 
settings in the type properties for a landing is Same As Run. With this setting enabled, you 
are left with only the identity data and the material property for monolithic landings. If the 
Same As Run setting is disabled, you can treat the landing as another tread with the same 
opportunities to apply a thickness and a nosing profile.
Reviewing the Components of Railings
The major parts of a railing are the profiles, different kinds of balusters, and the nested types 
within each railing family. Additional functionality is available to help integrate different 
railing parts into a more cohesive system. In Figure 15.6, a common railing is shown to illustrate 
the fundamental parts of a railing type.

Let’s examine some of these railing components in greater depth:
Profiles    The profile is the most basic component used to model a railing. All the rails, posts, 
and balusters are generated from profile families. You can have as many profiles per railing 
as you like, but you can’t have more than one shape in a profile family (RFA) file. In each 
profile family, the shape needs to be a closed loop—no gaps or overlapping lines allowed. 
Furthermore, all the railing profiles will be swept parallel to their host objects. In Figure 15.7, 
the top rail and all the intermediate rails are simple circular profiles swept along the path of 
the railing.
Figure 15.7
Multiple profiles per 
railing

Reviewing the Key Components of Stairs and Railings |  637  
Balusters    There are three kinds of baluster family templates you can use to customize a 
railing type:
◆
◆
Baluster posts have built-in instance parameters to control the height of the baluster so that 
it can adjust automatically when used within a railing type in a project. The posts are used 
at the start, end, and transitions of railings.
◆
◆
Balusters are the main, repeated vertical structure of most railing designs. They have 
instance parameters as well that control the vertical length and the angle of the top and 
bottom of the baluster (Figure 15.8). When you create your own custom baluster families, 
you must constrain the geometry to these reference planes so the baluster will adapt to the 
settings in the railing type.
Figure 15.8
A baluster template
◆
◆
Baluster panels have controls much like the baluster, but there are additional reference 
planes to control the overall width of a desired panel (Figure 15.9).

638  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Top Rail    The top rail is a separate component of a railing type. That is to say, it will 
not appear in the Edit Rails dialog box. Instead, you will find the Top Rail settings in the 
type properties of the railing and they consist only of a height and a type. The top rail is 
a nested system family that you can find in the Project Browser under Families ➢ Railings 
➢ Top Rail Type. Locate and double-click Circular – 1 1/2″ (Circular – 40 mm). You will 
find more detailed settings to control this subset of railing functionality (Figure 15.10). 
Let’s take a look at some of the properties of a top rail: Construction, Terminations, and 
Extensions.
◆
◆
Construction The first category of properties in a top rail defines the basic construction of 
the rail. Here you will select a profile and specify other behavior such as default join condi-
tion, transitions, and hand clearance.
◆
◆
Terminations Another top rail option is defining a termination. This is a family component 
that can be used at the end of a rail or rail extension. There is only one termination family 
loaded in the default project template, but you can create your own family using the Railing 
Termination.rft or Metric Railing Termination.rft family template. Figure 15.11 
shows an example of a termination.
Figure 15.9

◆
◆
Extensions When you need a rail to extend beyond its main sketch definition of the railing, 
an extension can be specified as part of the rail type. The extension is an integrated part of 
the rail, so it’s controlled by the same properties like size or materiality. In the settings for 
Extension (Beginning/Bottom), you can select an option called Plus Tread Depth. This is 
to accommodate common building codes that require a stair handrail to be extended the 
length of one tread plus some standard distance. Extension Style is a setting that gives you 
three predefined designs for the rail extension: Wall, Floor, or Post (Figure 15.12).

640  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
You can customize a rail’s extension by pressing the Tab key to select the rail. Then click Edit 
Rail in the contextual tab in the ribbon, and click Edit Path.
Handrail    The handrail is another system family that is nested within a railing family, and 
its properties are almost identical to those of the top rail family. The one exception is that 
handrails can use support families. From the Project Browser, navigate to Families ➢ Railings 
➢ Handrail Type and then double-click Circular – 1 ½″ (or Pipe – Wall Mount in the metric 
equivalent) to open the Type Properties dialog box for a handrail (Figure 15.13).

Reviewing the Key Components of Stairs and Railings |  641  
Beyond selecting a support family, you will notice settings for Layout that include Align 
With Posts, Fixed Number, Fixed Distance, Maximum Spacing, and Minimum Spacing. These 
are the main controls that will enable or disable the other settings for Supports, including 
Spacing, Justification, and Number.
Rail Structure (Non-Continuous)    Let’s return to the type properties of the main railing 
family. In the Project Browser, navigate to Families ➢ Railings ➢ Railing and double-click 
Guardrail – Pipe (900 mm Pipe in the metric exercise file). In the Rail Structure (Non-
Continuous) parameter, click the Edit button to open the Edit Rails (Non-Continuous) dialog 
box (Figure 15.14). In this interface, you can insert rails defined by profile families as well as 
set their relative height, horizontal offset distance, and material. These rails are considered 
non-continuous because they will be intersected by any balusters you define in the Baluster 
Placement settings. Click OK to exit this dialog box.
Figure 15.14
The Edit Rails 
(Non-Continuous) 
dialog box
Baluster Placement    When you return to the type properties of the railing, locate the 
Baluster Placement parameter and click the Edit button to open the Edit Baluster Placement 
dialog box (Figure 15.15). As you can see, there are options for the main pattern and the posts 
and an option for how the balusters will be used on stairs.

642  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
The Main Pattern section of the dialog box is where you would assemble all your baluster 
types and then space and host them accordingly. You can also decide how you want the 
pattern to repeat (or not repeat) itself at the ends of sketched line segments. The Posts section 
is used to specify which baluster is used at start, corner, and end conditions (and the fre-
quency of corner posts). Click OK to close both open dialog boxes.
That’s a high-level overview of the properties of railings and what they’re used for. We’ve 
covered the primary features necessary to create great railings.

Using the Tab Key with Stairs and Railings
Railings consist of nested families for top rails and handrails. Stairs are divided into runs, landings, 
and supports. When you first select a railing or stair, you will be selecting the parent type. You could 
then click Edit Type in the Properties palette to change the child types; however, there are some 
unique instance properties and editing capabilities exposed when you use the Tab key to directly 
select one of the nested elements.
For stairs, one of the important features of a run is whether it begins or ends with a riser. This 
property is critical in determining how a stair interacts with an adjacent floor slab. Depending 

Creating Stairs |  643  
on the type of stair you create, these properties are part of either the stair type or the run type. 
In the newer style of stair, the only way you can access these properties is by hovering your 
mouse pointer over a stair and then pressing the Tab key once to select the run. The instance 
properties of the run will then be shown in the Properties palette. You can also access the run 
width in the same manner.
For railings, you can use the Tab key to access editing functions of top rails and handrails. If you 
hover the mouse pointer over a top rail and then press the Tab key once to select the rail, you will 
find an Edit Rail button in the contextual ribbon. Activating this tool allows you to customize the 
path of the continuous rails to build or customize extensions.
Creating Stairs
Various common configurations of stairs can be created using the tools provided in Revit. 
Designs that used to require an outside-the-box (workaround) approach are now possible. 
Examples include three-run stairs (when the stair run turns back onto itself, creating an 
overlapping condition) and stringers with custom profiles. Despite the improvements to the stair 
tools, there’s still no way to anticipate every unique and sculptural design condition. In these 
cases, we’ll show you techniques that aren’t exactly using the stair tools as intended, but the 
results will geometrically resemble stairs (and their railings).
Understanding the Stair Tools
There are two different tools for creating stairs in a project environment—Stair By Component 
and Stair By Sketch. Each of these tools uses the core stair parts (runs, supports, landings) in 
slightly different ways.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

644  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
When you choose the Stair By Sketch tool, you are using 2D sketch lines that represent 
boundaries and risers. Although you have access to a Run function in Sketch mode, it is merely 
automating the generation of the 2D sketch. You do not have direct access to manipulate the 
3D geometry of the stair when you use Stair By Sketch. In addition, the entire stair element is 
bound to the rules and settings in the stair type—you cannot customize individual parts.
If you choose to use the Stair By Component tool, you have the ability to customize runs and 
landings within the overall stair element. You also have the unique ability to edit the stair in 
a 3D view. That is to say, the stair remains visible as a complete model when you edit the stair 
(Figure 15.16) compared to a Stair By Sketch, which collapses down to the 2D layout lines when 
edited.
Figure 15.16
Editing a Stair By 
Component in a 3D 
view
There are additional subcategories of the Stairs object style that allow you to further custom-
ize the appearance of stairs and their related elements (Figure 15.17). One of the subcategories is 
Riser Lines—providing an additional dashed line parallel to the edge of the riser that indicates 
the nosing length. You can customize the appearance of these elements in Object Styles from the 
Manage tab in the ribbon. You can also adjust the visibility of the stair elements for any view in 
the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and optionally save the settings to view templates.

Creating Stairs |  645  
The fundamental concept behind the Stair By Component tool is that the major components 
of a stair (run, landing, support) are nested system families that can be independently 
customized. Although both stair tools are being maintained in the software, understanding the 
difference between all the families and types can be a challenge.
Let’s take a look at the Project Browser under Families ➢ Stairs in the default project template. 
The family called Stair is the parent system family for the Stair By Sketch tool. If you expand Stair, 
you will see the stair types that will be available to you if you launch the Stair By Sketch tool.
For the Stair By Component tool, there are three system families that function as the parent 
families. The following families are the top-level families into which other families are nested:
◆
◆
Assembled Stair
◆
◆
Cast-In-Place Stair
◆
◆
Precast Stair
Under each of these families is where you define a type to be used in your projects. For 
example, under the Cast-In-Place Stair family, you will find the Monolithic Stair type, which 
uses nested families for the run, landing, and support. To better understand this nesting, let’s 
look at the family hierarchy of the Monolithic Stair type in a simple list:
◆
◆
Family: Cast-In-Place Stair
◆
◆
Type: Monolithic Stair
◆
◆
Run Type: ¾″ Nosing (20 mm)
◆
◆
Landing Type: 7″ Thickness (300 mm)
◆
◆
Support Type: None
Figure 15.17
Additional subcategories 
are available for stairs.

In the Project Browser, you will find listings for the following nested families under the 
Stairs category:
◆

Let’s explore the ability to directly manipulate component stairs. To begin, create a stair with 
a landing using the Stair By Component tool:
	
1.	 From the Architecture tab, on the Circulation panel, choose Stair ➢ Stair By Component. 
This will bring you into Sketch mode. Draw the stair from left to right. Base the base of 
the stair on the left of the screen, and drag your mouse to the right until you place nine 
risers. Click to locate the ninth riser.
	
2.	 Now, move your mouse about 4′ (1.2 m) to the right and click again. This will create a 
landing and the base for the tenth step.
	
3.	 Drag your mouse to the right, placing the other nine risers. Your stair in sketch mode 
should look like Figure 15.18.
Figure 15.18
Creating the component 
stair with landing
Selecting the runs or the landing will display grips and temporary dimensions that can 
be used to change the width, direction, and location of the runs or landing.
	
4.	 Widen the left run and landing by selecting the portion of the stair and pulling the blue 
arrow grips down, as shown in Figure 15.19.
Figure 15.19
Widening the left run

Creating Stairs |  647  
	
5.	 Now select the landing and move the lower grip to further widen the landing, as shown 
in Figure 15.20. The landing maintains the connection to the lower run.
Figure 15.20
Extending the landing
	
6.	 Changing the shape of the landing is not possible without converting the landing to a 
sketch-based component. Select the landing and then select Convert from the Tools panel. 
This will convert the component element to a sketch-based element. Keep in mind that 
this is irreversible (Figure 15.21).
	
7.	 With the landing now sketch based, you can edit its shape and create a form that isn’t 
rectilinear. Select Edit Sketch from the Tools panel. Delete the lower sketch line and then 
replace it with an arch-shaped boundary, as shown in Figure 15.22. Finish the sketch for 
the landing, and then click Finish Edit Mode for the component stair.
Figure 15.21
Converting the land-
ing to a sketch-based 
component

648  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
The resulting stair is shown in Figure 15.23. Don’t be afraid to experiment with using both 
component and sketch-based stair tools in a single stair condition. Just remember that it’s often 
easier to start with the component stair and then modify with sketches when necessary. This is 
a very powerful, flexible combination and gives you important feedback in 3D rather than going 
back and forth between sketches and the finished stair. This file can be downloaded from the 
Chapter 15 folder on the book’s web page. Look for the c15-Stair-Landing.rvt or c15-Stair-
Landing-Metric.rvt file.

Using the Instance Properties of Stair Components
We have discussed the hierarchy of nested families and types for components in other 
chapters; stairs follow this same structure. You can Tab+select through the stair to choose 
either the stair or the rail, but you have other options as well. By hovering over the side of 
the stair, you can choose just the treads or just the stringer. Both of these selection options 
come with their own properties, but there are even more parameters available as instance 
properties of runs, landings, and supports. When you use the Stair By Sketch tool, the 
Width parameter is available as a simple instance parameter, accessible in the Properties 
palette when you are sketching the stair or afterward when a stair is selected. When the 
Stair By Component tool is activated, you can set the width of a run only after it has been 
created. If you Tab+select the run within a stair assembly, you can access the Actual Run 
Width property and change it.
The Begin With Riser and End With Riser properties are critical to integrating a stair with 
adjacent floor slabs. In the Stair By Sketch tool, these parameters are available only in the Type 
Properties dialog box, which means that you would need to create a new stair type if either of 
these conditions needed to be customized. For component stairs, these properties can be found 
in the instance properties of each run. You will need to Tab+select a run within a stair instance 
to enable or disable these parameters, but it is ultimately more flexible to use throughout your 
project.
Another important group of instance properties is assigned to the stair supports. If you 
Tab+select a support for any component stair, you will see parameters, including Lower 
End Cut and Upper End Cut in the Properties palette. These can be assigned to Vertical Cut, 
Horizontal Cut, or Perpendicular—options that are not available with the Stair By Sketch 
tool.
Using Component Stairs in Assemblies
Stairs created with the component method cannot be added to assemblies. Use the Stair By Sketch 
method if you intend to document a stair with the Assembly functionality. See Chapter 19, “Working 
in the Construction Phase,” for more information about assemblies.
Using the Components for Customizing Stairs
A key concept in making the best use of Revit is to not get hung up on how elements and 
tools are named or labeled. For example, you can use the Railing tool to create a shad-
ing device—which is obviously not a railing. This same concept applies to stairs—don’t 
overlook the nosing profile family as a device for creating interesting shapes that complete 
the tread because the shape of the nosing is not limited to traditional-nosing profiles. Any 
shape that needs to extend beyond the face of the tread is fair game to model with the 
Nosing Profile family. Just remember that you’re limited to a single profile per tread and 
stair run (Figure 15.24). You’ll also want to pay particular attention to the insertion point of 
the nosing profile, because the intersection of the reference planes coincides with the top of 
the tread and the face of the riser.

650  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Figure 15.25 shows an example from a real stair that was designed to have each tread 
fabricated from a single plate of steel and then rolled to form the face of the riser above it. 
Here, each of these treads can be welded behind the lip of the tread above it. It’s a fairly 
elegant idea that can be accomplished by using a custom-nosing profile to create the 
appearance of a continuous tread. Look closely and you can see where the actual tread ends 
and where the nosing profile begins. Final linework can be adjusted or hidden (if necessary) 
when you’re creating the details.
Figure 15.24
Custom-nosing profile
Figure 15.25
Continuous tread and 
nosing profile
Figure 15.26 shows this stair in its final form using our custom profile, but the walls are hid-
den for clarity. If you’d like to investigate this stair further, it’s in the Chapter 15 folder on the 
book’s companion web page and is called c15-Henrys Stepp.rvt.

Creating Stairs |  651  
Understanding the Stringer
Stringers in Revit are good for creating a number of standard wooden or steel conditions, and 
the right and left stringers may be customized with profiles. If you need a custom middle profile 
or a stringer that follows the railing but deviates from the standard left/right stringer location, 
use the Railing tool (Figure 15.27). The stair will host this railing containing the custom stringer 
profile (or just the custom profile, with no handrail).
Figure 15.26
Example of a custom-
ized stair and railing
Figure 15.27
Use the Railing tool 
to create a custom 
stringer profile.

652  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Notice in Figure 15.27 that the last profile is not part of the traditional portion of the railing. 
Instead, this profile is used to indicate a custom stringer profile (Figure 15.28). But it has been 
assigned to the railing to maintain a particular relationship to the stairs.
Figure 15.28
Railing profile
In Figure 15.29, we’ve isolated the railing from the stairs to illustrate the finished railing: the 
handrail, two glazed and continuous panels, and the custom stringer.
Figure 15.29
Completed railing 
profile
This railing with a custom stringer profile is perfect for a multitude of stair conditions: 
straight, curved, or even a combination (Figure 15.30). This technique finishes off the stair nicely 
and exposes the structure in interesting ways.

Creating Stairs |  653  
Figure 15.30
Finished stairs
Although the stringer usually occurs to the left or right of the treads, this is certainly not 
always the case. In some situations you’ll want to create a middle stringer using a custom 
profile. Just remember that this will be a railing that will be hosted by the stair and may not 
even contain a handrail, just the profile for the stringer (Figure 15.31). In this case, the railing is 
still being hosted by the stairs; however, there isn’t any railing geometry above the tread.
Figure 15.31
Custom middle stringer 
profile

654  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
For component stairs, you can also use a custom profile for a stringer, but instead of using 
a railing family as we previously described, you can assign it to a support type. To accomplish 
this, you must first create a duplicate support type:
	
1.	 Download and open the exercise file c15-Custom-Stringer.rvt. In the Project Browser, 
navigate to Families ➢ Stairs ➢ Stringer, right-click Stringer – Default, and then select 
Duplicate from the context menu.
	
2.	 Double-click the duplicated type to open the Type Properties dialog box. Click the 
Rename button and set the new name to Stringer – Channel. Click OK.
	
3.	 In the Section Profile parameter, select C-Channel-Profile : C9X15 (M_C-Channel-Profile : 
C250X30 in the Metric file).
	
4.	 Check the box for the Flip Section Profile parameter.
	
5.	 Finally, change the Structural Depth on Landing to 5″ (125 mm) to set the channel loca-
tion under the stair. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
	
6.	 Activate the default 3D view and select the stair in the view. In the Properties palette, 
click Edit Type.
	
7.	 Find the Right Support Type parameter and click in the parameter value field. Click again 
on the small icon in the parameter field to open the Type Properties dialog box for the 
stringer.
	
8.	 In the Type dropdown list, select Stringer - Channel and then click OK.
	
9.	 Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the Left Support Type.
	
10.	 Click OK to close the dialog box and then observe the change in the stringer support for 
the stair (Figure 15.32).
Figure 15.32
A custom profile can be 
used as a support type.
This workflow applies to a carriage support as well. Repeat the previous steps, but look for 
those support types under Families ➢ Stairs ➢ Carriage. As a final note about custom support 
profiles, you must ensure that the proper usage property is specified in the profile family when 
you are creating the shape. In the Family Editor, click the Family Category And Parameters 
button in the ribbon and make sure the Profile Usage parameter is set to Stair Support  
(Figure 15.33).

Using Balusters as Tread Supports
Common tread shapes can be pretty boring, so let’s move directly on to custom tread conditions. 
In situations where you need to be a bit more inventive, you’re going to need to know how to 
create a custom baluster. This technique can either create a custom support element for the 
default treads or indicate the actual tread.
But instead of the baluster being vertical, it’s going to be horizontal. This horizontal baluster 
will be used in conjunction with the default tread. This baluster may even completely envelop 
the tread (Figure 15.34).
Figure 15.34
Baluster as tread 
support

656  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
First, we need to discuss a few rules for creating a customized tread support for the default 
tread:
◆
◆
Not every baluster needs a railing. If your baluster support isn’t going to be a part of the 
“actual” railing, simply create a second “railing” that is hosted by the stairs. Sketching 
another path for your custom railing that only contains the tread support baluster can 
be accomplished in a few steps. The baluster family template needs to be used for the 
component that will act as the tread support. Otherwise, it can’t be associated to the railing.
◆
◆
If you have a complex support element, it may be helpful to model the desired support ele-
ment as a generic family. When you’ve finished, nest this generic element into the baluster 
family. You may want to do this because the baluster templates have hardwired reference 
planes and parameters (which is fine if you’re making a baluster that needs to geometri-
cally flex). But in some cases, we’ve found that these reference planes and parameters may 
cause your baluster to fail when you load it in the project as a result of these parameters 
flexing. By modeling the geometry elsewhere and nesting it, you avoid this hassle because 
it moves as a single component.
◆
◆
Designating the level of detail is critical. Assigning smaller model elements to only 
appear when the Detail Level of a view is set to Fine will result in much faster graphics 
regeneration, view panning, and model rotation. So if you’re nesting one component 
into another family, the detail that you’re assigning at the deepest level will be respected 
through nesting (Figure 15.35).
Figure 15.35
Single component that 
will be used as a tread 
support
Once the component is complete, you can nest it into a baluster template, as shown in Figure 
15.36. If necessary, it’s also possible to assign parameters to the dimensions in the nested 
configuration.

Creating Stairs |  657  
The completed stairs are shown in two different configurations in Figure 15.37. Many 
configurations are possible once you correctly define a single stair type. If you’d like to 
investigate this stair further, it’s in the Chapter 15 folder on the book’s web page, and the file is 
called c15-Angled-Support-Stair.rvt.
Figure 15.36
The generic model 
nested into a baluster 
family
Figure 15.37
Completed stairs with 
angled tread supports
A custom baluster support might be modeled to contain the real balusters that are intended 
to support railings. This can simplify and shorten modeling time. In the example shown in 
Figure 15.38, the baluster support geometry also contains the railing elements on both the right 

658  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
and left sides. If you’d like to investigate this stair further, it’s in the Chapter 15 folder on the 
book’s web page; the file is called c15-Support Tread.rfa.
Figure 15.38
Complex tread support 
with balusters
The previous support baluster can be brought together with a custom profile for the center 
stringer, handrails, and glazed panels to form a complete stair and railing design (Figure 15.39). 
You can download this example from the Chapter 15 folder on the book’s web page; the file is 
called c15-Center Baluster Support.rvt.

Creating Stairs |  659  
Controlling the Baluster Supports
Don’t forget to control the number of baluster supports per tread. Revit has an easy way to accom-
plish this through the railing option Use Baluster Per Tread On Stairs, found in the Edit Baluster 
Placement dialog box.
Once you’ve begun to experiment with creating balusters as tread supports for stairs, you’ll 
notice you have options for making more complete and finished conditions.
Start and end posts are useful and can help complete the structure of your custom railing 
and baluster system, particularly if you want to properly anchor and connect your custom stair 
and railing. The elements shown in Figure 15.40 are the start and end posts to anchor a custom 
railing and a baluster that will serve as the tread with integrated support. It builds on the 
previous example of using a baluster as a support element for a tread.
Figure 15.40
Custom post and 
baluster families
To finish this stair, you need to create start and end posts that anchor the stair. As with the 
previous handrail-join exercise, you’ll want to model the bulk of the custom stair with the 
custom railing. Then you’ll export the stair parts for importing into the baluster template (or the 
generic model template that will be nested into the baluster template).
Figure 15.41 shows the results after the start and end posts and custom baluster families are 
applied to a completed stair design.
When it all comes together, the results can be elegant and interesting. All of this is available 
through the default Stairs tool. You can download this stair from the Chapter 15 folder on the 
book’s web page; it’s called c15-Tube Stair.rvt.
Now let’s go one step further. There’s no reason that the baluster support element needs to 
exactly conform to the shape of the tread. And there’s no reason that the support element can’t 
contain the actual baluster that is intended to support the handrail.
Take a look at the support element in Figure 15.42. Not only does it contain the support 
element, but the support element has been modeled to exceed the shape of the tread that will be 
modeled by the Stairs tool.

660  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Figure 15.41
Finished stair with 
custom start and end 
posts
Figure 15.42
Support and baluster 
as a generic model
Keep in mind that we’ve modeled the support element as a generic model and then nested 
it into a baluster post template (Figure 15.43). Again, this keeps the baluster unified so it’s not 
affected by the built-in reference planes and parameters.

Creating Stairs |  661  
Once this custom baluster post is loaded into the project, associate it with the stair and its 
railings. Remember to select the One Baluster Per Tread option. When finished, the default 
tread is an inlay to the more complete tread support (Figure 15.44). In more complex conditions, 
it may be desirable to envelop the entire tread with the support geometry. Doing so will allow 
you to create complex tread shapes that are not dependent on the default tread and use the 
functionality of the stair and railing objects to properly locate, rotate, and elevate each of your 
custom treads. If you want to examine this stair further, check out the file c15-Curved Tread 
Support.rvt in the Chapter 15 folder on the book’s web page.

662  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Figure 15.45 shows an example using this technique. The tread support elements have been 
modeled using blends in order to sweep under the metal plate while changing direction from 
vertical to angle. This will accommodate the angled pipe rail that will support the stair.
Figure 15.45
The top and underside 
of a tread support
Treads come together in a particularly interesting stair and railing configuration. There is 
obviously a more conventional outer railing for this stair. But the inner railing doesn’t have 
any elements that occur at hand height. The entire inner railing exists to support the baluster 
supports (which in turn support the default treads). The end post is being used to anchor the 
entire structure through the second level. You can find this example, c15-Highlights.rvt, in 
the Chapter 15 folder of the book’s web page. Figure 15.46 shows the finished stair. The large 
structural element is actually a baluster that’s been designated as the end post.
Figure 15.46

large end post

Creating Stairs |  663  
Creating Stairs with Other Tools
We’ve discussed a number of different ways the parts of stairs can be manipulated and created. As 
we approach alternate modeling techniques with the goal of creating elegant stairs, understand 
that the metadata may not correspond to the geometry. This is usually the only option to complete 
a design where there are limitations to the default tools while avoiding the need to resort to 
strictly 2D representation. Because the metadata—the information part of BIM—isn’t being 
coordinated properly, you’ll want to take particular care with regard to tagging and scheduling.
A solid spiral wall can be used as a railing, or a support element can easily be created in the 
Family Editor and then associated with the stair as a start post. Of course, this geometry could 
also be created as an in-place family, but then you’d lose the advantage of being able to quickly 
and easily relocate the stair in your project (or create a multistory condition).
In Figure 15.47, you can see part of a spiral stair with default treads and supports modeled as 
balusters with the Railing tool.
Figure 15.47
Baluster used as a 
support element
Rather than create the spiral wall (Figure 15.48) as an in-place family under the stair,  
we modeled the form as a baluster post in order to associate it with the beginning of the  
railing being used for the support brackets.
Figure 15.48
A series of swept 
blends modeled in a 
post family.

664  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
To make sure the path is correct, we copied the run line of the stair into the post family 
named Spiral Start Post (Figure 15.49). Now you can use this path as you create each of the 
blended sweeps (creating only one swept blend per path). In this case the blends are being 
modeled so that there’s a 3″ (75 mm) gap between the undersides of the default treads.
Figure 15.49
Copy the stair run path 
into the post family.
Figure 15.50 shows what you get when it all comes together. The swept blend has been 
created in a post template. This post is then loaded into the project environment and associated 
with the railing type named Support Baluster that contains the baluster definition with the 
support brackets named Custom Baluster. This is also a useful technique if you have to create 
walls that need to follow either side of a stair. If the condition exists only once, you may opt to 
create this as an in-place component.
Figure 15.50
Finished stair condition

Annotating Stairs |  665  
But if it occurs more than once or might be rotated and relocated (as well as occur on many 
levels), we recommend that you create this as part of the stair and railing definition. Then it will 
be easier to maintain relationships throughout the project. To investigate this stair, download 
the c15-Concentric Stair.rvt file from the Chapter 15 folder on the book’s web page.
Annotating Stairs
Stair treads are annotated using the Tread Number tool, which is located in the Annotate tab of 
the ribbon. You can use this tool from any plan view. When this tool is activated, place a string 
of labels on any component stair by simply selecting the stair run. The tread number annotation 
can be placed at the sides, the middle, or the quarter points along the run width (Figure 15.51).
Figure 15.51
The tread number 
annotation counts 
individual treads or 
risers.
To customize the tread number annotation, select a tread number instance you have already 
placed in a view and you will find additional parameters in the Properties palette, such as 
Number Size, Orientation, and Display Rule (Figure 15.52). You can also change the start 
number in the Options bar.
Figure 15.52
Customize the 
tread number in the 
Properties palette.
The arrow and label for stairs are controlled independently of the stair type for component 
stairs. If you created a stair with the Stair By Component tool, you will notice that the arrow and 
label can be selected separately. When they’re selected, you can change the type of annotation in 
the Type Selector, and you have additional parameters in the Properties palette (Figure 15.53).
Because the stair path annotation for component stairs is a separate element, it can simply be 
deleted when you don’t need it in a view. To replace the annotation, go to the Annotate tab in 
the ribbon, and from the Symbol panel click the Stair Path button and pick a stair to apply the 
annotation.
Finally, the cut mark that displays with stairs in a plan view can be slightly customized. 
The settings for cut marks are stored in yet another system family that is nested within the 

666  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
component stair type properties. In the Project Browser, navigate to Families ➢ Stairs ➢ Stair Cut 
Mark to find the types available in the default project template. Double-click any of these types 
to observe the properties for customizing the cut mark (Figure 15.54). To assign a Cut Mark Type 
value, open the Type Properties dialog box for a component stair type and look for the Graphics 
heading.

Creating Railings |  667  
Creating Railings
Railings can be created anywhere in a project. They can be placed on stairs, ramps, floors, and 
roofs, but they are not hosted elements. The railing does not need to be dependent on a host 
object to exist. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, you will find the Railing tool in the 
Circulation panel. Click the Railing flyout and you will see Sketch Path and Place On Host.
You would use the Sketch Path tool to create a railing on a flat surface such as a slab edge. 
When the Place On Host tool is activated, you must select a stair or a ramp and the placed 
railing will follow the slope of the stair or ramp. If you choose this second option, notice in the 
contextual ribbon that you have the option to specify whether the railing will be oriented above 
the tread or the stringer (Figure 15.55)—you can always modify this after the railing has been 
placed.
Figure 15.55
Set options for tread or 
stringer placement of 
railings.
Before we create a railing, we should explain the placement of a railing on a stair a little 
further. When you use the Place On Host method, the railing path is automatically assigned 
to the edge of the stair that represents the outside face of the tread and the inside face of the 
stringer (if one is defined). The railing orientation is simply flipped to either side of this path—
toward the tread or toward the stringer. In the Properties palette, you will find a parameter 
named Tread/Stringer Offset that is set to –0′-1″ (–25 mm) by default. Most rail and baluster 
families are developed along a center axis; therefore, the Tread/Stringer Offset value pushes the 
railing to one side or the other of the railing’s path. To modify this orientation after a railing has 
been placed, select a railing and either click the flip arrow that appears in the view window or 
right-click and select Flip Orientation from the context menu. The Tread/Stringer Offset value 
will remain the same no matter which way the railing is oriented.
When you use the Place On Host option of the Railing tool, be aware that you will not be 
able to click stairs that already have railings. You will not be prompted with a warning or an 
error—you simply can’t select the host object. If you do find a stair or ramp on which you would 
like to place a railing, also be aware that one railing type will be applied to both sides of the host 
object. If you want a different railing for the outside of a stair element, you can use the Place On 
Host tool and change one of the rails with the Type Selector either before it is placed or after. If 
you are using the Stair or Ramp tool, you can choose the option to automatically place railings 
when the stair or ramp is created.
New to Revit 2017, when you click the Railing button from the Circulation panel on the 
Architecture ribbon, you will no longer be given a dialog box asking you to pick a railing type. 
Now, those choices are simply made with the type selector. From the drop-down list in the type 
selector, you can choose any railing type defined in the project. For stairs only, you can define 
the placement of the railing to be along the treads or the stringers.

668  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Where would you need to use these sketch segment options for railings? You can use them 
to customize a railing that has been placed on a host. For example, you may need to continue a 
railing from a stair run onto a flat landing. Let’s try this out in an exercise:
	
1.	 Download and open the file c15-Railing-Tool.rvt or c15-Railing-Tool-Metric.rvt 
from this book’s web page.
	
2.	 There is a sample stair from Level 1 up to Level 2, and a railing has already been placed 
on the stair. Open the Level 2 floor plan. Select the railing along the outer edge of the stair 
and click Edit Path on the Mode panel in the contextual ribbon.
	
3.	 In the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon, select the Line tool and draw a line from 
the end of the existing railing sketch, as shown in Figure 15.56. Include a short segment 
extending in the direction of the existing sketch line, and then draw the next segment to 
the perpendicular edge of the floor landing.
Figure 15.56
Draw two new sketch 
lines to extend the 
railing path.
	
4.	 Select both new sketch segments you drew in step 3, and from the Options bar, set the 
Slope option to Flat. Now, this step may not be necessary because the railing sketch 
should be aware that the floor below is flat, but this is the best way to ensure consistent 
results with manually sketched railing paths.
	
5.	 Click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to finish the sketch, and activate the 
Default 3D view to observe your results (Figure 15.57).

Creating Railings |  669  
Creating a Custom Railing
Now that we’ve reviewed the major components of stairs and railings, let’s create a rail. The rail 
we’re going to make is a stainless steel cable railing with flat steel stock posts. Our completed 
railing will look like Figure 15.58. You can adapt the workflow we’re going to complete to create 
just about any typical railing.
Figure 15.57
The completed railing 
has been extended 
onto the landing.
Figure 15.58
The finished cable 
railing
	
1.	 To begin, we need to build some of the components of the railing. The rail will have a 
stainless steel top rail, which is already part of our default project template. However, 
we will need to create the cables and the posts. Let’s start with the cable. Select the 
Application button and choose New ➢ Family. Select the Profile-Rail.rft or Metric 
Profile-Rail.rft family template. You’ll see two intersecting reference planes and 
some text describing the Rail Centerline and the Rail Top.

670  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
	
2.	 We’re going to create the cable, which is a simple, circular extrusion. On the Create tab, 
select the Line tool from the Detail panel. Use this tool to create a circle that is ½″ (12 mm) 
in diameter (Figure 15.59). Save this file as Cable.rfa.
Figure 15.59
The cable profile family
	
3.	 We need to do a similar thing to create the stainless steel posts. Select the Application 
button again, choose New ➢ Family, and select Baluster-Post.rft or Metric 
Baluster-Post.rft from the list of new families. This will open the Left elevation view 
of the family. From the Project Browser activate the Ref. Level plan. We’re going to make 
an extrusion that will become our baluster.
	
4.	 You’ll notice that the tools in this family are different from those in the profile family we 
just created. The profile family was simple 2D linework that will extrude along a path to 
create the cable. In this baluster family, we’re going to create a 3D element. In the plan 
view, choose Extrusion from the Forms panel of the Create tab. Using the intersection of 
the reference planes as the lower-left corner of the form, create a box that measures 1 ½″ × 
½″ (40 mm × 12 mm). The shape should look like Figure 15.60. Don’t worry about adding 
the dimensions.
Figure 15.60
Using the Extrusion 
tool to create the post
With the shape created, click the green check mark in the contextual tab of the ribbon 
to make the form. You’ll see your box in plan, but for the next step, activate the Front 
elevation view from the Project Browser. You’ll see a short extrusion of the form you just 
created with the base at the Ref. Level. You’ll also see two reference planes above the 
form—one represents the typical railing height and the other (the higher one) represents 
the typical guard rail height.

Creating Railings |  671  
	
5.	 Switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon and choose the Align tool, and align the bottom 
of the extrusion to the Ref. Level and the top of the extrusion to the lower reference plane 
(Figure 15.61). Make sure to activate the lock after each alignment. When you’ve finished, 
save the new family as SS-Post.rfa.
Figure 15.61
Align the post to the 
reference planes.
	
6.	 With both of these families created, you can now make the railing. Open a new project 
file and load both of these families into it. Choose the Railing command and select Sketch 
Path. Draw a simple line of any length. That will become your railing. Now, while you’re 
in the Railing command, you need to create a new system family type to be your rail. 
Since this is a system family, like walls or floors, you need to create the rail by duplicating 
an existing one. Choose Handrail – Pipe and select Edit Type from the Properties palette.
	
7.	 In the Type Properties dialog box, choose Duplicate and name the new family Cable Rail. 
Click OK to close the Name dialog box. The family you duplicated shares many of the fea-
tures of the rail you want. The top rail is a circular pipe, and the rail itself is 3’ (900 mm) 
tall. You need to modify the Rail Structure (Non-Continuous) and the Baluster Placement 
options. Begin with the Rail Structure (Non-Continuous). Choose the Edit button to open 
the Edit Rails (Non-Continuous) dialog box. This dialog box has rails that are spaced 6″ 
(150 mm) apart using the Circular Handrail profile. You want to change a few things here. 
First, under the Profile heading, change the profile to Cable : Cable, which is the railing 
profile you just created. You can do that by selecting Cable : Cable from the drop-down 
menu. Do this for all of the profiles.
	
8.	 Next, you want to change the rail spacing from 6″ (150 mm) to 4″ (100 mm). Modify each 
of the rails to show a 4″ (100 mm) increment. Your rails from bottom to top will read as 
follows:
4″ (100 mm)
8″ (200 mm)

672  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
1′-0″ (300 mm)
1′-4″ (400 mm)
1′-8″ (500 mm)
This won’t be sufficient to make it to the bottom of the top rail, so you’ll need to add more 
rails. Click the Insert button to add three more rails: Rail 6, Rail 7, and Rail 8. Make the 
profile for all of those Cable : Cable and give them a height of 2′-0″ (600 mm), 2′-4″ (700 mm), 
and 2′-8″ (800 mm), respectively. Here you can also define the materiality of the rail. 
We’ve applied Stainless Steel to all of the rails. The completed dialog box will look like 
Figure 15.62. Once you’ve finished, click OK.
Figure 15.62
The completed 
Edit Rails (Non-
Continuous) dialog 
box
	
9.	 Now you need to adjust the baluster. In the Type Properties dialog box, at Baluster 
Placement, select Edit. This opens the Edit Baluster Placement dialog box.
	
10.	 First, like in the rail, you need to modify the family that is used to make the baluster. 
From the Baluster Family drop-down menu for both the Main Pattern (the upper portion 
of the dialog box) and the Posts (the lower portion of the dialog box), change the family to 
SS Post : SS Post. Also, you want the post centered under the top rail. Because you built 
the post family to one side of the reference planes, you need to offset the post to center it. 
In the Offset column on the far right, enter a value of ¾″ (19 mm). The finished dialog box 
will look like Figure 15.63.

Creating Railings |  673  
	
11.	 Click OK twice to finish the rail. The completed cable railing will look like Figure 15.64. 
You can see how quick and easy it is to create some simple railings. You can find the 
finished railing, c15-SS Railing.rvt, on the book’s web page.

674  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Creating Glass Railings with the Curtain Wall Tool
The most challenging railings often require exceptions to the rules. This usually means 
you’re trying to manually locate balusters or use panels that are not part of the routine railing 
definition. If you tried to define each of these exceptions as a different railing type, your project 
would be overflowing with railing types. The best solution for these types of railings is to 
diverge from the Railing tool and use the Curtain Wall tool.
By using the Curtain Wall tool, you’ll be able to create railings by modeling the balusters 
and panels inside the Curtain Panel family template (Figure 15.65). Another nice feature about 
this technique is that the railing is a room-bounding element because it is actually a wall. That 
makes this perfect for mezzanine conditions that require area calculations—certainly more 
efficient than creating redundant room-separation lines!
Figure 15.65
Curtain panel as a 
railing
Start by creating a single panel using the Curtain Panel template. The family may contain not 
only the panel for the railing but also the balusters. Once you load this panel into your project, 
you can create curtain walls with predefined panel widths (Figure 15.66).
Figure 15.66
Curtain panel railing 
with custom baluster 
locations

Using the Railing Tool for Other Objects |  675  
Because curtain panels allow you to unpin predefined grids (as well as create other grid 
locations), you’ll be able to quickly and easily make exceptions to the rules that you previously 
defined (Figure 15.67) and create several unique baluster locations specific to the installation.
Figure 15.67
Adjusted baluster 
locations
When you’re creating railings as curtain walls, be sure to filter your schedules accordingly 
to prevent these “railings” from being included in your curtain wall schedules. If you want 
to download this example project, it’s in the Chapter 15 folder on the book’s web page and is 
named c15-CurtainWall-Railing.rvt.
These outside-the-box techniques should give you some great ideas for making custom 
railings faster and more interesting than you could ever have imagined.
Using the Railing Tool for Other Objects
Currently, Revit software doesn’t have a specific tool to allow components to be quickly and 
easily distributed along a user-defined path. In some cases you could use line-based families, 
but these don’t work in curved conditions. You could also experiment with adaptive components 
in the conceptual massing environment, but that could be too complicated for a simple, repeat-
ing element. In the meantime, consider using the Railing tool to distribute elements along paths 
for a variety of uses besides just for railings.
Carefully Identifying Customized Model Elements
In this chapter we will make a few suggestions to use tools designed to create one type of element 
to generate other types of model elements. We highly recommend you take care in identifying such 
elements so that they may be clearly understood by other people who might use your model. If not 
Continues

676  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
When using railing functionality outside of a railing to distribute elements along paths, keep 
in mind these three rules:
◆
◆
You’ll probably want to nest your family into a baluster family template (rather than 
creating it directly as a baluster). This is because the existing parameters within the 
baluster family can cause your geometry to fly apart if it needs to move up and down as a 
single element.
◆
◆
Don’t expect your nested element to schedule or tag. If you need the elements to schedule 
or tag individually, you probably want to place them individually (or use another 
technique, like a line-based family).
◆
◆
Don’t share parameters of nested families in an attempt to schedule. Your element won’t 
schedule properly.
In some cases, you’ll want the railing family to have associated profiles, like the shading 
device in Figure 15.68. The railing profiles are used to create the shading fins, and the balusters 
are the support elements.
clearly identified, these elements could cause trouble in BIM applications such as 3D coordination, 
quantity surveying, and estimating and where specification databases are connected to the design 
model. Here are some suggestions for identification:
◆
◆
Use the Assembly Code property to assign an appropriate system description.
◆
◆
Provide a unique and clearly recognizable Type Name value.
◆
◆
Provide a clear description in the Type Comments field.
Whatever method you choose to identify these types of customized elements, be sure to indicate 
the method in your project’s execution plan. Whether it is a BIM execution plan, project execution 
plan, or other similar document, this type of communication and collaboration is essential to the 
reduction of errors and rework.

Using the Railing Tool for Other Objects |  677  
Using railings to quickly and evenly distribute components along a path is great during 
design and allows for quick iteration. Outdoor elements like lampposts are particularly 
appropriate for distributed placement (Figure 15.69). In this example, a lamppost has been 
nested into a baluster family.
Figure 15.69
Lamppost nested into 
a baluster family
Once this lamppost has been nested in the baluster family, you’ll be able to create a custom 
“railing” with the lamp designated as the “baluster.” This will allow you to quickly and easily 
distribute lampposts along a sketch at specific intervals that can be modified as a parameter. 
So, for example, if the lamppost was originally distributed on 60′ (18 m) centers, you could very 
quickly redefine it to occur on 40′ (12 m) intervals (Figure 15.70).
Figure 15.70
Lampposts distributed 
along a path as a baluster 
family

678  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
You can use this for any repetitive elements that must be placed on center and evenly 
distributed along a path. Other uses might include pipe bollards and outdoor planting.
Even a design pass at light rail tracks (including railcars) can be distributed along paths 
(Figure 15.71). In this case, the rail sleepers are balusters, and profiles are used to create the rails 
and the rail bed. The monorails are easy too. The vertical supports and railcars are balusters, 
and the suspended track is the rail profile. This file can be downloaded from the Chapter 15 
folder on the book’s web page. Look for the c15-Monorail and Railway Railing.rvt file.

Important Best Practices
Here are some best practices to consider with regard to creating complex stairs and railings:
◆
◆
Don’t forget to nest your family components whenever possible and appropriate. This will keep 
the components together when associated with some other template that contains hardwired 
parameters and reference planes. It will also save you time during design changes and iteration.
◆
◆
Don’t struggle with creating the stairs in this chapter. If you get stuck, you can download the 
sample stairs from this chapter’s files and use them for a starting point when creating your 
custom stair. Just remember, it’s usually easier to build and test a custom stair or railing in a 
sample project first. Then copy and paste or use Transfer Project Standards to get the custom 
stair or railing from the test project to your actual project. Download sample files for this 
document at the book’s web page. You’ll probably want to copy your custom stairs and railings 
in an easy-to-access project that contains several finished examples (since they can’t be kept 
as family components).
◆
◆
The level of detail and visibility is crucial if you care about graphic refresh times and printing. 
As you model the components of your custom stairs and railings, assign appropriate orientation 
and level of detail (Coarse, Medium, or Fine). You’ll notice a difference when you pan and rotate 
your model.

The Bottom Line |  679  
◆
◆
Take care to filter schedules. Using a curtain wall as a railing may have certain advantages, 
but you also want to make sure your curtain wall schedules are filtered to exclude these types 
of elements.
Overall, be careful when reaching into your bag of tips and tricks! You need to weigh the cost 
of implementing a new process against the cost of doing what’s familiar. Make sure that you’re 
maintaining a balance between predictability and efficiency. There are frequently two extremes that 
you need to avoid:
◆
◆
High predictability; low efficiency. Most people will grasp the solution that you intend to imple-
ment; they’ll fully understand the technology and technique. But they’ll also quickly realize that 
managing design changes and iteration will be highly manual and time-consuming. And the 
rest of the team will doubt your leadership and understanding of the technology and processes.
◆
◆
High efficiency; low predictability. The solution will be very efficient to manage the design, but 
only you or a few team members will understand what you’ve created. Everyone else on the 
team will resist making any changes to your creation out of fear that they’ll break it.
So, what’s important with creating interesting and innovative stairs and railings is that you manage 
to strike a balance between these two extremes. Just remember these four simple characteristics:
◆
◆
Beneficial: Not just to you but to the project team
◆
◆
Efficient: Implementation and changes that are fast and predictable
◆
◆
Elegant: Understood by the team and by any new team members
◆
◆
Repeatable: Can be used on many projects
If you can’t remember these guidelines, the handy acronym of BEER should help. When you are not 
sure which solution is the best one to follow, your team will tend to gravitate to whatever allows 
them to have a beer at the end of the day.
In other words, whatever allows them to decompress, reenergize, and come back to work the 
next day refreshed, focused, and enthusiastic will ultimately win out. And keep in mind that this 
principle isn’t just important to stairs and railings or Revit or BIM but also important to having 
an interesting life.
The Bottom Line
Understand the key components of stairs and railings.    Having a complete understanding 
of the components of stairs is important. You don’t want to set about breaking the rules until 
you understand how best (and when) those rules can be broken.
Master It    What are the essential parts of stairs?
Understand the different stair tools and apply them to custom designs.    Designing in a 
spreadsheet is hard. Step back and consider what you’re trying to accomplish. If you’ll look at 
the components that make up stairs, you’ll see some interesting opportunities.
Master It    How would you create a continuous tread that wasn’t monolithic? What would 
you do if you wanted to create a custom stringer? Are balusters always vertical and used 
to support handrails? What if your particular stair just can’t be modeled in the Stairs tool?

680  | CHAPTER 15  Creating Stairs and Railings 
Design railings and use the Railing tool for other model elements.    From model patterns 
to geometric intricacy, there’s a lot that can be created with the Railing tool. When this 
doesn’t work, look to the Curtain Wall tool for “railings” that can contain space and allow 
“balusters” to be conveniently unlocked.
Master It    Why would you not use a railing to manage repetitive relationships? What if 
you need to accurately distribute geometry along a path?
Implement best practices.    There are specific best practices when creating custom stairs and 
railings. Pay attention to nesting geometry, maintaining the right level of detail, and filtering 
schedules so the metadata ends up in the right place.
Master It    Is it possible to create solutions that are too efficient? What’s the big deal with 
detail levels? And finally, what’s the most important thing to remember before creating 
an elegant workaround?

 part 5 
 Documentation 
 Up to now, we’ve discussed how to create an Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture model and use BIM 
to derive interesting forms, create parametric content, and perform analysis on your design. Part 
5 focuses on how to document those designs in the construction document phase and ultimately 
present those drawings to project stakeholders. 
 We will walk through the process of creating detail views and 2D content (detailing); generat-
ing different types of plan views and sheets (documenting); and fi nally, how to add text, notes, and 
dimensions (annotating). 
 ◆ chapter  16 : Detailing Your Design 
 ◆ chapter  17 : Documenting Your Design 
 ◆ chapter  18 : annotating Your Design 


 chapter 16
Detailing Your Design   
 As you’ve seen so far, you can show information in Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software in 
a variety of ways, including 3D views, plans, sections, and elevations. In each of these cases, the 
geometry is typically modeled based on design intent, meaning that your goal isn’t to model every-
thing but to model enough to capture the overall scope of the proposed building. To this end, it 
becomes necessary to embellish the model in specifi c views with more detailed information. These 
take the shape of 2D detail elements that you will use to augment views and add extra information. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Create details 
 
◆
 Add detail components to families 
 
◆
 Learn effi cient detailing 
 
◆
 Reuse details from other fi les 
 creating Details 
 If you are accustomed to using 2D CAD software applications to create drawings, you should 
fi rst be aware of how the detailing process in Revit differs from CAD drafting. In Autodesk ® 
AutoCAD ® software, for example, you would create a new DWG fi le and then add lines, arcs, 
circles, hatch patterns, text, and dimensions to develop a detail. You might use blocks to com-
bine repeatable elements to increase effi ciency and maintain consistency. In Revit, you will 
 create additional views within the project fi le, to which you might add 2D embellishment along 
with annotation and dimensions. Details can incorporate parts of the 3D model or can be empty 
views exclusive to 2D elements. 
 View types for Detailing 
 Before we discuss the process of detailing, let’s review the fundamental views in which you can 
create details: detail views and drafting views. 
Detail Views  Detail views are essentially subsets of the views we’ve discussed previously 
in this book such as plans, elevations, and sections. When you create a new section or callout, 
you have the option to select Detail View from the Type Selector. The model is still displayed 
in a detail view, although you can set the Display Model view property to Do Not Display if 
necessary. 
 Because you can use detailing tools in any view, we will refer to any view that displays the 
model as a detail view throughout the remainder of this chapter. 

684  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
Refer to Chapter 2, “Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization,” 
for more information about the difference between callouts and detail views.
Drafting Views    Drafting views do not display model content. Instead, they are simply a 
blank canvas within which you can create details using only 2D elements such as lines, arcs, 
circles, or 2D families. Drafting views can be associated with sections or callouts, but those 
view references will display a reference label such as SIM (similar) or TYP (typical). You can 
customize the Reference Label value in the type properties of each view.
Download and open the file c16-Sample-Building.rvt or c16-Sample-Metric.rvt from 
this book’s web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017).
From the Project Browser, activate the view Section 2, and you will see an overall section of 
the building. We will create a more detailed section callout of the exterior wall at the right side 
of the view. Let’s walk through the steps to generate this view:
	
1.	 Switch to the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel, and then click Callout ➢ 
Rectangle.
	
2.	 In the Type Selector, change the view type to Wall Section.
	
3.	 Sketch a rectangular region around the exterior wall at the right side of the building.
	
4.	 When you finish sketching the new callout, it should look like the section view shown in 
Figure 16.1. Double-click the callout head to activate the new view.
Figure 16.1

Creating Details |  685  
	
5.	 In the Properties palette, change the View Name to Wall Section North, set the Detail 
Level to Medium, and change the Scale to 1/2″=1′-0″ (1:25).
You have taken the first step toward creating the path from the overall down to the  
specific. From the plan and an overall section, you have created a wall section. Before we 
drill down even further, let’s break the view down in order to isolate only the transition 
conditions at floors and roof.
	
6.	 Select the crop region in the wall section view and you will see a number of view break icons. 
Click one of the Horizontal View Break icons along either vertical edge of the crop region.
	
7.	 You now have two crop subregions, but you will need to create one more. Select the crop 
region again, and then click and drag the grip at the bottom of the upper subregion to 
stretch it downward. Do not drag it too close to the lower subregion because it will rejoin 
the subregions back into the original crop boundary.
	
8.	 Use the grips at the top edge and bottom edge of the three subregions to show the inter-
section conditions with the Level 1, Level 2, and Roof.
	
9.	 Select the crop region once again, and you will see vertical double arrows at the middle of 
each subregion. Use these arrows to move the subregions closer together.
The final result of this exercise should look like the image in Figure 16.2.

686  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
Working with the Detailing Process
Now that you have completed the setup of a detail view, we will discuss three different method-
ologies with which you can approach the detailing process: stand-alone detailing, hybrid detail-
ing, and model detailing. These are terms we invented to help you understand and plan your 
detailing efforts as your skills improve in the Revit environment.
Stand-alone Detailing (Beginner)    If you are relatively new to the Revit environment, you 
might choose to develop your details without any part of the 3D model serving the detail. In 
this scenario, you can use either detail views or drafting views; however, you may tend to use 
more of the latter. If you use detail views, the Display Model view property (in the Property 
Palette with the view selected) will most often be set to Do Not Display. This setting allows you 
to see the model components in a regular line weight, half tone, or not at all in a detail view.
With a stand-alone detailing approach, you forfeit some ability to ensure your details accu-
rately reflect the modeled condition. In a detail view, you may temporarily return the Display 
Model view property to Normal or Halftone, but you may be able to draft more comfortably 
using the blank canvas of an empty view.
Hybrid Detailing (Intermediate)    As you become more experienced with detailing in Revit, 
you may start to use a more balanced number of detail views and drafting views. With a hybrid 
approach you will maintain the model in any detail views and you will add detail components 
to embellish the 3D model. This approach tends to yield a more accurate representation of 
the intended design, but it will require more time and care to maintain as the model evolves 
throughout the design process. This is the workflow used by most teams detailing in Revit.
In Figure 16.3, you can see a detail view in which the Display Model view property has been 
set to Halftone. This illustrates the difference between what is modeled and what is a detail 
component.
Figure 16.3
Example of a detail view with 
embellished drafting

Detailing Tools |  687  
Model Detailing (Advanced)    The most complex approach to detailing can also be the most 
efficient—once you become familiar with creating families and customizing your project 
templates. The approach we refer to as model detailing still involves the use of some detail 
components; however, they are embedded into model elements where applicable. For exam-
ple, in a wood-framed structure, detail elements such as sill plates, studs, joists, or anchors 
can be embedded in wall type definitions. The details will display automatically when the 
walls are displayed in a section detail view.
With any of these three methods we’ve described, there is a range in which you can use the 
model to help generate your details. You should plan your approach before you begin detail-
ing in your project. As always, the more time you spend preparing your template content in the 
beginning, the less time you will need to develop your details later in the project.
Detailing Tools
Even when you’re creating details, Revit has a variety of parametric tools to allow you to lever-
age working in a BIM environment. You can use these tools to create strictly 2D geometry or to 
augment details you are trying to create from 3D plans, sections, or callouts. To become truly 
efficient at using Revit to create the drawings necessary to both design and document your 
project, it’s important to become acquainted with these tools—you will find yourself using them 
over and over again throughout your process. All of these tools are located on the Detail panel 
of the Annotate tab.
This small but very potent toolbox is what you will need to familiarize yourself with in order 
to create a majority of the 2D linework and components that will become the details in your 
project. To better demonstrate how these tools are used, let’s step through them to explain each 
one’s purpose. Note that some of the tools may not be available depending on the active view. 
For best results, make sure you have a plan or detail view active before continuing.
Using the Detail Line Tool
The Detail Line tool is the first tool located on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab. This tool is 
the closest thing you’ll find to CAD drafting because it allows you to create view-specific line-
work using different line styles and it provides tools for drawing and manipulating different 
line shapes.
Detail lines are view specific—they appear only in the view in which they’re drawn. They 
also have an arrangement to their placement, meaning that you can layer them underneath or 
on top of other objects. This is especially important when you begin using a combination of 
regions, detail lines, and model content to create your details.
Using the Detail Line tool is fairly easy. Selecting the tool will change your ribbon tab to look 
like Figure 16.4. This new tab will have several panels that allow you to add and manipulate 
linework.

688  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
There are three major panels on this new tab: Line Style, Draw, and Modify. Because of their 
use sequence (selecting the line type, creating the shape, and modifying the line), we’ll talk 
about them in order from right to left.
Line Style    This panel includes a drop-down menu that allows you to choose a line style in 
which to produce the linework in this view. The drop-down menu has all the default Revit 
line styles as well as any custom ones you might have made for your project or to accom-
modate office or client standards. The active line will be the one displayed in the drop-down 
window before it’s expanded.
New line styles can be added at any time in the project, and many offices find it necessary to 
add custom line styles beyond the thin, medium, and wide ones available in Revit out of the 
box. To add more styles or to just see the complete list, choose Additional Settings from the 
Manage tab and select Line Styles. For more information about creating your own custom 
line styles, refer to Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards.”
Draw    The Draw panel contains a number of geometry tools to draw within the active view. 
The tools allow you to create lines, boxes, circles, splines, ellipses, and arcs. The last tool in 
the bottom row is the Pick tool. This tool allows you to select a line previously drawn or por-
tion of a model element (say an edge) and add linework on top of the existing shape.
Modify    The Modify panel has several tools that you can use to modify any of the linework 
already placed within the view. The larger tools, from left to right, are Align, Offset, Mirror 
(axis), Mirror (line), Move, Copy, Rotate, and Trim.
Using the Linework Tool
Although not part of the Annotate tab, the Linework tool helps you make your detail compo-
sition more legible. Default settings for object styles and line weights will manage most of a 
view’s composition automatically, but you sometimes need to adjust a line or two to clarify a 
detail. The Linework tool allows you to modify the edges of model elements in a view-specific 
context. Note that this tool is not available in a drafting view because it works only on model 
elements.
To use the Linework tool, switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, locate the View panel, and 
click Linework. This will add the familiar Line Style selector panel at the end of the ribbon. 
Simply choose the line style you want to assign, and then select an edge of a model element.

Detailing Tools |  689  
The edges you pick can be almost anything: cut lines of walls, families, edges of floor slabs, and 
so on. Selecting the edge of an element will change the default line style to the style you have 
chosen. To return an edge to its original line style, use the Linework tool again, but select <By 
Category> from the Line Style drop-down list.
You can also choose to remove lines using this tool. By selecting the <Invisible Lines> line 
type, you can make some edges disappear. Use this method instead of covering unwanted lines 
with masking regions.
Another great use of the Linework tool is to indicate the edges of overhead ceilings or floors 
in a floor plan view. To accomplish this task, set the Underlay property of the active view to the 
level where the ceiling, floor, or roof is associated. If necessary, set the Underlay Orientation to 
Reflected Ceiling Plan. Start the Linework tool, select an overhead line style, and then pick any 
edges you’d like to see in the floor plan view. When you’re finished, set the Underlay property 
back to None, and not only will the lines you created with the Linework tool remain, but they 
will update if the overhead model object is modified.
Let’s use the Linework tool to continue our exercise with the wall section detail by following 
these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, locate the View panel, and then click the Linework 
tool.
	
2.	 From the Line Style drop-down menu in the contextual tab of the ribbon, choose Medium 
Lines.
	
3.	 As indicated in Figure 16.5, click the inside face and the outside face of the exterior wall. 
Also click the edge of the wall below the window sill.

690  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
Using Filled Regions and Masking Regions
The next tool on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab is the Region tool, which contains two 
individual commands: Filled Region and Masking Region. Regions are two-dimensional areas 
of any shape or size that you can fill with a pattern. This pattern (much like a hatch in AutoCAD 
software) will dynamically adjust based on changes to the region boundary. You can manipu-
late the draw order of regions in the same manner as detail lines. Regions also have a type 
property (Background) that can be set to Opaque (hiding the objects they are placed over) or 
Transparent (letting the elements below show through).
Filled regions allow you to choose from a variety of hatch patterns to fill the region. These 
are commonly used in details to illustrate materials like rigid insulation, concrete, or plywood. 
Masking regions, on the other hand, do not include a fill pattern. Masking regions are typically 
used to “hide” or mask certain content from a view that you don’t want shown or printed. As an 
example, there might be a particularly detailed way in which two walls join and their materials 
overlap. In some cases, it doesn’t make sense to model that condition, and it makes more sense 
to use detail lines to describe the condition. Here you would need to mask a portion of the view 
so you can essentially draw over it with new content.
When selecting the Region tool, you will be taken directly into Sketch mode, and you’ll have 
a series of tools similar to those for drawing detail lines. The Draw panel allows you to create 
any number of shapes with all the associated tools to move, copy, or offset the linework.
When creating either kind of region, it’s important to note that you cannot complete Sketch 
mode unless the boundaries you draw are in closed loops. You can create as many closed-loop 
boundaries as you want as long as they do not overlap and are all formed with closed loops 
(Figure 16.6). Notice in the figure that, in addition to the use of multiple closed loops, you can 
use any combination of line styles to draw the boundary of a region.
Doors and Symbolic Lines
In the architecture industry, doors are typically modeled in a closed position but shown as open and 
with a door swing direction in plan view. To get this dual representation, in the Family Editor turn 
off the visibility of the door panel (extruded solid form) in the plan view and draw the 90-degree 
open door panel and its swing using symbolic lines. Control this visibility in the family environ-
ment using the Visibility settings explained in the next section of this chapter.
Symbolic lines can be controlled using the same Visibility settings available for detail components 
and the solid model elements in the family. You can use the same logic and draw the dashed lines 
that represent the door-opening direction in elevations.

Detailing Tools |  691  
Another consideration for using regions is the linework that borders a region. When start-
ing the Region tool, you’ll be able to choose the line style you want to use for the border of the 
region from the Line Style drop-down (similar to working with detail lines). You can change 
line styles for any of the segments of the region and even make them all different if needed.
One especially useful segment line style is <Invisible Lines>. When drawn in Sketch mode, 
these appear as gray lines, but once the sketch is completed, they become invisible lines. When 
used with a masking region, this line style can create a completely invisible box that allows 
you to hide elements that are unwanted in a particular view. Figure 16.7 shows the same 
masking region in two instances, one selected and the other not selected. You can see how 
the masking region seems to disappear, covering the filled region. Use caution if you decide 
to use masking regions with invisible boundary lines because you will not be aware of their 
existence unless you hover the mouse pointer over them. In the example shown in Figure 16.7, 
the end result can also be achieved by modifying the filled region and drawing two additional 
invisible lines.
Figure 16.6
Multiple shapes within 
a single filled region
Figure 16.7
A masking region selected 
and not selected
Filled regions have slightly more options because, unlike masking regions, they let you con-
trol the parameters of the fill pattern. Filled region types are another type of Revit system fam-
ily. A region type created in one view can be used in any other view, and modifying the type 
properties of a region in one view changes it in all the other views.

692  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
Figure 16.8 shows the list of filled region types from one of our office templates. You’ll notice 
that many of the region names are indicative of various materials. Instead of naming the filled 
region types according to their graphic properties, such as Diagonal-Up, it’s a good idea to use 
the identity parameters such as Type Mark and Assembly Code to help extend the effectiveness 
of even 2D detail elements.
Figure 16.8
Selecting a filled region type 
from the Type Selector within the 
Properties palette

Detailing Tools |  693  
The filled regions also have additional properties. By highlighting any placed region, you can 
open its type properties from the Properties palette by clicking Edit Type (Figure 16.9). These 
properties allow you to control the fill pattern, background opacity, line weight, and color of the 
region. Remember that these properties are by type, so if you want a region that is opaque and 
then decide you also want one that is transparent, you’ll need to create another type.
Standardizing Type Names for Filled Regions
Having some sort of naming convention applied to your filled region types can help you ­organize 
the Type Selector in a way that is easy for the project team to understand. You’ll notice in Figure 
16.8 that we’ve organized the region names around a two-number MasterSpec division prefix. 
Because MasterSpec is tied to the keynoting system as well, project teams tend to be familiar with 
the naming convention. This approach also keeps similar material types together rather than all 
of the materials being sorted alphabetically. Take Concrete and Precast Concrete as an example. 
You can see in Figure 16.8 that those material types are very close together in the drop-down list 
based on their prefix.
Figure 16.9
Type properties for 
a filled region

694  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
As we discussed in Chapter 4, filled regions can use either a drafting pattern or a model 
pattern. Refer to Chapter 4 for instructions on how to create a custom fill pattern. For now, let’s 
review the process of creating a new filled region type.
Creating a New Filled Region Type
To create a new filled region type, begin by duplicating an existing region and then modify its 
properties. Follow these steps to get started:
	
1.	 Switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon, and on the Detail panel click Region ➢ Filled 
Region. Click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette.
	
2.	 Click Duplicate in the Type Properties dialog box.
	
3.	 Name your new region Earth Fill, and then click the button in the Fill Pattern field to 
open the Fill Pattern dialog box.
	
4.	 Make sure you have Drafting selected at the bottom of the Fill Patterns dialog box. Select 
the pattern named Earth.
Note that you can create filled region types with model patterns; however, you must make 
sure the region types are named clearly so you can recognize the difference between 
similar regions. For example, the filled region you would use to indicate brick masonry in 
a section is a drafting pattern (diagonal hatch), whereas a brick surface pattern is a model 
pattern and can be used in an elevation or plan view.
	
5.	 When you finish, click OK until you exit all the dialog boxes. The same region patterns 
that you created for a filled region can also be associated with material surfaces or cuts by 
accessing the Materials dialog box from the Manage tab in the ribbon.
Placing a Filled Region
Now that you have created a new filled region type, let’s add a region to the detail and explore 
how different boundaries can be used to create unique graphics without separate linework. If 
you continue from the previous exercise, the Filled Region command will still be active. If not, 
switch to the Annotate tab of the ribbon, locate the Detail panel, and then click Region ➢ Filled 
Region and follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Line Style panel in the ribbon, select Wide Lines from the drop-down menu.
	
2.	 In the Draw panel of the contextual tab in the ribbon, select the Line tool and then sketch 
an area to the right of the slab edge at the bottom of the detail view. Use the image in 
Figure 16.10 as a guide.
	
3.	 After you complete a closed loop of lines, hold down the Ctrl key while selecting the 
lines to the right and below the top line of the sketch, as shown in Figure 16.10. With mul-
tiple lines selected, go back to the Line Style drop-down menu in the ribbon and choose 
<Invisible Lines>.
	
4.	 Click the green check mark in the ribbon (Finish Edit Mode). The resulting filled region 
will look similar to the image shown in Figure 16.11.

Detailing Tools |  695  
The sketch line in the filled region boundary that is coincident with the edge of the slab 
should be of the same line weight as the setting for the slab. In this sample file, both Floors 
and Wide Lines are set to a line weight of 5.
Adding Detail Components
Another important tool for detailing is the detail component—a family that consists of exclu-
sively 2D geometry. You can schedule detail components, tag them, and assign keynotes. 
Because they are families, they can also be stored in your office library and shared easily across 
projects.

696  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
To add a detail component to a view, select Detail Component from the Component drop-
down list located on the Annotate tab, and use the Type Selector to choose from components 
that are already loaded into the model. If you don’t see a detail component you want to insert 
in the Type Selector, click the Load Families button in the contextual tab of the ribbon, and load 
one from the default library or your office library.
Remember, in the Autodesk default family library, detail components are stored in the Detail 
Items folder, under which the folders are organized according to MasterFormat or a similar 
standard coding system. Many building objects are represented in the default library with detail 
components. For example, if you are looking for a detail component representing a steel beam, 
don’t look in the library under Structural Framing—instead look in the Detail Items folder.
Adding Detail Components and Embellishing the View
We have preloaded some detail component families into the sample building project you down-
loaded earlier in this chapter. Use the following components to further embellish the bottom, 
middle, and top portions of the wall section (the metric equivalents may have an M_ prefix):
◆
◆
Base Molding - Section
◆
◆
Nominal Cut Lumber - Section
◆
◆
Corrugated Wall Tie - Section
These detail components are all specifically designed to be used in a section detail. There are other 
similar detail components in the default library that can be used in a plan detail or when the object is 
to be shown from the side. An example of some detail embellishment is provided in Figure 16.12.
Figure 16.12
Detail components have been 
added to the detail view of 
the model.

Detailing Tools |  697  
You might notice that there are only three types loaded for the detail component family 
named Nominal Cut Lumber - Section. What if you need to load more types from that same 
family? This scenario occurs sometimes when you use families that have a type catalog. Refer to 
Chapter 14, “Designing with the Family Editor,” for more information about families and type 
catalogs.
To reload a family for access to additional types within the family, one option is to start the 
Detail Component tool again, click Load Family, and find that family in the library. A simpler 
solution is to locate the family in the Project Browser (the Families branch is toward the bot-
tom), right-click the family name, and then choose Reload from the context menu. If the family’s 
source file (the RFA file) is available and the family has an associated type catalog, the Type 
Catalog dialog box will appear and allow you to select additional types to be loaded into the 
project.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Project Browser, expand the Families branch of the tree, locate and expand the 
Detail Items branch, and then locate Nominal Cut Lumber-Section or M_Nominal Cut 
Lumber-Section.
	
2.	 Right-click the family name and select Reload from the context menu.
Note that you may be prompted to select a family file if the original RFA file cannot be 
located. In that case, we have provided the RFA and the accompanying type catalog in 
TXT format along with this chapter’s exercise downloads.
	
3.	 Select the types 2 × 10 and 2 × 14 (50 × 200 mm and 50 × 300 mm) from the Specify Types 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 16.13, and then click OK.
	
4.	 Use the additional types to continue adding detail components to the view within the 
floor element at the middle of the detail view.

Arranging Elements in the View
So far you have created all of the content in order and have not had to change the arrangement 
of any of the elements. However, knowing how to change the arrangement is an important 
part of detailing, so you don’t have to draw it all in exact sequence. Arrangement allows you to 
change the position of an element, such as a line or a detail component, relative to another ele-
ment. Much like layers in Adobe Photoshop or arrangement of objects in Microsoft PowerPoint, 

698  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
Revit allows you to place 2D elements in front of or behind others. You’ll see the Arrange panel 
on the far right once an element or group of elements is selected and the Modify menu appears 
(Figure 16.14).
From here, you can choose among four options of arrangement:
Bring To Front    This brings the selected objects all the way to the front of the stack. In 
Figure 16.15, there are two detail lines on top of a masking region, which is also on top of a 
filled region. By selecting the detail lines and choosing Bring To Front, we moved the lines on 
top of all the other elements.
Bring Forward    This option brings the selected elements one step closer to the front in 
a given sequence. In Figure 16.16, we’ve selected the masking region and chosen Bring 
Forward, and now it appears on top of one of the detail lines. Note that each of the detail 
lines is its own layer within this stack.
Send To Back    This option does the exact opposite of the Bring To Front tool and will send 
an object all the way to the back of the stack. In Figure 16.17, we’ve chosen the masking region 
again and sent it to the back.

Detailing Tools |  699  
Send Backwards    The fourth option, Send Backwards, will step the selected elements one 
step backward in the stack. In Figure 16.18, we’ve chosen the horizontal detail line and sent it 
backward; it now appears behind the filled region.
Repeating Detail Component
Repeating elements are common in architectural projects. Masonry, metal decking, and wall 
studs are some common elements that repeat at regular intervals. The tool to help create and 
manage these types of elements is called the Repeating Detail Component, and it’s located in the 
Component flyout on the Annotate tab (Figure 16.19).
This tool lets you place a detail component in a linear configuration where the detail compo-
nent repeats at a set interval. This allows you to draw a “line” that then becomes your repeating 
component. The default repeating detail is common brick depicted in section, repeating in regu-
lar courses (Figure 16.20). Creating elements like this not only lets you later tag and keynote the 
materials but also gives you some easy flexibility over arraying these elements manually.

Beware the Limitations of Repeating Detail Components
Before you decide to use the Repeating Detail Component tool in any of your details, you should be 
aware of its limitations. Although repeating detail components can be scheduled, they cannot be tagged 
or assigned a keynote as you would for a simple detail component. If your annotation methodology 
relies on tags and/or keynotes, we recommend you avoid the use of repeating detail components. 
Instead of the repeating detail component, you can use a single detail component and then use the 
Array command.
Before you create a repeating detail component, we’ll cover the properties behind one so 
you can get a better idea of how they work. Start the Repeating Detail Component command 
and draw a sample line using the Brick type. Exit the command by pressing Esc or clicking the 
Modify button, and then select the Brick repeating detail. In the Properties palette, click Edit 
Type to open the Type Properties dialog box.
Let’s review what each of these settings does:
Detail    This setting allows you to select the detail component to be repeated.
Layout    This option offers four different modes:
Fixed Distance    This is the absolute spacing between components, for example, a strictly 
defined center-to-center measurement.
Fixed Number    This mode sets the number of times a component repeats itself in the 
space between the start and endpoint (the length of the sketched path).
Fill Available Space    Regardless of the value you choose for Spacing, the detail compo-
nent is repeated on the path using its actual width as the Spacing value.
Maximum Spacing    The detail component is repeated using the set spacing, and the 
number of repeated components is set so that only complete components are drawn. 
Revit creates as many copies of the component as will fit on the path.
Inside    This option adjusts the placement of the last detail component in the repeating 
detail. If Inside is selected, the last component will be drawn inside the endpoint of the 
repeating detail line. If Inside is not selected, the last component will be drawn outside or 
overlapping the endpoint of the line.

Detailing Tools |  701  
Spacing    This option is active only when Fixed Distance or Maximum Spacing is selected 
as the method of repetition. It represents the distance at which you want the repeating detail 
component to repeat. It doesn’t have to be the actual width of the detail component.
Using Formulas to Perform Math
In the example of the imperial brick, you have a distance of 2-2/3″ or 2 171/256" vertically between 
bricks stacked in a wall. Because there are three brick courses in every 8″ (225 mm is standard in the 
UK), you don’t need to know the exact distance between each brick—you can use Revit to calculate 
that value. Revit is formula driven, so you can enter = 8″/3 in the Spacing field and it will calculate 
the distance for you, similar to using a formula in Microsoft Excel.
Detail Rotation    This option allows you to rotate the detail component in the repeating detail.
In the c16-Sample-Project.rvt file, we have already created a repeating detail to illustrate 
brick and mortar coursing. At the base of the exterior wall, you will see that a portion of the 
modeled wall assembly already contains a layer assigned with a brick material; however, indi-
vidual brick courses are not shown. Let’s embellish the view with a repeating detail component 
to better communicate the design intent.
	
1.	 Zoom closer to the bottom portion of the detail view, at the base of the exterior wall. From 
the Annotate tab in the ribbon, locate the Detail panel, and click Component ➢ Repeating 
Detail Component.
	
2.	 From the Type Selector, choose the Brick repeating detail type. Starting at the bottom 
of the inside face of the brick layer, draw a line up to the bottom of the window sill, as 
shown in Figure 16.21.
Figure 16.21

detail component

702  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
If the last brick detail does not appear at the top of the sketched line, you can either drag 
the line farther up or edit the type properties of the repeating detail family and toggle the 
Inside parameter.
	
3.	 Press the Esc key or click the Modify button to exit the Repeating Detail Component 
command. Select the corrugated metal wall tie components you placed in the Detail 
Components exercise. Hold down the Ctrl key while clicking each component.
	
4.	 From the Arrange panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Bring To Front. If nec-
essary, you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to nudge the wall tie components 
so that they display in proper relation to the mortar lines of the repeating brick detail 
(Figure 16.22).

order and position 
of previously placed 
detail components.
Although this detail still needs annotations before you can think about placing it onto a 
sheet, you can begin to see how you have used the 3D geometry of the model and were able 
to quickly add some embellishment to it to create a working project detail. For now, save this 
detail. You’ll return to it later in the chapter.
Using Line-Based Detail Components
Although there isn’t a command dedicated to line-based detail components, this category of 
2D elements can be quite powerful. As their name suggests, line-based detail components are 
2D elements that behave like lines. Some examples of building elements you can illustrate with 
these components include waterproofing, gypsum board, plywood, and even repeating ele-
ments such as brick. Why would you use a line-based detail component for brick instead of a 
repeating detail component as we previously discussed? Because you can tag and schedule a 
line-based detail component. You can use any modifying commands on line-based detail com-
ponents such as Trim, Extend, and Align.

Detailing Tools |  703  
In the default content library you will find components in the Detail Items folder such as 
Gypsum Wallboard, Rigid Insulation, and Drainage Board. Start the Detail Component com-
mand, click Load From Library, and load a few of these families. In a detail view, practice draw-
ing these elements to embellish the modeled design further.
Drafting Insulation
The best way to think of the Insulation tool is as a premade repeating detail. You’ll find this tool 
on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab.
Selecting this tool allows you to draw a line of batt insulation, much like a repeating detail. 
Figure 16.23 shows a typical line of insulation.
When selecting the Insulation tool, you can modify the width of the inserted insulation 
from the Options bar or the Properties palette. In the Properties palette, you can also control 
the Insulation Bulge To Width ratio, which adjusts the amount of curve in the insulation. The 
default value is 2.0. By default, insulation is inserted using the centerline of the line of batt, but 
you can control the offset in the Options bar once the tool is activated. You can also modify the 
width either before or after inserting insulation into your view.
Let’s continue to embellish the wall section view in the c16-Sample-Project file. Follow these 
steps to begin adding insulation detail components:
	
1.	 From the Annotate tab in the ribbon, click the Insulation tool. In the Options bar, set the 
Width value to 5″ (150 mm) and the Offset to 0″ To Center.
You can customize the Offset value depending on how you would like to sketch the insu-
lation by drawing the line representing the center of the insulation or either edge.
	
2.	 Within the wall assembly, hover the mouse pointer at the midpoint of one of the nominal 
wood framing detail components you placed previously in this chapter. Use the midpoint 
snaps of the framing components to set the start point and endpoint of the insulation 
component.
	
3.	 Continue to add insulation components in the remaining wall, floor, and roof structure 
layers in the detail view.
A sample of the result is shown in Figure 16.24.

Creating Detail Groups
Detail groups are similar to blocks in AutoCAD and are a quick alternative to creating detail 
component families. They are collections of 2D graphics and can contain detail lines, detail com-
ponents, or any other 2D elements. You will probably want to use a detail component to create 
something like wood blocking; however, if you plan to have the same configurations of wood 
blocking in multiple locations, you can then group those configurations and quickly replicate 
them in other details. As with blocks in AutoCAD, manipulating one of the detail groups will 
change all of them consistently.
There are two ways to make a detail group. The more common one is to create the detail 
elements you’d like to group, select all of them, and then click the Create Group button in the 
Create tab of the contextual tab of the ribbon. When you’re prompted for a group name, use a 
naming convention that will help you organize and recognize the contents of each group rather 
than accept the default name (Group 1, Group 2, and so on).
The other way to create a detail group is by clicking the Create Group button in the Detail Group 
flyout on the Annotate tab (Figure 16.25). You will then be prompted for the type of group (Model 
or Detail) and a group name before you can select any elements for the group. If you are working in 
a drafting view, you can only create a detail group; the Model option is inactive in this case.
After defining a group name, you’ll be taken into Edit Group mode. Your view will have a yellow 
transparency overlaid on top of it, and elements within the view will appear gray. To add elements 
to the group, click the Add button in the Edit Group panel (Figure 16.26). Here you can also remove 
unwanted elements from your group. When you finish, simply click the Finish green check mark.

You can place any group you’ve already made using the Place Detail Group button from the 
Detail panel of the Annotate tab (Figure 16.27) and selecting the group from the Type Selector. 
You can also drag and drop any group from the Project Browser into the active view.

Detail Components and Project Templates
If you find you are inserting the same detail components over and over again, load them into your 
project templates and make them readily available when you begin any new project.
Adding Detail Components to Families
In this chapter, you have read about the number of ways you can embellish a 3D model with 
2D detailing. We have discussed how to add detail elements as needed in the project environ-
ment, but you can also include 2D elements inside families. The possibilities for this method are 
almost limitless. You can add any kind of symbolic line to 3D families, but in this section we 
will focus on nesting a detail component in a profile family, which will then become the basis 
for the curtain wall mullions in the sample project.
A more detailed review of curtain wall modeling is provided in Chapter 12, “Creating Walls 
and Curtain Walls.” For now, we will simply edit the mullions already provided in the sample 
building project to add some 2D detailing. Let’s get started by following these steps:
	
1.	 Continue working with the c16-Sample-Building.rvt or c16-Sample-Metric.rvt file 
you downloaded from this book’s web page. In the Project Browser, locate and activate 
the section view named Section At Curtain Wall. It is located under the Sections (Wall 
Section) branch of the Project Browser.
	
2.	 In the Project Browser, expand the Families branch, locate and expand the Profiles 
branch, and then right-click Pr-Mullion-Horizontal or M_Pr-Mullion-Horizontal. Choose 
Edit from the context menu, and the mullion profile family will open.
The basic reference planes and profile lines have already been created.
You should already have downloaded the RFA files included with this chapter’s exercise 
files. Among them are a series of detail components that represent the internal extrusion 
details of the mullions in the sample project’s curtain wall system.
	
3.	 From the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Detail Component command. Browse to the 
location where you downloaded this chapter’s exercise files and load the file named 
Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Horizontal.rfa or M_Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Horizontal.rfa.

706  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
	
4.	 Place the detail component to fit exactly within the profile boundary.
You may need to rotate the component before placing it by pressing the spacebar. The result 
should look like the image in Figure 16.28.

Create a callout of the wall 
section.
	
5.	 Click the Modify button and then select the detail component you just placed in the view. 
From the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Visibility Settings. In the Family Element 
Visibility Settings dialog box, uncheck the Coarse and Medium settings. The only setting 
that should be checked is Fine. Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
6.	 Click the Load Into Project button from the ribbon and load the revised profile family 
into the sample building project file. When prompted, select the option to override the 
existing version.
	
7.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel and click Callout ➢ Rectangle. In 
the middle portion of the wall section, sketch a rectangle around the mullion near the top 
of the floor associated with Level 2, as shown in Figure 16.29.
	
8.	 Double-click the callout head to activate the callout view. In the Properties palette or the 
view control bar, change the View Scale to 3″=1′-0″ (1:5) and set Detail Level to Fine.
After you have made these changes, you will see the nested detail component appear in 
the curtain wall mullion, as shown in Figure 16.30.

Adding Detail Components to Families |  707  
	
9.	 Repeat the steps in this exercise for the head and sill mullion families. Edit the profile 
families listed here (starts with Pr-Mullion) with the associated detail components (RFA 
files) or their metric equivalents:
Pr-Mullion-Head > Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Head.rfa
Pr-Mullion-Sill > Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Sill.rfa
The detail components we used for this sample exercise were excerpted from real manufac-
turer’s content that is available for free from the Kawneer website (www.kawneer.com). Complete 
curtain wall system components for Revit are also available from the website.
You might have noticed that the curtain wall modeled in this chapter’s sample building is 
somewhat simplified. For example, the portion of the glass panels inside the mullions is not mod-
eled; however, this condition appears in the detail component once you get down to a fine level of 
detail. This exercise illustrates a hybrid approach to the balance between modeling and detailing. 
If you download one of the Revit models from the Kawneer website (one sample, ASCMDDH3a 
.dwg, is provided with this chapter’s downloaded content), you will see that the glass panels are 
more accurately modeled to include the mullion bite (Figure 16.31). In that scenario, you would 
not need to include masking regions to simulate the glass panel in the mullion detail component.

component will

Level is set to Fine.

Reusing Details from Other Files
As you develop details of common building features, you will likely find the need to reuse this 
content in future projects. You might even have an existing library of details that were created in 
a CAD application. In either situation, there are tools and commands available in Revit software 
that allow you to maximize the usage of the material you produce over time.
Using CAD Details
It is quite common to have details that were originally created in a CAD program. Sometimes 
these are details taken from a manufacturer’s website, and sometimes they can be details drawn 
in other projects or from an office library, and you simply want to reuse them in your project 
rather than re-create them. Regardless of where they originated, you have the ability to work 
with 2D detail elements and import or link them into the model for use in your project.
In Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” we provide detailed guidance on 
using linked DWG files for the basis of project details.
Learning Efficient Detailing
As you get more practice creating details in Revit, you’ll find certain workflows support more flexibility 
and speed. Here are some tips to keep in mind when creating your details:
◆
◆
If your modeling is reasonably detailed to begin with, the detailing will go much faster because you 
will need to add fewer components. However, you must strike a balance and not make an overly 
detailed model because that would negatively impact performance. When wondering what to model 
or what to make into a detail component, ask yourself the following questions:
◆
◆
Will I see or use this in other views in the project?
◆
◆
Will it affect other aspects of the project (like material takeoffs)?
◆
◆
How large is it? (Our office tends to use 2D detailing for details 1 1/2″ (40 mm) and smaller.)
◆
◆
There is no limit to how much information you can place in a detail component. If you will be see-
ing similar conditions throughout the model, put in as much as you can.
◆
◆
You can use detail components at every scale within the model, so it is a great way to draw the 
information only once.
If the lines describing small components seem to merge when printed, there’s little point in showing 
that geometry at that scale. You might consider making the model simpler.
Tips on Importing CAD Details
At times in the project, your workflow will necessitate using 2D information from a past project, 
a manufacturer’s library, or another resource in your current Revit project. To optimize the per-
formance of your imported CAD files within your model, we recommend that you take some steps 
to prepare the CAD file before import. Here are some general tips to help your import process:

Reusing Details from Other Files |  709  
Using Details from Other Revit Projects
As we begin to discuss the reuse of detailing content, we must return to the three methodolo-
gies introduced at the beginning of this chapter—stand-alone detailing, hybrid detailing, and 
model detailing. As you approach a project with more detailed modeling, you will reduce the 
amount of drafting needed in the project environment; however, you will be less able to reuse 
content as standard details or detail templates. This is because the best way to reuse 2D content 
is with drafting views.
◆
◆
If the file you’d like to import contains hatches or annotations, delete them before importing 
and use filled regions and the Revit Text or Keynote tool for annotations. This will help keep 
your graphics consistent (in the case of hatch) and allow you to edit the verbiage and location 
of any notes.
◆
◆
Import only one detail at a time so you can take better advantage of the software’s ability to 
manage sheet referencing. If you have a series of details organized in a single CAD file that 
you want to use in documenting your project, isolate each detail, save it as a separate file, and 
then import it.
◆
◆
Make sure you import the CAD details using the proper line weights, colors, and styles. Check 
your CAD file before importing into your Revit project to make sure it is consistent with your 
office’s standards.
◆
◆
If the imported geometry is something you really want or need to edit, it’s better for your model 
and overall file size to import the CAD file into a detail component (if it’s 2D) and explode it 
and edit it in the Family Editor. This way, when you import it into your project file, it is still a 
single object rather than thousands.
◆
◆
Revit software doesn’t allow line segments shorter than 1/32″ (0.8 mm). Although this is 
seemingly a very small line, many manufacturer details have small segment lines in them. 
When CAD details are exploded, those short lines will be deleted and can leave your linework 
looking incomplete.
For additional tips on leveraging CAD data, refer to Appendix B, “Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting.”
There’s an App for That
If you have many details in DWG format that you would like to quickly import to a project file, a few 
add-ins are available to automate the process. One example is the Detail Link tool that is part of the 
Revit Express Tools suite that Cad Technology Center developed. This tool allows you to select mul-
tiple DWG files and import each one to its own drafting view in Revit. You can learn more about the 
Detail Link tool from the website www.cadtechnologycenter.com and the Autodesk Apps Exchange 
(http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com).
Saving a Single Detail
If you are working in a detail view of the model or a drafting view, you can save all of the 2D 
elements to an external file for reuse in other Revit projects. In the case of a single 2D detail, it 
can be quick work to get the file from one project to the next:

710  | chapter 16  Detailing Your Design   
We have created a sample file using this method for use in the remainder of this exercise. 
Make sure you download the file c16_JambDetail.rvt from the book’s companion 
web page.
	
5.	 Continue with the sample building project file saved from the previous exercises in this 
chapter.
	
6.	 From the View tab, click Drafting View to create a new view, and name it JAMB DTL.
	
1.	 Open the file with the detail you’d like to collect, and activate the view in which this 
detail appears. Select all the 2D geometry and annotation within the drafting view, and 
create a group using the Create Group button on the contextual tab of the ribbon.
Note that if you are in a callout or detail view in which model elements are displayed, 
two groups will be created—a model group and a detail group.
	
2.	 Give the group a name, making sure the name is unique enough not to overlap with any 
view names in your current project or the project you’re going to import into.
	
3.	 With the detail grouped and named, expand the Groups node in the Project Browser. 
Now, expand the Detail Group node and find the group you just created. Right-click the 
group and choose Save Group from the context menu.
	
4.	 As part of the Save As process, you’ll get the Save Group dialog box (Figure 16.32). This 
will allow you to create a separate RVT file for your group—basically a stand-alone project 
file. Save the group in a location where you’ll be able to find it again and close your project 
file. There’s no need to name the group because the new file will reflect the group name.

Group dialog

Reusing Details from Other Files |  711  
Saving Multiple Details
As you create more details in Revit projects, you will inevitably want to save some of them to an 
office library or some sort of localized resource so you can quickly locate the good ones again. 
Revit allows you to selectively save multiple views from a single project into a separate, stand-
alone file. This workflow will work for both 2D and 3D content.
A quick way to get any view with 2D elements isolated to an external file is to right-click the 
view in the Project Browser and choose Save To New File from the context menu. Note that this 
option is not available for any view that does not contain 2D detail elements. It might take the 
software a few moments to compile the view content, but you will be presented with a dialog 
Figure 16.33
Choose the 
detail group 
from the Insert 
2D Elements 
dialog box.
The scale does not matter because it will inherit the scale of the imported detail.
	
7.	 From the Insert tab of the ribbon, choose Insert From File and then Insert 2D Elements 
From File.
	
8.	 In the Open dialog box, navigate to and select the c16_JambDetail.rvt file. You will 
then see the Insert 2D Elements dialog box, which is shown in Figure 16.33. Highlight 
Drafting View: JAMB DTL from the list box, and select the Transfer View Scale check box. 
Click OK to close the dialog box and begin the import.
	
9.	 Click anywhere in the drafting view to place the imported elements, and then click the 
Finish button in the ribbon to complete the command.

box asking you to locate the new file. Once the view is exported, it functions like any other RVT 
file. You can open these new views directly and edit or manipulate any of the content or ele-
ments within the file. You’ll also see a streamlined version of the Project Browser having only 
the nodes that relate to the content you’ve exported.
Another way to export multiple views is to click the Application menu and choose Save As ➢ 
Library ➢ View. This command allows you to save multiple views into a single RVT file that acts 
as a library for those views. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Start by opening the file with the views you want to save. Click the Application menu and 
select Save As ➢ Library ➢ View.
	
2.	 This will give you the Save Views dialog box (Figure 16.34). It will show a list of view 
names on the left and a preview window on the right. Click the check box for each of the 
views you want to save into a separate file. Once you have all your view names estab-
lished, click OK.
Figure 16.34
Exporting multiple 
views to a separate 
file
The software might take a few moments to export the views, depending on how many you’ve 
chosen and how large the overall file size is. Once the process is complete, you’ll have a sepa-
rate file to import those views back into Revit projects. This import process is just as simple as 
exporting. Here’s how to import the views:
	
1.	 Open the project where you want to put the imported views. From the Insert tab on the 
ribbon, choose Insert From File and then Insert Views From File.

The Bottom Line |  713  
	
2.	 The new dialog box will look similar to the Save Views dialog box. You will have a list of 
the views you can import from the column on the left and a preview of those views on 
the right. Check the box for the views you want to import and click OK (Figure 16.35).
Figure 16.35
Importing multiple 
views into a project
You can also import entire sheets of details using this method. If sheets exist in the file you 
have selected with the Insert Views From File command, they are listed as options to insert. 
When sheets are inserted, the details placed on each sheet are automatically imported into the 
project as well.
The Bottom Line
Create details.    Details in Revit are a combination of 2D elements layered on top of 3D 
model elements or sometimes just stacked on top of each other. Creating good, easy-to-read 
details typically requires some embellishment of the 3D model.
Master It    What are the three primary categories of detail elements and how are they 
used?
Add detail components to families.    You can make creating details in Revit easier by 
adding some of the detail elements directly to the family. In this way, when you cut sec-
tions, make callouts, or enlarge plan conditions, your “smart” details can begin to construct 
themselves.
Master It    Because you don’t always want elements to appear in every scale of a view, 
how can you both add detail elements to your families and still limit the amount of infor-
mation that is shown in any given view?

 Chapter  17 
 Documenting Your Design   
 While the industry continues to move toward a 3D building information model as a construc-
tion deliverable, today we still need to produce 2D documents for a construction document set 
or design reviews. Using the integrated documentation tools in Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture 
software, you can create these sets with more accuracy and reliability than in the past. In this 
chapter, you will take the elements you have previously modeled and detailed and begin to 
create the documentation for your design. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Document plans 
 
◆
 Create schedules and legends 
 
◆
 Lay out sheets 
 Documenting plans 
 In this chapter, we’ll introduce a scenario that will mimic what might happen on a real project 
in a preliminary design phase. We are going to assume that you’ll be using the  c17-Sample-
Building-Start.rvt or  c17-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt model from the book’s web page: 
www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017 . 
 Here’s the story: You have recently completed some preliminary design work in advance of 
your upcoming client meeting. You’ll need to lay out the plans, elevations, and perspectives on 
some presentation sheets for the meeting, but you’ll also have to include some building metrics, 
such as area plans and schedules of overall spaces. 
 In the following sections, you’ll set up those views and sheets, starting with the area plans. For 
the purposes of program verifi cation, you have decided you need to establish the spatial areas for 
the building so the client can get some preliminary pricing from the contractor. Before you create 
your area plans, we’ll discuss some of the various ways you can calculate areas in Revit.  
 Calculating Space Using room Objects 
The simplest way to calculate the space in a building design is to use room objects. Room 
tags can be used to report room name, department, area, and any of the other properties of 
a room. These properties can also be scheduled to report the total area of all rooms within a 
design. With rooms, however, the areas that they report are limited to how those spaces are 
defi ned. With the  c17-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or  c17-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt  
model open, choose the Architecture tab, and then access the expanded panel under the Room 
& Area panel. Click Area And Volume Computations, which opens the Area And Volume

716  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Computations dialog box. You will see the options for room area computation in the project. 
The choices are as follows:
◆
◆
At Wall Finish
◆
◆
At Wall Center
◆
◆
At Wall Core Layer
◆
◆
At Wall Core Center
Because each of these settings affects the entire project, a level of consistency is ensured for 
room calculations; however, the global nature of the settings makes it difficult to use the room 
objects for gross area calculations. Room calculations can give you an accurate net area—or 
carpet area—that refers to the area between the finished wall surfaces considered as occupied 
space. This value can also be reported in the room tag or in a schedule by selecting the first 
choice under the Room Area Computation settings, At Wall Finish, in the Area And Volume 
Computations dialog box (Figure 17.1). Select this option and click OK.
Figure 17.1
The Area And Volume 
Computations dialog 
box
Let’s see how this looks in the floor plans. Activate the Level 2 floor plan. In this view, we 
have already established the rooms and added room tags; however, the tags do not show the 
room areas. To modify this setting, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select any of the room tags, and from the Properties palette, choose Edit Type.
	
2.	 In the Type Properties dialog box, choose the Show Area check box. Click OK to exit the 
dialog box.
Now you should see the areas reflected in the room tags, as shown in Figure 17.2. This is 
because the Show Area setting was created as a Yes/No type parameter assigned to the vis-
ibility property of the area label within the room tag family. If you want to explore this func-
tionality further, you can open the tag family. Select the room tag and click Edit Family in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon.

Figure 17.2
Room area reflected in 
the room tag
If you select any one of the room tags, you can also see the area that it is calculating displayed 
with a red outline (Figure 17.3). When adding rooms, you are not limited to only rooms that 
are bound on all sides with walls. If you note the lounge and lobby spaces on Level 1, shown in 
Figure 17.3, there isn’t a wall dividing the two rooms, yet they are shown as being independent 
of each other. This separation is achieved by using room separation lines, which can be placed 
with the Room Separator tool located on the Room & Area panel of the Architecture tab. Note 
that these lines will print and export with other model and annotation elements, but you can 
adjust their visibility in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. If you decide to change 
the visibility of the room separator lines and turn them off within a view, they will continue to 
divide the room objects. You will find these elements in the Visibility/Graphic dialog box on the 
Model Elements tab, under Lines, <Room Separation>.
Figure 17.3
The room object  
shows what area is  
being calculated.

718  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Because area calculations using rooms don’t usually include wall thicknesses, let’s look at 
another way to calculate areas—using area plans.
Working with Rooms and Areas
Rooms and areas are the two object types you will use to annotate and report the occupied space 
within your building designs. You can use room tags and area tags to visualize data such as a room 
name or number, but the tags merely report the data that exists in the object itself. So, how do you 
work with objects that have no solid geometry?
Both rooms and areas have a reference that can be seen if you hover the mouse pointer within a 
space. Sometimes these references can be difficult to find, but there is something you can do to 
improve your efficiency when working with these objects. In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog 
box, locate Areas or Rooms in the Model Categories tab. Expand the category for either object and 
you will see Interior Fill and Reference. These subcategories are turned off by default, but you can 
turn them on if you will be frequently editing these objects.
Creating Area Plans
Area plans are views of the model used to calculate defined, two-dimensional spaces within the 
model according to prescribed calculation standards but with the added ability to customize 
the area boundaries. The software allows you to create as many area calculation schemes as you 
need to depict the design. Area boundaries can exist only in area plans and can be either manu-
ally placed or automatically associated with walls. If they are automatically placed, the areas 
within them will be calculated based on the BOMA standard.
BOMA Area Calculations
BOMA stands for the Building Owners and Managers Association. Widely used in the United States 
by architects, developers, and facility managers alike, it was created to help standardize building 
development and spatial needs. BOMA uses its own set of standards for calculating areas that 
have some nuances relating to exactly where the area boundaries between spaces fall, depending 
on the Area Type property. You can find more information on BOMA standards at www.boma.org.
The default project template includes some predefined areas. To add to the list of available 
area schemes, access the expanded Room & Area panel in the Architecture tab of the ribbon, 
and then click Area And Volume Computations.
When the Area And Volume Computations dialog box opens, choose the Area Schemes tab, 
shown in Figure 17.4. Here you can add as many new area schemes as your design requires. For 
each area scheme, you can create associated plans, schedules, and area boundary layouts; how-
ever, be careful not to add too many superfluous area schemes on larger projects because doing 
so can degrade performance and increase file size.

Documenting Plans |  719  
Create a new area scheme by clicking the New button. By default this will be a rentable type 
plan based on BOMA calculation rules. You will see a new area scheme in the list. Click in the 
Name field of the new row and rename the scheme Usable Area (Figure 17.5). Click OK to close 
the Area And Volume Computations dialog box.

To continue the exercise, you will need to create area plans for your presentation. You can 
create an area plan from either of two locations: One is located on the Room & Area panel of 
the Architecture tab; the other is located on the Create panel of the View tab. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, find the Room & Area panel, click Area, and 
then click Area Plan. You are prompted with the New Area Plan dialog box, shown in 
Figure 17.6.
	
2.	 From the Type drop-down menu, choose Usable Area. While pressing the Ctrl key, select 
both Level 1 and Level 2.
	
3.	 Click OK. You are prompted with the option to automatically generate area boundaries 
for exterior walls. Because you selected more than one level, you will receive a prompt 
for each level for which a plan is being generated. Go ahead and click OK to generate the 
plans automatically.

720  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
This creates new area plans under a new node in the Project Browser: Area Plans 
(Usable Area). The name in the parentheses will always be associated to the area calcu-
lation type you used.
	
4.	 In the Project Browser, select both Level 1 and Level 2 under Area Plans (Usable Area). 
Right-click and select Apply View Template from the context menu.
	
5.	 In the Apply View Template dialog box, choose Area Plan from the list of view templates, 
click OK to apply the template, and close the dialog box.
Note: This method applies the template properties to the views, but it does not associate 
the template with the views. To permanently assign the view template to the views, 
edit the View Template parameter in the Properties palette.
View references, furniture, and floor patterns are turned off based on the settings defined 
in the view template (Figure 17.7). For more detailed information on using view templates, 
refer to Chapter 4, “Configuring Templates and Standards.”

Documenting Plans |  721  
When looking at the area plan on your screen, you’ll notice a thick, purple line running 
around the inside face of the exterior wall. This is the Area Boundary line. Note that we 
have changed the default properties of the Area Boundary line type in the figures within this 
project for clarity. The software has attempted to calculate your plan area based on some 
predefined rules. For the most part, it does a reasonable job of figuring out where the 
boundaries are, but from time to time those lines need some adjusting. You will learn 
over time whether this automation works based on the complexity of the perimeter walls 
in your designs. If they are complex and not clearly closed, the results of the automated 
boundary placement may be undesirable.
In the Project Browser, find the node Area Plans (Gross Building) and open either of the 
plans. Notice the difference in the application of the area boundaries to the exterior walls. 
The area boundaries are applied to the outside faces of the exterior walls. In the Usable 
Area plans (Figure 17.7), the boundaries are assigned to the inside faces of the exterior 
walls—also adapting to window elements.
To complete this part of the exercise, you will place additional area boundaries to sub­divide 
the interior space into different spaces.
	
6.	 Activate the Level 1 area plan for Usable Area. From the Architecture tab, select the Room 
& Area panel; click Area Boundary.
The default drawing method is set to Pick, and in the Options bar, the Apply Area Rules 
setting is checked. Remember that this setting determines whether the location of the 
boundary will be affected by the Area Type property of the areas placed on either side of 
the boundary.
	
7.	 Pick the interior walls indicated in Figure 17.8.
Figure 17.8
Place additional area 
boundaries on Level 1 as 
shown here.

722  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
	
8.	 Activate the Level 2 area plan for Usable Area, and using the same method as in Level 1, 
add area boundaries to the interior walls indicated in Figure 17.9. You will need to use the 
Trim tool to adjust the line for the wall at the end of the corridor.
Figure 17.9
Place additional area 
boundaries on Level 2 as 
shown here.
Adding Area Objects
Like room objects, areas need a closed boundary in order to be placed, and they have 
properties to which you can add attributes that are “taggable.” You can have any number of 
areas visible in an area plan, but unlike rooms, areas can be seen and tagged only in area plans. 
In this section’s exercise, you will place area objects within the boundaries you created in the 
previous exercise:
	
1.	 On the Room & Area panel on the Architecture tab, choose the Area tool.
The Area tool places an area in a manner similar to placing a room, and it gives you a 
bound area with a large X in it (Figure 17.10). The area of the space bound by the purple 
boundary lines will be reported as part of the area tag.
	
2.	 Place areas in each of the zones defined by the boundary lines in the Level 1 floor plan 
for Usable Area. To modify the names of the areas, you can select the area object and then 
modify the name in the Properties palette, or you can select the area tag, click the name, 
and then type the new value. Change the names of the areas to OFFICES, LOBBY, and 
SERVICES, as shown in Figure 17.11.

3.	 Select the OFFICES area (not the tag), and in the Properties palette, change the Area Type 
property to Office Area. Select the SERVICES area and change its Area Type property to 
Building Common Area.
Notice that some of the area boundaries change to different wall faces as the Area Type 
property is modified. This behavior is based on the BOMA area measurement standards 
and is dependent on either allowing Revit to automatically assign area boundaries or 
using the Apply Area Rules option when you are placing the boundaries yourself.
Rooms are not visible in the area plans, based on the settings in the view templates pro-
vided in the sample project. If you do not turn off the visibility of rooms in area plans, 
you may mistakenly select a room object instead of an area. Always be sure to check the 
Type Selector to verify that you have selected an area or a room.
Deleting Areas
As you complete this exercise, you may accidentally place an area outside the boundaries of the 
design, or you may place two areas within the same space. First, realize that you must delete the 
area, not just the area tag, to remove the area element; however, the area actually remains in your 
project. You are prompted with a warning as shown here:
To completely remove an area from your project, you must remove it from an area schedule. The 
Area and Level properties of deleted areas are shown in a schedule as Not Placed. You can pick these 
rows in a schedule and choose Delete from the Rows panel of the ribbon.
	
4.	 The next step in our area plan is to follow steps similar to those for Level 1. Activate 
the Level 2 area plan for Usable Area and place areas in the zones defined by the area 
boundaries.
	
5.	 Rename the areas OFFICES, CIRCULATION, and SERVICES, as shown in Figure 17.12.
	
6.	 Select the OFFICES area and change the Area Type property to Office Area. Select the 
CIRCULATION area and change Area Type to Major Vertical Penetration. Select the 
SERVICES area and change the Area Type to Building Common Area.

Documenting Plans |  725  
	
7.	 Select the area tag for SERVICES, and from the Options bar, activate the Leader setting. 
This will allow you to move the tag away from the area object without generating a warn-
ing. With the SERVICES area tag still selected, move it outside the area boundary lines 
and adjust the leader line as necessary.
Modifying Area Plans
Like rooms, areas can be modified at any time during the design process. They will be adjusted 
automatically if the boundary lines are locked to a wall or other element that has been moved as 
part of the design, or they can be modified manually.
If you delete an area line, you’ll get the warning message shown in Figure 17.13. This message 
tells you that you have removed one or more of the boundary lines for an area and the software 
can no longer calculate the area.
Figure 17.12
Rename the areas placed 
on Level 2.

Modifying an area 
boundary generates a

726  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
If you are in the midst of modifying a space, finish your modifications and replace any area 
lines that you’ve deleted or removed as part of the design change. Once the area is completely 
bound, it will recalculate the space.
In this section, you’ve created an area plan that will give you a graphic representation of the 
space you’ve defined with boundary lines. But what if you want to show this same information 
in a spreadsheet format? All you need to do is set up a view type in the model that allows you to 
look at the same information in a tabular format. For this, you can use a schedule.
Working with Area Plans on Large Projects
On a large project where our client was a government agency, our team was required to create 
many different area schemes to comply with the documentation deliverables. These area schemes 
included gross floor area, rentable area, and individual department areas. Because the project was 
so large in overall area and number of spaces, performance of our Revit project file was suffering 
because the software was simultaneously analyzing the parametric relationships between all the 
physical building elements while maintaining all the calculations in our area plans for each of the 
area schemes.
To alleviate some of the degraded performance, we decided to create a separate project file into 
which we linked our architectural model. In this file, we re-created the required area schemes, 
area objects, and area plans. Even the sheets dedicated to the area calculations were created in 
this project file.
Although this approach improved the performance of the main architectural model, there were 
some limitations. The main limitation was that we could not use the Pick Walls method to assign 
the area boundaries to the walls in the linked model. Thus, the Apply Area Rules option did 
not function, which required us to manage the area boundaries manually in relation to their 
associated walls.
If you decide to pursue this method of working with area plans on large projects, consider the work 
involved against the benefits gained in performance before you decide to implement it.
Creating Schedules and Legends
Schedules are lists of elements and element properties within the model. They itemize building 
objects such as walls, doors, and windows as well as calculate quantities, areas, and volumes. 
They can also list document elements such as sheets, keynotes, and views. Schedules are yet 
another live way to view a Revit model. Once created, they are constantly kept up to date with 
any changes that occur to the model itself.
Legends are views in which you can display building components or annotations used in your 
model without affecting quantity schedules of the actual project model. Legends can be created 
for displaying information such as door types, wall types, key plans, or general notes. Legends 
and schedules are unique in their behavior as a view because they are the only views that can be 
placed on multiple sheets.

Creating Schedules and Legends |  727  
Creating Schedules
In a project workflow, creating schedules of objects, areas, or quantities is usually one of the 
most laborious tasks for architects. When this process is performed manually, it can take a very 
long time and typically results in errors that require validation of the design data.
In Revit, all building elements have information about their properties defined within the 
model. You also have the option to include additional information with any element. For example, 
doors have properties such as size, material, fire rating, cost, and so on. All of this information can 
be scheduled and quantified. Because the schedule is a live tabular view of the element within the 
model, modifying values in a schedule changes the element in the model, and vice versa.
There are several types of schedules, all of which you can access from the Create panel of the 
View tab. You can also create schedules by right-clicking the Schedules/Quantities node in the 
Project Browser. You can create six primary types of schedules:
Schedule/Quantities    As the most commonly used schedule type, this schedule allows you 
to list and quantify all element category types. You would use this type to create tabular 
views for doors, walls, windows, areas, rooms, and so on.
Graphical Column Schedule    This type of schedule can graphically show the structural 
columns in the project and their attributes.
Material Takeoff    This type of schedule can calculate the area or volume of materials across 
any family category. For example, you might want to know the volume of concrete within the 
model. Regardless of whether the concrete is in a wall, floor, or column, you can configure 
the schedule to report the total amount of that material in the project.
Sheet List    This schedule allows you to create a list of all the sheets in the project. In addi-
tion to the number and name of the sheet, you can include the current revision number, date, 
and revision description.
Note Block    This type of schedule lists the parameters of generic annotation families that are 
used in your project. These are different from element tags because the values reported in the 
Note Block schedule come from the annotation families—not the model objects. You can also 
use a note block to list the annotation symbols (centerlines, north arrows) used in a project.
View List    This schedule generates a list of all the views in the Project Browser and their 
properties. A view list is useful for managing your project because the schedule is a bidirec-
tional view, which allows you to edit many view properties such as name, scale, and phase.

728  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Each of these schedule types gives you the ability to select related element properties that 
you can mix and match to track elements within the model. When you create a new schedule, 
you must first select a category of objects to itemize (Figure 17.14). You can also filter the schedule 
based on the various disciplines by selecting the Filter List drop-down menu at the upper left.
Figure 17.14
Creating a new schedule
Although the most common schedules are based on a single object category, you can also 
create schedules that span categories. The first option in the dialog box in Figure 17.14 is the 
<Multi-Category> schedule. You might want to schedule all the casework, furniture, and 
furniture systems in a project simultaneously, or all the windows and doors if they are being 
ordered from the same manufacturer. Although this type of schedule allows you to span mul-
tiple categories, many specific parameters cannot be included. First, it is difficult to isolate just 
two categories (such as windows and doors) in a multi-category schedule. Second, you cannot 
include critical parameters in the schedule such as length, width, and height. Another limit of 
this schedule type is that you cannot schedule host elements (walls, floors, ceilings, and so on), 
only their materials and family components.
Schedule Keys
There is a special kind of schedule that gives you the ability to populate a list of values before plac-
ing any actual objects in your model as well as manage these values from one location. Known as a 
schedule key, it can be selected when you first create a schedule. A common example of the use of 
a schedule key is to manage room finishes. In this use case, you create a schedule key named Room 
Finish Type. You add the parameters Floor Finish, Base Finish, Wall Finish, and Ceiling Finish to 
the schedule. In the schedule, use the New Row button to create room finish types. For example, 
you could create types for Executive Office, Standard Office, Service Corridor, and Rest Room.
The parameter Room Finish Type will then appear in the element properties of every room object. 
The parameters that are assigned to a schedule key can be edited only in the key schedule—not 
in the room properties. This might seem inconvenient; however, you can manage large numbers of 
objects with common parameters. For example, if the floor finish for all the rooms in your project 
that were assigned as an Executive Office type needed to change from carpet to ceramic tile, you 
would simply change the schedule key and all instances of that room type would update.

Creating Schedules and Legends |  729  
Creating a Room Schedule
To become familiar with the general functionality of creating a schedule, you will create a room 
schedule. You’re going to continue working in the model, c17-Sample-Building-Start.rvt file 
or c17-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt you opened earlier in this chapter. Later in this chapter, you 
will apply your skills to create an area schedule based on the previous exercises.
From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules ➢ Schedule/Quantities. In the New 
Schedule dialog box, select Rooms from the list of categories, and click OK to continue. You are 
then presented with the Schedule Properties dialog box. This is the main interface by which 
you set, and later modify, any of the organizational or appearance characteristics of your sched-
ules. The dialog box consists of five tabs: Fields, Filter, Sorting/Grouping, Formatting, and 
Appearance. Let’s step through each of these tabs and examine how they affect the form and 
function of the schedule:
Fields    The Fields tab (Figure 17.15) lets you select the data that will appear in your schedule. 
The list of available fields on the left will vary based on the category you choose to schedule. 
If you’ve assigned any custom parameters to those categories, they will be available here as 
well. Also notice the option Include Elements In Linked at the lower-left corner. Enabling 
this option will allow you to schedule across multiple files, and it can be a great tool for 
larger projects. The order of the fields you add to the Scheduled Fields list at the right side 
(top to bottom) determines the order of columns in your schedule from left to right.

The Fields tab
From the list of available fields on the left, add Level, Number, Name, and Area to the list of 
scheduled fields on the right.
Filter    On the Filter tab (Figure 17.16), you can filter out the data you don’t want to show in 
your schedule. Filters work like common database functions. For example, you can filter out 
all the sheets in a set whose names don’t begin with the letter A. Or you can filter a material 
list so that it shows only items containing Concrete. Filters operate only on certain schedule 
fields. For instance, you can’t apply a filter to the Family And Type field.

730  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Set the first group of filter drop-downs to Filter By: Level: Does Not Equal: Roof 1. Set the sec-
ond group of filter drop-downs to Filter By: Level: Does Not Equal: Roof 2.
Sorting/Grouping    The Sorting/Grouping tab (Figure 17.17) lets you control the order in 
which information is displayed and which fields control that order. For instance, if you are 
creating a sheet index, you can choose to sort by sheet number or sheet name, depending on 
how you’d like the information displayed. You can also decide whether you want to show 
every instance of an item or only a summary of object types by using the Itemize Every 
Instance check box at the bottom.

and set the Footer drop-down to Count And Totals.

Creating Schedules and Legends |  731  
In the Sorting/Grouping tab, you have the ability to summarize the reported information in 
group footers or as a grand total at the bottom of the schedule; however, you must designate 
one or more fields to calculate totals in the Formatting tab to display these results.
Formatting    The Formatting tab (Figure 17.18) controls the display for each field and whether 
the field is visible on the schedule. It also controls other elements of the field, such as justifica-
tion, display name, and orientation of the header. This tab also allows you to use the Calculate 
Totals check box for use with the footer or Grand Totals options in the Sorting/Grouping tab. 
Note that you may also need to use the Calculate Totals option for certain numerical fields 
if you intend to deselect the Itemize Every Instance option in the Sorting/Grouping tab. For 
example, if you include the Area property of walls and choose not to itemize every instance, 
the area appears as a blank field in the schedule unless you check the Calculate Totals option.
Figure 17.18
The Formatting tab 
allows you to change 
unit formats and specify 
fields in which you need 
to calculate totals.
The Hidden Field option is also an important feature to help you customize your schedules. 
You can use this option when you need to include a field just for filtering or sorting but you 
don’t want to see it in the schedule, such as a custom sorting parameter for drawing sheets. You 
can also select it when you want to use a field as the header of a group of elements in a sched-
ule. For example, you may include the Family and Type fields, but you want only the family 
listed as a grouping header because you don’t need to show the family name repeatedly in 
every row of your schedule.
For this exercise, select the Level field and then activate the Hidden Field option. Select the 
Area field, set the Alignment to Right, and then activate the Calculate Totals option.
Appearance    The Appearance tab (Figure 17.19) controls the graphical aspects of the sched-
ule, such as font size and style of text for each of the columns and headers in the schedule. It 
also allows you to turn the schedule grid lines on and off and modify the line thickness for 
the grid and boundary lines. For revision schedules, you can also specify whether the sched-
ule reads from top to bottom or from bottom to top.

732  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design

The Appearance tab
Select the Outline check box and set the Outline drop-down to Wide Lines.
Once you’ve worked through each of the tabs in the Schedule Properties dialog box, click 
OK and you will see the working layout of the schedule. The schedule settings can be modified 
at any time, but this gives you a basis from which to begin. To modify the schedule, you can 
access any tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box from the five corresponding buttons in the 
Properties palette when the schedule view is active.
A special tab on the ribbon is active when you are editing a schedule. This ribbon is not 
available when you select a schedule that has been placed on a sheet but available only in the edit-
ing mode. To edit a schedule on a sheet, you must right-click the schedule and then select Edit 
Schedule from the context menu. The Modify Schedule/Quantities tab shown in Figure 17.20 
has many tools that enable you to modify field selection, hide columns, merge cells, and perform 
other functions that are similar to those found in Microsoft Excel.
Figure 17.20
The contextual tab  
in the ribbon for 
schedules
In some schedules, such as room schedules, area schedules, and sheet lists, the Insert Data 
Row button is active. This command allows you to add rows to the schedule in order to pre-
populate the project with values before you actually create an element. In the example of rooms, 
if you first create a room schedule and then generate a list of rooms using the Insert Data Row 
command, you can place rooms in your model using the predefined data in the Room drop-
down from the Options bar.
In addition to the various formatting tools in the contextual tab for schedules, you will find 
a panel named Parameters. The drop-downs in this panel allow you to select some cells in the 
schedule and point them to other parameters within the project. As an example, we inserted a 

Creating Schedules and Legends |  733  
row beneath the title row and set the left cell to Project Information: Project Number. The two 
remaining cells in that row were merged and the cell’s parameter was set to Schedule: Phase 
using the two drop-downs in the Parameters panel. As you can see in Figure 17.21, you can even 
change the phase of the schedule directly in the cell of the schedule.
Figure 17.21
Additional information 
can be added to a sched-
ule with tools from the 
Parameters panel.
Another key feature of the contextual tab for schedules is the Highlight In Model button. 
This button allows you to select any element in the schedule and locate that element within the 
model. Let’s say you want to locate a particular door from your door schedule. Select the respec-
tive row in the schedule and click the Highlight In Model button; Revit will pull up a different 
view with that door highlighted. This technique can be a useful way to locate elements in the 
model, especially for larger models.
Now that you have an idea of the elements that compose a schedule, let’s explore the work-
flow with the following two exercises. You will first create a simple wall schedule and then cre-
ate a Usable Area schedule based on the areas you defined earlier in this chapter.
Making a Wall Schedule
In this exercise, you will create a schedule of building elements that is filtered to report only cer-
tain types of walls and is simplified to show only a summary of each unique wall type within 
the project. Make sure you have the c17-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or c17-Sample-Metric-
Start.rvt file open, and then follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel, click Schedules, and then click 
Schedules/Quantities.
The New Schedule dialog box opens.
	
2.	 Choose Walls from the Category list and click OK.
	
3.	 In the Fields tab, choose the following wall properties from the Available Fields list and 
add them to the Scheduled Fields list (in order):
◆
◆
Function
◆
◆
Family

734  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
◆
◆
Type
◆
◆
Area
	
4.	 Switch to the Sorting/Grouping tab, set the first Sort By field to Family, and check the 
Header and Blank Line options. Leave the Itemize Every Instance option checked for now.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the dialog box and observe the amount of data that is available for this 
schedule.
Let’s refine the schedule even further.
	
6.	 In the Properties palette, scroll down to find the Edit buttons related to the five tabs in 
the Schedule Properties dialog box. Click the button next to Filter. Set the first filter drop-
down list to Function: Equals: Exterior.
	
7.	 Switch to the Formatting tab and select the Function field from the list. Check the Hidden 
Field option and click OK to view the result in your schedule.
Note that now only the exterior walls are being listed. Walls with any other function 
property are not being itemized. Although the Function field is not shown, it must be 
included in the Scheduled Fields list to be used as a filter.
	
8.	 From the Properties palette, click the Edit button related to the Sorting/Grouping tab. 
Uncheck the Itemize Every Instance option and check the Grand Totals option. From the 
Grand Totals drop-down list, choose Totals Only.

Creating Schedules and Legends |  735  
	
9.	 Switch to the Formatting tab and select the Family field from the list. Check the Hidden 
Field option. Next, select the Area field, check the Calculate Totals option, and set the 
Alignment to Right.
	
10.	 Click OK to close the dialog box and observe the final modifications to your wall schedule 
(Figure 17.22).
Figure 17.22
The finished wall sched-
ule displays a summary 
of elements.
In this simple wall schedule exercise, you saw that a large amount of model data can be suc-
cinctly itemized and displayed using a combination of parameters within the elements. Only 
the exterior wall types were itemized, and the total area for each type was reported, including a 
grand total of all types.
Making an Area Schedule
In our next exercise, you will create an area schedule specifically for the Usable Area scheme 
you established earlier in this chapter. The process is similar to that of creating a wall schedule.
If you are working through all the exercises in this chapter, continue with the c17-Sample-
Building-Start.rvt or c17-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt file from this book’s web page. To 
create the schedule, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, select Schedules and then Schedule/Quantities. From 
the Categories list, select the Area (Usable Area) schedule type and click OK.
	
2.	 On the Fields tab, notice that the available fields in an area table are much more limited 
than they were in the Walls table in the previous exercise. For this schedule, you need 
only four fields:
◆
◆
Area Type
◆
◆
Level
◆
◆
Name
◆
◆
Area
Choose those from the Fields list on the left, and using the Add button, move them to the 
right or double-click the names to move them from one side to the other.
Remember that the order of the fields in this list will determine the order of the columns 
in your final schedule. Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons as needed to order the 
list correctly.

736  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
	
3.	 Next, choose the Sorting/Grouping tab. From the first pull-down menu, choose to sort 
by Area Type and check the Header and Footer boxes with the Totals Only option. In the 
second pull-down, choose to sort by Level. Check the Itemize Every Instance option at 
the bottom.
	
4.	 In this schedule, you want to make the areas read as they would in a spreadsheet—right-
justified and totaled. Choose the Formatting tab and select Area from the list on the left. 
Change the Alignment to Right and check the Calculate Totals box. Select the Area Type 
field and check the Hidden Field box.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the dialog box and observe your results (Figure 17.23). The areas placed 
on each level should be listed under a header and the total area should be calculated at 
the bottom of each grouped level. Finally, the sum of all areas is displayed as a grand 
total at the bottom of the schedule.
Figure 17.23
The final schedule is an 
organized list of areas 
according to their level.
Adding Schedules to Your Templates
As you continue to document your designs, you will likely use the same schedules on many projects. 
Spend the time to make them consistent with your office’s graphic standards, and add them to your 
office template. That way, you won’t have to create them from scratch each and every time. As you 
add content to your model, the schedules will automatically populate, in effect filling themselves out.
If you have a schedule in another project and you want to add it to your current project, there’s no 
need to re-create it. Open both projects in the same instance of Revit. Go to the sheet on which 
the schedule you want to copy appears. If it’s not on a sheet, you’ll need to place it on one. Then 
simply select it and copy it to the Clipboard (press Ctrl+C). In your destination project, go to any 
sheet and press Ctrl+V to paste it. Once the paste is finished, the schedule should be there with all 
the formatting from the previous project but with all the information from your current model.
Another way to save a schedule separate from a project file is to save the view. Choose the Application 
button and click Save As ➢ Library ➢ Save Views. From here you can select several schedules to 
export as a small, separate RVT file. This file can then be inserted into other project files to add 
the schedules. If you want to export only one schedule, you can right-click on the schedule in the 
Project Browser and select Save To New File from the context menu.

Creating Schedules and Legends |  737  
Creating a Sheet List
Using a sheet list schedule, you can create a tabular view of sheets in your project—even 
including drawings provided by consultants. This type of schedule allows you to create 
placeholders for sheets that are not yet created or that will not be a part of your discipline’s 
drawing set.
In the sample workflow, you have created area plans for the Usable Area scheme. Eventually, 
you may want to create another area scheme based on departmental spaces. You haven’t created 
them yet, but you want to create your sheet list, including the area plans that you will create 
later. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules ➢ Sheet List.
	
2.	 In the Fields tab of the Sheet List Properties dialog box, add the fields named Sheet 
Number and Sheet Name to the list of scheduled fields.
	
3.	 On the Sorting/Grouping tab, choose to sort by Sheet Number and make sure the Itemize 
Every Instance check box is checked. Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
4.	 To begin adding sheets to the sheet list, go to the Rows panel in the ribbon and then 
click Insert ➢ Data Rows. This will give you a row with the next sequential number 
based on the last number you entered. Change the sheet number in the new row to 
G101 and click the Data Rows button again. The next new row should be G102. Change 
the names of G101 and G102 to LEVEL 1 AREA PLAN and LEVEL 2 AREA PLAN, 
respectively.
You can continue populating the schedule in this way, adding any sheet names you need 
or plan to have in the presentation package. Next, you will begin to create a sheet directly 
from a row in the sheet list.
	
5.	 Start by selecting the New Sheet button from the Modify Schedules/Quantities tab on the 
ribbon. This will give you a dialog box similar to Figure 17.24.
	
6.	 Select the type of sheet border you’d like to use from the list at the top. Choose the C size 
sheet border for this exercise.
	
7.	 Select G101 - LEVEL 1 AREA PLAN from the list of placeholder sheets and click OK.
This will create a sheet from the line item in the schedule using the same name and sheet 
number. The new sheet will appear under the Sheet node in the Project Browser with the correct 
number and name. You will begin to add views to this sheet later in this chapter.

738  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Using Legends
Legends can become great tools for general notes, key plans, or any other view type that you 
will want to have consistent across several sheets. It’s also important to note that anything you 
place inside a legend view—doors, walls, windows, and so on—will not appear or be counted in 
any schedules. Legend elements live outside of any quantities present in the model.
The Legend tool is located on the Create panel in the View tab. You can create two types of 
legends from this menu: a legend, which is a graphic display, or a keynote legend, which is a text-
based schedule. Both legend types can be placed on multiple sheets, but for this exercise, you’ll 
focus on the graphic legend. The keynote legend will be handled in more detail in Chapter 18, 
“Annotating Your Design.”
As part of the sample workflow, you may want to present some of the wall types from your 
presentation package to demonstrate the Sound Transmission Class (STC) of the walls and the 
overall wall assembly. Because these wall types will be appearing on all the sheets where you 
are using them in plan, you’ll make them using a legend.
To make a legend, choose the Legend button from the View tab under the Legends flyout. 
Creating a new legend is much like creating a new drafting view. You’ll be presented with a 
New Legend View dialog box (Figure 17.25), where you can name the legend and set the scale. 
For this legend, name it WALL LEGEND and choose 1 1/2” = 1”−0” (1:10) for the scale.

Laying Out Sheets |  739  
The legend you’ve created will look like a blank view. At this point, it’s up to you to add 
content. The simplest type of legend would be adding notes such as plan or demolition notes 
that would appear in each of your floor plans. You could do this simply by using the Text tool 
and adding text within this legend view; however, in this example you want to add more than 
just text.
To add wall types or any other family to the legend view, expand the Families tree in the 
Project Browser and navigate to the Wall family. Expand this node and then expand the Basic 
Wall node. Select the Interior − 4 7/8” (138 mm) Partition (1-Hr) wall type, drag it into the view, 
and insert it anywhere.
With the family inserted into the view, it will appear as a 3’ (1000 mm)-long plan wall. 
Change your view’s detail level from Coarse to Medium or Fine so you can see the detail within 
the wall. With that done, select the inserted wall and look at the settings in the Options bar. 
These options will be consistent for any of the family types you insert. The Options bar for leg-
end elements consists of three sections:
Family    This drop-down menu allows you to select different family types and operates just 
like the Type Selector does for other elements within the model.
View    The View option lets you change the type of view from Floor Plan to Section.
Host Length    This option changes the overall length (or in the case of sections, height) of the 
element selected.
Let’s make some minor adjustments to the wall sample in the legend. Let’s change View to 
Section and change Host Length to 1’-6” (500 mm).
The wall now looks like a sectional element. By adding some simple text, you can embellish 
the wall type to better explain the elements you’re viewing (Figure 17.26).

Laying Out Sheets
Throughout this chapter, you have created different kinds of views, including area plans, 
­schedules, and legends. Eventually you will need to lay those out onto sheets so they can be 
printed or exported as PDF or DWF files and sent to others for review.

740  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Creating sheets is easy. As you’ve already seen, you can create sheets through a sheet list 
schedule. You can also create sheets by right-clicking the Sheet node in the Project Browser 
and selecting New Sheet from the context menu. Regardless of which method you use to create 
them, in the following sections we’ll walk you through laying out these views on sheets and 
show you how to manipulate each view further once it’s placed on a sheet.
Adding the Area Plan
In the following exercise, you will continue to use the c17-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or 
c17-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt file saved from previous exercises in this chapter:
	
1.	 Open the G101 – LEVEL 1 AREA PLAN sheet in the view window by double-clicking it 
in the Project Browser. Now, let’s add your first view—the Usable Area plan for Level 1. 
To do this, simply drag and drop it from the Project Browser onto the sheet. The view will 
show at the proper scale and with a view title already established. You can then drag the 
view across the sheet to place it where you’d like to have it, which in this case is centered 
at the top of the sheet.
When views are placed on sheets, they are referred to as viewports. Select the view you 
just placed on the sheet and look at the Properties palette. The instance properties of the 
viewport are actually the view properties of that view. These properties can be modified 
at any time in the Properties palette for a viewport that has been placed on a sheet. A 
viewport also has type properties that determine the view title family, the visibility of 
the view title, and the formatting of the optional title extension line. We discuss viewport 
management with greater detail in Chapter 20, “Presenting Your Design.”
After placing the view on the sheet, you’ll notice that the purple area boundary lines are 
still visible. If you print the sheet at this point, the software will print those lines as thick, 
black lines that border your floor plate. This may be undesirable, so you need to do some 
view management to turn those lines off. One way you can do this is by activating the area 
plan from the Project Browser and working within the view itself. Since you have the view 
already established on a sheet, there’s no reason to go back to the original view when you 
can work on it directly through the sheet.
	
2.	 Right-click the view on the sheet and choose Activate View from the context menu. You 
can also double-click a view placed on a sheet to activate it.
Activating a View
Activating a view is like working in model space through a paper space viewport in Autodesk® 
AutoCAD® software. You’re working on the actual view but you’re doing so while it is placed on 
the sheet. This gives you the benefit of seeing how changes to the view will affect the layout of 
the view on the sheet. For example, it could be undesirable to enlarge the crop window for the 
view to show more information on the sheet. Doing so will take up valuable sheet real estate 
and should be balanced by the amount of space the other views on this sheet need. You’ll also 
notice that once the view is activated, all the surrounding materials (the sheet and any other 
views) turn gray. This is to alert you to the fact that you’re working in the view and are not 
active on the sheet.
In this view, however, you want to make some modifications to the visibility and turn off the 
area boundaries so they are not visible when you print. To do this, open the Visibility/Graphic 

Laying Out Sheets |  741  
Overrides dialog box by pressing VG on your keyboard or navigating to the command via the 
context menu.
In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, pan down in the Model tab (activated by 
default) and choose the Lines node. Uncheck the box for <Area Boundaries> and click OK. The 
boundary lines should disappear from the view.
Now you’re ready to get out of the activation mode and add some additional views to the 
sheet. To do this, right-click anywhere within the view and choose Deactivate View from the 
context menu. You can also double-click outside the viewport to deactivate the view.
Deactivate Active Views
Keep the following in mind: Once you activate a view and complete your edits, you must deac-
tivate it. As you can see on the sheet, activated views gray out the surrounding sheet context. 
If you were to print at this point, the sheet would print as gray with only the activated view 
showing in black.
To deactivate a view, you can do one of three things. You can click Deactivate View from the con-
text ribbon, right-click the mouse and choose Deactivate View from the context menu, or simply 
double-click outside of the view area.
With the view on the sheet, you will want to make some other adjustments to help clean 
up the sheet layout a bit. One thing you will want to do is modify the view title’s location and 
length. To do this, select the viewport, and the view title will activate. With the view title active, 
you’ll notice the blue grip at the end of the title line. By grabbing and dragging the grip, you can 
shorten the view title. Press the Esc key or click the Modify button in the ribbon to deselect the 
viewport.
Now select the view title itself—not the viewport—and then click and drag the title closer to 
the view itself (Figure 17.27).

selecting it directly, 
not by selecting the

742  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
Using Guide Grids
If you have multiple plans, elevations, or sections that need to be placed at the same location 
on a series of sheets, the Guide Grid command can help you manage this. Guide grids are 
nonprinting grids that can be associated with sheets. The grids allow you to snap or align 
elements such as reference planes, other grids, or crop regions to specific locations relative to 
the sheet border.
You can create as many unique guide grids as required in a Revit project. First, activate the 
G101 sheet to establish your first guide grid. Complete the following exercise before placing the 
next area plan on a new sheet:
	
1.	 From the View tab in the ribbon, select Guide Grid from the Sheet Composition panel. 
Name the new grid C-Sheet Area Plans.
	
2.	 When you see the grid appear on the sheet, select it and look at the Properties palette. 
Change the spacing to 3” (75 mm).
	
3.	 Select the outer boundary of the guide grid and activate the Move command (press MV 
on the keyboard). Snap to one of the grid intersections within the guide, and then move it 
to the upper-left intersection of the inner sheet border.
Where you place the guide grid and the spacing of the grid itself will depend on exactly 
how you plan to use it. In our example, we need to identify only a single common point 
to which we will align our area plans. The location of the boundary of the grid is not 
important; the boundary cannot be snapped to.
	
4.	 Access the view properties of the sheet and scroll down to find the Guide Grid property. 
Make sure it is set to C-Sheet Area Plans.
	
5.	 Select the area plan already placed on sheet G101 and activate the Move command. Snap 
to the intersection of the two reference planes visible in the plan and then to a nearby 
intersection on the guide grid.
Note that some traditional modifying methods do not work with guide grids. For example, 
you cannot use the Align command.
	
6.	 If you haven’t already done so, create a new sheet using the G102 - LEVEL 2 AREA PLAN 
placeholder. In the Properties palette, make sure the guide grid is specified and note that 
it is now in exactly the same location as on the previous sheet.
	
7.	 Drag the Level 2 Usable Area plan onto the sheet, and then use the Move command to 
adjust the location of the plan to the same location as on the previous sheet (Figure 17.28). 
Note that only crop regions and datum objects will snap to the guide grids; therefore, you 
may need to activate the area plans and enter Reveal Hidden Elements mode in the view 
control bar. This will temporarily display reference planes in the exercise file. Deactivate 
the view and move the viewports into alignment with the guide grid.

Laying Out Sheets |  743  
If you haven’t noticed already, model views of the same scale will always snap to each 
other without any special grids. What you might not realize is that this also works between 
views of different types as long as they are of the same scale. For example, you can drag an 
elevation from the Project Browser onto sheet G102 and see how it snaps in relation to the 
plan. Sections can also be aligned with elevations and with plans. Even 3D views can be 
aligned with each other.
Adding the Schedule
With the largest view, the area plan, on the sheet, you can use the bottom portion of the sheet to 
lay out your other views. For the second view, let’s add the area schedule you created. To do this, 
drag and drop it from the Project Browser in much the same way you added the area plan. The 
inserted view will look like Figure 17.29. You’ll notice some differences in how this view looks 
from the way a schedule looks when it’s not on a sheet. Specifically, you can now see the header 
text and the fonts you chose in the schedule properties. You’ll also be able to see the grid lines 
and their associated line weights from the Appearance tab of the schedule properties.
Figure 17.28
Use Guide Grids 
to help align 
views among a 
series of sheets.

744  | Chapter 17  Documenting Your Design   
With the schedule on the sheet, it looks a bit tight. You have the ability to redefine the column 
spacing so you can make any visual adjustments to the schedule while it is on the sheet to help it 
read better. These adjustments do not change the actual schedule—just its appearance on the sheet.
To do this, highlight the schedule by selecting it. The schedule will turn blue, and you’ll have 
a few new grips to help you make adjustments (Figure 17.30). The blue inverted triangles will 
allow you to modify the column widths. Grab them and drag them left or right to change the 
column sizing.
Figure 17.29
A schedule placed on a 
sheet
Figure 17.30
A schedule’s appearance 
can be manipulated 
when it is placed on a 
sheet.
You’ll also notice a blue cut symbol on the schedule. This cut symbol lets you break the 
schedule into multiple vertical columns on the same sheet. This tool can be especially handy if 
you have a long schedule like a room schedule or door schedule and it has too many rows to fit 
vertically on your sheet. Selecting this tool will break the schedule in half (and you can break 
it into half again and again) so that you can take advantage of the horizontal real estate. If you 
choose to separate your schedule in this fashion, it will still retain all the necessary information 
and all the portions will continue to automatically fill themselves out dynamically as a single

schedule would. You also have the opportunity to change the overall height of the schedule once 
it is broken up by grabbing the grips at the bottom of the schedule and dragging up and down 
(Figure 17.31). Doing so will draw or push rows from the adjacent schedule portion so that all of 
your information is continuous.
Figure 17.31
Changing the  
schedule height
To rebuild a split schedule—essentially returning it to a single list—select the schedule on the 
sheet so it highlights and the grips are displayed. Click one of the move icons and drag the split 
portion on top of the other schedule segment. The split schedule will then become whole again.
Finishing the Sheet
Now that you have those two views on the sheet, it is a simple matter to add the remaining 
views. To add the wall legend you created, you will drag and drop it from the Project Browser in 
much the same way you did with the other two views.
In this case, the wall legend came onto the sheet needing little modification. Following 
this same workflow, you can also add a drafting view from the imported detail to the sheet, 
completing Sheet G102 (Figure 17.32).

The Bottom Line
Document plans.    With floor plans you can create visual graphics that help define how a 
space is laid out. However, Revit provides other tools such as area plans to help you describe 
space.
Master It    List the four types of area plans that you can create and note the two that 
Revit creates automatically.
Create schedules and legends.    Schedules are another view type; they allow you to show 
information about the model in a nongraphic format. Schedules can also be used to dynami-
cally report quantities of elements inside the model.
Master It    Understand how to create schedules and report additional information about 
the elements in the model. How would you create a simple casework schedule showing 
quantities of types?
Lay out sheets.    Eventually in a project it will become necessary to create sheets that will 
become the documentation set. Knowing how to create a good sheet set provides you with 
another venue to communicate with contractors, clients, and other team members.
Master It    To properly create a sheet set, you need to understand the dynamics of adding 
views to a sheet. In the Revit environment, there is only one way to add views to a sheet. 
What is it?

 Chapter  18 
 annotating Your Design   
 No set of documents is complete without the annotations to describe the drawings. Even when 
you are using a digital, parametric model, you still need to provide annotated documents. It is 
necessary to add dimensions, tags, text, and notes to the drawings to properly communicate 
with owners, contractors, and the rest of the design team. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Annotate with text and keynotes 
 
◆
 Use tags 
 
◆
 Add dimensions 
 
◆
 Set project and shared parameters 
 annotating with text and Keynotes 
 Notes are a critical part of communicating design and construction intent to owners and builders. 
No drawing set is complete without descriptions of materials and the work like the ones you can 
see in Figure  18.1 .  
 Figure  18.1 
 An annotated detail 

748  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
There are two ways to add notes to your drawings in Autodesk® Revit® Architecture software. 
Both are located on the Annotate tab and highlighted in Figure 18.2. One of these methods is the 
Text command (shown on the left), and the other is the Keynote command (shown on the right).
Figure 18.2
The Text and Keynote 
commands
The text object consists of a resizable field into which you can enter text with optional features, 
including leaders, bullets, or numbers. Text can be used for annotations, sheet notes (such as gen-
eral notes), or legends; it can be used generally anywhere you need to add a description or a note.
Keynotes are predefined text fields that are linked to elements and materials through a data 
file. Keynotes can be scheduled and standardized across the project but can’t be directly edited 
within the application. Both keynotes and text have specific uses. Let’s look at how both of these 
can be used in a project.
Using Text
Text is quick and easy to add to any view (including 3D views), and like other drafting elements 
it is view-specific. Text added to one view will not appear in any other location within the model, 
nor will the information that you insert into the text box hold any sort of parametric values.
You can access the Text tool from the Text panel on the Annotate tab (shown previously in 
Figure 18.2). To begin adding text, select the Text tool and first observe the settings in the contex-
tual ribbon (Figure 18.3). You can specify an option for a leader, the position of the leader, and 
the justification of the text. It is easier to set these options before you place a text object, but they 
can always be adjusted later.
Figure 18.3
The contextual ribbon 
for the text tool
After you have selected the most appropriate settings for your annotation, go to a place in a 
view where you’d like to place the text object. You will have the opportunity to use one of two 
methods to create the text object. If you click once, the location you clicked will be the origin of 
the text object and the text will not have a defined width. Using this method, you may need to 
use the Enter key to fit the text to your needs—pressing Enter will create a line break in the text 
box. This method may cause some difficulty in the future if you need to resize the text box or if 
you change the scale of the view.
The other option is to hold down the left mouse button while you click to place the origin of 
the text. Then drag the mouse pointer to specify the boundary of the text object, creating a box. 

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  749  
Don’t worry about the vertical extents of the boundary; you just need to set the width of the 
text box. Using this option gives you greater flexibility if you need to resize the text box or if the 
scale of your view changes, because the word-wrapping will be handled automatically. With the 
Text command active, you’ll be presented with the standard mouse pointer crosshair, but it will 
have a small A in the lower-right corner to let you know you are adding text and not other ele-
ments. In either case, if you need to adjust the width of your text box, you can do so at any time 
using the grips.
If you select one of the leader options in the ribbon before placing the text object, your first 
one or two clicks (depending on the leader option selected) will be to place the leader. For exam-
ple, if you choose the two-segment line leader option, your first click will be the arrowhead of 
the leader. Your second click will be the elbow of the leader, and then the third click will be the 
beginning of the text box. At this third click, you can still drag the mouse pointer to predefine 
the width of the text box. Try this a few times until you become familiar with the implicit place-
ment and snapping alignment of text objects and leaders.
Once you place a text object in a view, you can write much as you do in applications such as 
Microsoft Word. Once you finish typing, click outside the text box. Your finished text box will 
look like Figure 18.4.
Figure 18.4
A highlighted text box
New to Revit 2017 are some additional text formatting tools. With the text inside the text 
box activated or as you’re typing, you’ll notice some new text formatting features. For any-
one familiar with any other text editor, these tools should be fairly self-explanatory, and for 
anyone familiar with Revit over the past few years, these come as some long-sought-after 
text-editing improvements. The new tools, shown in Figure 18.5, will allow you to do the 
following:
◆
◆
Format the font to bold, italic, or underlined text
◆
◆
Add subscripts or superscripts
◆
◆
Change font size visually
◆
◆
Add bullets, numbers, or alphabetical lists
◆
◆
Indent text
◆
◆
Change the position of text in a list by adding or removing incremental tabulation

750  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
You’ll also notice that once you finish with your initial text or you select an existing text 
object, a few tools are available with which you can modify the text:
Grips    The round grips on either side of the text box allow you to resize the width of the box.
Move    There is a move icon that appears in the upper-left corner of the text box. In addition, 
hovering your mouse anywhere within the highlighted text will also display a move cursor. 
You can click and drag from within the box or click the move icon on the upper-left corner 
to relocate it. When you’re moving text with the move icon (or the Move command), the text 
and leader will relocate together. When you’re moving text by dragging, the leader end will 
remain pinned while you relocate the text box. These methods let you move either the text or 
the text and the leader, depending on your need.
Rotate    The upper-right corner shows a rotate icon. Clicking this icon allows you to 
rotate the text box as you would any object in a project. Remember that text will always 
position itself to be read left to right if it is horizontal or bottom to top if it is vertical in 
a view.
A text family behaves like other families because it maintains a parametric relationship 
throughout the project. Making type property changes to a text object in one location (changing 
font, font size, color, and so on) changes all the instances of that type throughout the model. To 
modify text type properties, select a block of text or choose the Text tool and then observe the 
Properties palette, as shown in Figure 18.6.
Figure 18.5
New text formatting 
tools
Figure 18.6
Type Selector for text
The instance properties for text objects are rather limited and deal primarily with controls 
such as alignment, location, and so on, which you can also set on the ribbon. The Type Selector 
also allows you to select a different text type or edit the properties of the currently selected 
type. Click the Edit Type button to open the text family’s type properties. Figure 18.7 shows the 
properties for the default 1/4” Arial text type.

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  751  
In the Type Properties dialog box, you have more control over the style of the text from a type 
perspective. While you can now edit specific text in a text box, there are still many reasons that 
you want to control text with the Type tool. In the Type Selector, you can modify text type prop-
erties, such as font, size, and width factor. You can also add formatting to the text, such as bold, 
italic, and underline. Other important settings to consider include Show Border, Background, 
and Leader Arrowhead. The Show Border property simply allows all text object instances to 
be enclosed with a line boundary. The Background property can be set to either Opaque or 
Transparent, which will control whether the text will obscure objects beneath it. Finally, the 
style of leader arrowhead is defined in the text type properties to help you maintain consistency 
throughout your design documents.
Contextual Text Formatting
When any text object is selected in a view (not the text itself), additional formatting tools become 
available on the ribbon. The Format panel is divided into four sections that allow you to modify 
the instance of the text you’ve placed. Figure 18.8 shows the Format panel when the overall text 
object is selected and when you activate the text within the object. Let’s look at this panel in 
more detail to better understand the toolset:

752  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Leaders    The leftmost section of this panel (a) allows you to designate the type and style of 
leader you want to add to your text box. When you activate the Text tool, the upper-left A is 
selected by default (as in Figure 18.8), which designates that no leader is currently added. The 
other choices all add a leader to the text. Reading from left to right, the options are no leader, a 
single-segment leader, a double-segment leader, and an arc leader. Leaders can be added at any 
time when you’re placing or editing text and can also be removed at any time. Remember that 
when you’re removing leaders, they will disappear in the order in which they were added.
Leader Location    The second portion of this panel (b) dictates leader location. Leaders can 
be added to the left or to the right and at the top, middle, or bottom of the text box. The top 
example in Figure 18.9 shows the default with a left leader springing from the upper left of 
the text; leaders that spring from the right side typically come from the end of the text box 
(at the bottom). A double-segment leader springing from the left and right will look like the 
example shown in Figure 18.9.
Figure 18.9

Using Keynotes
Keynotes are annotations that use a parameter to connect specific elements or materials in the 
model to descriptive information stored in an external TXT file. You can control the formatting 
of the keynote’s font style, size, and justification in the same manner as you can format standard 
text, but keynotes are essentially a tag family. Formatting changes must be made in the keynote’s 
family (RFA) file and reloaded into the project.
Inserting a keynote allows you to choose a value from the TXT file and apply it to a material 
or element. Because keynotes act as families, they can also be scheduled where standard text 
cannot. Before we discuss how to add different keynote types, we’ll explore the various ways a 
keynote can be displayed.
Without official corroboration from Autodesk, it appears that the keynoting functionality 
was designed to support the American Institute of Architects (AIA) proposal of the ConDoc 
system, in which a short numeric reference (usually based on MasterFormat by the Construction 
Specifications Institute) followed by a two-letter suffix is used to label elements in a drawing. 
The keynote then references a list or legend that is located on the same sheet as the note and has 
a longer definition of the note. For example, a keynote on a detail might read 033000.A1, with a 
leader pointing to an element in the drawing. The associated list on the side of the sheet would 
read CAST IN PLACE CONCRETE. Figure 18.10 shows an example of a keynote legend.
Figure 18.10
A keynote legend

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  753  
Despite the intended use of a keynote, you are not restricted to using only the numeric code. 
You can also display the full, written description directly within the detail or view without the 
numeric reference key. Figure 18.11 shows an example of keynotes that display the full descrip-
tion instead of the key.
Figure 18.11
Keynotes displaying 
full text descriptions
There is no wrong way to use keynotes, and Revit supports several methods of using them 
for annotation. Regardless of the method you use, keynotes will adhere to the same process for 
use. Once an element is tagged with a keynote, it will retain that keynote in all other views in 
the model. If an element has been tagged with a keynote in one view and is then annotated in 
another view, it will automatically display the same keynote value. This can become a powerful 
tool you can use to add consistency throughout the project for annotated elements.
New to Revit 2017 is the ability to pin keynotes. Pinned keynotes will retain their location even 
if the element they have tagged has been moved.
The Keynote command is located on the Annotate tab in the ribbon. When you select the 
Keynote tool, you have three options:
Element    Use Element keynotes to annotate elements and assemblies within the model, 
such as walls, doors, floors, or other family instances. This type of note is typically used if 

754  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
you want to annotate an entire assembly (such as a wall, roof, or door). Moving the Element 
keynote leader arrow off the object will change the value of the note based on the element 
to which it points. The keynote value for a family type can be preset within the family. 
We’ll go into that later in this chapter.
Material    Using the Material keynote type will allow you to annotate specific materials within 
any elements. You can add notes for materials like concrete, gypsum board, rigid insulation, metal 
studs, and so on. Moving the Material keynote leader arrow from one material to another will 
change the value of the note based on the material to which it points even if it’s within the same 
element. So, a wall with multiple materials can have several Material keynotes. Material keynotes 
can also be predefined as part of your project template through the Materials tool on the Manage 
tab. Material keynotes can also be used in conjunction with Element keynotes (Figure 18.12).

a material
User    User keynotes are different from Element and Material keynotes because they are 
view-specific and cannot be predefined. Although they are still tied to the same TXT file and 
will update in the same manner as other keynotes, they are not associated with any model 
objects. User keynotes are meant to be used for all the instances when you don’t have a mod-
eled element or material but you still need to define a note. Some examples of things you 
wouldn’t necessarily model might be sealant, backer rod, or flashing.
User keynotes are used primarily in drafting views. To use any keynote, a given view must 
have at least one model element or component visible within it. In the case of a drafting view, 
you will need to insert a 2D component (such as wood blocking or a steel stud) because key-
notes cannot be used to note linework. Because User keynotes are not locked to specific model 
geometry, once they are inserted they can easily be copied or moved around within the view 
and pointed toward any element. In this way, if you have sealant or flashing shown as linework, 
you can add a User keynote to the view and then adjust the note leader and the note value to call 

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  755  
out the sealant properly. You can change the value of a User keynote at any time simply by double-
clicking the note value; this modification will not affect any other notes within the project.
You can use all of these note types in conjunction with one another. Using an Element note 
to add a keynote to a wall doesn’t mean you cannot also use a Material note to call out the indi-
vidual materials in the wall assembly.
Assigning Keynotes and Editing
A core concept of the Keynote tool is how the notes react within the model. Assigning a keynote 
to an object lets you associate a text or numeric value with a family’s keynote type parameter. This 
value is consistent for every instance of that element within the model or project. For example, all 
walls have a type parameter called Keynote that lets you set the keynote value. If you keynote a 
wall anywhere within the model, the keynote value in the type parameter will reflect that note. 
Consequently, any other wall of that type will be prepopulated with that keynote value. Changes 
to this keynote value will dynamically update the type parameter value and update any keynotes 
placed within the model tagged to this wall.
All keynotes within a project are tied to an external TXT file. This TXT file is the only loca-
tion where the value of the keynotes can be edited. You can modify this file at any point to add 
or remove notes, and you can make the edits while the project is actively open. Figure 18.13 
shows a sample of the file.
Figure 18.13
The keynote TXT file

756  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
This external file is designed to keep the annotations consistent by storing them in one repos-
itory. Every time you add or change a note value and reload the TXT file back into the Revit 
model, all the keynotes dynamically update.
You can edit this TXT file or add one to the project at any time. You can have multiple key-
note files for various projects, but you can have only one TXT file associated with a project at a 
time. You cannot assign multiple keynote files to one project model.
Managing Keynotes
A great way to ensure consistent use of notes throughout multiple projects is to create a master 
keynote file for each of your various project types. This master note list can be linked to elements 
and materials within your project template so that you can immediately begin inserting common 
notes into any project. Because this master list will likely be quite long, project teams can make 
a copy of the list and place it in their project directory. They can then safely delete the notes they 
won’t be using over the course of the project, giving them fewer options to hunt through when 
they need to add a keynote.
A single keynote file also gives project management a level of control over the consistency of the 
notes that you won’t be able to get if you use regular text. Spelling accidents or mislabeling can 
happen in a project when you use regular text objects. For example, it’s easy to overlook a note 
that reads CIP CONCRETE on one detail and CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE in another. By placing 
all the notes into one file, the project manager or project architect has better control over how the 
note reads, thus ensuring consistency throughout all the sheets and details.
Because the keynote list is a separate TXT file, if you are transferring files to other offices or 
clients, you may need to include the TXT file along with the RVT file. If you don’t send the TXT 
file, others will be able to see all your keynotes but they won’t be able to change or edit any of 
them.
Using the Keynote File
Three default keynote text files are available at the library locations. In Windows 7, Windows 8, 
or Windows 10, they are found at C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\RVT 2017\Libraries\US (there 
is also a default keynote file in the Metric folder). Another way to find these files is to start a new 
project using the default template and go to the Annotate tab. Click the Keynote drop-down 
arrow on the Tag panel and select Keynoting Settings. In the Keynoting Settings dialog box, 
click the Browse button and you will be taken to the default library location.
These four keynote files are
RevitKeynotes_Imperial.txt
RevitKeynotes_Imperial_2004.txt
RevitKeynotes_Imperial_2010.txt
RevitKeynotes_Metric.txt
You can edit any of these files in Notepad or Excel and follow the format already established 
within the file. Let’s look at the format of this file so you can understand how to customize the 
keynotes.

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  757  
The first few rows of the file (Figure 18.14) designate the grouping of the notes. In this example, 
they consist of a label (Division 03) followed by a tab and then a description (Concrete).
Figure 18.14
The keynote TXT file 
header
Directly below this header is a secondary, or minor, grouping. This secondary grouping fol-
lows the same format as the primary group and provides better control over how the keynotes 
are displayed within Revit. This line follows the same format as the first: Label (030000), then 
a tab, then a description (Concrete), then another tab, and then a reference to the parent code 
(Division 03). This last entry must match the label in the line above. This designates the second 
line as a subset to the first line. You can add as many or as few subgroups as you’d like. In our 
case, we have subcategories for each division, but that’s not necessary.
Below the grouping are the contents of that group. These lines are articulated in the following 
format:
Label [tab] Description (note body) [tab] Grouping
In the example shown in Figure 18.14, this reads as follows (where the [tab] is an actual tab, 
not the text):
033000.A1 [tab] C.I.P. CONCRETE (033000) [tab] 030000
To get an idea of how this will all look once loaded into Revit, see Figure 18.15, which shows 
you the Keynotes dialog box with Division 03 expanded.
Figure 18.15
The Keynotes dialog 
box

758  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Using the keynote file approach lets you add, remove, or edit notes and groups of notes. 
It might seem frustrating to have to open and load a separate TXT file every time you want 
to add or remove notes from the keynote list. However, remember that this also maintains 
consistency and a level of control over the master list that isn’t available with simple text 
objects. Although it might be slow at stages to get all the project notes into the TXT file, 
it also means that the time you’ll spend checking and verifying the notes is dramatically 
reduced.
If you find that editing keynotes in an external TXT file that is segregated from the 
­project environment does not suit your needs, tools are available online to help you manage 
keynotes using a graphical interface. Revolution Design has created a tool called Keynote 
Manager (www.revolutiondesign.biz) that will manage your keynote list, create headings 
and subheadings, and format the TXT file in a way that Revit can read it. Tools like this are 
great for speeding up the editing process for keynotes and maintaining proper formatting of 
the TXT file.
Accessing Keynote Settings and Loading the TXT File
Now that the keynote TXT file is established and you’ve begun populating it with annotations, 
you need to link it to your project. Loading this file into the project is simple and needs to hap-
pen only once. Additionally, loading this keynote file is a project setting, not a user setting. Once 
the file is linked, all team members will have access to the keynotes. As a side note, if you are 
working in a team environment, make sure to place the keynote file in a location everyone has 
access to, like a network resource. Placing it on your C: drive will allow you access to it but will 
not allow others on your team to see the notes.
To access the keynote settings and load the keynote text file, go to the Annotate tab in 
the ribbon, locate the Tag panel, and then click Keynote ➢ Keynoting Settings, as shown in 
Figure 18.16.
Figure 18.16
Accessing the 
Keynoting Settings
This command will open the Keynoting Settings dialog box (Figure 18.17). Here, you can 
define the project’s keynote file as well as adjust some other settings. To load the keynote file, 
click the Browse button and navigate to the TXT file you created.

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  759  
Here are some other variables that you can set in the Keynoting Settings dialog box:
File Path    File Path defines how Revit Architecture looks for your text file using one of three 
methods:
Absolute    The Absolute option follows the UNC naming conventions and navigates 
across your network or workstation for a specified location.
Relative    This option locates the text file relative to your RVT project file. If you move 
the RVT file and the text file and maintain the same folder structure, the keynote file will 
be found and automatically loaded.
At Library Locations    This option lets you put the text file in the default library location 
defined in the File Locations tab of the Options dialog box (Application ➢ Options).
Numbering Method    Numbering Method defines how the keynotes are numbered:
By Keynote    This option allows you to number keynotes as they come from the associated 
text file.
By Sheet    With this option enabled, the keynotes are numbered sequentially on a 
per-sheet basis.
Figure 18.17

dialog box
Loading or Reloading Keynotes
Once the keynote TXT file is loaded into Revit, it is available for the team to use. As we’ve men-
tioned, changes can be made to this file on the fly while the project is open and active. Although 
this is true, if changes are made to the keynote file while the project is open, the keynote file will 
need to be reloaded into the project for the changes to be visible to other team members. There 
are two ways to do this:
◆
◆
Open the Keynoting Settings dialog box and click the Reload button. Once this is done, you’ll 
need to use Synchronize With Central (if the project is workshared), and your team members 
will also need to use SWC to gain access to the changes.
◆
◆
Close and reopen your project file. 

760  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Adding Keynotes
Download the project file c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt and the keynote file MARA_Keynotes.txt
from the folder for Chapter 18 on this book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. 
Make sure you place them in the same folder on your computer because the path setting for the 
keynote file is set to Relative in the RVT file. Open the RVT project file to begin the exercise.
To add keynotes to an element in a project model, choose one of the three keynote types from 
the Annotate tab; then select the object you want to annotate in your view and insert a keynote. 
The sequence for inserting keynotes is arrowhead, leader segment, and then keynote. Similar to 
placing a tag, the Keynote command (even the User keynote) requires an object to be selected to 
start the insertion sequence. If the object doesn’t have a note already defined, you’ll be prompted 
to pick a note from the Keynotes dialog box. Figure 18.18 shows a sample of this list.
Figure 18.18
Choosing a keynote  
to insert
Let’s explore this functionality with a quick exercise in which you will annotate a detail with 
keynotes. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the Project Browser, expand the Sections (Wall Section) heading and activate the 
view named Window Sill Detail.
	
2.	 Go to the Annotate tab in the ribbon and select Keynote ➢ Element Keynote on the Tag panel.
	
3.	 Select the window in the view and then place the leader and keynote.
You will see that the keynote code has already been populated because the keynote has 
already been defined in the type properties for the window family.
	
4.	 With the Element Keynote command still active, click the wood sill detail component and 
place another keynote. This time, the Keynotes dialog box will appear because no key-
note was defined in the wall’s type properties. Select the keynote labeled 061100.A1 and 
then close the dialog box.

5.	 Go back to the Annotate tab in the ribbon and select Keynote ➢ Material Keynote.
	
6.	 Select the cross-hatched material at the right side of the wall below the window. Again, the 
Keynotes dialog box will appear because a keynote value was not defined in that material’s 
identity data. Select the keynote labeled 071300.A1 and then close the dialog box.
The results will look like the image in Figure 18.19.

Creating Keynote Legends
Depending on your choice of keynote and your workflow, you might want to create a legend on 
each sheet for your notes. You might want only the keynotes that are shown on a given sheet to 
dynamically appear in the legend. Or you might want to have one legend that will show all key-
notes used throughout the project.
These legends usually reside on the side of a sheet near the title block information and can 
take one of two forms. The first type is all-inclusive and shows every note within the project. 
This style has the benefit of consistency between sheets in the set. The same note will always be 
in the same location in the list; however, this type of list can become quite long for larger proj-
ects. The other type of keynote list includes only the notes that show up on a particular sheet. 
This has the advantage of supplying a list of notes customized for each sheet without extraneous 
information. Creating either list manually has traditionally been challenging. One of the ben-
efits of Revit Architecture is the ability to completely automate either list type, thus removing 
much of the chance for error in the process. Let’s review how to create both types of lists.
Creating a keynote legend is simple: Choose the Legends button on the View tab and select 
Keynote Legend from the drop-down list (Figure 18.20). Once you launch the command, name 
the keynote legend, and then click OK.
Figure 18.20
The Keynote Legend 
button

762  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
You’ll be presented with what looks like a typical schedule dialog box, called Keynote Legend 
Properties. There are only two fields available in a keynote legend, and by default, they are both 
loaded into the Scheduled Fields side of the Fields tab (Figure 18.21). Those fields are as follows:
Figure 18.21
The Fields tab of 
the Keynote Legend 
Properties dialog box
Key Value    This field contains the numeric value of the keynote.
Keynote Text    This field contains the text description for the keynote.
A keynote legend works like any other schedule as far as formatting and appearance go. By 
default, the sorting and grouping are already established because the key value is used to sort. 
The one special item of note is located on the Filter tab. At the bottom of this tab is a feature 
unique to this type of schedule: a Filter By Sheet check box (Figure 18.22). Selecting this box 
gives you the ability to filter the list specifically for each sheet set; leaving the box deselected 
will supply a full list of the keynotes over the entire project.
Figure 18.22
The Filter By Sheet 
option on the Filter tab 
in the Keynote Legend 
Properties dialog box

Annotating with Text and Keynotes |  763  
Like any other type of legend, a keynote legend can be placed on sheets again and again 
within the project. You’re not limited to only one instance of the legend on a sheet as you are 
with other view types. Additionally, if you choose the keynote legend that filters by sheet, it 
will dynamically modify the note list based on individual sheet contents. As views are added or 
removed from a sheet or notes are added to the project, the keynote legend updates accordingly.
Keynote legends are considered to be another type of legend view and will appear under the 
Legends node of the Project Browser.
A Schedule for Keynotes
Creating a schedule for keynotes is a great way to find single-use notes and typos in a project. If 
you are working on a project team, there’s always a chance that someone could be inserting an 
incorrect keynote into the project. Scheduling the notes is an efficient approach to managing the 
annotation process and gives you the tools to verify consistency. Scheduling keynotes allows you 
to do three things:
◆
◆
List all the notes within a project and verify their spelling and accuracy.
◆
◆
Find odd or one-off instances. Sometimes this can mean the note was accidentally placed in 
lieu of another note.
◆
◆
Make sure all the keynotes in the project are represented in the specifications. 
Using the Keynote Family
Revit Architecture comes with a default keynote family that allows you to produce both 
keynotes and text notes using the default keynote TXT file. The family name is Keynote 
Tag.rfa. This family has four types that let you change note styles within the project, as 
Figure 18.23 shows.
Figure 18.23

able in the default tag
Here are the four default styles:

764  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Each of these tag types pulls information from the text file we discussed previously in this 
chapter and reports it at the end of the leader. To change your keynotes between any of these 
options, select the keynote and choose a different type in the Type Selector.
Annotating with Tags
Tags are text labels for elements such as doors, walls, windows, rooms, and several other objects 
that architects typically need to reference in a set of drawings. In Revit Architecture, tags are 
intelligent, bidirectional graphics that report information stored in an object’s properties. Once 
you’ve tagged an element and entered a value in the tag, the tagged model element will retain 
that value until you remove it. The value lives with the model elements in a project; it is not a 
property of the tag. That means you can delete or remove tags without fear of losing the data 
entered into the tag. It also means that once an element is tagged with information in one view, 
if the tag is configured to report a type property, the same or similar elements will report the 
same information in any other view in which they are tagged without the necessity of entering 
the information twice. To understand this a bit better, take the example of a wall tag.
You’ve placed a wall tag in a view. The tag initially had “?” as a value, meaning that the Type 
Mark property for that wall was blank. In the wall tag, you’ve entered a wall type value of A1. 
In another view, you can now tag the same wall type and it will automatically display a value of 
A1. You can also delete any, or even all, of the tags for that wall, and new tags you place will still 
report the type number of A1.
A1
45
A1
45
101
04 22 00.A4
OFFICE

Keep in mind that you can also tag elements that are in linked models. Although you can-
not edit the properties of these elements (for example, you cannot change the wall type or door 
number), you can add tags to any of the linked elements as if the same elements were part of 
your project file.
Tags are versatile elements for annotating your designs. A tag can display a door number, but 
it can just as easily display any other properties of the door, such as fire rating, cost, or material 
type.
Inserting Tags
Tags can be automatically inserted when a model element, such as a door or room, is placed 
within the project (by checking the Tag On Placement option in the contextual tab of the ribbon), 
or they can be inserted later. The options to place a tag are all located on the Tag panel of the 
Annotate tab (Figure 18.24).

Figure 18.24
Tag tools in the 
Annotate tab
When you’re adding tags, it’s not necessary to find or choose the right tag—they will be 
assigned automatically. Tag families are specific to the elements to which they are being tagged. 
For example, you use a door tag to tag a door, but you can’t use a door tag to tag a wall or other 
element within the project. Figure 18.25 shows you some of the tags that are available; there is 
a tag for each type of object. You can customize each of the tag family types so you can graphi-
cally differentiate your door tags from wall tags, room tags, area tags, and so on.
Figure 18.25
Listing of various tag 
families
Figure 18.26
The Options bar when 
placing a tag
When inserting a tag, you’ll have several placement options available in the Options bar, as 
shown in Figure 18.26.
Orientation    The first option allows you to orient the tag horizontally or vertically. Tags, like 
text, will always read from either the bottom or the right side of the sheet or view.
The Tags Button    Clicking this button opens the Loaded Tags and Symbols dialog box, 
where you can load various tags.
Leader    The final three options relate to the tag leader. You can select the Leader check box 
(or turn it off) to have a leader show (or not show). Although attached leaders are the default 
for tags, the Leader drop-down can be changed from Attached End to Free End if you don’t 
want to associate the end of the leader with the element you’ve selected. Using the Free End 
option allows the leader to float free of the object. The final option of this set for leaders is 

766  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
the default leader length. By default, the value is set to 1/2” (12 mm). When you’re placing 
tags like wall tags that have leaders perpendicular to the wall they are tagging, it is a good 
idea to set a default length with which you are comfortable. You can adjust the tag location 
after inserting them, but sometimes it’s easier to set a good default value in leader length.
New to Revit 2017 is the ability to pin tags. Like Keynotes, a pinned tag will retain its location 
even if the element it has tagged has been relocated. This can be beneficial to keep small changes 
to elements from impacting several views prior to a deadline, but it can be equally problematic 
by allowing elements that have been dramatically changed to look incorrectly tagged.
Using the Tag Toolset
On the Annotate tab, you’ll find several tools that you can use to insert tags. Look back at 
Figure 18.24 to see these tools. Each has a different purpose and can be used in conjunction 
with other tools or separately to help document your project. Let’s take a look at each one:
Tag By Category    The Tag By Category button is possibly one of the most frequently used 
Tag commands. As we mentioned before, several tags are available, allowing you to tag a 
host of elements in the model. Click the Tag By Category button when you want to tag one 
element at a time, regardless of its category.
Using this tag command will allow you to select a door, a window, a wall—whatever single 
element you want to apply a tag to in the model. As you hover over elements, the tag type 
that corresponds to that element will be shown. Should the element you are trying to tag not 
have the associated tag loaded in the project, you will be prompted to load it (Figure 18.27).
Figure 18.27
Loading a tag for a spe-
cific element type
Tag All    The Tag All button, which activates the Tag All Not Tagged command, will do 
exactly that: tag all the untagged elements of a selected category within a given view. For 
example, you can tag all the doors. Or you can tag all doors, walls, and rooms—or any 
combination of any list of elements. When you select the Tag All command, the Tag All Not 
Tagged dialog box will appear (Figure 18.28). This dialog box displays a list of the elements in 
the view for which you have already loaded tags. Here, you can specify which elements can 
get tagged, what tag will be used, and if that tag will have a leader assigned to it. Use the Ctrl 
key on your keyboard to select more than one element from the list. When you’ve selected 
the categories you would like tagged, click OK.

Annotating with Tags |  767  
Tagging all the elements within a view can be a wonderful time-saver—but only if you’re okay 
with the software choosing the location for each of the tags. For example, the tags will be placed 
in the middle of the rooms. For most spaces, that will work just fine. For other tag types, such as 
walls or doors, you might have to adjust tag locations to make sure everything reads properly.
Room Tag and Area Tag    These two tag types work in much the same way. They will tag the 
room elements or area elements, depending on the type of view in which you happen to be. In 
other words, Room tags will work only in plans and elevations, whereas Area tags can be placed 
only in area plans. To tag rooms or areas, simply select the tag type you want and select the room 
or area object. When you place rooms or areas initially, the tag option is selected by default.
Material Tag    The Material tag is used to annotate specific materials within a model ele-
ment, similar to the Material keynote. The main difference from the keynote is that the tag 
does not use an external TXT file to read additional information about the tagged element. 
The default Material tag will display the Material Description value (Figure 18.29, left) as 
opposed to the Keynote value. You can always customize the Material tag to display other 
values such as the Mark, as shown in Figure 18.29 (right).

768  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Multi-Category Tag    The Multi-Category tag allows you to use the same tag style in a 
project to tag elements of different categories. This tag type can be useful in a number of 
ways. Let’s say you want to tag several elements in a floor plan and call out their manufac-
turer and unit cost. Typically, you would have to create a few different tag families to tag 
furniture, casework, lighting, and so on. Now a single tag type can do this for you by tagging 
the same field (like manufacturer or unit cost) across different element types. Let’s step 
through making a Multi-Category tag.
From the book’s web page, download the c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or c18-Sample-
Metric-Start.rvt file or continue with the exercise file from the previous section. Then follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan.
	
2.	 Click the Application menu and choose New ➢ Family. This will take you to the default 
family templates. Open the Annotations folder and choose Multi-Category Tag.rft or 
Metric Multi-Category Tag.rft.
	
3.	 In the Family Editor, go to the Create tab and select the Label tool. Click near the intersec-
tion of the reference planes in the view to place a label.
	
4.	 Once the label is placed in the view, the Edit Label dialog box opens (Figure 18.30). 
Here you’ll see a list of the parameters that are common across multiple family types—
Assembly Code, Cost, Family Name, and Model, among others. Select Manufacturer 
and Cost from the list and click the icon with the green arrow to add them to the Label 
Parameters list. Make sure the Manufacturer parameter is above the Cost parameter (you 
can do this by selecting Manufacturer and then the Move Parameter Up button). Select 
the Break option in the Cost row. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 18.30
Adding parameters  
to a label
	
5.	 Save the family as MfrCost.rfa and then click the Load Into Project button in the ribbon. 
If you have multiple project files open, select the c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt 
project file when prompted.

Adding Dimensions |  769  
	
6.	 Back in the project file, switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon, locate the Tag panel, and 
then click the Multi-Category button. Click one of the chairs in the space named LOUNGE. 
When the tag is placed, you will see a question mark, indicating that this element has no 
predefined value for either Manufacturer or Cost. Press the Esc key twice or click Modify 
to exit the Tag command, select the tag you just placed, and then click the question mark.
	
7.	 The Change Parameter Values dialog box (Figure 18.31) opens. This dialog box is used 
only when a tag has multiple parameters assigned to a single label. Otherwise, you would 
usually be able to type a value directly into a tag. Enter values for both Manufacturer and 
Cost, and then click OK. You’ll get a dialog box stating that you’re changing a type param-
eter that could affect many other elements. Click Yes and then OK to accept that change.
Figure 18.31
Changing the param-
eter values
	
8.	 As you hover your mouse over other elements in this view, you’ll notice the same behav-
ior as with other tags. Elements that have predefined values will show the tag filled in 
while elements without values will have question marks. Add a few more tags, and you 
can begin to see some of the versatility of the Multi-Category tag.
Adding Dimensions
Dimensions are used to convey the distance or angle between elements or parts of elements. 
In Revit, a dimension is a bidirectional annotation, which means that you can edit the distance 
directly within the dimension string to move elements a specific distance apart and the dimen-
sion updates automatically as the distance between elements changes. Dimensions are annota-
tions, making them view-specific elements that appear only in the view in which they’re drawn. 
The Dimension tools are located on the Annotate tab.
Like all annotations in Revit, dimensions will automatically adjust to the scale of the view. 
If you change the view scale, the dimensions automatically resize. By default, a Linear string of 
dimensions only dimensions parallel entities. Nonparallel elements by their very nature have a

dynamic dimensional relationship. Dimensions in Revit Architecture always read from the bot-
tom or from the right, following standard architectural sheet layout conventions.
To place a dimension, choose any Dimension tool and begin selecting multiple entities. 
You can keep selecting multiple entities in any sequence, creating a dimension string across 
your view. Click anywhere in an open area of the view to finish selecting entities and place the 
dimension string.
When any Dimension tool is active, you will see two settings available in the Options bar 
that are specifically related to walls. The first drop-down list allows you to specify the default 
method for dimensioning wall geometry. You can choose from wall centerlines, wall faces, 
center of core, or faces of core. This setting merely establishes the defaults—what will be 
selected when you first click a wall with the Dimension tool. If you need to select a different 
part of a wall, hover the mouse cursor over a wall segment and then press the Tab key to cycle 
through the available options. Each part of the wall segment geometry will highlight at the 
mouse pointer as you continue to repeatedly press the Tab key.
The second option allows you to pick either individual references (default) or entire 
walls. When the Entire Walls option is selected, click the Options button to modify the Auto 
Dimension settings, shown in Figure 18.32. In this example, we have chosen to dimension 
opening widths as well as intersecting walls. The dimension string shown was placed with a 
single click on the exterior wall!
Figure 18.32
Changing the Auto 
Dimension option
Once a dimension string is placed, you have several options to customize the string, the 
dimension values, and the witness lines (the linework that makes up the dimension). In Figure 
18.33, you can see a typical aligned dimension string that has been selected after placement. 
Let’s take a look at each of the available controls:

Adding Dimensions |  771  
Dimension Value Grip    To adjust the position of any of the dimension values, especially 
for shorter dimension strings where the value might overlap the witness lines, click and drag 
the dimension value grip to relocate the text. The leader settings associated with dimension 
values are found in the dimension type properties. If you need to reset the position of the 
dimension value, right-click the dimension string and select Reset Dimension Text Position 
from the context menu.
Extension Line Grip    The predefined distance that separates the dimensioned object from 
the beginning of the extension line is specified in the dimension type properties as Witness 
Line Gap To Element; however, you may need to manually adjust the extension line in some 
circumstances. Click and drag the extension line grip, and you will also notice that the grip 
will snap into place near the predefined distance if you need to return the extension line to 
its original gap distance.
Witness Line Grip    The grip on each extension line that is closer to the dimension string is 
the witness line grip. This control allows you to move the witness line to a different entity. 
Click and drag this control to another object in the project and the dimension string will 
automatically update.
Dimension Value Constraint    The lock symbol allows you to preserve a dimension value 
so that it cannot be changed unless the constraint is removed. This functionality can be 
used to preserve dimension values for minimum widths of corridors, floor-to-floor heights, 
and other special features of your designs. As powerful as this feature is, you should 
use it only when absolutely necessary, because an overly constrained model can create 
problems you may have difficulty unraveling. Remember, with great power comes great 
responsibility.
Dimension Equality Toggle    Another powerful control included with dimensions is the 
ability to set all the values of a selected dimension string to be equal. And because the 
dimension is a bidirectional annotation, the model elements associated with the dimensions 
will be spaced equally as well.

Using Dimension Equality
When you choose to use the dimension equality toggle, there are a few unique options to 
customize how the values are displayed. In the type properties of a dimension style, you can 
specify the default text displayed as well as a formula and how the witness lines are displayed 
(Figure 18.34).
Figure 18.34

dimension style type 
properties
When you click the Equality Formula button, you can specify a customized string of values 
to best express the intention of the equality and, new to Revit 2017, how those values will be 
shown on the dimension string. In the example shown in Figure 18.35, the parameters Number 
Of Segments, Length Of Segment, and Total Length are selected with suffix symbols to display 
the complete result in the dimension string, as shown at the bottom of the figure.

Customizing Dimension Text
One of the main benefits of dimensions in Revit Architecture is that they cannot be overridden 
to display a different length or angle other than what is actually being measured. This may 
come as a shock if you have used Autodesk® AutoCAD® software in your past experience, but 
this restriction is necessary to maintain the integrity of the building information model.

Adding Dimensions |  773  
Even though you cannot override the value of the dimension, you have the ability to 
either append some text to a dimension value or override the length or angle with a text 
string. To access these settings, double-click any dimension string to open the Dimension 
Text dialog box. In the example shown in Figure 18.36, the text HOLD has been added to 
appear below the dimension string, indicating that the dimension is to be maintained during 
construction.
Figure 18.36
Custom text appended 
to a dimension value
You’ll notice the option Replace With Text at the top of the Dimension Text dialog box. You 
might think you can override the dimension value with a string representing another length or 
angle value, but a warning will prevent you from entering any numeric values.
The Replace With Text option can be used to indicate various conditions for the purpose of 
construction tolerances. For example, you may have a series of similar conditions where new 
construction abuts existing conditions and you simply want the dimension to display VARIES, 
as shown in Figure 18.37.

Using Dimensions to Modify Geometry
We have trained hundreds of new Revit Architecture users through the years, and one of the most 
misunderstood concepts is how to use dimensions to modify model geometry. We just discussed 
the method for customizing dimension text, but users often will use this same method to make 
a change to model elements. This results in frustration when all you get is the Dimension Text 
dialog box.
To develop a clearer understanding of this concept, remember that a simple dimension string is a 
measurement between two objects. If you select the dimension, the software does not know which 
object you are intending to move. Instead, pick the model element first and then select an associ-
ated dimension to change its value, and the element will be moved.

Adding Dimensions |  775  
Editing Dimension Strings
As you continue to annotate your project with dimensions, you will likely need to edit dimension 
strings to combine, split, or add new witness lines. Most of these editing functions can be done 
with the Edit Witness Lines command. You will find this command in the contextual ribbon 
when you select a dimension string in a view.
Let’s walk through each of these dimension-editing scenarios with some exercises. 
Download and open the file c18-Dimensions-Start.rvt or c18-Dimensions-Metric-Start
.rvt from this book’s web page, and then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Activate the Level 1 floor plan and zoom in to the lower-left portion of the layout. You 
will see that some dimensions have already been placed and you will need to edit them 
(Figure 18.38).
Figure 18.38
Sample project with 
dimension strings
	
2.	 Select the lower dimension string (indicated as A in the view) and then click the Edit 
Witness Lines command in the contextual ribbon.
	
3.	 Click the next vertical wall segment to the right of the layout and then the corner point. 
You might need to press the Tab key to place the dimension on the outer face of the wall 
and to snap to the angled corner.
	
4.	 To complete this editing command, click an open area of the view. Do not press the Esc 
key or you will lose the edits you just made.
The results should look like Figure 18.39.
Figure 18.39

to a dimension string

776  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
	
5.	 Now select the upper dimension string labeled as B in the view and once again activate 
the Edit Witness Lines command.
	
6.	 Click each of the intersecting interior partitions to remove them from the dimension 
string. Click an open area of the view to complete the command, and the results should 
look like Figure 18.40.
Figure 18.40
Removing witness 
lines from a dimension 
string
You can also delete any inner segment of a dimension string if you hover your mouse pointer 
over one segment in a dimension string and press the Tab key once. An individual segment will 
highlight; select this segment and then press the Delete key. Try this with the outer dimension 
segment from the previous exercise (Figure 18.41).
Figure 18.41
Delete an inner dimen-
sion string segment.
Using Alternate Units
Alternate Units allow you to show mixed Imperial and metric units within a single annotation. You 
can do this either to the right of the base dimension or below it. Just select one of the dimension 
strings and open its type properties. The Alternate Units settings are highlighted in Figure 18.42. 
Set Alternate Units to Below to show the alternate units below the dimension string.

Adding Dimensions |  777  
Let’s explore how to use this tool:
	
1.	 Continuing from the previous exercise, select the dimension string B and click the Edit 
Type button in the Properties palette. You don’t want all the dimensions to show both 
sets of units, so click the Duplicate button and name the new dimension string Linear – 
3/32” Arial I/M (Linear - 2.5mm M/I for the metric file).
	
2.	 In the same Type Properties dialog box, change Alternate Units to Below. Set the 
Alternate Units Format to Millimeters in the Imperial file (Feet And Fractional Inches 
in the metric file). So that you know the other number is a measurement in an alternate 
unit, in Alternate Units Suffix add mm in the Imperial file. The settings will look like 
Figure 18.43.
	
3.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.

Annotating with Project and Shared Parameters
Every element in a project has a list of parameters. Some of these parameters, such as Assembly 
Code and Mark, are common parameters that are assigned to almost all object types. Others, 
such as Length, Height, and Volume, are unique to specific element types. Despite the plethora 
of default parameters, there are situations where you may need to add custom parameters to 
elements. These custom parameters, like the default ones, can be tagged and scheduled.
Depending on how you’d like to use a custom parameter, you can add them to your elements 
in a few ways:
◆
◆
If all you want to do is schedule the new parameter, you have a couple of options:
◆
◆
Add the parameter directly within the schedule itself. This will add a new parameter to 
your element family. Adding a parameter using this method adds it only to the element 
family in the schedule. For example, say you want to schedule the sound transmission 
class (STC) of a wall. You could add this property directly within the wall schedule and 
the new parameter would be available only to objects in the Walls category.
◆
◆
Add the parameter to the project. Using this method, you can still schedule the new 
parameter, but you will have the option to add it to multiple categories. So, if you 
want to add a parameter for Unit Cost, you can add that to both your door and win-
dow categories at the same time.
◆
◆
If you want to be able to both schedule and tag your parameter, you will need to create a 
shared parameter. This parameter is created as part of a separate file that is shared among 
the tag family, the element family, and the project. An example of this kind of tag might be 
for door security hardware. You can create a parameter that is assigned to a door family as 
well as a door tag that will allow you to designate whether or not a door has a card reader 
to gain entrance to a room.
In the following sections, we will discuss how to create both of these parameter types as well 
as the pros and cons of each.
Creating Project Parameters
You can create custom project parameters at any time in the project cycle. Depending on how 
you create the parameters, you can assign them to one or more element categories within the 
model. You can also assign them to elements that have already been created or to element 
categories for elements that you have yet to create.
The following steps will allow you to make a custom parameter that can be scheduled but 
not tagged. For this example, pretend you are working on an existing building and reworking 
a space. Much of what is onsite will need to be demolished, but you would like to reuse all 

Annotating with Project and Shared Parameters |  779  
the elements that are salvageable. As you are documenting the existing conditions, you want 
to schedule the elements you want to keep. To do this, you’ll make a parameter called Reuse. 
Continue with the project file from the previous exercise (c18-Dimensions-Start.rvt or 
c18-Dimensions-Metric-Start.rvt).
To add a new project parameter, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Go to the Manage tab in the ribbon and click the Project Parameters button.
This will display the Project Parameters dialog box (Figure 18.45).
Figure 18.45
The Project Parameters 
dialog box
	
2.	 Click the Add button to open the Parameter Properties dialog box. Here you will be 
asked to define a list of properties for the new parameter.
Let’s step through what these selections will be (Figure 18.46 shows a view of the com-
pleted dialog box).
Figure 18.46

properties (shown 
with Hide Un-checked 
Categories selected)

780  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
	
3.	 Set Parameter Type to Project Parameter.
Choosing between project and shared parameter is the first choice you’ll need to make. 
We’ll get to shared parameters later, so for now, leave it at the default of Project Parameter.
	
4.	 For Name, type Reuse. The name is used for describing the parameter as well as referencing 
it in schedules and the Properties palette.
	
5.	 Leave the Discipline setting at Common.
The Discipline drop-down menu will give you a few choices: Common, Structural, 
Electrical, HVAC, Piping, and Energy.
	
6.	 Set Type Of Parameter to Yes/No.
This setting dictates the format or behavior of the parameter. As you can see in Figure 18.47, 
a variety of parameter types are available. It’s important to understand some of these options 
and, more specifically, their differences. If you start creating formulas with your parameters, 
you’ll quickly understand how important it is to use the proper type. For instance, you can-
not multiply Angle × Volume. Text cannot be added to a formula. Integers do not have deci-
mal values. Many of these values are easy to understand if you apply a bit of logic.
Figure 18.47
Listing of available 
parameter types
	
7.	 For Type Or Instance, choose Instance. This setting controls the uniqueness of the param-
eter itself. Both parameter types can be mixed within a given family. In this example, use 
an instance parameter because you want to designate whether something is reusable on 
an element-by-element basis.
See Chapter 2, “Applying the Principles of the User Interface and Project Organization,” 
for more information on type and instance parameters.
	
8.	 For Group Parameter Under, choose Green Building Properties.
This setting is an organization tool. When you open your element properties, depending 
on how many parameters you add, you can develop quite a long list. This tool allows you 
to group new parameters into any given category.

Annotating with Project and Shared Parameters |  781  
	
9.	 In the list of categories, check the boxes for Doors, Furniture, and Windows.
Categories is the list of element types in which this new property will appear. This 
is where you define all the category types you’ll associate with the new parameter. 
Category selections are flexible. If you decide you need to change categories after you 
create your parameter, you can easily come back to the Project Parameters tool and 
modify your selection.
	
10.	 When you finish, click OK. This will take you back to the Project Parameters dialog box, 
where you can choose to add another parameter or, in our case, just click OK to exit 
completely.
Back in the model, you can now select a door (because it is one of the categories you chose) 
and see that you have added a Reuse parameter in the form of a check box to the bottom of the 
Properties list (Figure 18.48).
Figure 18.48
The Reuse parameter  
in the family
Now that you’ve created a custom parameter in the project, it’s even easier to create one while 
in a schedule. You can create a custom parameter while creating a schedule or after the fact 
by modifying one. To create a parameter in a schedule, click the New Parameter button in the 
Schedule Properties dialog box (Figure 18.49). Doing so opens the same dialog box that you see 
when you click the Project Parameter button, with the exception that the Categories selections 
will be grayed out because you can create parameters in schedules only for the element being 
scheduled.

782  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Creating Shared Parameters
When you want to schedule and tag a custom parameter, you will need to use shared param-
eters. Previously in this chapter, you learned that customized project parameters are useful 
for scheduling the STC rating on a wall. You can also use them to schedule which doors have 
security systems as part of the door hardware set, for example, or to specify which equipment in 
a lab will require special gases (oxygen, argon, and so forth). None of these parameters exist by 
default in any families, but they are all values that you might want to tag or schedule, depend-
ing on the type of project you are working on.
These parameters do not exist in any of the tags either, so in order to tag these parameters, 
you need to create them in both the tag and the element families.
Don’t worry—it’s not as complicated as it all sounds, but you will need to follow some steps 
fairly closely. Once you have added a shared parameter to your project, you cannot modify it. If 
you want to change it, you’ll need to delete it and add the parameter again. So it behooves you to 
make your choices thoughtfully.
Let’s look at the workflow behind creating a shared parameter. You’ll do this by creating a 
custom wall parameter called STC so you can tag the sound transmission class of the wall types. 
To get started, continue using the c18-Dimensions-Start.rvt or c18-Dimensions-Metric-
Start.rvt example from the previous exercise.
Creating the Shared Parameter
The first thing you do is create a new, shared parameter file. This file translates the values of the 
shared parameter between the tag, family, and project. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 To create a shared parameter, go to the Manage tab in the ribbon and click the Shared 
Parameters tool.
Figure 18.49
Adding a parameter 
while in a schedule

Annotating with Project and Shared Parameters |  783  
Doing so opens the Edit Shared Parameters dialog box (Figure 18.50).
Figure 18.50
Creating the shared 
parameter
	
2.	 Click the Create button to open the Create Shared Parameter File dialog box. Name your 
shared parameter file. For our example, we’ve named it STC; however, if you plan to make 
more than one shared parameter, you might want to name it something more universal. 
All of the shared parameters for a given project will ultimately live in the same file. Give 
the file a name and location that will make sense to the project team. Then click Save.
	
3.	 Now that you’ve saved the TXT file, you’ll return to the Edit Shared Parameters window, 
where you’ll assign this parameter to a group by selecting New under the Groups option 
(this keeps like elements grouped together). This group is a hierarchical collection. So, for 
the wall’s STC, you will want to create a group called Wall Properties (Figure 18.51). This 
grouping allows you to easily sort different parameters within project categories. Once 
you name the group, click OK.
Figure 18.51
Creating a shared 
parameter group
	
4.	 Once you have a group, you’ll see that the Parameters buttons are now active. Click the 
New button and name the parameter STC. Leave the Discipline setting at Common. For 
Type Of Parameter, choose Integer. Because STC ratings are whole numbers, you can use 
the Integer type and eliminate any decimal places you’d have if you used Number as the 
type (Figure 18.52). Once you’ve entered the settings, click OK.

784  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
	
5.	 You should see the new STC parameter in the Edit Shared Parameters dialog box. Click 
OK to exit this dialog box.
You’ve now created a shared parameter. The next step is to assign it to a category.
Assigning the Shared Parameter to a Category
The shared parameter is now defined, but you don’t have it associated with any categories yet. 
To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click the Project Parameters button to open the 
Project Parameters dialog box. You want to add a new parameter, so click Add.
	
2.	 The Parameter Properties dialog box opens. This time, select the Shared Parameter radio 
button, and then click Select. In the Shared Parameters dialog box, select the STC param-
eter you just created, and then click OK. You’ll see that many of the fields are now grayed 
out in the Parameter Properties dialog box. This is because you have already specified 
this information in the shared parameter. In the Categories list, select Walls (Figure 18.53). 
Click OK to exit the dialog box.

and setting the type

3.	 You’ll see the new shared parameter (STC) below your previous project parameter 
(Reuse) in the Project Parameters dialog box (Figure 18.54). Click OK to close the  
dialog box.
Figure 18.54
The shared parameter is 
now part of the project.
	
4.	 Now that the STC parameter is part of the project, you can begin assigning values to it. 
Open the Level 1 floor plan and select one of the interior walls on the left side of the plan. 
By scrolling down in the Properties palette, you’ll notice that the STC parameter is now at 
the bottom (Figure 18.55). Enter a value of 45 and click Apply, or simply move your mouse 
out of the palette to set the value.

786  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
Tagging the Shared Parameter
So far, you’ve created a shared parameter and added it to the Walls category in a project. These 
are all features you could have leveraged with a project parameter. The benefit of using a shared 
parameter is being able to tag it. The final step in this process is creating a tag to display the STC 
parameter in the wall:
	
1.	 The first thing you’ll need is a new tag. Because you’re tagging a wall, and there isn’t a 
default wall tag type, you’ll need to make a generic tag and apply it to a wall condition. 
From the Application menu, select New ➢ Family. Open the Annotations folder, select 
Generic Tag.rfa, and click Open.
	
2.	 Next, you’ll assign the correct category to the tag. By default, a generic tag is just that: 
generic. You want it to report information from the Walls category, so on the Create tab, 
in the Properties area click the Family Category And Parameters button.
	
3.	 With the Family Category And Parameters dialog box open, choose Wall Tags from the 
list (Figure 18.56), and click OK. Delete the red text note in the tag family template before 
continuing.
Figure 18.56
Selecting the Wall Tags 
category
	
4.	 With the proper category selected, you need to add a label for your tag. From the Create 
tab in the ribbon, select the Label tool on the Text panel, and then click just above the 
intersection of the two reference planes in the view.

Annotating with Project and Shared Parameters |  787  
	
5.	 In the Edit Label dialog box, select Type Mark from the list of category parameters and 
add it to the Label Parameters list to the right (Figure 18.57). This will call out the wall 
type and help you associate the proper wall with the STC rating. Click OK to close the 
dialog box and zoom in closer to the label you just placed.
Figure 18.57
Adding the Type  
Mark parameter
	
6.	 With the Type Mark parameter placed, let’s add the STC parameter. Activate the Label 
tool again, and then click just below the intersection of reference planes in the view. In 
the Edit Label dialog box, click the Add Parameter button at the bottom of the Category 
Parameters list. This opens the Parameter Properties dialog box (Figure 18.58). Click 
Select to open the Shared Parameters dialog box. Select STC and click OK, and then click 
OK again.
Figure 18.58
Choosing the shared 
parameter

788  | Chapter 18  Annotating Your Design   
	
7.	 You’ll now see the STC parameter in the Category Parameters list. Select it and add it to 
the right side of the dialog box (Figure 18.59). Click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 18.59
Adding the STC 
parameter to the  
label
	
8.	 With all the labels added, you can brush up the tag with a bit of linework to help differ-
entiate the tag from the rest of the drawing. On the Create tab, choose the Line tool from 
the Detail panel. Using the default options, draw a box around the two labels and a line 
between them (Figure 18.60). Once this is done, save the family as Wall-STC.rfa and 
then load it into the project by clicking the Load Into Project button.
Figure 18.60
The customized  
wall tag
1t
STC
	
9.	 Back in the project, you’re ready to tag the wall. Once you insert the tag into the project 
file, Revit will automatically begin the tagging command. However, the other way to 
begin tagging is to choose Tag By Category from the Annotate tab. Select the wall to 
which you have already given a value of 45 for the STC. You’ll see the wall type and STC 
rating populate within the tag (Figure 18.61).
Once you’ve stepped through this workflow a few times, it will quickly become familiar and 
you’ll be able to add custom parameters to projects and tag them without a second thought. One 
thing to keep in mind while you’re doing all this, however, is that once you have added a shared 
parameter to your project, you will not be able to change any of the properties of the parameter 
itself. If you set the parameter type to Integer but you really wanted Number, you’ll need to delete 
the parameter and start over. Also, when working with a team, remember that shared parameters 
work much like keynotes with their external TXT files. If you are sharing the project file with the 
idea that it will be edited by another team, be sure to include the shared parameter file.

Shared Parameters beyond Tagging
We have just finished a section on how to create your own shared parameters and use them to 
create tags that are not a part of the default Revit categories. But, as with all parameters, your 
use of shared parameters is not limited to only tagging. In one project, for example, we were 
designing a manufacturing facility. This facility had a large amount of process equipment, 
and the various pieces of equipment had special design needs like argon and nitrogen gases, 
compressed air, or special electrical power. We wanted to tag the equipment in our drawings, 
but we also wanted an easy way to visualize which pieces of equipment needed what kinds of 
services.
To do this, we combined the shared parameter file we created for the tags and used color filters 
(discussed in Chapter 10, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options”) to color the equip-
ment in plan and help the design teams make sure we were supplying the right services to the 
right elements.

The Bottom Line
Annotate with text and keynotes.    Although a picture is worth a thousand words, you 
will still need notes to make drawings understandable and be able to call out key elements 
in each view. Know how to create and modify text and keynotes for a complete set of 
documents.
Master It    To properly use the keynoting feature, you’ll need to understand what each of 
the three keynote types do and how they’re used. List each and explain how they can be 
used in a project.
Use tags.    Tags are text labels for elements such as doors, walls, windows, rooms, and sev-
eral other objects that architects typically need to reference in a set of drawings. These tags 
typically refer back to other schedules or information in other portions of the drawing set 
and are unique to the view in which they are inserted.
Master It    Inserting tags quickly can be a good way to make documentation time more 
efficient. How can you quickly tag a number of elements in the model at the same time?
Add dimensions.    Dimensioning is a critical part of the project documentation, allowing 
you to communicate the distance elements are from one another.
Master It    Adding dimensions is a necessary part in any project. However, in a project 
workflow you will typically want to change the location of a dimension’s witness line 
without having to re-create the entire dimension. How do you move a witness line 
without remaking the entire dimension?
Set project and shared parameters.    Revit Architecture lets users add as many custom 
parameters to an element as are needed to document the project. These parameters can be 
both tagged and scheduled, depending on how they are made.
Master It    You need to add a custom parameter for your project to track the percentage 
of recycled content in materials. What’s the best way to go about doing this?

 In the previous chapters, we focused on the architect’s role in design and construction using 
Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software. As the software continues to expand beyond being a tool 
for design documentation, we want to touch on several other uses outside the traditional scope of 
the designer. In the chapters in Part 6, we discuss how Revit can be used to augment design and 
documentation after construction documents are complete.

 ◆ Chapter  21 : Computational Design with Dynamo 


 Chapter  19 
 Working in the Construction phase   
 In this chapter, we will explore the use of Autodesk® Revit® Architecture software in 
the construction phase by design teams and builders. For design teams, the use of Revit 
Architecture usually entails markups, sketches, and revision management; however, a 
builder may approach building information modeling (BIM) tools in unique ways. Many 
different BIM programs are available for builders to use in preconstruction and construc-
tion phase tasks, so we will not assume that Revit is the primary tool used by the majority 
of them. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Add revisions to your project 
 
◆
 Use digital markups

 Model for construction 
 Using revisions in Your project 
 Revisions allow designers and builders to track changes made to a set of construction docu-
ments during the construction phase of a project. Because the construction documents 
usually consist of numerous sheets, this methodology allows everyone on the team to track 
and identify which changes were made and when they were made during construction. The 
purpose is not only to ensure correct construction but also to create  as-built documentation 
recording how the building was actually created to be delivered to building owners upon 
occupancy. 
 In a typical drawing set, revisions will look like Figure  19.1 when they are created and issued 
as part of the drawing set. Revision clouds themselves are created within views that are placed 
on the sheets. The revision tag is also placed within the view, but once the view is then placed 
on a sheet, the revision will dynamically appear in the sheet properties and on any revision 
schedule on the sheet itself. 
 Creating a revision Cloud 
 To create a revision cloud in your project, switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon, locate the 
Detail panel, and then choose Revision Cloud. This places you in a revision cloud drawing 
mode, similar to Sketch mode, and allows you to bubble the revised detail or drawing. When 
you fi nish, click the green check mark to complete the sketch and your annotation is done. We’ll 
step through this in more detail later in this chapter.

794  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
You will usually have several rounds of revisions to a document set. Revit provides a way to 
manage the revision list and gives you the ability to name and date the various revisions in your 
project to better track them. The Sheet Issues/Revisions tool is located in two places within the 
application. You can find it on either the View tab in the Sheet Composition panel or the Manage 
tab under Additional Settings.
Either one of these buttons will open the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box (Figure 19.2). 
Here you can add, merge, issue, and define the visibility of revisions.
Before you begin creating revisions in your sheet set, it’s good to start with this dialog box 
to give those revisions some order. Let’s review the major components of the Sheet Issues/
Revisions dialog box, beginning with the table of revisions:
Table of Revisions    The Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box starts with one default revi-
sion already in place, even though you may not have made a revision yet. This is only to 
give you a place to start—no revision will appear in your title blocks until you add revision 
clouds to your views. Each revision has a fixed number of parameters that you can enter. 
As you can see in Figure 19.2, the parameters include Numbering, Date, Description, and 
an Issued check box in addition to Issued To and Issued By columns and options for show-
ing clouds and tags.
Figure 19.1
Typical revisions

Using Revisions in Your Project |  795  
Numbering (Table Column)    The Numbering option allows you to number each revi-
sion numerically, alphabetically, or not at all. If you choose an alphabetic sequence, the 
sequence is defined in the Customize Numbering Options. In the Numbering Options 
box in the lower right, choose either Numeric or Alphanumeric to set your sequence and 
remove letters you don’t want to use. For instance, some firms don’t use the letters I and 
O because they are often confused with the numbers 1 and 0, respectively. Figure 19.3 
shows a sample of the dialog box. By default, an entire alphabet appears here. The None 
option allows you to add project milestones—unnumbered entries that appear in revision 
tables—to sheets without having to add revision clouds.

Revisions dialog box
Figure 19.3
Customize Numbering 
Options allows you to 
use any order of letters 
or numbers.

796  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
Date and Description    Both of these fields are user-driven only. The date is not tied 
to any functionality within Revit, nor is the description—both are simple text fields. 
However, both fields will schedule as part of your revision table on your sheets and are 
useful in organizing and tracking your revisions.
Issued    To issue a revision, click the check box in the Issued column. Doing so locks 
the revision clouds and tags placed on sheets or in views associated with that revision, 
preventing them from being moved, deleted, or otherwise edited. The parameter values 
in the dialog box become inactive. This is to guarantee that the clouds and data do not 
change downstream once you issue a set of drawings.
Revisions in a Live Model
During the construction process, the project model may still be changing. When you issue a revi-
sion, keep this in mind: Although the clouds can become fixed in the project, the model will not 
be static. As you continue to make revisions to the model, it will always be up to date. This means 
that you might have multiple revisions in the same location on your sheet set. So if you need to 
maintain an archive of all project phases or each revision, be sure to export the sheets as either 
DWF or PDF files as a snapshot of the sheets at time of issue.
Issued To/Issued By    You may enter notes to the project team in these fields for whom 
the revisions are to be issued and who issued them.
Show    This table column controls the visibility of revision clouds and revision tags 
that have been issued. As issues occur, you may want to hide just the clouds or just the 
tags from previous revisions. For example, if you’ve issued one revision and then add 
­revisions to a later issue and want to clean up your drawing, you can choose to show 
the issued revision as the tag only—typically a small triangle with the revision number 
­inside it—or not show anything at all by using the None option.
Add Button    This function is used to create a new revision. The new revision will auto-
matically be placed in sequential order and only the sequence number will be automatically 
updated. You’ll need to add your own description and date.
Numbering (Radio Buttons)    You can choose to number revisions by sheet or by project. 
This is a global setting for the whole project, but one can be swapped for the other at any 
point. Which method you choose mainly depends on how your firm chooses to track revi-
sions. The Per Sheet setting allows you to have as many revisions as you want within the 
drawing set, but on each sheet, the list of revisions will remain sequential. For example, an 
issue named “Issued for Design Development” may be revision number 4 on one sheet and 
number 7 on another. Using the Per Project setting will order your revision clouds based 
on the sequence established in the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box. In other words, all 
revisions with the same issue date would have the same revision number regardless of how 
many revisions appear on any given sheet. This approach might give you a greater degree of 
consistency throughout your document set but may limit the number of overall revisions you 
can use in the project. Either numbering method can be configured in advance and added to 
your project template.

Using Revisions in Your Project |  797  
Placing Revision Clouds
If you want to place a revision, open a view in which changes to the project have occurred and 
use the Revision Cloud tool found in the Detail panel on the Annotate tab. Use the familiar 
sketching tools from the Draw panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon to generate a cloud 
around the area you are calling out as a revision. The tool automatically starts with the Box 
command, allowing you to draw a box around your revision. If you’d like something more fluid, 
you can switch to the Line tool on the Draw panel. Lines are automatically created that make a 
cloud (or series of arcs), as shown in Figure 19.4. The size of the arcs will be determined by the 
Arc Length setting found in the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box we described in the previ-
ous section. When you finish creating the cloud, click the Finish Sketch button (the green check 
mark) in the contextual tab of the ribbon. Note that the Revision cloud tool doesn’t require you 
to form a closed loop—you can finish the sketch at any point.
Figure 19.4
Adding a revision 
cloud to a view
By default, each new revision cloud will be assigned to the last revision in the Sheet Issues/
Revisions dialog box. If you need to change the revision to which a cloud is assigned, select the 
cloud and use the Properties palette to modify its revision number (Figure 19.5).
Figure 19.5
The revision cloud’s 
issue assignment can 
be changed in the 
Properties palette.

798  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
As soon as you have placed a revision cloud on a sheet, any revision schedules placed in your 
title block will update to include the revision number, description, and the date you assigned in 
the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box earlier (Figure 19.6).
Revision Clouds in a Live Model
During the construction process, the project model may still be changing. As you create revisions, 
you might need to create more than one within the same view or sheet. Where you place the revi-
sion cloud can be as important as the revision itself. For instance, do you place it within the view 
or on the sheet? As a best practice, we suggest you place the revision in the location where the 
content is changing. So, if you’re modifying a flashing detail, place the revision bubble in the view. 
If you’re changing the name of the detail on the sheet, place it on the sheet itself. This will help you 
downstream, when you make another change to that same view or element.

Description
Date
Like other objects, the graphics for revision clouds are controlled from the Object Styles dia-
log box, found in the Settings panel on the Manage tab. Settings for revisions are located on the 
Annotation Objects tab. The default setting for the line thickness is 1. We recommend that you 
increase the default thickness for revisions in your project template to more clearly illustrate and 
communicate your design modifications.
Tagging a Revision Cloud
Revision clouds can be tagged like many other elements. Similar to other tags, revision tags 
are intelligent and designed to report the revision number or letter that has been assigned to 
the revision cloud. To place a revision tag, use the Tag By Category tool in the Tag panel on the 
Annotate tab.
If a tag for revisions is not in your template, you will be warned that no such tag exists 
in your project. To continue, simply load a revision tag. The default tag is named Revision 
Tag.rfa and is located in the Annotations folder of the family library within a standard 
installation.
Once you have a tag loaded, you are ready to tag revision clouds. Hover the cursor over a 
revision cloud and click to place the tag. You will see a preview of the tag prior to placing it 
(Figure 19.7). Once the tag is placed, you can drag it around the cloud to reposition it and turn 
the leader on and off. With or without a leader, the revision tag will stay associated with the 
cloud.

Using Digital Markups |  799  
Disabling the Leader
You can choose to use a leader line between the tag and the cloud, depending on your prefer-
ence or your office standards. In many cases, the tag just needs to be near the cloud and a leader 
is not necessary. Disable the leader by selecting the tag and clearing the Leader option in the 
Options bar. It’s good to note here that if your firm’s standards are to hide the cloud and you 
have the leader activated, you’ll see the revision tag plus the leader but no cloud since the leader 
and tag are connected.
Figure 19.7
Tagging a revision 
cloud
BIM and Supplemental Drawings
The process of making supplemental drawings (SDs)—also known as supplemental sketches (SKs)—
entails making a change to an existing drawing and then issuing that change as a separate document 
during the construction process. Sometimes this can be a single 8 1/2″ × 11″ [A4] or 11″ × 17″ [A3] 
sheet where the new detail is then pasted over the old one in the document set. From a workflow 
perspective, this can be a little disruptive for two reasons:
◆
◆
Placing a view into a smaller sheet to issue the individual view can lead to other problems. 
Because there is only one instance of the view, it requires you to take the view off your 
Construction Document sheet to place the view in a new sheet. The problem is that the new 
sheet/detail is meant to replace a portion of your original document set, so your set is now 
out of sequence. You will need to remove the view from the sheet it was issued on temporarily 
(and remember to put it back) or duplicate the view and hope that you do not need to make 
last-minute additional changes.
◆
◆
A supplemental drawing, once issued, is like a snapshot in time. It becomes a numbered change 
made to the drawing set at a given date. Because the model and all the views in the model always 
reflect the most current state of the project, making separate SD sheets and views within Revit 
will show any additional changes made to that view.
◆
◆
As an alternative, you can reissue the full sheet. This is easiest for a Revit workflow, but it 
depends on your firm’s standards for supplemental drawings.
Using Digital Markups
Both Autodesk® A360 (www.autodesk360.com) and Autodesk® Design Review offer an efficient 
way to view and mark up 2D digital documents and 3D models. This workflow is different from 
revisions and is geared more toward informal design review rather than the management of 
sheet issues. For example, if your drawings must be reviewed for quality control and overall 
comments by a senior designer who might not be familiar with Revit software, this tool can 
streamline the process. The senior designer, consultant, or any other third party can make com-
ments and review changes directly in the digital file and return them to the Revit Architecture 
user who needs to modify the original model.

800  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
In this section, we’re going to focus on the use of Design Review for DWF markups. Both 
applications are capable of this workflow. Think of the A360 tool as an online version of the 
DWF markup tool. It additionally has many powerful collaboration tools to help the overall proj-
ect process—markups are only a portion of what the tool does. Feel free to explore A360 to see 
the full effect it can have on team collaboration.
Using Design Review, you can view files in DWFx or DWF format. If you export sheets to DWFx 
and the markups are linked back into Revit, the markups will be automatically placed on the corre-
sponding sheet. So there is no need on your part for any sort of alignment or placement of the revisions.
Design Review is a free tool that you can download from the Autodesk website: http://usa
.autodesk.com/design-review. Once it’s installed, you can open and mark up any DWFx or 
DWF file produced by any Autodesk or other CAD/BIM software package.
Publishing to Design Review
There are two ways to share your model using Design Review: as 2D drawings or as a 3D model. 
If you publish to 3D, you create a single 3D representation of your model that can be orbited, 
control visibility of element categories, and be queried for the properties of any of the elements. 
Publishing to 2D can create either a single view or a whole collection of interconnected views and 
sheets packaged as one file. You can even combine 2D views and a 3D model in one DWFx file.
Exporting DWFx Files
You can export to DWFx from any view, except a schedule. To export your views or sheets, select 
the Application menu and choose Export ➢ DWF/DWFx. The DWF Export Settings dialog box 
(Figure 19.8) will open. Here you can choose views/sheets to export in addition to specifying 
how the results will be published.
Figure 19.8
The DWF Export 
Settings dialog box

Using Digital Markups |  801  
In the following exercise, you will open a Revit file and create a DWFx file for review:
	
1.	 Open the c19-Sample-Building-Start.rvt model, which can be downloaded from this 
book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017.
	
2.	 Open Sheet A101 from the sheet list in the Project Browser. Click the Application menu 
and select Export ➢ DWF/DWFx to open the dialog box shown in Figure 19.8.
	
3.	 Click the New Set icon at the top of the list of views and name the set MASTERING 
SHEETS.
Once you create the set, you will see a new drop-down list appear in the dialog box; you 
can use it to control which views are displayed in the view list (Figure 19.9).
Figure 19.9
The Show In List 
drop-down is 
available only 
with a view set.
	
4.	 From the Show In List drop-down, select Sheets In The Model, and then select sheets 
A101 and A102.
These sheets will be added to the set to be published.
You can sort the list of views by any of the columns by clicking a column header. Try this 
by clicking the Name header.
	
5.	 To check the export size, select the DWF Properties tab and click the Print Setup button. 
In the resulting dialog box, you can set explicit sizes for your export. Click the option Use 
Sheet Size to automatically detect sheet sizes based on the title blocks you are using in the 
project.
This dialog box mirrors the one used for printing.
	
6.	 Click Next and specify the name of the file and a location in which to save it. Make sure 
you check the box to combine all sheets into a single DWFx file (see Figure 19.10).
Figure 19.10

publishing.

802  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
	
7.	 Open the published DWFx file in Autodesk Design Review. Choose the Markup & 
Measure tab, and then add a few comments and markups on the A101 sheet.
Using the Shapes and Draw tools on this tab, you can add clouds, arrows, and text to insert 
your comments or changes into the drawings. This can be done in a variety of colors and line 
weights to give them extra visibility on the page. Once all your changes are created, save the file 
and it will retain all your changes. Figure 19.11 shows an example of a markup.
Figure 19.11
A marked-up DWFx file
Importing a Design Review Markup
Once you’ve added markups to the DWFx file, save the file and close Design Review. You can 
then link the marked-up DWFx file back into the RVT project file. Continue to use the sample 
file from the previous exercise. You can also download the file c19-Sample-MarkedUp.dwfx 
from this book’s web page. This file already contains some markups to use in the following 
exercise. Perform these steps to import the marked-up file into the project file:
	
1.	 On the Insert tab, choose DWF Markup from the Link panel and then select the DWFx file 
you saved in the previous exercise.
This is a simple import dialog box. There are no settings in the window.
When you select a DWFx file, only the markups will be shown—not the entire DWFx file. 
If there are no markups in the file, nothing will be visible in Revit.
	
2.	 In the next dialog box (Figure 19.12), you will see the views in the DWFx file that contain 
markups and the sheets in the Revit project to which they will coordinate. You can insert 
all the markups or only specific sheets. Select the sheets you’d like to import; be sure to 
select A101, and then click OK.
	
3.	 Open sheet A101 from the Project Browser, and you will see the markup as an overlay in 
the same location where it was created in Design Review (Figure 19.13).

Using Digital Markups |  803  
Figure 19.12
Sheets with associated 
markups are shown.
Figure 19.13
The marked-up sheet 
linked into Revit
Markups can be linked only to sheets. If you export a view and mark it up, you will not 
be able to link that view back into the model. Also, none of the other linework from the 
DWF will link into the model—any of the building geometry, backgrounds, sheet content, 
and so on. The only thing that will be visible in Revit is content created with the DWF 
Markup tool.
You cannot move or delete linked DWF markups—they appear with a pin if selected; 
however, you can do a number of things to graphically indicate that you’ve reviewed a 
markup:
Change its graphic appearance.    Let’s say you have 20 redline markups on your sheet. You 
need to keep track of which ones you’ve picked up. One way to do this is to graphically over-
ride each markup as you make the requested modifications. Select the markup, right-click, 
choose View ➢ By Element, and click Override Graphics. Choose a color to indicate “done.” 
Yellow works well because it suggests a highlight marker.

804  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
Hide it.    This approach is similar to the graphic override, but you hide the markup alto-
gether. Select the markup, right-click, and choose Hide In View ➢ Element.
Remove it.    You can remove markups by choosing Manage Links from the Manage tab. In 
the Manage Links dialog box, select the DWF Markups tab, select the markup, and click the 
Remove button. This removes all markups associated with the link.
Another way you can interact with a linked DWF file is by modifying the status or append-
ing comments to each markup. You can access these features in the Properties palette when you 
select a markup, as follows:
	
1.	 In the A101 sheet view, select one of the markups you created and go to the Properties 
palette.
	
2.	 Change the Status drop-down list to Done and then click the Edit button in the Notes 
field. In the Edit Text dialog box, enter some text related to the completion of the design 
modification requested in the markup (Figure 19.14).
Figure 19.14
Modifying the 
properties of the 
markup
	
3.	 Click the Apply button at the bottom of the Properties palette or move the mouse pointer 
out of the Properties palette.
	
4.	 Switch to the Insert tab in the ribbon, and from the Link panel choose Manage Links. 
Select the DWF Markups tab.
	
5.	 Select the row containing the DWFx file you linked in the previous steps, and then click 
the Save Markups button at the bottom left of the dialog box.
There is no alert or notification that the save process has completed, so just wait a few 
seconds.
	
6.	 Click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.

Modeling for Construction |  805  
	
7.	 Open the DWFx file again in Design Review, and you will see that the status of the mark-
ups has been updated.
The comments you added can be seen in the Markup Properties palette (Figure 19.15).
Figure 19.15
Modifying the 
properties of the 
markup
Using the DWFx file format along with the integrated tools within Revit, you have closed a 
communication and coordination loop that has traditionally been an area of difficulty. This 
workflow also benefits larger project teams because you don’t have to manage a central pile of 
drawing markups that need to be shared or distributed among several teammates. All the staff 
working on a project will have access to the same linked DWF markups.
Modeling for Construction
Now that we have reviewed some basic functionality a design team might use during the con-
struction phase, let’s take a look at how a builder (contractor, subcontractor, or construction 
manager) might use Revit in the industry today.
Revit is often referred to as a design application; however, contractors are using the software 
more frequently as both a model-authoring and project-analysis tool. Although builders use 
BIM tools to obtain different results than design professionals do, many of the processes and 
functions are the same; they are merely applied in particular ways according to the needs of the 
various users.
Functionality introduced back in Revit Architecture 2012 supports a more interactive and 
flexible approach to construction modeling. The first addition was the ability to create parts, 
which are individual subsets of more complex layered elements such as walls and floors. The 
other addition allowed you to generate assemblies, which are segregated subsets of the project 
model with their own associated views, annotations, and sheets. These tools are used to take 

806  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
large elements and break them down into smaller components as they’d be used on the job site. 
As an example, in an architectural model, a cast-in-place concrete floor would be a single ele-
ment for the entire floor plate. In practice, the contractor would never pour the floor that way. 
The concrete would be poured in a series of pads, and the contractor would have to divide 
the slab into those series of pours for his or her schedule. The potential to minimize data loss 
between the design and construction stakeholders of a project can start to change how we 
approach collaboration and delivery of our buildings.
Creating Parts
Parts are designed to aid the user in subdividing larger model elements into smaller compo-
nents for construction planning. Each part maintains a persistent relationship with the elements 
from which it was derived, and it can be subdivided into smaller parts if necessary. Parts can be 
generated from walls, floors, ceilings, and roofs, as long as they are of consistent thickness. They 
also have their own properties, such as volume, area, and height; as such, they can be scheduled 
independently of their original elements.
While it is likely that designers will use parts to customize architectural elements, we are 
going to discuss only the workflow intended for the builder. To get started with the basic work-
flow for creating and dividing parts, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the file c19-Parts-Start.rvt or c19-Parts-Metric-Start.rvt, which you can 
download from this book’s web page.
	
2.	 Activate the Default 3D view if it isn’t already open.
Notice that each of the wall, floor, ceiling, and roof elements in this sample model is com-
posed of one object. A section box has been activated in this view that is exposing the 
layers within each element (Figure 19.16).
Figure 19.16
The beginning Parts 
model

Modeling for Construction |  807  
	
3.	 Select the floor at Level 2. On the Create panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, click 
the Create Parts button.
Notice that the original object has been visually replaced in the current view by the parts 
representing each layer of the floor assembly. It is still in the project model—it has not 
been deleted.
There is a new view property in the Properties palette named Parts Visibility whose 
default value is Show Parts. This means that if parts have been created for any object,  
they will be displayed instead of the original. This property can also be set to Show 
Original or Show Both.
	
4.	 In the Project Browser, right-click the Default 3D view and choose Duplicate View and 
then Duplicate. Rename the copy of the view Original Model.
	
5.	 Activate the view named Original Model. From the Properties palette, find the Parts 
Visibility parameter and change it to Show Original.
	
6.	 In the Project Browser, rename the {3D} view to Parts Model.
	
7.	 Activate the Parts Model view, and repeat the process of creating parts for the wall, the 
ceilings, and the roof in the sample model. Simply select each of these elements and 
choose the Parts tool from the context menu as before.
In the previous exercise, you created an alternative way to view your model that begins to 
explore constructability. Without additional modification, you can start to interact with these 
individual components by examining their properties or even hiding them or overriding their 
graphic display.
Modifying Parts
In addition to creating parts from original model elements, you can divide these parts into 
smaller ones. You can even change the phasing properties at the part level and use grips to 
modify the extents of the parts. Let’s begin with an exercise to divide some parts using planes 
and sketched lines:
	
1.	 Go back to the Parts Model view and select the top part of the roof at the Roof level.
This will be the layer representing insulation.
	
2.	 From the Part panel in the contextual ribbon, click Divide Parts.
You will enter Sketch mode, where you can either select intersecting datum or draw your 
own dividing lines.

808  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
	
3.	 Click the Intersecting References button in the contextual ribbon. You are presented with 
the Intersecting Named References dialog box (Figure 19.17). From the Filter drop-down 
list, select All and notice that you can choose from levels, grids, and named reference 
planes.
Figure 19.17
You can use a datum 
as one way to divide 
parts. 
Note that if a reference plane has not been named, it will not appear in this list.
	
4.	 Check the boxes for the two reference planes named xPlane1 and yPlane1. Click OK to 
close the dialog box. You’ll see two green datum objects highlight in the model.
	
5.	 Click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to finish Edit mode.
After you complete the process for dividing the part, notice that the part has now become 
four separate pieces. To experiment with how the parts maintain their relationship to the 
original object as well as the intersecting reference planes, go to the Level 1 floor plan 
and move the reference planes around, but try to keep them within the boundary of the 
sample floor. When you return to the 3D view, you will see that the divisions stay syn-
chronized with the reference planes.
	
6.	 Activate the ceiling plan for Level 1. In the Properties palette for the view, change Parts 
Visibility to Show Parts. Select the Gypsum Wall Board part on the bottom of the ceiling 
below the Level 2 floor.
Graphically, this will look like you’re selecting the entire ceiling because it will all high-
light blue.
You can make sure you have the correct part selected by examining the Properties pal-
ette. The category filter at the top should display Parts (1) and the Material parameter 
should indicate Gypsum Wall Board – Ceiling (Figure 19.18).

7.	 Click the Divide Parts button in the contextual ribbon, and then click the Edit Sketch 
button to activate Sketch mode. Draw a diagonal line across the part from left to right, as 
shown in Figure 19.19.

Figure 19.19
Sketch a line to divide 
a part.
If you need to sketch lines to divide parts, the lines do not have to be in closed loops, but 
they must intersect the boundaries of the part. Keep in mind that if the original element 
is edited so that its boundaries extend beyond any sketched part divisions, the part divi-
sions will be deleted.
	
8.	 Click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to finish the sketch, and then click it 
again to finish the part-dividing mode.
	
9.	 Activate the Parts Model view, and orbit the model so you can select the inside face of the 
wall. Select the part of the wall that would represent the gypsum wall board at the inte-
rior face of Level 2.

810  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
	
10.	 From the Properties palette, find the Show Shape Handles parameter and check the 
box. You will see triangular shape handles on all four sides of the part, as shown in 
Figure 19.20. Drag the top shape handle down to indicate that the gypsum wall board is 
not to be installed to the full height of the wall assembly.
Figure 19.20
Use the Properties 
palette to enable shape 
handles for parts.
There are several other ways you can interact with parts in your project model. Select any of 
the parts and observe the Properties palette. You will see that you can override each part’s mate-
rial, phase created, and phase demolished (Figure 19.21).

Using Parts
So far in this chapter, you’ve seen how you can use parts to subdivide building elements such as 
walls and floors. While the workflow outlined can take away from quickly laying out walls and 
floors, the Parts tool is very useful if leveraged correctly. As an example, one use for the Parts tool 

Modeling for Construction |  811  
Dividing Parts with a Gap
In the previous exercise, you learned how to divide parts using datum objects and simple 
sketches. You also have the ability to divide parts with a defined gap as well as with a custom 
profile. Let’s explore these options with another exercise:
	
1.	 Continue to work with the sample file c19-Parts-Start.rvt or c19-Parts-Metric-
Start.rvt from the previous exercise. Activate the Parts Model 3D view and orbit the 
model to view the exterior face of the wall.
	
2.	 Select the main part of the exterior wall face that has the material assignment Concrete, 
Precast. Click the Divide Parts tool in the contextual ribbon.
	
3.	 In the Properties palette, set the Divider Gap parameter to 1″ (25 mm).
	
4.	 Click the Intersecting References tool in the ribbon, set the filter to All, and then select 
Level 2, Reference Plane: yPlane1, and Grid: 1. Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
5.	 Click the green check mark in the ribbon to finish Divide Parts mode, and the panel will 
be divided with a continuous gap, as shown in Figure 19.22.
would be to define precast panels. In many instances, the precast paneling follows architectural 
grid lines. Controlling those with hosted voids or sweeps can be cumbersome and lead to a lot of 
manual coordination. Hosted sweeps can also be problematic around windows or other openings 
in the panels. This workflow would allow you to dynamically update the design and have it resonate 
through the documents quickly and clean up more easily than sweeps.
Knowing when to make use of a tool in Revit is almost as important as knowing how to use the 
tool. Tools like parts that allow a granular manipulation of building geometry are typically better 
left until later in the design process.
Figure 19.22
Parts divided with a 
continuous gap
In addition to simple gaps, parts can be divided with a custom profile. A family template 
called Division Profile.rft (Metric Division Profile.rft) is available in the default 
family template library. This profile family is similar to other profiles except that the com-
pleted sketch in the family does not need to be a closed loop. That said, the sketch must 
extend completely between the two reference planes associated with the Width parameter in 
the template.

812  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
A number of division profiles are loaded in the default architectural project template. You 
can find these in the Project Browser under Families ➢ Division Profiles. To examine how any of 
these are created, right-click Tapered Notch and select Edit from the context menu.
Let’s explore how you can edit an existing division and apply a custom profile to the gap. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Continue to work with the project file c19-Parts-Start.rvt or c19-Parts-Metric-
Start.rvt from the previous exercise. Activate the Parts Model 3D view, and orbit the 
model to view the exterior face of the wall.
	
2.	 Select any one of the divided parts of the main precast concrete portion of the wall. Once 
a part has been divided, you won’t need to select all the parts to edit the division—select 
just one. From the contextual ribbon, click Edit Division.
	
3.	 In the Properties palette, change the Division Profile parameter to Angled Step: Angled 
Step. Once you select a profile type, additional parameters are available in the Properties 
palette. Set the Edge Match parameter to Complementary (Figure 19.23).
Figure 19.23
Assigning a division 
profile to a part
	
4.	 Click the green check mark in the ribbon to finish the division edits, and you will see that 
the updated profiles are applied to all edges of the divided parts (Figure 19.24).
Figure 19.24
Parts divided with a 
division profile

Modeling for Construction |  813  
	
5.	 To explore different functionality with division profiles, repeat steps 2 through 4, but 
select the profile Notch and set the Edge Match parameter to Mirrored. Observe the 
change in behavior using a different matching property.
When you apply a custom profile to a division of parts, the profile is applied to all divi-
sions. If you need to assign different profiles to different divisions, you must apply each 
of those unique divisions separately. Let’s try this approach by continuing the exercise.
	
6.	 In the Parts Model view, select any of the precast concrete parts you generated earlier in 
this exercise. Click Edit Division in the contextual ribbon.
	
7.	 Click the Intersecting References button in the ribbon, and in the Intersecting Named 
References dialog box, set the Filter drop-down to All, and then deselect Reference Plane: 
yPlane1.
	
8.	 Click OK to close the dialog box, and then click the green check mark in the ribbon to 
finish editing the division.
	
9.	 While pressing the Ctrl key, select the two larger precast concrete panels to the right side 
of the wall. Click the Divide Parts button in the ribbon.
	
10.	 Click the Intersecting References button in the ribbon, set the Filter drop-down to All, 
and then select Reference Plane: yPlane1. Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
11.	 In the Properties palette, set the Divider Gap parameter to 0″–1″ (25 mm). Click the green 
check mark in the ribbon to finish editing the division.
You will now see that the custom profile was maintained for the other part divisions, but the 
rightmost vertical division has only a simple gap.
Merging Parts
Parts can be merged to form larger, more contiguous geometry; however, the parts to be merged 
must have the same material and the same creation and demolition phases, and the merged 
geometry must consist of a single connected component. Parts with gaps assigned to the divi-
sions will not be merged.
To merge parts, press the Ctrl key while selecting multiple parts. In the contextual ribbon, 
click Merge Parts. Once parts have been merged, you can always edit them in the future. To edit 
merged parts, select the part and then select Edit Merged from the contextual ribbon.
Excluding Parts
Parts can also be excluded from a model to support more detailed construction conditions. To 
exclude a part, select the part and click Exclude Parts from the Exclude panel of the contextual 
ribbon. Excluded parts will not appear in any schedules; however, they are easily restored. 
To restore an excluded part, hover over the area with your mouse pointer where the part was 

814  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
excluded. You will be able to select the excluded part, but it will be indicated with a special icon. 
Click the icon on the excluded part or click Restore Parts in the contextual ribbon.
Be Aware of the Parts Category
Because parts are considered a separate category of elements, you should pay careful attention 
to how they might affect your views and view templates. Take a look at the visibility and graphic 
overrides for any view, and you’ll see that Parts is listed as an object category. This means that 
once you create parts for a model element—whether the original object was a floor, ceiling, wall, 
or roof—the parts are all treated as a singular type of object. For example, if you have surface pat-
terns for floors hidden in a view and you create parts for a floor, the surface pattern will appear 
again unless you have hidden surface patterns for the Parts category as well.
Scheduling Parts
Another valuable aspect of using parts is the ability to schedule them—essentially a cleaner way 
to generate material takeoffs. You can create a parts schedule in the same manner as you would 
for other object categories. On the View tab, click Schedules ➢ Schedule/Quantities, and choose 
the Parts category.
Select the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box, and you will see the available 
fields (Figure 19.25). With a part schedule, you can report the original category of the object 
along with the part material and the usual geometric information.
Figure 19.25
A part schedule has 
access to some unique 
fields for reporting.

Modeling for Construction |  815  
There is also a field named Construction that indicates whether the part was derived 
from a Core layer or a Finish layer. This field can then be used as a filter and/or sorting cri-
terion in your schedule. An example illustrating the results of a part schedule is shown in 
Figure 19.26.
Figure 19.26
An example of a completed 
part schedule
Creating Assemblies
An assembly organizes related elements within your project. The feature is designed to help 
users track and schedule a collection of elements as a single entity. In the case of precast 
concrete, for example, a column made of multiple families, including reinforcing bars, mounting 
hardware, and corbels, can be collected into a single assembly.
As you identify objects to be included in an assembly, you can also choose from a variety 
of views in which to document the element in isolation from the rest of the project model. A 
collection of assembly views can be thought of as shop drawings. Let’s take a look at the work-
flow for creating an assembly.
In the following exercise, you can use any sample model to illustrate the process of creating 
assemblies:
	
1.	 In any view of your project, select a few model elements. Try to pick a few that are relatively 
close to each other.

816  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
	
2.	 From the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Create Assembly. You will be prompted to 
name the new assembly (Figure 19.27).
Figure 19.27
Enter a name for the 
new assembly.
If you selected objects of different categories such as a wall and a ceiling, you have the oppor-
tunity to select which category the assembly will inherit. Choosing one category or the other 
does not seem to have an effect on the functionality beyond the organization that is exposed to 
the user.
Using Identical Assemblies
When you create a new assembly, the software automatically determines whether another identical 
assembly exists in your model. If one exists, the new assembly inherits the name of the identical 
assembly. In a somewhat similar situation, if you were to create copies of an assembly throughout 
your project, the matching assemblies would function in a similar way to how groups function. 
The fundamental difference between assemblies and groups is in the propagation of changes. If 
you have identical assemblies in a project and you change one of them, the name of the modified 
assembly is changed and it is treated as a unique assembly.
Creating Assembly Views
After you have created an assembly, you can create a series of views that are dedicated to that 
assembly. In other words, you will see only the elements included in the assembly within these 
views. In addition to plans, sections, and 3D views, you can generate parts lists and quantity 
takeoffs for an assembly.
To generate assembly views, select an assembly in any view and select Create Views from 
the Assembly panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon. You are prompted with a dialog box in 
which you choose the views assigned to the assembly (Figure 19.28).

Modeling for Construction |  817  
After you click OK, you will find the assembly views at the bottom of the Project Browser. 
Under the Assemblies grouping, you will find each assembly listed with all the associated views 
(Figure 19.29).
Figure 19.28
Select views to be 
created with the 
assembly.
Figure 19.29
Assembly views are 
found at the bottom of 
the Project Browser.
Although sections are automatically placed for the included elements, the individual views 
are not placed on the assembly sheet. To do this, activate the sheet within an assembly and then 
drag and drop the views onto the sheet. Note that assembly views can be used on non-assembly 

818  | Chapter 19  Working in the Construction Phase   
sheets and regular views can be placed on an assembly sheet. An example of views compiled 
into an assembly sheet is shown in Figure 19.30.

 presenting Your Design   
 Although Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture software is most often used to create parametric 
content for documentation, it is often necessary to show designs to clients and other project 
stakeholders to make critical decisions. Revit has tools that you can use to embellish views or 
create new graphics to help present the design. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Understand color fi ll legends 
 
◆
 Use 3D model views in your presentation 
 
◆
 Work with viewport types 
 
◆
 Create “exploded” axonometric views 
 Understanding Color Fill Legends 
 There are many times in the design process when you will need to go beyond documenta-
tion for construction and portray spaces in a building in a different way. For example, you 
may need to communicate design intent, departmental adjacencies and allocations, or room 
fi nishes. Because Revit software has these functions, you can use its parametric capabili-
ties to do more than just generate annotation—you can graphically show all kinds of model 
parameters. 
 The tool for creating this kind of view is called the Color Fill Legend. You can use this tool to 
color areas and rooms in plans, sections, and elevations. It allows you to assign different colors 
to just about any of the room or area properties within a view. Here are just a few examples of 
the types of views you can create: 
 
◆
 Floor plans showing departments. 
 
◆
 Floor plans showing spaces based on area value. An example might be rooms smaller than 
500 square feet (50 sq m) as one color, rooms that are between 500 and 1000 square feet 
(50 sq m to 100 sq m) as another color, and rooms bigger than 1000 square feet (100 sq m) as 
a third color. 
 
◆
 Building sections showing different departments in different colors as in a stacking 
diagram. 
 
◆
 Plans, sections, or elevations portraying room fi nish types. 

820  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
There is an almost endless list of the types of color fills you can create to help communicate 
a wide variety of project-specific details. The Color Fill Legend tool is located on the Color Fill 
panel of the Annotate tab (Figure 20.1).
Figure 20.1
The Color Fill  
Legend tool
To better demonstrate some of the uses of the Color Fill Legend tool, let’s make a simple color 
fill plan showing room types.
Making a Color Fill Legend for Rooms
In many projects, it becomes necessary to display plans with some additional information about 
the spaces. Typically during the design phases, clients need to see how different departments 
are located adjacent to one another. Even in a simple residential design, it can be helpful to see 
how public spaces such as kitchens and living areas are located relative to the more private 
spaces of bedrooms and bathrooms.
In the sample building project used in Chapter 17, “Documenting Your Design,” you may want 
to visually show the various space types in the floor plans. You want to graphically demonstrate 
which spaces have been assigned to various departments defined in the building’s program of 
requirements. To get started, download and open the c20-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or
c20-Sample-Metric.rvt model from the book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. 
You will begin by creating a new type of floor plan that will help organize the Project Browser and 
automatically assign an appropriate view template.
To get started, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel, and then choose Plan Views 
➢ Floor Plans. In the New Floor Plan dialog box, click the Edit Type button to open the 
Type Properties dialog box for the Floor Plan type.
	
2.	 Click the Duplicate button and then name the new view type Color Fill.
	
3.	 Click the button in the parameter field named View Template Applied To New Views. In 
the Apply View Template dialog box, select Color Fill Plans and then click OK to close the 
Type Properties dialog box.
	
4.	 Using the Ctrl key, select both Level 1 and Level 2 in the New Floor Plan dialog box, and 
then click OK.
	
5.	 Return to the Project Browser and you will see a new heading called Floor Plans 
(Color Fill). Change the names of the new floor plans to Level 1 - Dept - Color and 
Level 2 - Dept - Color.

Understanding Color Fill Legends |  821  
	
6.	 Activate each of the new color fill plans and use the Tag All Not Tagged tool to add room 
tags to each plan.
For more information on tagging, see Chapter 18, “Annotating Your Design.”
	
7.	 Open the Level 1 - Dept - Color floor plan and click the Color Fill Legend button in the 
Color Fill panel of the Annotate tab. This will activate the Color Fill Legend tool and ask 
you to place a legend somewhere in the active view. Anywhere for now is fine—just place 
it to one side of the plan or the other.
Once the legend is placed, you can then define and customize its characteristics.
	
8.	 After the legend is placed, you’ll be presented with a dialog box similar to the one in 
Figure 20.2. This dialog box will prompt you to choose from a list of space types avail-
able in the current view and color schemes that have already been established within the 
model. From the Space Type drop-down list, select Rooms, and from the Color Scheme 
drop-down list, choose Name and click OK.
Figure 20.2
Choose Space Type and 
Color Scheme after you 
place the legend in a 
view.
The color scheme will automatically generate a legend based on your room names and 
color the rooms on the plan.
If you already created a color scheme that you wanted to use in this view, it would be 
a simple matter of selecting it from this list and clicking OK, and the legend and view 
would be complete. The default project template contains a few simple color schemes 
from which you can choose when you place your first legend. You started with a basic 
one that automatically assigns a color for each unique room name in the project; however, 
this type of presentation is not usually that useful.
In the subsequent steps of the exercise, you will create different color schemes to further 
explore more complex methods of presentation.
	
9.	 After the legend is placed, you can then alter its properties or choose a different color 
scheme. To modify a legend, select the legend, and in the Modify | Color Fill Legends 
context menu, click the Edit Scheme button.
This opens the aptly named Edit Color Scheme dialog box (Figure 20.3). This dialog box 
allows you add, rename, or delete color schemes on the left side and define the graphic 
properties and attributes of these schemes on the right.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

822  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
A drop-down list labeled Color at the top of the Scheme Definition area appears. This is 
the property by which the color scheme is being defined. It is currently assigned to color 
the plan according to room name. Each unique room name in the project is automatically 
generating its own color for the legend.
	
10.	 From the list of schemes at the left, choose Department.
The Color drop-down list now indicates the Department parameter, but there are no 
values defined in the list to the right. This is because text has not been added to the 
Department parameter for any of the room elements in the project.
Any parameter available to be used in a color fill legend needs to have values in its prop-
erties. You can enter the value in the Properties palette either by selecting the item and 
finding that property or by predefining values in the color scheme. In the following steps, 
you will predefine values for the departments and then assign them to the rooms later.
	
11.	 Now let’s predefine some values. At the left side of the table under Scheme Definition, 
click the green plus sign to add values to the color scheme for Department. Create four 
new values as follows:
◆
◆
MANAGEMENT
◆
◆
OPERATIONS
◆
◆
PRODUCTION
◆
◆
SALES
For now, you can use the automatic color and pattern assignments.
	
12.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
You will notice in the floor plan that the legend now shows the title Department Legend and it 
displays No Colors Defined (Figure 20.4). Even though you defined some Department values, 
they will not show on the legend until you assign values to the rooms placed in the project.
Figure 20.3
The Edit Color  
Scheme dialog box

Understanding Color Fill Legends |  823  
	
13.	 Back in the floor plan, select the Manager room on the lower left of the plan and look in 
the Properties palette. Find the Department property and click in the value field to access 
a drop-down list (Figure 20.5).
Figure 20.4

scheme
Figure 20.5
Assign values to room 
properties based on 
data assigned to a  
color scheme.
The values available in the list are the values you added to the color scheme in step 5.
	
14.	 Assign the two rooms at the left side of the plan to the MANAGEMENT department, 
assign the LOUNGE space to the SALES department, and assign the SUPPORT space to 
the OPERATIONS department.
As you make these assignments, the color fill legend will update and the space will fill 
with the matching color.
	
15.	 Activate the Level 2 - Dept - Color floor plan and repeat steps 7 through 14 to assign 
some department values.
Because you already created a color scheme defined by department value, you don’t need to 
repeat steps 9 and 10.

824  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
Customizing a Color Fill Legend
Although the software automatically assigns colors to each value in a color scheme definition, 
you’ll likely want to change the colors or the fill patterns to suit your presentation needs. In this 
section you will customize the color scheme and the legend created in the previous exercises. 
Because many firms typically have standards for presentation color schemes, it’s a good idea to 
add your customized schemes to your office template.
In the following exercise you will create a copy of the department-based color scheme  
to use black line patterns instead of color fills. Download and open the file c20-Sample-
Building2-Start.rvt or c20-Sample-Metric2-Start.rvt from the book’s web page. 
Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Return to the Level 1 - Dept - Color floor plan you used for the exercise in the previous 
section. In the Project Browser, right-click Level 1 - Dept - Color and choose Duplicate 
With Detailing from the context menu. Rename the duplicated view Level 1 - Dept - Black. 
Repeat this process for the Level 2 - Dept - Color plan.
	
2.	 Activate the Level 1 - Dept - Black floor plan, select the legend located to the right of the 
plan, and click Edit Scheme in the ribbon to open the Edit Color Scheme dialog box.
	
3.	 Select Department from the list of schemes on the left side and click the Duplicate icon at 
the bottom of the list. Name the duplicate scheme Department (Black).
	
4.	 You can change any of the assigned colors by selecting any of the buttons in the Color 
column. Doing so opens the Color dialog box (Figure 20.6) and allows you to select colors 
based on RGB values or PANTONE colors. Change the colors for each of the departments 
to black (R:0, G:0, B:0) and then click OK.
After you have defined the colors, take note of a couple of other features in the Edit 
Color Scheme dialog box, shown previously in Figure 20.3. The first is the Options area 
at the bottom of the dialog box, which contains a single check box that allows you to 
pull values from linked projects. If you are working on a large building that is split into 
multiple files, this is a good way to tie all that information together into a single graphic 
presentation.
	
5.	 The other option you have is the ability to exclude various scheme definition values 
for a color scheme. Notice the Visible column next to the Value column in the scheme 
definition, as shown in Figure 20.7.
Assigning Color Fills without a Legend
In the previous exercise, you generated color fills on a plan by adding a legend and then customizing 
the color scheme through the legend. You don’t have to place a legend in order to color a plan with 
a color scheme. In the Properties palette for a view, you can find the Color Scheme property. Click 
the button in the value row to open the Edit Color Scheme dialog box and choose a color scheme 
to be assigned to the view. The plan will display the respective colors even without a legend shown 
on the view. You can always add a legend later by using the Legend tool in the Color Fill panel of 
the Annotate tab in the ribbon.

Understanding Color Fill Legends |  825  
Figure 20.6
Click the button in the 
Color column to select 
a different color.
Figure 20.7
Use the Visible option 
to exclude values from 
the legend.
Uncheck the box in the Visible column next to the value for OPERATIONS.
This setting will exclude the selected value wherever this color scheme is applied to a view. 
In this example, we might assume that the client does not need to see spaces that belong to 
the OPERATIONS department in color—just the remaining departmental spaces.
	
6.	 Click each of the fields under the Fill Pattern column to change the fill pattern to a variety 
of line-based patterns, as shown in Figure 20.8.
Figure 20.8
The pattern for 
each value can be 
customized.
	
7.	 Click OK and you’ll notice that the color fills have dynamically changed to reflect the 
modifications you made in your color scheme properties, as shown in Figure 20.9.

826  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
Figure 20.9

scheme colors and 
patterns are altered
	
8.	 Open the Level 2 - Dept - Black floor plan. In the Properties palette, locate the Color 
Scheme parameter and click the button in the value field that is currently assigned to 
Department. In the Edit Color Scheme dialog box, choose the Department (Black) color 
scheme and click OK.
The pattern fills are automatically placed according to the department assignments. Also 
notice that spaces assigned to the OPERATIONS department are not colored, nor does the 
department name appear in the legend because the Visible setting was turned off in step 5.
Modifying Other Settings
By now, you’ve created a color fill legend and placed it within a view, and you’ve seen a number 
of the settings and properties of the legend. Those settings reflect how the color fill legend 
will look and react to the plan or view in which it’s placed, but there are other settings you can 
modify as well. The legend key itself has several properties that control fonts and swatch sizes. 
Select the legend and click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette to explore some of the 
other properties you can modify.
Figure 20.10 shows the type properties for a color fill legend. In this dialog box, you can 
change the font size and type as well as the size of the color swatches that appear in the legend.
An important type property for color fill legends is Values Displayed. The two options for 
this property are By View and All, and the default setting for color fill legends is By View. 
You might have noticed that none of the spaces on Level 1 are assigned to the PRODUCTION 
department, and so that value does not appear in the legend placed on Level 1.
Try creating a duplicate color legend type named All Values and change the Values 
Displayed property to All. This legend type shows all department names, regardless of the 
department assignments on each level. This setting does not override the Visible options you 
specify in the color scheme settings; therefore, the OPERATIONS department will still not 
display when you use the Department (Black) color scheme.
In summary, you can combine any color scheme with any color legend type—the two are not 
dependent on each other.

Understanding Color Fill Legends |  827  
Using Numerical Ranges for Color Schemes
In the previous exercises, you explored how to use color schemes to create presentation material 
based on specific object properties. You can also create color schemes that display ranges of numer-

.rvt or c20-Sample-Metric2-Start.rvt file. With the Room color fill legend defined, you have

Don’t Forget Your Standards
It can take several tries between creating color fill plans and printing them to get the colors just 
right. You’ll find yourself making multiple adjustments along the way. When you have one that 
works for you, take the time for a couple of extra steps so you don’t have to re-create this work in 
the future.
First, if it is a type of project that you’ll be doing again and again, add the legend to your project 
template. This is as easy as placing the legend on a view and the view on a sheet (similar to a 
schedule) and copying it to the Clipboard. Open your project template (in the same instance of 
Revit) and paste it onto a sheet, and your settings, colors, and naming conventions will be quickly 
transferred and saved for future use.

828  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
seen an example of how to create color fill legends. A variety of other legend types are available, 
and some of these types allow you to define your own parameters when creating the legend itself. 
Let’s step through this process again using a different legend type so you can see how you can 
define your own parameters in a color fill legend.
The next color scheme you will create is based on areas. Whereas the Department color 
scheme was defined by rooms that were already placed on plans, the area scheme is defined  
by numerical ranges you will need to define within the color scheme properties. Follow  
these steps:
	
1.	 In the Project Browser, right-click the Level 1 - Dept - Black floor plan and choose 
Duplicate With Detailing from the context menu. Rename the duplicated plan Level 
1 - Area Range. Select the color fill legend in the view, and click Edit Scheme in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon.
	
2.	 In the Edit Color Scheme dialog box, create a copy of the Name color scheme, using the 
Duplicate icon at the bottom of the list. Name the new scheme Area Range. Also change 
the Title field to Area Range.
	
3.	 From the Color drop-down list, choose Area. Click OK if you are presented with a 
warning about preserving colors.
You’ll notice that all the room names and colors will disappear; they are replaced with 
values representing each unique room area.
This type of schedule—like a schedule of room names—is probably not that useful as a 
presentation method. Instead, let’s create a series of colored area ranges to easily identify 
which spaces are within specific ranges.
	
4.	 Next to the Color drop-down list in the Scheme Definition field, select the By Range 
option. The static area values in the list below are now split into two columns labeled At 
Least and Less Than (Figure 20.11).
Figure 20.11
Select By Range to 
change the scheme 
definition.
	
5.	 Select one of the rows so the green plus button is active. Click that button two times so 
that you have four rows in the list of value ranges.
	
6.	 Starting from the bottom row, change the values to 800, 500, and 200, as shown in 
Figure 20.12.

Understanding Color Fill Legends |  829  
You can also try changing some of the colors assigned to each of the value ranges to make 
the presentation more meaningful or simply easier to read.
	
7.	 Click OK to update the color fill scheme and view the results in the plan (Figure 20.13).

Definition field

The rooms now have colors based on their sizes rather than their names.
	
8.	 In the Project Browser, right-click Level 2 - Dept - Black and choose Duplicate With 
Detailing from the context menu. Rename the duplicated view Level 2 - Area Range.
	
9.	 In the Level 2 - Area Range floor plan, select the existing color fill legend and click Edit 
Scheme from the contextual tab in the ribbon. In the Edit Color Scheme dialog box, select 
Area Range and then click OK.
The rooms on Level 2 are now also represented with the same color range as we assigned for 
Level 1.

Presenting with 3D Views
In addition to using 2D views such as plans, sections, and elevations to convey your design 
intent, you can present the 3D model in a variety of ways. In Chapter 11, “Visualization,” we 
discussed the methods for creating analytic and photorealistic visualizations; the following 
sections will help you to establish a new repertoire of presentation techniques for design and 
construction documents.
Orienting to Other Views
A quick and easy way to create more useful 3D views is by utilizing the Orient To View command. 
This command, which is somewhat hidden within the ViewCube®, allows you to create a 3D view 
that mimics the settings of a 2D view.
In the following exercise, you will continue to use the c20-Sample-Building2-Start.rvt 
or c20-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt file. You will first adjust the view range settings for the floor 
plans and then create a 3D view for each level. Finally, you will assemble the views on a sheet to 
complete the presentation.
	
1.	 Select Level 1 from the Project Browser and go to the Properties Palette to examine the 
view properties. Click the Edit button in the View Range property.
	
2.	 In the View Range dialog box (Figure 20.14), change the Top value under Primary Range 
to Level Above and set the corresponding offset value to –1’-8” (–0.5 m). Repeat this step 
for Level 2.
Program Verification with Color Fills
Another more advanced presentation technique can be achieved with color fills by using value 
ranges for verification of your project’s program of requirements. We showed you how to create a 
color fill scheme to illustrate ranges of spatial area; however, the results can be made even more 
useful for effective decision making.
The Area property of rooms will always display the actual value of the enclosed space. To compare 
the actual or designed area with the required area, you must create and populate a user-defined 
parameter. There are other applications that can accomplish this integration with Revit, including 
Trelligence Affinity (www.trelligence.com) and dRofus (www.drofus.com); however, the ability 
of an external application to feed the required program areas into the Revit model is irrelevant. 
The key is to compare the required area with the designed area and feed the difference into another 
user-defined room parameter. This can be accomplished using the Revit application programming 
interface.
Once the difference in area is captured in a room parameter, a color scheme can be established to 
color the ranges in the difference. For example, if the designed area is divided by the required area, 
you will get a percentage that can be included in a color scheme range. Color the higher percentages 
(positive and negative) with a noticeably visible color and the lower percentages with a more subtle 
color. If the range of acceptable differences is between 95 percent and 105 percent of the required 
area, then that range can be assigned no color and no pattern.

Presenting with 3D Views |  831  
Although you are changing the top of the view range of the floor plans, you will not see 
any difference in their graphic display.
	
3.	 Right-click the Default 3D view {3D} in the Project Browser and create two duplicates. 
Rename the duplicate views Box-Level 1 and Box-Level 2.
	
4.	 Activate the view Box-Level 1 and right-click the ViewCube. Select Orient To View ➢ 
Floor Plans ➢ Floor Plan: Level 1, as shown in Figure 20.15.

range.

832  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
The view will be set to a plan orientation, but more important, a section box has been 
enabled that matches the extents of the Level 1 plan view. Try orbiting the view to see the 
results (Figure 20.16).
Figure 20.16

oriented to a plan view
	
5.	 Right-click the ViewCube and select Orient To A Direction ➢ Southwest Isometric.
	
6.	 Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the Box-Level 2 view.
	
7.	 Create a new sheet using the title block in the project file, and drag the Box-Level 1 and 
Box-Level 2 views onto the sheet.
Place the Box-Level 2 view directly above the Box-Level 1 view and you’ll notice that the 
views will align vertically. You can align model views of various types on sheets as long as they 
are the same scale. This does not work for drafting views or perspective views.
You can continue to experiment with the view settings of these 3D views on the sheet. Even 
though the section boxes won’t print by default, you may want to hide them anyway. You can’t 
uncheck the Section Box property because the view would no longer be three-dimensionally 
cropped. To hide the section box, select the viewport and then click Activate View in the con-
textual tab in the ribbon. Select the section box, and from the contextual tab in the ribbon, click 
Hide In View (the light bulb icon) ➢ Hide Elements. Right-click and choose Deactivate View 
from the context menu, and then repeat this process for the other 3D view.
Cutting to the Core
We have worked on many building projects in which there was a central core of vertical circula-
tion: stairs, elevators, and shafts. After years of legacy experience using 2D views to explore these 
complex yet isolated three-dimensional spaces, we found it difficult to imagine an easier way to 
perform this design and coordination task.
The ability to quickly generate a 3D view that is based on an enlarged stair plan or elevator shaft section 
has proven to be immensely valuable. Teaching this technique to the senior architects and engineers 
on your team will bring you plenty of praise! There’s even an app for that—the COINS Auto-Section 
Box add-in is a free download that can be found in the Autodesk Exchange app store (http://apps.
exchange.autodesk.com). The Auto-Section Box tool has become one of our most used add-ins.

Presenting with 3D Views |  833  
Annotating 3D Views
Once you add a 3D view to your sheets, you’re likely want to annotate it. To add annotations to 
your 3D view, you first need to lock it before adding text and tags as you would in a 2D view. 
This functionality is quite simple to implement.
In any orthographic 3D view, you will find the Lock/Unlock View button in the view short-
cut bar, as shown in Figure 20.17. Once you lock the view, you can begin to add tags, text, and 
dimensions, but you cannot change the orientation of the view unless it is unlocked.
Figure 20.17
The 3D view can be 
locked from the view 
control bar.
In the example shown in Figure 20.18, a section box was first applied to a 3D view and then 
annotated.
Figure 20.18
Annotation can 
be applied to a 3D 
view with locked 
orientation.
Once you have added annotation to a view, you may need to rotate the view. Return to the 
locked view tool and click Unlock View. You are now free to orbit the 3D view; notice how 
your annotations orbit with your model. The annotations will appear a bit skewed as a result 
of this rotation. If you want to return the view to the originally saved orientation, click Restore 
Orientation And Lock View. The annotations will reappear in their original locations.

834  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
Editing Viewport Types
In the previous exercises, you might have noticed that the 3D views placed on the sheet dis-
played the default view title; however, we don’t need the titles every time we place a view on 
a sheet. Options and properties related to the display of views on sheets are stored as viewport 
types. Although the name conjures up memories of model space and paper space in Autodesk® 
AutoCAD® software, it is actually quite different in Revit. The viewport does not determine the 
scale or anything else about the view itself but simply sets the parameters for how a view sits on 
a sheet.
Let’s examine how to customize viewport types by completing an exercise that continues 
from the previous example of placing 3D views on a sheet:
	
1.	 Using the sheet with the two stacked 3D plan views, select one of the views and click Edit 
Type in the Properties palette.
The Type Properties dialog box appears (Figure 20.19).
There are only a few properties in a viewport type, most of which are related to the 
extension line in the title. You can change the View Title family selection in the Family 
drop-down list. However, in this exercise you will not need a view title. We’re going to 
create a new viewport type that does not use a title.
Figure 20.19
The type properties  
of a viewport
	
2.	 Click the Duplicate button to create a new viewport type named No Title.
	
3.	 Click the Show Title drop-down list and select No.
	
4.	 Next, for the Show Extension Line setting, uncheck the box.

Creating “Exploded” Axonometric Views |  835  
Before you click OK to make the new type, let’s verify an important property in this dia-
log box. The Show Title property is set to When Multiple Viewports, which will display 
the titles only when multiple views are placed on a sheet. The view title is not displayed if 
only one view is placed on a sheet, as in an overall floor plan.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box, and you’ll see that the viewport you 
had selected is already changed to the new type. Select the other viewport and switch it 
to No Title in the Type Selector.
When you have completed the exercise, you can also add some detail lines to the sheet to 
further embellish the descriptive presentation, as shown in Figure 20.20. Although you cannot 
snap to the geometry within the viewports, you can use the arrow keys to nudge the lines into 
alignment as required.
Figure 20.20
Customized viewports 
placed on a sheet
Creating “Exploded” Axonometric Views
A very useful tool to help you present your designs in a unique way is the Displace 
Elements tool. This tool allows you to create an “exploded” axon—essentially allowing  
you to take the geometry of a 3D view and move it without impacting the model. In  
Figure 20.21, you can see the use of the Displace Elements tool on the left and the original 
model on the right. The displacement is view-specific, so in all other views the model 
integrity remains.

836  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
In this exercise, you’re going to continue using the c20-Sample-Building2-Start.rvt or 
c20-Sample-Metric2-Start.rvt file to create a displaced element. The Displace Elements tool 
is found on the Modify tab, and it is active when you select an object in a 3D view. It is located 
on the View panel in the upper-right corner.
You’ll start this exercise by creating a new view:
	
1.	 Take the Box-Level 1 view you created in the previous exercise and duplicate it. Rename 
the view Axon-Level 1.
	
2.	 With the new view established, you can change the orientation. Right-click the 
ViewCube, select Orient To A Direction, and select Southeast Isometric. Alternatively, you 
can select the corner of the ViewCube where the Front, Right, and Top sides connect.
Your starting view will look like Figure 20.22.
Figure 20.21
Using the Displace 
Elements tool
Figure 20.22
Baseline view for the 
displaced elements

Creating “Exploded” Axonometric Views |  837  
	
3.	 One thing that you’ll notice about this view is the section box. In other situations, the 
scope box would create a limit for what you could change, because anything outside 
the scope box would effectively disappear within the view. Because the changes you 
are making using the Displace Elements tool are only view-specific and not actually 
manipulating model content, you can leave the scope box where it is.
So that it doesn’t interfere with the view, however, you can turn it off. Right-click the 
scope box and choose Hide In View ➢ Element from the context menu.
	
4.	 Now, you can begin displacing elements. When using this tool, elements will be grouped 
based on selection. So, if you were to pick multiple elements and then displace them, they 
would all move together, keeping a relative distance to one another.
To demonstrate this, select both of the walls on the right of the view (Figure 20.23).
Figure 20.23
The first selection  
for displacement
	
5.	 Select the Displace Elements tool from the View panel of the Modify tab. Both walls will 
remain highlighted now, but you’ll see a 3D control tool appear (Figure 20.24).
Figure 20.24
Using the 3D control 
to move the displaced 
elements

838  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
	
6.	 Grab the red control (the one that points to the lower right) and pull it away from the 
building. The walls should move in a plane parallel to their original position.
You’ll see the walls you selected visually unjoin from the building (Figure 20.25). If you 
were to move these walls without the use of this tool, you would receive error messages 
about rooms being unbound or elements being unjoined. None of that is happening because 
the changes you’re making are just view-specific and not impacting the actual model.
Figure 20.25
The displaced walls
	
7.	 For the next displacement, select the three walls on the backside of the building (Figure 20.26). 
Select the Displace Elements tool again, and drag these using the green arrow (the one point-
ing to the upper right).
Figure 20.26
The second 
displacement

Creating “Exploded” Axonometric Views |  839  
Notice how the door moved without selecting it (instead the wall was selected) but the 
storefront system did not move. As you create these types of views, you’ll need to make 
sure you’re selecting all of the elements you want to relocate. If you don’t get it exactly 
right, however, don’t worry. With these displaced walls highlighted, some new tools are 
active in the Modify | Displaced Elements tab: Edit, Reset, and Path. The Reset tool will 
undo the displacement you have created and reset the walls to their original locations.
	
8.	 To complete this step, you need to use the Edit button. Select Edit and notice how 
the view has changed. The elements within the displacement group are highlighted 
orange, and a new Edit Displacement Set panel has popped up that is similar to the 
Edit Groups panel.
	
9.	 In this view, choose Add from the Edit Displacement Set panel. Choose the storefront 
system that you didn’t select in step 7 (Figure 20.27).
Figure 20.27
Add the storefront  
wall to the 
displacement set.
It will immediately move to its proper location within the wall and turn orange like the 
rest of the set (Figure 20.28). Click Finish from the panel to exit this view.
Figure 20.28
Displace the wall  
next to the stairs.
	
10.	 You’re going to make one more displacement: the wall to the right of the stairs. Select 
it, choose the Displace Elements tool, and move the wall away from the stairs just a bit 
(Figure 20.29).

840  | Chapter 20  Presenting Your Design   
	
11.	 With all the elements displaced for this view, we’re going to touch on one more 
tool. Highlight the first set of walls you displaced and select the Path tool from the 
Displacement Set panel. With this tool selected, click the lower portions of the walls you 
moved. It creates a dashed line or a “path” that the walls are pulled out upon. This will 
help to add visual clues to the view so you can see the origin point of specific elements. 
Do this for the other elements you’ve displaced (Figure 20.30).
Figure 20.29
Using the Path tool 
to trace the displaced 
elements to their 
origin points
Figure 20.30
Completing the 
displacement of 
elements
In addition to moving building elements along their logical displacement plane, you can 
move them in any other direction if it increases the clarity of your 3D presentation. The 
path will be jogged for elements that are displaced out of plane.

The Bottom Line |  841  
	
12.	 The final view with the paths and displaced elements will look like Figure 20.31.
Figure 20.31
The finished view
As with any other view in Revit, this view is parametric as well. Changes you make to elements 
within the model will update elements within this view and to the paths too.
If you now open the Default 3D view, you’ll see that the integrity of the model has not 
changed—all the building’s elements are exactly where you would expect them. You can even 
begin to experiment with making modifications to the walls you have displaced—add a door or 
a window and you can see that updated within the displaced view. You can quickly begin to see 
how useful this type of visualization can be!
The Bottom Line
Understand color fill legends.    Color fills are a great way to illustrate data that otherwise 
might appear only in a schedule, such as department assignment, designed areas, and room 
finishes.
Master It    There are a variety of ways to graphically display information using color 
fills. It can initially take a bit of time to get things organized, but once you create the 
legends, they can easily be transferred between views and projects. Describe how to  
add a color fill legend, once created, to your project template.

 Chapter  21 
 Computational Design 
with Dynamo   
 For a typical Revit user, the term  computational design can evoke visions of obscure tools used 
for advanced form-making. This preconceived notion has proven diffi cult to curtail, even as 
parametric modeling and design computation become more commonplace. New tools provid-
ing parametric design environments enable users to not only create unique geometry but also 
develop automated processes and sophisticated data manipulation techniques. 
 The application of computer programming in design and construction has given rise to archi-
tects and engineers extending the capabilities of “out-of-the-box” Revit software by developing 
custom tools with the Revit application programming interface (API). The results provide more 
fl exibility and expediency to the design process. Learning to code can be a diffi cult task, neces-
sitating the rise in use of visual programming as a vehicle for computational design. With this 
process, users can create algorithms and manipulate data graphically, rather than textually. 
 Visual programming is diagrammatic and easier to understand than code, with  nodes 
representing entities and  wires mapping out how nodes relate to each other. This is known as a 
data fl ow , and in most visual programming languages the fl ow of data occurs from left to right. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to:

 Getting Started with Dynamo 
 Dynamo is a visual programming interface plugin for Revit. It is also available as a stand-alone 
application known as Dynamo Studio. With Dynamo for Revit, users can create custom design 
and automation methods with node-based diagrams that instantly affect both project and 
family fi les. Geometry and data generated with Dynamo become fl exible; minor tweaks to a 
Dynamo defi nition fi le can deliver major results. Figure  21.1 shows an example of this.

Downloading Dynamo
Dynamo is an open source application. You can download the official released version of 
Dynamo from http://www.dynamobim.com. On the home page, browse to the dedicated 
download page and choose the latest version. Figure 21.2 shows the Dynamo BIM

Installation
Once Dynamo is downloaded, run the executable file to complete the installation if you’re plan-
ning to use the stand-alone version (Figure 21.3). Make sure Revit and any other applications 
are closed. During the installation you can customize the installed components, including what 
versions of Revit you want to add Dynamo to (if you want to install this for earlier versions 
of Revit). (In Revit 2017, Dynamo is installed automatically with Revit.) Make sure Dynamo 
Training Files is selected, as these are an invaluable learning resource.

Getting Started with Dynamo |  845  
Opening Dynamo
Once Dynamo is installed, open Revit to use the application. Dynamo will be available in 
the Manage tab of the ribbon. You might notice that Dynamo is grayed out initially. To open 
Dynamo, you must have a Revit project file or family file (typically a Conceptual Mass) open to 
connect to Dynamo. Dynamo will run only in the file in which it was opened. If you have mul-
tiple files open within Revit, make sure that the file you want to connect to Dynamo is the active 
window before clicking the Dynamo button.
Click the Dynamo button to start the application. It will open in a new window (Figure 21.4). 
To create a new Dynamo file, with the extension *.dyn, click the New icon on the Start Page. 
A Dynamo file is referred to as a definition and can be thought of as a dynamic diagram that 
performs a function or process.

Understanding the Dynamo UI
Although connected to a Revit file, Dynamo has its own user interface and window separate 
from the Revit window. Dynamo’s user interface is divided into four areas, as shown in  
Figure 21.5.
	
A.	 Toolbar
	
B.	 Node Library
	
C.	 Workspace
	
D.	 Execution Bar

Toolbar    Like most Windows-style software, the toolbar contains the basic application func-
tionality for managing files, selections, and settings. It includes drop-down menus as well 
as icons for quick access. Hovering over an icon will display its functionality and hotkey in a 
contextual box.
Node Library    The Node Library is a categorized repository for all available nodes. Nodes 
are objects within Dynamo that connect to form a routine or program and are connected 
with elements called wires. Wires are what visually demonstrate the flow of data between 
nodes. We’ll go into the parts of a node a bit later in this chapter.
The nodes are organized hierarchically within nested libraries based on how nodes relate to 
one another. You can browse the Node Library by clicking the menus and submenus until 

Understanding the Dynamo UI |  847  
you reveal a set of nodes and their descriptions. As an example, point-related nodes can be 
found in the Geometry menu and then the Point submenu (throughout this chapter we will 
use the convention Geometry ➢ Point to describe where to locate a specific node). Within the 
submenu, nodes are further categorized by color: green is Create, red is Action, and blue is 
Query. Hovering over a particular node will reveal a contextual box with the node descrip-
tion including necessary inputs for the node and what it will output when used properly. The 
search bar at the top of the Node Library palette can be used in lieu of browsing the library’s 
hierarchy to search for a specific node by name. Finally, clicking a node will place the node 
into the Graph View of the workspace.
Workspace    The workspace is where you interact with nodes and relationships while devel-
oping your Dynamo definition. The workspace is an area where two views are overlaid: the 
Graph View and a 3D Preview. The Graph View is the display of your Dynamo definition 
showing the mapping of the nodes and formulas; the 3D Preview is the display beyond the 
Graph View (in the background) and shows any geometry being created by your Dynamo 
definition. Both are rendered simultaneously.
As you create a Dynamo definition that includes geometry nodes, you will see a preview of 
the results, or an instantiation, not only within the workspace but also within the project or 
family environment. The preview geometry cannot be selected and should be thought of as a 
by-product of what you are creating in your definition. It is shown as a visual reference only.
It is important to note that your mouse will behave differently depending on whether the 
Graph View or 3D Preview is activated. Refer to Table 21.1 for mouse controls in each of these 
view types.

Toggling between the two views to control the extent and orientation of each view is possible 
by selecting the Toggle Preview icons at the top-right corner of the workspace, as shown in 
Figure 21.6 (A). Any geometry that is displayed in the 3D Preview is visible only within the 
workspace. Unless you have created a definition that converts Dynamo geometry into model 
geometry using particular Revit element nodes, you will be unable to see any geometry vis-
ible in the Revit project or family file you have connected to this Dynamo session. We suggest 
playing with the two different view types and the mouse controls. While it might not sound 
intuitive when reading the workflow, it functions fairly simply when you are in the Dynamo 
environment.

848  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Execution Bar    The Execution Bar is where you run the Dynamo definition or perform the 
process that you have laid out in the view. A new definition defaults to Automatic as a run 
style. This means that the definition is running automatically and updates immediately when 
it is modified. Automatic execution is appropriate for smaller and leaner Dynamo definitions. 
However, it can create performance issues when you are modifying larger definitions where 
small changes can take considerable time to update. If you notice a lag in performance or 
are working with large definitions, switch to Manual where the definition is processed only 
when the user chooses.
Connecting Nodes Makes Data Flow
Now that we have looked at the user interface, let’s take an in-depth look at a node’s structure 
and state and how you can create a visual program when connecting nodes with wires.
Node Structure
Dynamo nodes are the building blocks of a visual program. The flow of data within a node (and 
ultimately through the entire Dynamo definition) enters through the left and exits out the right 
side via ports. Nodes can store, analyze, and process both data as well as geometry; they can 
even report and access information that exists outside of the Dynamo environment. A node is 
broken down into five key parts, as shown in Figure 21.7.
A node consists of the following:
	
A.	 Node name: This is the common name of the node. The system of naming is Category.
NodeName. For example, you can define a point in space with Point.ByCoordinates. 
Throughout the chapter this convention will be used to define nodes.
	
B.	 Input ports: These are receiving locations for data from another node. You can hover over 
a port to see a contextual pop-up containing the type of data required. Some nodes do not

Also shown in Figure 21.6 are additional navigation tools. Dynamo definitions can become 
rather large, and at times you will want to zoom in or zoom out to work in greater detail or to 
see the overall workflow. From top to bottom in area B, these tools will allow you to zoom to 
fit, zoom in, zoom out, and pan within the view.

Connecting Nodes Makes Data Flow |  849  
have input ports, meaning that their primary function is either to act as an input for other 
nodes (for example, the Integer node) or to access and report information from the Revit 
file you have tethered to the Dynamo file (for example, the Wall Type node).
	
C.	 Output ports: These are transmitting locations to send data from the current node to 
the input port of another. Whatever the function of the node might be (whether you are 
creating a point or calculating the volume of a solid mass), you can supply the results 
further along the Dynamo definition. Some nodes do not have output ports, meaning that 
their primary function is to either display information from a preceding connected node 
(Watch) or perform a transaction (Excel.WriteToFile).
	
D.	 Node preview: This tool allows you to preview the resultant data from the node. You can 
hover over the icon to see a contextual pop-up of the data or click the icon to open and 
close a preview pane.
	
E.	 Lacing option: This tool illustrates the lacing option applied to the resultant data (more 
on lacing options later) and is relevant only when your node contains a list of data, which 
it often does.

Using Nodes
You can place a node into the workspace by browsing through the Node Library categories and 
clicking one of the node options available. The node will appear in the center of your workspace 
when selected. A node can be moved by simply selecting and dragging it to a new location.
Search Bar
Once you get a handle on the naming conventions of the Node Library, another method for 
node selection and workspace placement is to use the search bar available at the top of the 
Node Library palette. When nothing is selected in the Dynamo environment, the search 
bar is automatically active; simply typing at any point will begin a dynamic search. As you 
type, the Node Library will limit the available nodes based on what is being typed. Dynamo 
will try to predict the node you are searching for and highlight a node as you continue 
typing. If the highlighted node is the desired node, pressing Enter on your keyboard allows 
you to place it, as shown in Figure 21.8. Pressing Escape will clear the text in the search 
bar and restore all available nodes. If you are having trouble with the search bar being 
automatically active, press Escape prior to typing a search query.

850  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Connecting Nodes with Wires
Nodes are linked together using wires, a graphical representation denoting the flow of data 
within the Dynamo definition. To connect two nodes, left-click the output of one node (the right 
side of the node), then move the mouse to the inputs of another node (on the left side) until the 
intended input port highlights, and left-click again to complete the connection. A connected 
node will look like Figure 21.9. To disconnect, left-click the output port of your node and then 
again in an empty area in the workspace.

Connecting nodes
Node States
As shown in Figure 21.10, a node can have various visual states depending on how it is con-
nected to other nodes, whether the user is interacting with it, and whether the definition is valid. 
Here are some examples of node coloration:
	
A.	 Active: The node’s header is dark gray with all inputs connected and (when running 
automatically) the type of data is correct.
	
B.	 Idle: The node’s header is gray and disconnected from other nodes.
	
C.	 Warning: The node is yellow; it is in an error state because of the type of data being fed 
to it or the structure of the data it is attempting to interpret.

D.	 Selected: The node has a blue stroke around the perimeter. Any connected wires will 
also highlight as blue.

Organizing a Definition
As you develop a Dynamo definition, it can start to look a lot like spaghetti if you are not care-
ful. Organization and legibility are important, regardless of whether you are a beginner or an 
advanced user. There are many reasons why you would want to stay organized.
◆
◆
You are possibly sharing your definition with your colleagues.
◆
◆
Your definition is large and/or complex.
◆
◆
You are working on your definition intermittently and might not remember your line of 
thinking between opportunities to work on it.
◆
◆
You have realized you have made an error and need to go back through your definition and 
troubleshoot.
Fortunately, Dynamo includes some tools to help you with organizing your definition.
Notes    Notes are editable text fields you can add to your Dynamo definition, allowing you 
to add descriptions and characterize areas of your definition in plain language. To add a note 
to the workspace, select Edit in the toolbar and choose Create Note (or use Ctrl+W). You can 
move the note around with your mouse similar to how you do with a node. Double-clicking 
the note opens an Edit Text window.
Selection Alignment    Making your definition look neat and tidy by manually moving 
nodes with your mouse can be difficult, if not impossible. To align a set of nodes, drag-select 
them and right-click. In the context menu, choose Align Selection. There are a variety of 
alignments available including average and distribution options.
Grouping    Grouping is an effective way to organize your definition, allowing you to high-
light selections of nodes with color and annotate with text. To group a set of nodes, drag-
select them and right-click. In the context menu, select Create Group. A green rectangle will 
appear around your selected nodes. You can drag the group with your mouse similar to how 
you move a node and edit the group annotation by double-clicking the group. To change the 
group color or ungroup the selection, right-click the group and select the appropriate option.

852  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Using Visual Programming
With that background, let’s start programming! Once you have an understanding of the user 
interface and node structure, it is time to delve into visual programming by creating small 
snippets of Dynamo definitions. As you read through the exercises, use Dynamo to re-create 
the images shown in this section. Each aspect covered includes relevant material, advice, and 
where/how to find depicted nodes. You can also use the automatic search function within 
Dynamo to quickly find a node if you are familiar with the node name (in other words, the 
header text at the top of each node).
Before we begin, we have to delve into the two types of nodes we are going to use: input 
nodes and watch nodes.
Input Nodes    Input nodes are how a user can define values or parameters within a 
definition. There are a variety of different types of inputs.
◆
◆
Number and Integer: These nodes allow you to manually input a numeric value.
◆
◆
String: A string is another word for a series of characters or text. An example of a string 
could be “Room Name” or “Fire Rating.”
◆
◆
Number Slider and Integer Slider: These nodes are similar to Number and Integer but 
give you dynamic control of the output with a slider. By clicking the down arrow at the left 
of the node, you can reveal the default values controlling the slider granularity.
◆
◆
File and Directory Path: These nodes allow users to access and utilize files or directories 
available on the workstation.
Watch Nodes    Watch nodes are preview nodes. They serve a similar function to clicking the 
Node Preview button, but they create a continuous reveal that is useful for troubleshooting 
and data management. There are two types of watch nodes:
◆
◆
Watch: This node creates the standard data list preview.
◆
◆
Watch3D: This node creates geometric results, acting like a small workspace view. It 
might seem redundant at first glance, but if you are creating a definition with multiple 
geometric solutions, the overlap within the workspace can be illegible and cumbersome. 
You can hide a geometry’s preview in the workspace by right-clicking the node and 
selecting Preview.
In Figure 21.11, watch nodes surface solutions from data that has been both created and 
derived from manual inputs.
With an understanding of the node types, you’re ready to begin creating a Dynamo 
definition. This definition is going to start with a simple shape. Shapes can be points, curves, 
and surfaces. Let’s explore each type.
Points    Point nodes can be found by browsing Geometry ➢ Point in the Node Library. In 
Figure 21.12, two points are created using the Point.ByCoordinates(x,y,z)node. The 
coordinates for the first point are defined by Number nodes, while the second point is defined 
by an Integer Slider node. Both points require user input for their coordinate values. Note 
the point in the lower right of Figure 21.12.

Using Visual Programming |  853  
Figure 21.11
Input nodes and 
watch nodes

to create a point
To create a point, simply drop in the following nodes:
◆
◆
Number (you’ll need two instances of this)
◆
◆
Integer Slider
◆
◆
Point.byCoordinates node
Once the nodes are placed, connect them, mimicking Figure 21.12. With the Execution 
Bar set to Automatic, modify the Number node values, and slide the arrow on the Integer 
Slider. You should see the location of the points update in the 3D Preview beneath the 
Graph View.
Curves    By browsing for Geometry in the Node Library, you can find a number of categories 
corresponding to types of curves such as Line, Curve, and NURBS Curve. In Figure 21.13, a 
Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node is used to create a curve with two point nodes as inputs. 
We can use this to create a curve attached to our point.

854  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Figure 21.13
Creating a curve by 
start point and end 
point
	
1.	 Start by detaching the Integer Slider node. You are going to use a similar tool, the 
Number Slider (shown in Figure 21.14), in the following steps. This slider allows you a 
higher level of granularity but works effectively the same way as the Integer Slider. 
After you detach the Integer Slider, connect the NumberSlider following the same 
layout (Figure 21.14).
Figure 21.14
Creating a surface by 
extruding a curve
	
2.	 Add another Point.ByCoordinates node and connect them as shown in Figure 21.13. Set 
your first Number node to zero and connect it to the X and Z connections on the first Point
.ByCoordinates node and to the Y on the second Point.ByCoordinates node. Set the second 
Number node to 5 and connect it to the remaining Y and X and Z connections.
	
3.	 Add a Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node. Connect the Point connections from the 
Point.ByCoordinates nodes to the startPoint and endPoint connections of the new node.
	
4.	 Add a new NumberSlider node and a Curve.PointAtParameter node.

Using Visual Programming |  855  
	
5.	 Connect the Line connection from the Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node to the Curve 
connection in the Curve.PointAtParameter node. Finally, connect the NumberSlider 
output to the Param connection of the Curve.PointAtParameter node.
Now, by changing the values of the Number node or the slider, you can change the location of 
the point on the line or the line’s start and end points.
Surfaces    Now that you have created a point and a curve, you can use what you have to create 
a surface. There are a number of surface categories to browse under the Geometry heading of 
the Node Library such as Surface, Sphere, and Polysurface. There are also surface nodes that 
are “hidden” within other categories. To continue this exercise, you are going to use the Line
.ByStartPointEndPoint from the previous example (Figure 21.13). You will create an extruded 
surface using a Curve.Extrude node, which can be found under Geometry ➢ Curve. Notice 
how the extrusion of the curve is controlled with the NumberSlider nodes in this example.
	
1.	 This example will get a bit more complex. Start by removing the NumberSlider and 
Curve.PointAtParameter nodes. You are going to connect a few additional nodes 
between your original content and the sliders.
The Value of Computational Programming
Seems like a lot of work for a line, right? Remember, one of the benefits of visual programming is 
the ability to rapidly change the output based on a string of values. As you become more practiced 
with Dynamo, you can use definitions like this to feed geometry within families and rapidly change 
a building’s façade design or other aspects of the form.

2.	 Add Vector.YAxis, Number, and Curve.Extrude nodes (shown in the green box in 
Figure 21.14). With those nodes added, do the following:
◆
◆
Connect the output of Line.ByStartPointEndPoint to the Curve input of 
CurveExtrude.
◆
◆
Connect the Vector output of Vector.YAxis to the Direction input of CurveExtrude.
◆
◆
Connect the output of the Number node to the Distance input of CurveExtrude.
◆
◆
Give the Number node a value of 10.
	
3.	 Add two NumberSlider nodes and a Surface.PointAtParameter node, as shown in the 
blue area of Figure 21.14. With those nodes added, connect the following:
◆
◆
The output of first NumberSlider to the U input of Surface.PointAtParameter
◆
◆
The output of the second NumberSlider to the V input of Surface.
PointAtParameter
◆
◆
The output of the CurveExtrude node to the Surface input of Surface.PointAtParameter
Now, by changing the sliders, you can update the curve and the surface! As we’ve demon-
strated in this basic example, once your definition is created, it can be a simple matter to use the 
definition to manipulate forms. Next, you’ll look at some advanced elements in Dynamo.
Additional Dynamo Tools
Now that you have stepped through some basic examples of using Dynamo to create points, 
lines, and surfaces, you can learn how those tools can be leveraged for more complex shapes. 
In this section, you’ll explore some additional tools and see how they can be leveraged to create 
more robust Dynamo definitions. Because providing exercises to fully explain all the aspects of 
Dynamo could easily fill an entire book, the following content will simply explain the concepts 
and refrain from more step-by-step examples.
Code Blocks
Code Blocks are nodes that you can use to define a snippet of DesignScript, a simple pro-
gramming language developed by Autodesk. DesignScript is a programming language 
available in many Autodesk tools such as AutoCAD that allows for more robust control of 
parametric content. You can create a Code Block by searching for it in the Node Library or 
just double-clicking an empty area in the workspace. The basic structure of DesignScript 
works by creating a line of code followed by a semicolon, as shown in Figure 21.15. Code 
Blocks can come in handy in a variety of ways. The following are two commonly used Code 
Block functions:
◆
◆
Creating inputs: A Code Block can be used in lieu of inputs. Simply typing a numeric 
value followed by a semicolon will create an output. Multiple outputs can be created using 
the same node.
◆
◆
Creating expressions: Adding an expression with variables will reveal inputs. This mini-
mizes the need for additional nodes for mathematical equations that can make a definition 
bulky and difficult to follow.

creating inputs and 
expressions

Managing Data
Situations will arise using Dynamo where you will create data flows that are collections of 
items, and in some cases, they are associated with other collections. Any data flow containing 
multiple items is known as a list (sometimes described as an array). List nodes can be found 
under Core ➢ List. Understanding the principles of data management in Dynamo is critical for 
successfully developing useful definitions. Take some time to peruse and experiment with all 
the various list nodes available. Each of the images accompanying the following topics can be 
used to practice the concept and replicate the Dynamo definition.
Simple Lists
A simple list is a line of items, as shown in Figure 21.16. A List.Sequence node has been used 
to create the list 1, 2, 3…. Let’s examine Figure 21.16 more closely. In the first Watch node, you 
will notice that each item in the list has an index value in brackets signifying its location in the 
list. Index values are integers and begin with the value [0]. To select an item from a list, you have 
to use its index value. In the second half of the definition, items [0] and [3] have been singled out 
using List.GetItemAtIndex.
Figure 21.16
Creating a simple list 
and retrieving items

858  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Complex Lists
A complex list has more than one dimension, often referred to as a list of lists or a multidimen-
sional array. In Figure 21.17, a complex list is generated from a simple list using List.Chop. The 
result is a list of five sublists, each containing two values. Using List.GetItemAtIndex will 
single out an item of the highest order, as shown in the Watch node. It can then be used again to 
single out a particular value.
Figure 21.17
Creating a complex list 
and retrieving items
Structuring Lists
Certain nodes require list inputs. For example, the Curve.ByPoints node has one input port, 
“curves.” A simple list of points will produce a single curve. To create multiple curves, you must 
break up the list supplied into sublists. By organizing data correctly, a single node can have a 
robust output. In Figure 21.18, we use the List.Create and List.Transpose nodes to reorga-
nize point data. Code Block nodes, in the blue field, are used to reduce the size of the definition 
for clarity. You can also use Code Blocks to create lists. As you can see, 0..6..1; creates a list 
from 0 to 6 with a step of 1.

restructuring 
complex lists

Additional Dynamo Tools |  859  
Lacing
Lacing is another word for data matching, or the method in which a Dynamo node interprets 
and associates differently sized inputs. There are three methods available, each one producing 
different results. To modify the lacing method of a node, right-click the lacing icon on the lower-
right corner of the node. In the cascading menu, hover over lacing and make a selection. The fol-
lowing lacing methods are illustrated using points and lines to establish their behavior:
Shortest List    The default lacing option for Dynamo is Shortest List, as shown in 
Figure 21.19. For each list, associate each corresponding list item until there are no more items 
in one list.
Figure 21.19
Using the Shortest 
List algorithm
Longest List    Figure 21.20 shows the longest list lacing option. For each list, associate each 
corresponding list item, duplicating the last item in the shorter list until there are no more 
items in either list.
Figure 21.20
Using the Longest 
List algorithm

860  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Cross Product    As shown in Figure 21.21, the cross product lacing option makes all possible 
connections. For each list, associate each list item with every other item in the corresponding 
list.
Figure 21.21
Using the Cross 
Product algorithm
Changing a lacing method (particularly to cross product) on a large definition can gener-
ate a massive increase in node solutions, leading to performance issues and the possibility of 
Dynamo freezing and not responding. It is good practice to save your file first, disconnect any 
subsequent nodes before switching lacing methods, and then use a Watch node to best ensure 
the intended outcome.
Geometric Manipulation and Analysis
Beyond the creation of geometry, nodes can also manipulate existing geometry or perform anal-
ysis against an existing model. In this section, we’ll explore some of the node types that allow 
those functions.
Vectors
A vector is a quantity that has a direction and magnitude. The input of a vector is similar to 
that of a point (x,y,z), but the node calculates the relative difference between the origin, in 
this case (0,0,0), and the coordinate input. Vector-related nodes can be found by browsing 
Geometry ➢ Vector in the Node Library. In Figure 21.22, a Points.ByCoordinates node is 
used to define the direction of a line using the Line.ByStartPointDirectionLength node. 
The YAxis node is also a vector and was used in the preceding surface example to define the 
direction of an extrusion.

Additional Dynamo Tools |  861  
Coordinate Systems
Coordinate systems are two-dimensional abstract planes, similar to construction planes in CAD 
software, and are used to create local coordinates for evaluating existing geometric conditions 
and creating new ones. Coordinate system nodes can be found by browsing Geometry ➢ Vector or 
Geometry ➢ Plane in the Node Library. In Figure 21.23, a Surface.CoordinateSystemAtParameter 
node was used to locate a coordinate system on a surface at (U:0.5, V:0.5).

signify a curve’s 
direction

Placing a coordinate 
system onto a surface
Geometric Transformations
A transformation is a general term for methods used to manipulate the orientation, size, and 
location of a shape. Common transformations are translate (move), scale, rotate, and reflect. 

862  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Figure 21.24 shows two of these transformations. Vectors and coordinate systems are critical for 
defining a transformation.
Figure 21.24

Revit to Dynamo to Revit
The real utility of Dynamo lies in its connection to Revit, enhancing the design process by com-
bining design computation with a robust building information database. Information from a 
Revit project or family file can be ported into Dynamo, provided that you opened the Dynamo 
session when your existing file was open. If you have multiple files open, make sure that the 
active window belongs to the appropriate file before clicking Dynamo. Revit-related nodes are 
found in their own menu within the Node Library.
Category, Type, and Element Selections
Controlling the quality of a Revit project file through auditing and en masse model changes are 
two prospects ripe with manual technical solutions, plug-ins, and workarounds developed over 
the years. Dynamo’s suite of Revit selection nodes, found by browsing for Revit ➢ Selection 
and for Revit ➢ Element within the Node Library, can help you develop your own dynamic 
solutions. There are two general types of nodes that when used together can query and select 
elements in a Revit file: menu selection nodes and All Elements nodes.
◆
◆
Menu selection nodes are more difficult to find because they do not have a standard nam-
ing convention, but they all share two common features: no input ports and an embedded 
drop-down menu. These nodes can give you access to Revit categories and types. There is 
also the Element Types node, a node where the term element is used broadly to describe 
nearly anything in Revit, from sun settings to voltage types to phase filters.
◆
◆
All Elements nodes select all the elements in a project based on a particular qualification, 
usually one of the tiers within the Revit hierarchy (Category ➢ Family ➢ Type ➢ Instance).

Additional Dynamo Tools |  863  
Auditing a Revit Project
Figure 21.25 shows two project file audits being performed. Using the Categories and Element 
Types nodes connected to All Elements nodes, you can identify all walls that have been placed in 
the model as well as all wall types that are available to place. An extra node, Element.Parameters, 
shows the wall type properties as a series of sublists corresponding to the order of the list of wall 
types.
Figure 21.25
Auditing wall types 
and walls placed
Placing Revit Families
In addition to auditing, you can use menu selection and All Elements nodes to help place Revit 
families. In Figure 21.26, a Dynamo definition creates a series of floors. All elements of category 
Levels are retrieved from the model. The level elevations are used to define a series of points. 
These points define planes where a rectangle is placed. A Floor.ByOutlineTypeandLevel node 
uses a “longest list” lacing option to combine the outlines, floor type, and levels to create a series 
of floor elements in the project.
Figure 21.26

a series of floors

864  | Chapter 21  Computational Design with Dynamo    
Manual Selections
There are a variety of manual selection nodes available in Revit ➢ Selection (or you can type 
select in the search bar). These are point-click nodes that allow you to select model elements as 
well as parts of model elements. These nodes tend to be more useful in Conceptual Mass fami-
lies than project files. Once selected, the element is visible in the workspace 3D Preview. The 
node is now dynamically linked to the object, recognizing any modifications that might occur in 
the Revit file and displaying the element ID below the select button, as shown in Figure 21.27.
Figure 21.27
Selecting faces of a 
conceptual mass
Interoperability
There is an entire ecosystem of software being used by architects and engineers during 
the design process. Each particular platform in that ecosystem has its own file formats and 
protocols. Moving from one file format to the next can result in both data loss and geometric 
“impurity.” Interoperability, a term heard often when discussing BIM processes and workflows, 
is a property of one piece of software that enables it to work with another. More generally, the 
term has come to mean the ability to send and receive data seamlessly.
Using database formats like spreadsheets is a pragmatic (and democratic) solution to the 
problem of interoperability. If you can convert design data into a tabular form, Dynamo proves 
quite useful. Dynamo has the ability to read and write in both Microsoft Excel and CSV formats. 
The Excel nodes, Excel.ReadFromFile and Excel.WriteToFile, can be found in their own 
menu named Office. CSV nodes can be located in the BuiltIn and Core menus. Using either 
format will require File Path inputs.
Excel to Revit
An Excel spreadsheet can be used to create a set of points. File.Path and File.FromPath 
are used to convert the browsed path to an input for Excel.ReadFromFile, as shown in 
Figure 21.28. A String input is used to locate the correct sheet in Excel. Keep in mind, strings 
are case sensitive. If you are having trouble accessing the data from a spreadsheet, check to make 
sure your sheet name is correct.

Additional Dynamo Tools |  865  
The original data is three columns corresponding to x, y, and z values. As you can see in the 
output of the Excel.ReadFromFile node, Dynamo understands the data in a way that might 
seem unconventional at first. The highest-order list defines a row, and the three items in that list 
define the three columns. Each list could be considered a point, in effect, but Point
.ByCoordinates requires three inputs. The List.Transpose node is used to transpose the data, 
similar to transposing a spreadsheet (swapping columns and rows). Once transposed, there 
are three lists each with all values x, y, or z. A Code Block is used in lieu of List.GetItems to 
quickly create three outputs that can be used to create the point geometry.
Revit to Excel
Data can just as easily be sent to Excel from Revit (via Dynamo). In Figure 21.29, room data is 
retrieved from a project file and exported to a newly created Excel file. The resultant spread-
sheets were added to emphasize the connections in Figure 21.29. Using selection nodes, all  
elements of category Room are retrieved, and room parameters are obtained using Element
.GetParameterValueByName. The room names and areas are then combined into a List.Create 
node. If the data was placed into Excel.WriteToFile at this point, the result would be 14 col-
umns of data including one row of room names and one row of room areas. By transposing the 
data before writing to Excel, you can create a more conventional spreadsheet.
Package Manager
The Dynamo Node Library is extensive and built for a variety of applications across a range 
of industries, but there is always missing functionality or modifications to existing nodes that 
might pique a user’s interest. Dynamo is open source and welcomes community involvement. 
The package manager is a portal for Dynamo users to develop and publish additions to the 
Node Library to extend Dynamo’s core functionality.
Packages are available to download in the Online Package Search by choosing Search for a 
Package in the toolbar. The list might take a few moments to load. Packages can include a suite

of nodes or be an individual node. You can browse existing packages or search using the search 
bar at the top of the window. Similar to the Node Library, searching will limit the results related 
to what you type.

To install a package, select the download icon and voilà! At the bottom of the Online Package 
Search window, the downloaded package is highlighted in cyan. The location of the new node(s) 
depends on how the developer has structured the package. In some cases, installing a new pack-
age might create an additional menu in your Node Library; in others, it might be blended to fit 
within the library. Use the search bar if you are unsure where an installed package has been 
located.

Sample definitions are included during installation; you can access them in the Dynamo tool-
bar under Help ➢ Samples. Learning Dynamo can be both rewarding and arduous, but you 
are not alone! The community of Dynamo users is continuously growing. At DynamoBIM 
(www.dynamobim.org) you can find additional tutorials, forums, user galleries, and a blog. 
A simple online search query for help with a Dynamo issue can yield many results, but it is 
important to realize that Dynamo is (currently) a perpetual beta software that has undergone 
many changes since 2011. Online search results that are more than a year old can yield obso-
lete solutions.
The Bottom Line
Get started with Autodesk Dynamo.    Dynamo is a visual programming interface that runs 
parallel with Revit and allows you the ability to code forms and shapes within your Revit 
environment. Dynamo creates definitions by connecting nodes with wires to convey data.
Master It    There are five parts to a node. What are they, and what do they do?

The Bottom Line |  867  
Understand the Dynamo UI.    Dynamo has a simple, straightforward UI. Becoming com-
fortable with the parts of the user interface can allow you more flexibility and lower frustra-
tion when learning the application, either as a novice or on your road to an expert.
Master It    What are the four primary sections of the user interface?
Connect nodes to make data flow.    Connecting nodes is the true power behind Dynamo. 
The connections visually and programmatically show data flow and the path of information 
from beginning to end to create the form, run the analysis, or provide whatever is the desired 
output. Understanding the basics of connecting nodes is the first step to creating your own 
Dynamo definition.
Master It    Describe the workflow to create a series of nodes and connect them properly.
Use additional Dynamo tools.    While Dynamo is a robust programming application, there 
are additional tools you can use to further leverage its capabilities.
Master It    Describe some of the tools external to Dynamo and how they can be used to 
push the capabilities of the application even further.

 Appendix A 
 Th e Bottom Line  
 Chapter  1 : introduction: Th e principles of BiM 
Focus your investment in BIM.  Since using Revit software is a change in workfl ow, it is also 
important to understand the change in staffi ng and who is needed to perform what roles on a 
project. 
Master It  What are the three primary roles in a Revit project, and what are the respon-
sibilities of those roles? 
Solution  Every successful Revit project will need three roles accounted for. These roles 
do not need to be individual people; one person can assume all three roles at any point in 
the project. The roles are architect, modeler, and drafter. These roles are responsible for 
understanding and articulating the design, creating model content, and laying out and 
annotating the documentation, respectively. 
Understand a BIM workfl ow.  Understand how projects are completed in BIM and how the 
use of Revit software on a project can change how information within a project is created. 
Master It  Explain one of the primary differences between a more traditional 2D 
 CAD-based workfl ow and producing documents using Revit. 
Solution  In a 2D CAD-based workfl ow, documents are created by team members 
by creating plans, sections, elevations, and details, all as separate drawings, and then 
 manually coordinating that content for the project set. In a BIM or Revit workfl ow, the 
plans, sections, elevations, and perspectives are a by-product of creating the virtual 
building model and are coordinated through updates made to the model itself. 
Leverage BIM processes.  Understanding the level of risk your fi rm is willing to take in 
new technologies will help you establish goals for your future use of BIM. 
Master It  Using the three areas of fi rm integration (visualization, analysis, and 
 strategy), defi ne how those areas overlap for your fi rm or project. 
Solution  Remember, there is no wrong answer in mapping a path forward for your fi rm 
or project. The important thing is to identify which areas are critical to the workfl ow of 
your fi rm to help you focus your future efforts. 
 Chapter  2 : Applying the principles of the User interface 
and project Organization 
Understand the user interface.  In addition to understanding how your project is 
 organized, to use the Revit software well you must understand how the UI is organized. 
Once you grasp both of these concepts, you will be ready to move ahead. 

872  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Master It    The “big” areas of the UI are the ribbon, the Properties palette, the Project 
Browser, and the drawing area. How do these areas work together, and what tabs corre-
spond to an iterative design process?
Solution    The Architecture tab is where you’ll turn in your early design process because 
it contains datum objects, system families, component families, and spaces. As the design 
­develops, you’ll establish your views from the View tab. When you start to get into docu-
mentation, you’ll work from the Annotate tab. Having panels from the Modify tab pulled off 
and close at hand will keep you from having to go between one contextual tab and another.
Understand project organization.    The compelling advantage of being able to design, 
­document, and manage your project across multiple disciplines—the architectural, 
­structural, and mechanical disciplines—is something that you can do only in Revit, and 
understanding project workflow is key to getting off on the right foot.
Master It    Thinking back to the Revit organizational chart shown in Figure 2.21, what 
are the main components of a Revit project, and how can you apply them to your design 
process? How do these categories directly affect your design workflow?
Solution    The top-level categories of a Revit project are datum, content, views, and man-
agement. They correspond to the design process of maintaining relationships, repetition, 
representations, and restrictions. Keep these corollaries in mind as you move sequentially 
from schematic design, design development, construction documentation, and construc-
tion management.
Chapter 3: The Basics of the Toolbox
Select, modify, and replace elements.    Many fundamental interactions are supported by 
Revit software to select just what you need and to modify elements efficiently.
Master It    How can you quickly select only the door tags in a plan view and switch 
them to another type?
Solution    First, window-select the entire plan. Then, using the Filter tool in the Modify 
tab of the ribbon, select only the Door Tags category, close the Filter dialog box, and 
change the type in the Properties palette.
Edit elements interactively.    The editing tools in Revit are similar to those found in other 
CAD and BIM software programs. Tools such as Move, Copy, and Trim are available on the 
Modify tab of the ribbon.
Master It    How do you create a parametric repetition of an element?
Solution    Select an element and activate the Array tool from the Modify tab of the 
­ribbon. Specify a linear array with the Group And Associate option, and choose either 
Move To 2nd for specific element spacing or Move To Last for consistent overall length 
with varied element spacing.
Use other editing tools.    Beyond the basic editing tools are more advanced commands to 
help you consistently and intelligently populate a building model with content.
Master It    How do you copy model elements in the same location for a multistory 
building?

Chapter 4: Configuring Templates and Standards |  873  
Solution    Select the required elements and copy them to the Clipboard (Ctrl+C). From 
the Clipboard panel in the Modify tab, select Paste Aligned To Selected Levels, and then 
choose the levels to which you’d like to paste the copied content.
Create site context for your project.    The site tools allow you to create context for your 
­building models, including topographic surfaces, graded regions, and property lines.
Master It    Describe the different methods used to create a topographic surface.
Solution    A topographic surface can be created by placing points at specific eleva-
tions relative to internal project coordinates, by using an imported 3D CAD file from a 
civil engineering software program, or by using a text file that contains the x-, y-, and 
­z-coordinates of a field of points.
Chapter 4: Configuring Templates and Standards
Define settings for graphic quality and consistency.    The fundamental building blocks for 
any template are the customized settings for object styles, line styles, fill patterns, materials, 
and more.
Master It    How can a complex custom-fill pattern be imported?
Solution    Use a text-editing application to create a custom pattern or copy a pattern 
from another application. Be sure to add lines to the pattern definition that describe 
the units and pattern type. In the New Pattern dialog box, choose Custom and click the 
Import button to select your custom pattern file. Adjust the pattern as necessary for the 
desired result.
Organize views for maximum efficiency.    The project template can be used to capture a 
framework supporting your visual and organizational standards.
Master It    How can you customize the Project Browser to support your business 
needs?
Solution    Filtering folders based on view types and documentation helps team members 
quickly find what they’re looking for in a project. Your project template can also ­exclude 
views that are not needed based on a specific task. For example, if you’re in ­design 
development, you can exclude previous views and sheets that were part of a ­previous 
schematic design stage.
Create custom annotation families.    Developing a graphic style to match your standards 
will usually require you to edit some annotation families or create them from scratch.
Master It    Can a single label display more than one parameter? How are custom view 
tags loaded into a project?
Solution    A single label can show more than one parameter—and even custom param-
eters. Just remember to place the label with the Label tool. Assign the label to report the 
desired parameters.
Start a project with a custom template.    Making your custom template available for new 
projects ensures that all future projects will maintain the same level of graphic quality and 
efficiency you expect.

874  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Master It    How do you set your own custom project template to be the default for new 
projects?
Solution    Click the Application button, select the Options button, and navigate to the 
File Locations tab. Click the Browse button for the Default Template File field, and navi-
gate to the location of your custom project template. From now on, click the Application 
button, select New Project, and select New in the Recent Files window—or press 
Ctrl+N—to use your new template as the basis for the new project.
Develop a template management strategy.    Organizing your standards, content, and set-
tings while using Revit tools to transfer content will make your effort more efficient.
Master It    How do you insert your standard details from one Revit project to another? 
How do you transfer settings such as materials?
Solution    2D content such as standard details can be stored in separate Revit project files 
and loaded when needed. One way to do this is with the Insert Views From File tool in 
the Insert tab. Select an RVT project file, and then choose eligible views such as drafting 
views, sheets, or schedules. They are transferred into your active project with all associ-
ated parameters. To transfer settings and styles such as materials, select the Manage tab 
and click Transfer Project Standards. Remember to open another project from which 
you’d like to transfer settings before running this tool.
Chapter 5: Working in a Team
Understand key worksharing concepts.    Once the team has created local files, it is neces-
sary to understand how to keep both the local files and the central file up to date as changes 
occur on the project. Doing so ensures that everyone is working from an updated and recent 
copy of the model at all times.
Master It    Once you have begun working in your local file, how do you publish your 
changes to the central file? How do you download changes from the central file to your 
local file?
Solution    The easiest way to do this is by using the Synchronize With Central command, 
which is accessible from the Collaborate tab and also from the Quick Access toolbar. To 
download changes from others without uploading your latest work, use the Reload Latest 
(RL) command.
Enable worksharing on your project.    Knowing how to activate and use worksharing is 
indispensable to working in a team environment using Revit.
Master It    How do you transition a single-user Revit file to a multiuser environment us-
ing worksharing?
Solution    To activate worksharing, click the Worksets button on the Collaborate tab. 
This will initiate the worksharing feature and divide your model into the two default 
worksets. To allow others to access the model, you will need to choose File Save As 
and save the file to a network location. After this, close the file. Each team member 
then makes a local copy of this network file and works exclusively within his or her 
local copy.

Chapter 6: Working with Consultants |  875  
Organize worksets in your model.    There is no single rule for organizing worksets in your 
project models; however, they can be used to your team’s advantage. You can use worksets to 
better organize larger projects and for additional visibility control.
Master It    How do you assign objects to worksets? How do you change an object’s work-
set assignment?
Solution    As model elements are added to a project, they are assigned to the active 
workset selected by the user. The active workset is visible either in the Collaborate tab 
in the ribbon or in the status bar. An object’s workset assignment can be changed in the 
Properties palette at any time.
Manage workflow with worksharing.    Once the central file has been created, you will need 
to organize and structure the model into logical worksets to maintain workflow with Revit.
Master It    How do worksets differ from layers in 2D CAD? What are some logical ways 
to create worksets within a model?
Solution    2D CAD layers were logically divided around individual elements in isolated 
files. In Revit, because everything is in one file and you are working with 3D objects, not 
just model lines, you need to use worksets to divide the building in different ways. Some 
logical workset divisions would be Shell And Core, Interiors, FF&E, and Site.
Understand element ownership in worksets.    Editing elements in a central file means you 
have sole ownership over further changes to those elements. Understanding the permissions 
is critical to working in a team.
Master It    How do you edit an element in the model if someone has already taken own-
ership of it in a worksharing environment?
Solution    Trying to edit the element initiates a request for permissions in Revit. When 
you alert the other team member of your desire to have ownership of this element, that 
person can grant your permission request using the Editing Requests button on the 
Collaborate tab.
Collaborate in the cloud.    Not all of your team members will be Revit-savvy and know 
how to use the tools. In addition, not everyone on the team will have a copy of Revit, but you 
might still need their input and comments on the design. Learning to leverage complemen-
tary tools to Revit is critical to keeping a project moving smoothly.
Master It    How do you use the cloud to get feedback from non-Revit users on a project team?
Solution    Create a series of views in your project, making sure to name them in a way 
that is easy for other team members to understand. These views can be plans, sections, 
elevations, or 3D views. Share the Revit model with team members using http://­360
.autodesk.com. The site will allow them to browse the views and add comments.
Chapter 6: Working with Consultants
Prepare for interdisciplinary collaboration.    Proper planning and communication are the 
foundation of effective collaboration. Although only some client organizations may require a 
BIM planning document, it is a recommended strategy for all design teams.

876  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Master It    What are the key elements of a BIM execution plan?
Solution    An effective BIM execution plan will first list the goals and uses of building 
information modeling as well as the scope of the data to be developed. It will also list the 
software platforms to be used, information exchange process, delivery strategy, and tech-
nology infrastructure.
Collaborate using linked Revit models.    The most basic tool for collaboration is the ability 
to view consultants’ data directly within the context of your own model. Project files from 
other disciplines can be linked and displayed with predictable visual fidelity without com-
plex conversion processes.
Master It    How can worksharing complement the use of linked Revit models?
Solution    Placing each linked model on a unique workset allows team members to 
choose when to load or unload the linked models without affecting their teammates. 
Worksets within linked models can also help you manage graphic quality using the 
­ability to load or unload worksets globally.
Use Copy/Monitor between linked models.    The Coordination Monitor tools establish 
intelligent bonds between elements in a host file and correlating elements in a linked model. 
They also support a workflow that respects the needs of discrete teams developing their own 
data, perhaps on a different schedule than that of other team members.
Master It    How can grids in two different Revit projects be related?
Solution    The Copy/Monitor tool allows you to copy elements such as grids from a 
linked file into a host file and monitor the linked element for changes.
Run interference checks.    Interference checking—also known as clash detection—is one of the 
most important components of building information modeling. It is the essence of virtual con-
struction and has the greatest potential for cost savings during the physical construction process.
Master It    How do you find interfering objects between two linked Revit models?
Solution    On the Collaborate tab, locate the Coordinate panel and choose Interference 
Check Run Interference Check. If you are using linked models, select the desired linked 
project in the Categories From drop-down list while keeping the other column set to 
Current Project. Select the desired object categories in the left and right columns (for 
example, choose Structural Framing from a structural model and Ducts from an MEP 
model). Click OK to run the check. The results can be exported to a report for coordina-
tion with others.
Chapter 7: Interoperability: Working Multiplatform
Use imported 2D CAD data.    CAD data can be integrated into your Revit project in a num-
ber of ways: as plans of existing conditions, as fixture layouts from consultants, or as stan-
dard details from your company’s library.
Master It    How can CAD details be used in a Revit project?
Solution    Create a new drafting view for a single detail. From the Insert tab, choose Link 
CAD and select a DWG detail file. During linking, set the colors to Black And White. 

Chapter 8: Advanced Modeling and Massing |  877  
Make sure the scale of the drafting view matches the notation scale of the CAD detail. 
Use the Query tool to turn off unwanted layers within the linked file.
Export 2D CAD data.    The ability to deliver quality 2D information to other ­constituents 
involved in your project is as important as importing it into the Revit environment. 
Appropriately formatted views, standardized layer templates, and proper coordinate settings 
will result in happy team members and a smooth coordination process.
Master It    Does Revit software comply with the National CAD Standard?
Solution    Yes, you have the ability to map Revit model categories to standardized layers 
in the Export Layers dialog box. Access this tool by clicking the Application menu and 
selecting Export Options Export Layers DWG/DXF. Load industry-standard layer  
conventions using the Standard button.
Use imported 3D model data.    Model data generated outside of the Revit environment can be 
integrated into your projects as whole-building systems, massing studies, or unique components.
Master It    How can a building’s structural model created with the Bentley Structure be 
integrated into a Revit project?
Solution    Create a structural framing family into which the DGN model will be 
­inserted. When the family is finished, the DGN geometry will be displayed as any other 
Revit structural-framing component.
Export 3D model data.    Your modeled elements don’t have to remain in the Revit environ-
ment forever. Data can be exported to 3ds Max, SketchUp, AutoCAD MEP, and more.
Master It    How can you coordinate your architectural Revit model with an engineer 
­using AutoCAD MEP?
Solution    The engineer will likely require one DWG model per level for efficient coordi-
nation. Create duplicate floor plans for exporting and adjust the View Range settings for 
Top to Level Above, Offset: 0 and Bottom to Associated Level, Offset: 0. Create duplicate 
3D views for each level, right-click the ViewCube®, choose Orient To View Floor Plans, 
and find the corresponding floor plans. These 3D views can be batch-exported to DWG 
format and referenced by the MEP engineer in the designs.
Work with IFC imports and exports.    Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is a vendor-
neutral model format designed to support interoperability in the AEC industry. It is widely 
used by some major BIM platforms available around the world.
Master It    How is an IFC model integrated into a Revit project for coordination?
Solution    You can open an IFC file by clicking the Application menu and selecting Open 
IFC. Once the file is open, the data can be saved as an RVT Revit project file and linked 
into another Revit file for continued coordination.
Chapter 8: Advanced Modeling and Massing
Create and schedule massing studies.    Starting the design process with actual building 
­elements can lead to a lot of unexpected frustration. Walls lead to rooms, which get room 
tags and eventually scheduled. But if you’ve failed to fulfill the client’s program, you’ll 
­wonder where to start over!

878  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Master It    You’re faced with creating some design studies of a large hospital complex. 
How would you go about creating a Revit project that would allow you to create a 
­massing study and schedule it against the design client’s program?
Solution    Massing studies allow you to create schedules of the surface, floor areas, and 
volumes of a mass. This is incredibly helpful for resolving the design intent and client’s 
program before committing to walls, floors, and other building geometry.
Know when to use solid and surface masses.    Solid masses and surface masses can both be 
used to maintain relationships to host geometry like walls and roofs, but surface masses can’t 
be volumetrically scheduled or contain floor area faces.
Master It    You’ve been asked to create a complex canopy system for the entry to a hotel 
project. The system will consist of a complex wave of triangular panels. What kind of 
mass would you create?
Solution    You’re probably going to be better off not creating a solid mass because you 
don’t need a solid—you need only a surface. It’s best to use solids when you have to 
calculate the client’s overall design program: floor areas, surface, and volume. For lim-
ited, surface-based relationships, just use surface massing. Surface masses will help you 
resolve the overall design idea first. Then you can move on to patterns and eventually 
component-level geometry.
Use mathematical formulas for massing.    Not all massing is going to involve intui-
tive, ­in-the-moment decision making. By discovering the underlying rules that express 
a form, you can create the formulas that can iterate and manipulate your massing study. 
So rather than manually manipulating the mass, you manipulate the formulas related to 
your mass.
Master It    What’s the best way to discover and create these formulas?
Solution    Never stop sketching! Staring at a blank spreadsheet is a one-way road to 
frustration. Sketch the idea and try to discern the rules that make the form change and 
morph into your design idea. Once you think you’ve discovered the rules that contain the 
idea, start testing the rules. Once you find that the idea or principle is valid, it’s simply a 
matter of scale.
Chapter 9: Conceptual Design and Design Analysis
Embrace energy analysis concepts.    Understanding the concepts behind sustainable design 
is an important part of being able to perform analysis within the Revit model and a critical 
factor in today’s design environment.
Master It    What are four key methods for a holistic sustainable design?
Solution    Four key methods for a sustainable solution are (1) understanding a building’s 
climate, (2) reducing building loads, (3) using free energy when possible to power those 
loads, and (4) using efficient systems.
Create a conceptual mass.    Understand ways to generate building forms quickly and easily 
to explore a variety of shapes and orientations.
Master It    Describe how you can use families to quickly generate form.

Chapter 10: Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options  |  879  
Solution    By using adaptive components and masses, you can quickly create geometry 
that can be dynamically modified by pushing or pulling reference lines or by formulas.
Analyze your model for energy performance.    Being able to predict a building’s energy 
performance is a necessary part of designing sustainably. Although Revit doesn’t have an 
energy-modeling application built into it, it does have interoperability with many applica-
tions that have that functionality.
Master It    Explain the steps you need to take to get a Revit model ready for energy 
analysis.
Solution    The steps are as follows:
	
1.	 Make sure the building has walls, floors, and roofs. Those all need to meet and join so 
there are no unrealistic gaps in the model.
	
2.	 Make sure each of the regions in the model has a room element inserted into it and that 
the room element’s height is set to the bottom of the floor above.
	
3.	 Under Area And Volume Calculations, select Room Volumes.
	
4.	 Export the model to gbXML and import that into an energy-analysis application.
Chapter 10: Working with Phasing, Groups,  
and Design Options
Use the Phasing tools to create, demolish, and propose a new design.    Time is such an 
important element to the design process and nearly impossible to capture with traditional 
CAD tools. Don’t use phasing for construction sequencing (there’s a better way). Embrace 
phasing for communication, not just illustration.
Master It    How can you use phasing to communicate your design across a series of key 
stages? What kind of project is best suited to phasing?
Solution    From the Manage tab, you can access the settings for phases. You can create 
phases for the major stages of work in your project as well as define filters and graphic 
overrides to illustrate the overall design approach. Use the Phase and Phase Filter view 
properties to customize project views, including schedules. Set the Phase Created and 
Phase Demolished properties of model elements to adapt to the project phases. Any kind 
of project can use phasing, but tenant improvement projects benefit the most from the 
ability to document existing conditions and demolition.
Understand and utilize groups.    Groups are great for creating collections of both host and 
family component geometry. Just remember to apply best practices, and you’ll avoid a lot of 
common roadblocks. Individual model elements within groups will always appear properly 
in schedules, as you’d expect. And creating exceptions in groups allows you to make subtle 
changes without creating a new group.
Master It    Why shouldn’t you mirror groups?
Solution    Although mirroring works conceptually, it breaks down in implementation. 
Just because you can mirror something in Revit Architecture doesn’t mean that it can 

880  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
actually be manufactured that way. And even more confusion can result if the ­mirrored 
object has to be powered, accessed, maintained, and so on in an impossible ­condition. 
Mirroring groups has been known to create so much hassle that you are better off 
­avoiding it.
Create and use design options.    Like groups, design options work great when you 
­follow the rules. Design options are intended for design iteration that is bounded and 
­well-defined—not for putting multiple buildings in one project file. Remember that links, 
groups, and phasing can exist within design options. Always keep hosted elements with 
their host when using design options.
Master It    Suppose you have a multistory tower. How could you show multiple design 
options for the entire vertical exterior enclosure?
Solution    Put each enclosure option in a different project file. You can link these files 
into one master project file. Then associate each of the links with a different design 
­option. Eventually you set and accept the primary option. Then bind the link, and the 
chosen enclosure model will become a group within your project. The group can be 
­ungrouped to continue editing the final design.
Chapter 11: Visualization
Create real-time and rendered analytic visualizations.    Analytic visualization is the 
concept of communicating information about your project in a nonliteral way, and it’s very 
important! It’s not about showing real materials in the project but about using filters to 
­visualize important metadata.
Master It    During the renovation of a space, you want to reuse the doors rather than 
throw them away. How would you illustrate this?
Solution    Assign an instance parameter to the doors called Recycled. Then apply this 
value to all the doors fulfilling these criteria in your project. Now you can use this 
­parameter to create a view filter to illustrate where these reused doors are being used.
Render emotive photorealistic visualizations.    Photorealistic visualization is about com-
municating design ideas but in emotive ways that are much closer to how the space will be 
experienced, including real lighting, materials, and entourage. Just remember that the time it 
takes to calculate and render your views will change dramatically based on the quality and 
resolution of your views.
Master It    Would the rendering for a PowerPoint presentation differ from a rendering 
being printed for a marketing brochure?
Solution    The rendering for the PowerPoint presentation needs to be only about 150 dpi, 
whereas the rendering for the printing needs to be 300 dpi. A 300 dpi image will take 
much longer to render than a 150 dpi image, even though they’ll look the same on the 
screen.
Understand the importance of sequencing your visualization workflow.    The sequence 
of design—building, content, materials, and cameras—is not the same as the sequence for 
visualization (geometry/cameras, lighting, materials). Lighting is far more important than 

Chapter 12: Creating Walls and Curtain Walls |  881  
materials of actual objects. Get the lighting right and the materials will look great, but not the 
other way around.
Master It    How do you create a rendering environment that replaces the actual materials 
with matte materials in order to study the effects of lighting on your design?
Solution    Use Phase Filter to create a material override, and assign this analytic filter to 
the view that you’re rendering.
Chapter 12: Creating Walls and Curtain Walls
Use extended modeling techniques for basic walls.    Walls in Revit are made from layers of 
materials that can represent everything from generic placeholders for design layouts to com-
plete assemblies representative of actual construction.
Master It    How can you customize the profile of a wall?
Solution    A wall can be attached to another object such as a roof, floor, or reference 
plane. Select a wall, activate the Attach Top/Base tool, and pick the object to which the 
wall should be attached. You can also edit the profile of a wall in elevation by selecting a 
wall, activating the Edit Profile tool, and modifying the sketch of the wall.
Create stacked walls.    Exterior walls are usually composed of several combinations of 
materials with varying thicknesses. These various wall types can be combined into a single 
entity called a stacked wall.
Master It    How do you create a stacked wall?
Solution    You must duplicate an existing stacked wall type within a project. In Type 
Properties, open the Edit Assembly dialog box and add any combination of basic walls 
into the stacked wall structure.
Create simple curtain walls.    A curtain wall is an assembly of parts including curtain 
grids, panels, and mullions. They can be created in predefined types with regular horizontal 
and vertical spacing along with specific panel and mullion types.
Master It    How do you add a door to a curtain wall?
Solution    Use the Tab key to select a single panel in a curtain wall segment. If the panel 
is part of a predefined system, you must unpin the panel first. From the Type Selector, 
choose a curtain panel door family.
Create complex curtain walls.    The Revit conceptual massing environment can be used to 
create complex curtain wall configurations. Pattern-based panel families can be loaded into 
the massing environment and populated on a divided surface. These populated surfaces can 
then be loaded and placed in a project model for documentation and scheduling.
Master It    How do you create a complex divided surface?
Solution    From the Recent Files window, select New Conceptual Mass. Add a second 
level to the family and draw a curved line on each level. Select the two lines and click 
Create Form; choose the Planar Surface option. Select the new form and click the Divide 
Surface button on the ribbon.

Chapter 13: Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs
Understand floor modeling methods.    Floors make up one of the most fundamental, 
sketch-based system families used in a Revit model. You can customize them to accommo-
date a variety of assumptions at various stages of design.
Master It    How can you create a structural floor with integrated metal decking?
Solution    You can create a structural floor by going to the Architecture tab of the rib-
bon and clicking Floor Structural Floor. This tool activates the Structural parameter in a 
floor’s instance properties. Once this is activated, edit the floor’s type properties to add a 
Structural Deck layer and assign a deck profile.
Model various floor finishes.    Thick and thin floor finishes can be created to support 
­tagging, scheduling, and quantity takeoffs.
Master It    How would you represent a thin finish material in your project such as 
carpet?
Solution    Activate the Split Face tool from the Modify tab of the ribbon, select a floor, 
and define the boundaries of the area to be assigned as the thin material. Activate the 
Paint tool, select the appropriate material, and click the split face you created within the 
floor.
Create ceilings.    Ceilings are sketch-based system families that can host objects such as 
light fixtures and HVAC diffusers.
Master It    What’s the best way to model a ceiling within a space?
Solution    Ceilings are best created in a ceiling plan. Activate the Ceiling tool from the 
Build panel in the Architecture tab of the ribbon. Specify a value for the Height Offset 
From Level setting of the ceiling in the Properties palette, and use Automatic Ceiling to 
fill a bounded space with a ceiling object.
Understand roof modeling methods.    Roofs can be modeled as simple single-pitch shed 
roofs or complex extrusions of sinuous curves.
Master It    What is the best way to create a single vault roof?
Solution    That roof is best created with the Roof By Extrusion method. Go to the 
Architecture tab of the ribbon and click Roof ➢ Roof By Extrusion. Specify a wall or refer-
ence plane as the work plane and switch to an elevation, section, or 3D view. Draw the 
profile of a vaulted roof and click Finish Edit Mode. Adjust the extents of the extrusion as 
desired.
Work with advanced shape editing for floors and roofs.    A small but powerful toolset 
is available for extended editing of floor and roof objects. These tools allow you to create 
warped floor slabs and tapered layers of roof assemblies.
Master It    How do you create a drainage point in a flat roof slab?
Solution    Select a roof object and activate the Add Split Line tool from the Shape Editing 
panel in the ribbon. Draw two crossing lines from the four corners of the roof ­boundaries. 
Activate the Modify Sub Elements tool and select the point where the split lines cross. 
Change the value that appears to create a low drainage depression in the slab.

Chapter 14: Designing with the Family Editor |  883  
Chapter 14: Designing with the Family Editor
Get started with a family.    Before you start to create your own family components, take a 
moment to think about how you expect that component to “behave” in your project. The role 
of the Family Editor isn’t just an environment to model geometry; it also determines how the 
content that you create will behave in the project environment.
Master It    Choosing the right template is critical. You can convert from one family tem-
plate to another, but this is not always the case. Why would you want to choose a door 
template rather than a Generic Model template?
Solution    Balusters, curtain panels, detail components, and hosted elements all have 
specific, predefined behavior. Plan ahead when you’re creating these categories. Objects 
that need to “cut” their host, like doors and windows, must be created in templates that 
are hardwired to contain a portion of the host that will be cut. This allows you to create 
the door or window and also cut the host in the way that it needs to cut in the project.
Create the framework for a family component.    Reference planes, points, and lines are the 
“bones” of your component. Assign parameters to the skeleton, and the geometry will follow 
along. Be sure to test the parameter and reference relationships before you start to create any 
solid model geometry.
Master It    Why should you build, assign parameters to, and test the references first? 
Why not just model the geometry?
Solution    Testing the references and parameters before you add geometry keeps things 
simple and helps you troubleshoot parametric behavior before building the geometry. 
Remember to keep parametric dimensions outside of Sketch mode so you and others can 
easily find them later. After you’ve tested the parameters and references successfully, you 
can be confident that your geometry will behave predictably.
Understand family modeling techniques.    Although the Family Editor contains a wide 
assortment of modeling and editing tools, you don’t always need to build everything in one 
file. You can use a number of techniques to reduce redundancy and manage complex geom-
etry for a component family.
Master It    When would you consider using the technique of nesting families? How 
could this method improve the efficiency of a component family?
Solution    Anytime you need to create a repetitive element within a family, you should 
consider using a nested family. This method allows you to build the repetitive element 
only once, and you will maintain better control of the placement of the nested component 
within its host. You can also use multiple nested families as a way to explore various de-
sign solutions for a component or to efficiently manage subcomponents, such as different 
hardware types for a door.
Apply extended family management techniques.    Sometimes parametric behavior 
will depend on the parameters that directly control it, but often these parameters will be 
expressed as a relationship to something else.
Master It    Why are formulas so important? Why not just create the parameters you need 
and then modify them as needed in the project environment?

884  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Solution    Formulaic relationships help maintain rules within a family so that chang-
ing one rule can have an effect on many others. Using formulas, therefore, allows you 
to drive one parameter based on the value of another, and the result can drive a length, 
­material, or other rules-based value. When you have many parametric-type permuta-
tions, it’s better not to weigh your project down with a lot of options that you’ll probably 
never use. Whenever this happens, don’t load all the possible types in your project—just 
turn to a type catalog in order to select only the family types that you need. Since you 
don’t want to have to remember all of these relationships manually, allow Revit to main-
tain them for you.
Chapter 15: Creating Stairs and Railings
Understand the key components of stairs and railings.    Having a complete understanding 
of the components of stairs is important. You don’t want to set about breaking the rules until 
you understand how best (and when) those rules can be broken.
Master It    What are the essential parts of stairs?
Solution    Baluster posts, balusters, and baluster panels along with handrail profiles are 
the essential parts of any railing. Nosings, stringers, and treads are the essential parts of 
stairs. Having a firm understanding of how these components react to changes in their 
respective dialog boxes is critical.
Understand the different stair tools and apply them to custom designs.    Designing in a 
spreadsheet is hard. Step back and consider what you’re trying to accomplish. If you’ll look at 
the components that make up stairs, you’ll see some interesting opportunities.
Master It    How would you create a continuous tread that wasn’t monolithic? What would 
you do if you wanted to create a custom stringer? Are balusters always vertical and used 
to support handrails? What if your particular stair just can’t be modeled in the Stairs tool?
Solution    Try using the nosing profile to complement the shape of your tread. And don’t 
forget that a handrail profile can be used to create a custom stringer profile with little 
trouble. Although balusters often support handrails, this is not always the case. Balusters 
may also consist of the support element that will support the tread. A complex baluster 
family associated with the railing as the start post can create the most complex railing 
conditions quickly and easily. But if all else fails, remember that there’s still the Family 
Editor. Just model it the way you want it, and then put it in the project. It’s probably more 
sculpture than stair at this point. Modeling it in the Family Editor means that you’ll be 
able to move, elevate, rotate, and copy the results throughout the project. If you have to 
make changes (and you will), you’ll simply open the component in the Family Editor.
Design railings and use the Railing tool for other model elements.    From model pat-
terns to geometric intricacy, there’s a lot that can be created with the Railing tool. When this 
doesn’t work, look to the Curtain Wall tool for “railings” that can contain space and allow 
“balusters” to be conveniently unlocked.
Master It    Why would you not use a railing to manage repetitive relationships? What if 
you need to accurately distribute geometry along a path?

Chapter 16: Detailing Your Design |  885  
Solution    Modeling these railings as components in the Family Editor is often faster 
than creating groups and then copying them throughout the project. Railings are also 
helpful for creating geometry that needs to be distributed along paths, even if the results 
aren’t actually railings. Finally, don’t use geometry when a model pattern will do. This 
will keep your project light.
Implement best practices.    There are specific best practices when creating custom stairs and 
railings. Pay attention to nesting geometry, maintaining the right level of detail, and filtering 
schedules so the metadata ends up in the right place.
Master It    Is it possible to create solutions that are too efficient? What’s the big deal with 
detail levels? And finally, what’s the most important thing to remember before creating 
an elegant workaround?
Solution    You’re not the only person working on the project! Design is a team sport, 
and any out-of-the-box exceptions to the rules need to be understood by the entire team. 
“Over modeling” is often misunderstood to mean “too much geometry,” but geometry 
is critically important to understanding how your design is going to be assembled. So if 
you’ll take the time to assign levels of detail to components, it’ll help refresh views and 
printing. Finally, remember that the best solution is the one that is implementable. If your 
team doesn’t understand your “custom hack,” you’re not playing a team sport and the 
project will ultimately suffer.
Chapter 16: Detailing Your Design
Create details.    Details in Revit are a combination of 2D elements layered on top of 3D 
model elements or sometimes just stacked on top of each other. Creating good, easy-to-read 
details typically requires some embellishment of the 3D model.
Master It    What are the three primary categories of detail elements and how are they 
used?
Solution    Detail lines are used to create two-dimensional linework of various weights 
and styles. They are used for drafting, much as you would draft in a CAD application. 
Filled regions and masking regions are the two region types that are used to apply pat-
terns (even if that pattern is a solid-white field) against your details. These can help to 
show context such as materiality. Components like detail components and detail groups 
are used to create 2D families that can be used and reused in a variety of details within 
the model. They are historically used to create elements like blocking, metal studs, metal 
deck, and so on.
Add detail components to families.    You can make creating details in Revit easier by 
adding some of the detail elements directly to the family. In this way, when you cut sec-
tions, make callouts, or enlarge plan conditions, your “smart” details can begin to construct 
themselves.
Master It    Because you don’t always want elements to appear in every scale of a view, 
how can you both add detail elements to your families and still limit the amount of infor-
mation that is shown in any given view?

886  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Solution    Using the detail levels (Coarse, Medium, and Fine), you can control the 
­visibility of any element within a family to show, or not show, at those settings. By con-
trolling the detail level, you can keep the family simple in a Coarse view and add more 
detail as the drawing gets increasingly complex.
Learn efficient detailing.    As you master detailing in Revit, you’ll begin to learn tips and 
tricks to make your process of creating details more efficient.
Master It    To help you assess how much effort you should be putting into your details, 
what are three questions you should be asking yourself before starting any detail?
Solution    Before starting any detail, ask yourself:
◆
◆
Will I see or use this in other views in the project?
◆
◆
Will it affect other aspects of the project (like material takeoffs)?
◆
◆
How large is it?
Reuse details from other files.    In many project workflows, you will need to incorporate 
details from other projects. Reusing these details can aid in the speed and efficiency of 
­project documentation.
Master It    There are several ways to reuse details from other projects. Name one and 
list the steps to perform the tasks necessary to quickly move a detail from one project to 
another.
Solution    Here are the steps to save views from one project for use in another project:
	
1.	 Start by opening the file with the views you want to save. Click the Application menu 
and select Save As Library Views.
	
2.	 The Save Views dialog box shows a list of view names on the left and a preview win-
dow on the right. Click the check box for each of the views you want to save into a 
­separate file; click OK.
	
3.	 To import the views, open the project you’d like to import the views into, and choose 
Insert From File from the Insert tab. Choose Insert Views From File.
	
4.	 In the resulting dialog box, you will have a list of the views you can import from the 
column on the left and a preview of those views on the right. Check the box for the 
views you want to import and click OK.
Chapter 17: Documenting Your Design
Document plans.    With floor plans you can create visual graphics that help define how a space 
is laid out. However, Revit provides other tools such as area plans to help you describe space.
Master It    List the four types of area plans that you can create and note the two that 
Revit creates automatically.
Solution    The four types of area plans are rentable area, gross area, usable area, and 
BOMA area. The software provides automatic calculations to show rentable and gross 
areas.

Chapter 18: Annotating Your Design |  887  
Create schedules and legends.    Schedules are another view type; they allow you to show 
information about the model in a nongraphic format. Schedules can also be used to dynami-
cally report quantities of elements inside the model.
Master It    Understand how to create schedules and report additional information about 
the elements in the model. How would you create a simple casework schedule showing 
quantities of types?
Solution    Here are the steps to create a schedule within Revit:
	
1.	 On the View tab, choose Schedule/Quantities from the Schedule button.
	
2.	 Choose Casework as a schedule category.
	
3.	 On the Fields tab, choose Family And Type followed by Quantity.
	
4.	 On the Sorting tab, choose to sort by Family And Type; make sure Itemize Every 
Instance is checked. When that’s done, click OK.
Lay out sheets.    Eventually in a project it will become necessary to create sheets that will 
become the documentation set. Knowing how to create a good sheet set provides you with 
another venue to communicate with contractors, clients, and other team members.
Master It    To properly create a sheet set, you need to understand the dynamics of adding 
views to a sheet. In the Revit environment, there is only one way to add views to a sheet. 
What is it?
Solution    Views can be added to a sheet by dragging them from the Project Browser 
and dropping them onto the sheet. From that point, they can be edited or manipulated to 
properly place them relative to other views that appear on that sheet.
Chapter 18: Annotating Your Design
Annotate with text and keynotes.    Although a picture is worth a thousand words, you 
will still need notes to make drawings understandable and be able to call out key ­elements 
in each view. Know how to create and modify text and keynotes for a complete set of 
documents.
Master It    To properly use the keynoting feature, you’ll need to understand what each of 
the three keynote types do and how they’re used. List each and explain how they can be 
used in a project.
Solution    Element keynotes annotate assemblies such as walls, floors, and roofs. 
Material keynotes designate materials within Revit, such as concrete, gypsum board, or 
rigid insulation. User keynotes are not tied to an element or a material and can be used to 
note other aspects of the view or detail.
Use tags.    Tags are text labels for elements such as doors, walls, windows, rooms, and sev-
eral other objects that architects typically need to reference in a set of drawings. These tags 
typically refer back to other schedules or information in other portions of the drawing set 
and are unique to the view in which they are inserted.

888  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Master It    Inserting tags quickly can be a good way to make documentation time more 
efficient. How can you quickly tag a number of elements in the model at the same time?
Solution    Use the Tag All tool. This tool allows you to load several tags for different 
elements at the same time and populate a view with all those tag types at once. You will 
probably need to manipulate the location of some of the tags, but most should be placed 
cleanly and accurately, saving you time for other portions of the project.
Add dimensions.    Dimensioning is a critical part of the project documentation, allowing 
you to communicate the distance elements are from one another.
Master It    Adding dimensions is a necessary part in any project. However, in a project 
workflow you will typically want to change the location of a dimension’s witness line 
without having to re-create the entire dimension. How do you move a witness line  
without remaking the entire dimension?
Solution    Highlight the dimension string and grab the blue grip that is below the text 
string. By clicking and holding this element, you can now select a new host for the wit-
ness line.
Set project and shared parameters.    Revit Architecture lets users add as many custom 
parameters to an element as are needed to document the project. These parameters can be 
both tagged and scheduled, depending on how they are made.
Master It    You need to add a custom parameter for your project to track the percentage 
of recycled content in materials. What’s the best way to go about doing this?
Solution    Since the items you want to track need to be scheduled but not tagged, it’s 
­easiest do to this with a project parameter. Add one to the project for a percentage of 
­recycled content, and then track that in a Multi-Category schedule showing all the 
­material types you want to track.
Chapter 19: Working in the Construction Phase
Add revisions to your project.    You need the ability to track changes in your design 
after sheets have been issued. Adding revisions to a drawing is an inevitable part of your 
workflow.
Master It    How do you indicate revisions on a drawing sheet?
Solution    First, a revision must be created in the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box. 
Then, a revision cloud is drafted in either an active view or a sheet. The revision cloud 
is assigned to one of the project revisions in the Properties palette. Finally, the revision 
cloud is tagged. The revisions are automatically tracked in revision schedules that are 
part of the title block.
Use digital markups.    DWFs provide a lightweight means to digitally transfer and mark up 
multiple sheets in a document set.
Master It    Explain the workflow using DWF markups.
Solution    Once your views are drawn and placed on sheets, export the sheets to a 
DWFx format. They can be shared with other members of your team for markup. Others 

Chapter 20: Presenting Your Design |  889  
will open the DWFx in Design Review and create the comments, and then send the 
­marked-up set back to the design team. This set is then linked back into the drawing set, 
and the markups will be visible on the drawing sheets.
Model for construction.    Parts and assemblies allow a model element to be broken down 
into smaller parts. These subelements can be used in more detailed ways for the construction 
process while still maintaining their association with the original element.
Master It    Describe the method for breaking down a design-based model assembly into 
its individual components.
Solution    Select a wall, floor, roof, or ceiling and use the Create Parts tool. The view 
may need to be set to Show Parts. Once parts are created, they can be divided, merged, or 
excluded.
Chapter 20: Presenting Your Design
Understand color fill legends.    Color fills are a great way to illustrate data that otherwise 
might appear only in a schedule, such as department assignment, designed areas, and room 
finishes.
Master It    There are a variety of ways to graphically display information using color 
fills. It can initially take a bit of time to get things organized, but once you create the 
legends, they can easily be transferred between views and projects. Describe how to  
add a color fill legend, once created, to your project template.
Solution    To add a color fill legend from a project to your project template, add it to a 
view and add the view to a sheet. Legends can be transferred like schedules: Once they 
are added to a sheet, they can be copied to the Clipboard and then pasted to the sheet in 
the project template. This will transfer all the colors, fonts, and other settings from the 
project to the template.
Use 3D model views in your presentation.    Revit provides a variety of ways to help you 
visualize your designs—both while designing and during presentation. Understanding 
where these features are located and how and when to use them can help expedite the  
presentation process, depending on the look and feel you want to create with your images.
Master It    Describe the process for creating an exploded 3D view of each level within 
your project.
Solution    After adjusting the view range of your plan views to accommodate the actual 
bottom of the level up to the top, open a 3D view and right-click the ViewCube. Select 
Orient To View and choose the floor plan for each level.
Work with viewport types.    Viewport types are simple to manage, but they are powerful 
when applied to the views you place on sheets. You can customize the view titles for any use 
case, from design presentations to construction documents.
Master It    Describe the process for adding a new viewport type to your project.
Solution    After placing a view on a sheet, select the view and click Edit Type in the 
Properties palette. Click Duplicate and create a uniquely named type. Once you have 

890  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
modified the settings, apply the new type to other views by selecting a viewport and 
picking the new type from the Type Selector.
Create “exploded” axonometric views.    The Displace Elements command is used to ­create 
exploded axonometric views that used to be drafted by hand or created manually in a sepa-
rate model. Understand the best ways to use this tool to help visualize and communicate 
design ideas.
Master It    Describe the process for creating a displaced view.
Solution    Starting in a 3D view, select elements to visually displace. The selections will 
be based on how you would like to see the elements grouped as you move them around 
within the view. By selecting elements and then selecting the Displace Elements tool, you 
can begin staging your axonometric view.
Chapter 21: Computational Design with Dynamo
Get started with Autodesk Dynamo.    Dynamo is a visual programming interface that runs 
parallel with Revit and allows you the ability to code forms and shapes within your Revit 
environment. Dynamo creates definitions by connecting nodes with wires to convey data.
Master It    There are five parts to a node. What are they, and what do they do?
Solution    The five parts are Node Name, Input Ports, Output Ports, Node Preview, and 
Lacing options. These parts control the input and output of a node.
Understand the Dynamo UI.    Dynamo has a simple, straightforward UI. Becoming com-
fortable with the parts of the user interface can allow you more flexibility and lower frustra-
tion when learning the application, either as a novice or on your road to an expert.
Master It    What are the four primary sections of the user interface?
Solution    The following are the four primary sections of the Dynamo UI:
◆
◆
The Toolbar
◆
◆
Node Library
◆
◆
Workspace
◆
◆
Execution Bar
Connect nodes to make data flow.    Connecting nodes is the true power behind Dynamo. 
The connections visually and programmatically show data flow and the path of information 
from beginning to end to create the form, run the analysis, or provide whatever is the desired 
output. Understanding the basics of connecting nodes is the first step to creating your own 
Dynamo definition.
Master It    Describe the workflow to create a series of nodes and connect them properly.
Solution    Nodes are added by searching for them in the Node Library and adding 
them to the workspace. This can be done via dynamic search or by browsing through the 
­library and clicking a node. Once added to the workspace, nodes output on the right and 
input on the left. Connecting nodes is done by dragging the right (output) of one node to 

Chapter 21: Computational Design with Dynamo |  891  
the left (input) of another node, creating a sequence for the data to flow. The sequence or 
definition is the visual program.
Use additional Dynamo tools.    While Dynamo is a robust programming application, there 
are additional tools you can use to further leverage its capabilities.
Master It    Describe some of the tools external to Dynamo and how they can be used to 
push the capabilities of the application even further.
Solution    There are several applications that can interface with Dynamo. The first and 
most obvious one is Revit. Revit can be used as a workspace of sorts to create geometry 
or as a data set to pull information from if you want to perform any type of analysis on 
your project file. Excel is another application that can help feed long lists of data (num-
bers, strings, and so on) into Dynamo to cut down on manual entry or as a pass-through 
application. In this last example, you might pull room areas from a Excel-based building 
program and push them into Dynamo to test designed room sizes. Finally, there is the 
Dynamo package manager that allows more advanced users a way to give back to the 
Dynamo community and create their own nodes and other content.


 Appendix B 
 Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting    
 This appendix provides some tips, tricks, and troubleshooting to help keep your project fi les 
running smoothly. Listed here are some pointers to keep you from getting into trouble as well 
as a peppering of time-savers and other great ideas. 
 In this appendix, you’ll learn to: 
 
◆
 Optimize performance 
 
◆
 Use best practices 
 
◆
 Maintain quality control 
 
◆
 Apply tips and shortcuts 
 Optimizing performance 
 It should make sense that a smaller Revit fi le on a fast computer with a good network will run 
the quickest. There is no real “typical” project fi le size for Autodesk ® Revit ® Architecture projects, 
and a fi le can range anywhere from 10 MB to well over 800 MB. We’ve found that a project with 
less square footage and with a lot of geometry and detail (like a medical offi ce building) can be 
larger in fi le size than a warehouse project—which has a lot of empty square footage. Because 
documentation is often an indication of project complexity, we’ve found as a good rule of thumb 
that for each documented sheet, your fi le should be about 1 MB. So a completed project of 100 
full-size sheets should be about 100 MB. 
 Much of the variation depends on the level of detail in the model itself, the presence of 
imported geometry (2D CAD fi les, SketchUp, and so on), the number of views you have, and the 
overall complexity. Obviously, your hardware confi guration will also be a factor in determining 
the speed and operation of your models. 
 You can optimize your hardware in a number of ways to get the most out of the confi guration 
you have. You should fi rst look at the install specifi cations and recommended hardware specs for 
a computer running Revit software. Autodesk has published those requirements on its website, 
and they are updated with each new version of the software. You can fi nd the current specs at 
www.autodesk.com/Revit ; then choose System Requirements from the right side of the menu at 
the top of the page. 
 Beyond the default specifi cations, you can do things to help keep your fi les nimble. Here are 
some other recommendations: 
Use a 64-bit OS.  Revit Architecture likes RAM, and the more physical RAM it can use, the 
more model you can cache into active memory. Windows offers several versions of a 64-bit 

894  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
OS, but since Revit 2014, Windows 7 has been a minimum requirement. You can use this in a 
32-bit or 64-bit version, but a 64-bit OS allows you to use as much RAM as you can pack into 
your machine. Note that Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 are also supported.
Get a faster hard drive.    Chances are you’re working on Revit on a local hard drive. If you’re 
working on a large project with a central file, your local file will be on your computer’s hard 
drive. If you’re working on a small project without worksharing enabled, there’s a chance 
you might be working on your local drive if you’re taking the file home or if you don’t have a 
network. Regardless, one of the things that will affect performance is your drive speed. This 
is how fast your computer can read/write to the local drive (input/output or I/O speed). With 
the large files Revit can create, a faster drive will equal less read/write time; so if it’s within 
your budget, try to get the 7200 rpm drive as a minimum or even an SSD (solid state drive). 
We’ve found the SSD, especially in a laptop, is a huge performance boost. You’ll appreciate 
the difference.
Get a good graphics card.    Revit is also very graphics-intensive and will push the limits of 
any video card you have in your computer. Although many graphics cards are available at a 
variety of performance and price levels, a good starting point is looking for ones that have 
been tested and approved by Autodesk for use with Revit. You can find recommended system 
hardware as well as graphics hardware and driver specifications at www.autodesk.com/
graphics-hardware-detail.
Figure out how much RAM your project will need.    Before you email your IT department 
requesting 64 GB of RAM, figure out how much you’re actually going to use on your project. 
Your OS and other applications like Outlook will use some of your RAM, but you can calcu-
late how much RAM Revit will need to work effectively. The formula is as follows:
Model size in Explorer × 20 + Linked file size(s) × 20 = Active RAM needed (in 
megabytes)
Let’s look at a couple of examples to demonstrate how it works. You have a Revit file with no 
linked files, and your file size on your server is 150 MB. So you’ll need 150 MB × 20 = 3000 
MB, or 3 GB, of RAM just for Revit to operate effectively. In another example, you have a 120 
MB file, a 50 MB structural model linked in, and four CAD files at 1 MB each. The calculation 
is as follows:
(120 MB × 20) + (50 MB × 20) + (4 MB × 20) = 3480 MB or 3.5 GB of RAM
Once you’ve put as much RAM into your workstation as is practical, your next recourse for 
improving model performance is to reduce your file size so you’re not using as much RAM. 
Here are some tips to do that and thereby improve your file speed:
Manage your views.    There are two things you can do using views to help improve perfor-
mance. First, the more views you have open at once, the more information you will load into 
active RAM. It’s easy to have many views open at once, even if you’re concentrating on only a 
few views. Close windows you’re not using to help minimize the drain on your resources. You 
can always close all the windows except your active one using the Close Hidden Windows 
tool. Choose the View tab and click the Close Hidden button (Figure B.1). You can map a key-
board shortcut to this command such as “XX,” or you can find it in the Quick Access toolbar. 
The Close Hidden Windows command will close the hidden windows in your active project 
as well as all other open projects and families in your current session of Revit.

Optimizing Performance |  895  
The other way to manage your views is to get rid of the ones you don’t need. Revit allows you 
to make different views within your model quickly and easily. This can sometimes lead to 
having a lot of views (sometimes hundreds) that you aren’t using in your document set and 
don’t plan to use. Adding too many views can raise your overall file size even if you haven’t 
added any geometry or annotations within those views. Get rid of those unused views—
typically views that are not on sheets—to help keep your file running smoothly. We discuss 
how to create a schedule to help identify the unused views later in this chapter.
Delete or unload unused CAD files.    There are many times in a project process when you’ll 
want to load content from another source as a background. This could be a client’s CAD 
as-built drawings or a consultant’s MEP design. You might link these files into your draw-
ing and, during the busy course of the project, forget about them. As you’ve seen from the 
earlier tips on RAM use, all these small files add up. Getting rid of them can speed up your 
Revit project file and is just good housekeeping. If the CAD file is linked, you can remove it 
using the Manage Links button on the Insert tab. If the CAD files have been inserted instead 
of linked, right-click an instance of the CAD file in a view and choose Select All Instances 
from the context menu. Then click Delete to remove all the instances in the entire model as 
opposed to only the CAD file in the active view.
Figure B.1
Closing hidden 
windows
Link, Don’t Import
As a general rule of thumb, we highly recommend linking CAD files instead of inserting them. 
You will notice a significant difference in model performance as you get more and more CAD files 
into your model.
Don’t explode imported CAD files.    A CAD file, when imported into Revit Architecture, is 
a collection of objects that is managed as a single entity. If you explode a CAD file, the single 
object immediately becomes many objects—and these all take up space in the file, requiring 
more resources to track and coordinate.
If you’re importing DWG files, leave them unexploded as much as possible. If you need to 
hide lines, use the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box to turn layers on and off. Explode 
only when you need to change the imported geometry, and start with a partial explode to 
minimize the number of new entities. Figure B.2 shows the tools available on the ribbon when 
you select an imported or linked DWG file. Also note that lines smaller than 1/32″ (~1 mm) 
are not retained when CAD files are exploded. This can result in unusable imports.
Figure B.2
Explode options

896  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
A better workflow than importing your CAD files directly into the project is to import them 
into a Detail Component family and then load that family into the project. This approach 
will also aid in keeping accidents from happening, like a novice user exploding the imported 
CAD. An example of this workflow is to import a SketchUp model into a mass family and 
then load the mass family into a project file. This workflow is covered in more detail in 
Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform.”
Turn on volume computation only as needed.    Calculating the volumes on a large file can 
slow down your model speed immensely. This setting is typically turned on when export-
ing to gbXML, but sometimes teams forget to turn it back off again. Volumes will recalculate 
each time you edit a room, move a wall, or change any of the building geometry. Turn these 
off using the Area And Volume Computations dialog box found at the bottom of the Room & 
Area panel on the Home tab (Figure B.3).

calculations to 
minimize unneeded 
computations.
Use Best Practices
Good file maintenance is critical to keeping your files running smoothly and your file sizes low. 
The following are some best practices and workflows that were identified in other areas of the 
book but are consolidated here as a quick reference:
Manage the amount of information shown in views.    Learn to manage the amount of 
information needed in a given view. Minimize the view depth and the level of detail so you 
don’t show more than you need to show in a view. Here are some simple tips to keep your 
individual views working smoothly:

Use Best Practices |  897  
Minimize the level of detail.    Set your detail level, found in the view control bar, rela-
tive to your drawing scale. For example, if you’re working on a 1/32″ = 1′-0″ (1:500) plan, 
you probably don’t need Detail Level set to Fine. This will cause the view to have a higher 
level of detail than the printed sheet can show, and you’ll end up with not only black 
blobs on your sheets but also views that are slow to open and print.
Minimize view detail.    Along with the amount of detail you turn on in the view using 
the Detail Level tool, make sure you’re not showing more than you need to. For instance, if 
you have wall studs shown in a 1/16″ = 1′-0″ (1:200) scale plan or the extruded aluminum 
window section shown in a building section, chances are it will not represent properly 
when printed. Turning off those elements in your view will keep things moving smoother 
as well as printing cleaner.
Minimize view depth.    View depth and crop regions are great tools to enhance per-
formance. As an example, a typical building section is shown in Figure B.4. The default 
behavior causes Revit to regenerate all of the model geometry to the full depth of that 
view every time you open the view. To reduce the amount of geometry that needs to 
be redrawn, drag the section’s far clip plane (the blue dashed line when you highlight 
the section) in close to the cutting plane.
Figure B.4
Minimizing the  
view depth

898  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
Model only what you need.    Although it is possible to model to a very small level of detail, 
don’t fall into the trap of over-modeling. Be smart about what you choose to model and how 
much detail you plan to show. If it’s not conveying information about the project, maybe it’s 
not really needed. The amount of information you do or do not model should be based on 
your project size and complexity, your timeframe, what you need to document, and your 
comfort level with the software.
How much to model: Use these three rules of thumb.    When you are trying to decide how 
much detail to put into a model or even a family, there are three good rules of thumb to help 
you make the right decision for the particular element you’re looking to create:
◆
◆
Scale: What scale will this detail be seen in? If it’s a very small scale (such as 3″ = 1′-0″), it 
might be simpler to just draw it in 2D in a drafting view.
◆
◆
Repetition: How many times will this detail appear in the drawing set? If it will appear in 
only one location or only one time, it might be easier to just draft it in 2D rather than try to 
model the element. If it will appear in several locations, modeling is the better solution. The 
more exposure an element has in the model (the more views it shows in), the more reasons 
you have to model it. For example, doors are good to model. They show in elevations and 
plans all over the sheet set.
◆
◆
Quality: Be honest—how good at modeling families are you? Don’t bite off more than you 
can chew. If you’re new to the software, keep it simple and use 2D components. The more 
projects you complete, the better you’ll understand the transition to a BIM workflow.
Don’t over-constrain.    Embedding user-defined constraints into families and the model 
helps keep important information constant. However, if you don’t need to lock a relationship, 
don’t do it. Over-constraining the model can cause problems later in the project process when 
you want to move or modify locked elements. Constrain only when necessary. Otherwise, let 
the model be free. However, if you do over-constrain your model, Revit has a new feature to 
show you where the constraints are located in any given view. In the View Control bar at the 
bottom of the screen is the Show Constraints tool (Figure B.5).
Figure B.5
Finding constrained 
objects with the Show 
Constraints tool
Watch out for imported geometry.    Although you have the ability to use geometry from 
several other file sources, use caution when doing so. Remember that everything you link 
into a project or a family takes up around 20 times the file size in your system’s RAM. So 
linking a 60 MB NURBS-based ceiling design will equal 2 GB of RAM and more than likely 
slow down your model. Deleting unused CAD files, using linking rather than importing, and 
cleaning up the CAD geometry before insertion will help keep problems to a minimum.
Purge unused files and family types.    You will find that you won’t use every family, 
group, or material you create in your model. Revit Architecture has a tool that will allow 
you to get rid of those unused elements to help keep your file sizes down to a reasonable 
level. This tool, Purge Unused, can be found on the Manage tab in the Settings panel. If 

Use Best Practices |  899  
your file is very large, it can take several minutes to run, but eventually you’ll be presented 
with a list (Figure B.6) of all the unused elements within your file.
Figure B.6
Use the Purge Unused 
dialog box to reduce 
file size.
We’ll discuss the Purge Unused command in greater detail later in this appendix.
Model correctly from the beginning.    As you refine your design, it’s critical to model 
correctly right from the beginning, not taking shortcuts, so you don’t have to fix things 
later. If you can begin by thinking about how your project will be assembled, it will save 
you a lot of time later in the process. It’s good practice to plan ahead, but remember that 
the software will allow you to make major changes at any stage in the process and still 
maintain coordination. If you are still in an early phase of design and do not know the 
exact wall type, use generic walls to capture your design intent; changing them later will 
be simple.
Manage workshared files.    When employing worksharing on a project, you’ll want to fol-
low additional tools and tips. Check out Chapter 5, “Working in a Team,” for more details.
Make a new local copy at least once a week.    In a workshared environment, your local 
copy can begin to perform poorly or grow in file size while the central file remains small and 
nimble. If this is the case, it might be time to throw out the old local copy for a new one. Keep 
in mind that Revit allows you to make a new local copy upon opening the central file. When 
you choose a central model from a network location, Revit will automatically make a new 
local copy and place it in your Documents folder. If you choose not to follow that workflow, 
keep in mind that if you’re accessing a project on a daily basis, it’s a good idea to make a new 
local copy at least once a week.

900  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
Divide your model.    For larger projects or campus-style projects, you can break up your 
model into smaller submodels that are linked together. You can also do this on a single, large 
building, although it is a bit more complex. Dividing a model helps limit the amount of infor-
mation you are loading into a project at one time.
This is a particularly good idea if your project is going to be delivered in separate phases or 
bid packages. As the project progresses and you complete each delivery, you’ll start the next 
phase by creating a new project file and then linking in the previous project file as context. 
Doing so will greatly simplify your document set (because you’ll be able to start over after 
each phase) and avoid inadvertently modifying the previous phase (since the geometry and 
documentation are in a linked file).
If you decide to divide your project, make your cuts along lines that make sense from a 
holistic-building standpoint. Don’t think of the cuts as you would in CAD, but think about 
how the actual assemblies will interact in the building. For example, don’t cut between floors 
2 and 3 on a multistory building unless you have a significant change in the building form 
or program. A good place to cut might be between the building and the adjacent parking 
garage. Here’s a list of some good places to split a model:
◆
◆
At a significant change in building form or massing
◆
◆
At a significant change in building program
◆
◆
Between separate buildings on the site
◆
◆
At the building site
Don’t want to divide your model? Use Collaboration for Revit.    Collaboration for 
Revit is a service that synchronizes your model with other model users in your office or 
other locations. It is a paid service that allows you similar functionality to something 
like Revit Server, but without the need to manage the installation process across your 
network. In lieu of your files being saved on your Revit Server installation, the central 
file resides on the Autodesk® A360 website. For more information about the service, visit 
www.autodesk.com/products/collaboration-for-revit/overview.
Collaboration for Revit, or C4R, is included in the default Revit installation starting with 
Revit 2017. The service is designed for teams working in different locations to work within 
the same model at the same time without having to manage a Revit Server installation.
To use C4R, open Revit and choose the Collaborate tab. On the Manage Collaboration panel, 
you can activate C4R by choosing the Collaborate button (Figure B.7).
Figure B.7
Activating Collaboration 
for Revit
Revit will ask you to save your model and then ask whether you want to collaborate across 
your network or collaborate using A360 (Figure B.8). Collaborating within the network will 
limit you to working only with people who have access to your LAN. If you’re working with 

Quality Control |  901  
other firms on the same model, you would want to use the A360 option. When you save your 
model, it will either save to a central location on the LAN or save to the A360 site, allowing 
you to coordinate with anyone else, anywhere.
Figure B.8

the LAN or with A360
Quality Control
In any project process, you should always maintain a level of quality control to ensure a solid 
workflow. When working in a BIM environment, good model maintenance is an imperative part 
of the process. A well-maintained model will open quickly and be responsive when you’re chang-
ing views or manipulating content. A model that is not well maintained can have a very large file 
size, take a long time to open or save, or even become corrupted. Letting the quality of your model 
suffer can negatively impact the team’s overall production and lead to frustration because mem-
bers cannot be as efficient as they’d like to be. The model size will grow, it will take a long time to 
save locally or SWC (Synchronize With Central), and the file can suffer corruption or crashes.
Maintaining a good, healthy model is not difficult. It takes about as much effort as regularly 
changing the oil in your car. The important thing, as with your car, is actually doing the regular 
maintenance so you don’t have to fix a bigger problem that could have been avoided. In the 
following sections, we’ll cover some simple things you can do using the tools already built into 
Revit software.
Keeping an Eye on File Size
The size of your file is a good metric for general file stability. A typical Revit file size for a project 
in construction will be between 100 MB and 500 MB. Note that 500 MB is really on the high side 
of file sizes; beyond that, the model will be slow to open and hard to rotate in 3D views. Other 
views, such as building elevations and overall plans, will also be slow to open.

902  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
Should your file become large or unwieldy, you have several ways to trim your file and get 
your model lean and responsive again. We’ve discussed some ways to make your computer 
faster to accommodate larger files sizes. Now, let’s discuss ways to optimize the file itself.
Purging Unused Families and Groups
On the Manage tab is a command called Purge Unused. This command removes all the unused 
families and groups from your model by deleting them. There are many times in a design pro-
cess when you will change window types or wall types or swap one set of families for another. 
Even if those elements are not being used in the project, they are being stored within the file, and 
therefore, when the file is opened, they are being loaded into memory. Depending on the stage of 
your project, you should periodically delete these elements from the model to keep your file size 
down. Don’t worry—if you find you need a family you’ve removed, you can always reload it.
Select the Manage tab and choose Purge Unused from the Settings panel. Depending on the 
size of your model and how many families you have loaded, it might take the software a few 
minutes to complete this command.
After the software is done thinking, it will provide you with a list of all the families and 
groups in the file that are not actively within a view (Figure B.9). At this point, you have the 
option to select the elements you want to delete or keep, and remove the rest. You can select 
either entire families or just unused types. Notice that some of the families cannot be selected 
for deletion, because either they are nested in another family or other types of that family are 
already being used in your project.
Figure B.9
The Purge Unused  
dialog box

Quality Control |  903  
In addition to families, unused materials and property sets can be removed using the Purge 
Unused command. Imported categories can be purged as well; however, you don’t have the 
option to choose which ones to delete.
We don’t recommend that you use this command in the early stages of design, because your 
file size won’t be that large early on, and purging would eliminate any preloaded families that 
you might have included in your template. During schematic design and design development, 
you are typically going through design iteration and will likely be adding and removing content 
regularly. It can become a hassle to have to constantly load or reload families into the model. If 
your model is not suffering from performance issues or the file size isn’t unruly, it’s not neces-
sary to perform a Purge Unused.
You might also consider using the Save Families tool before purging all unused families. 
From the Application menu, click Save As Library Family and you can export all of the families 
in your project to a folder. After you purge unused families, you can always return to the folder 
in which you saved the families and reload them as necessary.
Cutting Down on the Number of Views
The ability to quickly create views within a model is one of the benefits of using Revit; however, 
this ability can be a detriment if it is not managed. Beyond the simple hassle of sorting through 
many views to find the one you need, too many views can also negatively affect your perfor-
mance and file size.
Obviously, a number of views are needed within the model to show design intent and create 
the construction documentation. Beyond those views, you will find yourself creating views to 
study the design, deal with model creation, or simply view the building or project from a new 
angle. These types of working views will never make it to the sheet set, and some will be used 
for only brief periods.
Before you go through the effort of counting all your unused views, remember that a Revit 
model is a database. You can use this feature to let the software perform the counting for you, 
using schedules. To create a schedule that will track unused views, open the AppB-Foundation
.rvt file found on the book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2017. Next, select 
the Schedules flyout from the View tab and choose View List.

904  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
The View List Properties dialog box allows you to select the fields you want to have in your 
schedule. For your View List schedule, select the following fields (in order):
◆
◆
Sheet Number
◆
◆
View Name
◆
◆
Title On Sheet
Use the Add button to move those fields from the left column to the right one and sort them 
in the order listed (Figure B.10).
How Many Working Views Are Too Many?
How many working views are too many to have in your model? The obvious answer is that when 
performance begins to suffer, you need to start looking at ways to make the model leaner and speed 
up response times. We had a project team new to Revit software, and they were complaining about 
the file being slow to open and manipulate. When reviewing their model, we saw their file size was 
over 900 MB! We were surprised they were able to do any work at all.
One of the first things we did to get the file size down to something more reasonable was look at 
all the views that were not on sheets. We found they had more than 1200 views not being used. 
Deleting those views and running a File Save (with the Compress box checked) brought the file size 
down to 500 MB. Although the size was still high, this example demonstrates the impact that too 
many views can have on your file size.
Figure B.10
Selecting fields for  
your View List

Quality Control |  905  
If you were to click OK right now, you’d create a schedule of all the views you have within 
the model. Since you want to see only the views that are not on sheets, you have a bit more 
formatting to do. By selecting the Filter tab, you can choose to see only the views not placed on 
sheets. In the sample model, there are two sheet types: those that begin with an A and ones that 
begin with a K.
	
1.	 On the Filter tab, choose to filter the sheets by sheet number.
	
2.	 From the drop-down menu, choose Does Not Begin With as a filter type.
	
3.	 Finally, in the text field, enter a capital A (Figure B.11).
Figure B.11
Filtering out views on 
sheets
Remember that because these are database functions, they are also case sensitive. Before 
moving on to the next tab, choose to add another filter selection. Copy the one you just created 
to filter A sheets, but now filter out all the K sheets.
Filtering Is AND, Not OR
Remember that filtering is not an OR command (this OR that)—it’s an AND command. So, if you 
have more than one filter, what you see in the schedule needs to meet both requirements, not just 
one.
As a last bit of formatting, select the Sorting/Grouping tab. On this tab, from the drop-down 
menu select Sheet Number. Should you have missed a sheet number type (for instance, if you 
have G sheets in your list), it would appear at the top. Be sure to have the Grand Totals and the 
Itemize Every Instance check boxes selected (Figure B.12). Click OK when you’ve finished.

906  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
Figure B.12
Sorting the schedule by 
sheet name
The result of this exercise will be a schedule that looks similar to Figure B.13; it shows a list 
and the total of all the views not on sheets in your model. You can see that in our model we have 
19 views not currently on sheets. No matter how many views you have in this schedule, you’ll 
want to be selective about what you eliminate and what you choose to keep. Just because a view 
is not on a sheet, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have value to your project. Ideally, someone familiar 
with the project will assess the value of the views in this schedule to determine what to keep 
and what to remove.
Figure B.13
The finished schedule

Quality Control |  907  
It is also a good idea to add this schedule to your office template where it will keep a running 
list of views not on sheets that you can refer to at any time in the project process.
Using Schedules
As you saw in the previous example, using schedules is a great way to use tools already in the soft-
ware to perform quality control on your projects. Don’t think that all schedules need to be placed 
on sheets. There are several uses for schedules as a quality assurance measure. In the previous 
example using views, you used schedules to help troubleshoot poor model performance; however, 
you can use schedules to help you control quality for all kinds of things. The following sections 
highlight two more examples.
Multicategory Schedules
An excellent way to monitor the contents of your building model is through the use of multi-
category schedules. For the purpose of quality control, you might not be too concerned with 
extensive quantity takeoffs. Thus, you will need to create a schedule with a limited number of 
fields, organized in a way that doesn’t list each and every object instance in the project. We’ll 
show you how to do this in the following exercise:
	
1.	 Continuing with the AppB-Foundation.rvt file, go to the View tab in the ribbon, click 
the Schedules flyout, and select Schedule/Quantities.
	
2.	 Choose <Multi-Category> at the top of the Category list and change the name to 
Multi-Category QA Schedule.
	
3.	 In the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box, add the following fields (in order) 
to the Scheduled Fields list:
◆
◆
Category
◆
◆
Assembly Code
◆
◆
Assembly Description
◆
◆
Family And Type
◆
◆
Count
	
4.	 Switch to the Sorting/Grouping tab, set the first sorting parameter to Category, and select 
the Header option. For the second sorting parameter, choose Assembly Code, and set the 
third sorting parameter to Family And Type. Finally, uncheck the Itemize Every Instance 
option at the bottom of the dialog box (Figure B.14).
	
5.	 Switch to the Formatting tab and select the Category field. Check the box to make it a 
hidden field and then click OK to view the results (Figure B.15).
With this type of schedule, you can manage the entire scope of contents actively placed in your 
model. Objects that don’t have the proper assembly codes can be corrected in this schedule. For 
other issues such as family- or type-naming conventions, you will need to make those adjustments 
in the Project Browser. In addition to verifying that the correct content has been used throughout 
your project, you can check the Count field for rows where a small number of elements have been 
placed—perhaps indicating that a family has been placed in error.

Discover a Bundle of Schedules
Did you know that there are some valuable elements hidden in project templates provided by 
Autodesk? If you create a new project file using the Construction-Default template, you will find 
many schedules related to quality assurance (QA) or quantity surveying (QS). There is also a sheet 
named 000 - Temporary Schedule Sheet, from which you can copy any number of schedules and 
then paste them into your own project.
Note 
Another way to save your schedules is to simply right-click them in the Project Browser 
and choose Save to New File. This will export the schedule to an RVT file and is a good way to 
save any view type.

Quality Control |  909  
Keynotes
As a final example illustrating the use of schedules to manage the consistency of a project, we’ll 
discuss how to use keynotes in the construction document process. Regardless of whether you 
use numerical keys or text-based keys, you will invariably need to use one of them to add anno-
tations to your project. Although the software can easily produce both types of annotation, for 
the sake of ease and consistency we will refer to them as keynotes for the remainder of this section 
because that is the name of the Revit command.
If you are keynoting a project, you are adding annotations that call out specific materials 
or conditions within your details. Those notes not only need to be consistent across multiple 
details but will also link directly back to the project specifications—a separate set of documents 
published outside of the Revit environment. Historically on a project, to maintain any sort of 
consistency between notes in different views, you needed to manually coordinate all the notes 
and manually check them. When you are talking about hundreds of sheets in a drawing set 
and thousands of notes, there is plenty of room for error. In a manual process, you can have 
notes on one sheet that read “Cast-in-Place Concrete,” whereas on another sheet they read “CIP 
Concrete,” and on a third sheet “Cst in Place Conncrete” (note the typos).
The Keynote tool has some built-in checks and balances to ensure a level of consistency when it 
is being used, and we explore the tool further in Chapter 18, “Annotating Your Design.” However, 
it should be pointed out that a keynote legend is another good way for the project manager to 
maintain a level of oversight throughout the project. A keynote legend will give you a running 
list of what notes are being used in a project—even though it is intended to be placed on sheets to 
complement your documentation. This overall list can also be cross-checked against the specifica-
tions so you can ensure that everything you’ve added to the model has a corresponding section.
To create a keynote legend, follow these steps:
	
1.	 On the View ribbon, select the Legends drop-down, and choose Keynote Legend.
The fields for a keynote legend are limited to Key Value and Keynote Text.
	
2.	 Switch to the Filter tab and you will notice an option unique to this type of legend. Check 
the box labeled Filter By Sheet if you want the legend to display only the keynotes shown 
within the same sheet on which the legend is placed. Remember, you can place a legend 
on as many sheets as necessary.
	
3.	 In the Sorting/Grouping tab, you have one additional option to help you review the key-
notes used in your project. If you select the Footer option and choose the Title, Count, 
And Totals option (Figure B.16), you can view how many times each keynote is used 
throughout your project. Remember that this option will also affect the instances of the 
keynote legend already placed on sheets. Use this option sparingly and disable it after

The finished schedule will look like Figure B.17. If you look at the elements displayed in the 
schedule, you’ll notice that it is organized by Construction Specification Institute (CSI) division, 
and every note will be listed so you can verify the spelling and accuracy of each item.

Reviewing Warnings
A seemingly obvious place to troubleshoot your model is the Review Warnings tool. Although 
this technique will do very little to affect your overall file size, the Warnings dialog box will alert 
you to problems within the model that should regularly be addressed to ensure file stability. To 
locate this dialog box, go to the Manage tab in the ribbon, find the Inquiry panel, and click the 
Warnings button.
Selecting this tool will give you the dialog box shown in Figure B.18, which lists all the warn-
ings still active in your project file.
Figure B.18
The Warnings dialog 
box
Warnings are notifications of all types of issues the software has resolving geometry, conflicts, 
or formulas that do not equate. Examples of things that will appear in this dialog box are instances 
where you have multiple elements sitting directly on top of each other, thereby creating inaccurate 

Quality Control |  911  
schedule counts; wall joins that do not properly clean themselves up; wall and room separation 
lines overlapping; stairs that have the wrong number of risers between floors; and so on. This 
dialog box shows you all the times the yellow warning box appeared at the bottom-right corner of 
the screen and you did not take action to solve the problem. Warnings that go unchecked not only 
can compound to create other errors but can also lead to inaccurate reporting in schedules or even 
file corruption. You’ll want to check the Warnings dialog box regularly as part of your periodic 
file maintenance and try to keep the number of warnings to a minimum. You might also notice 
that the dialog box has an Export feature. This feature exports your warning list to an HTML file, 
allowing you to read it at your leisure outside the model environment (Figure B.19). Pulling this 
list into a Microsoft Word or Excel document allows you to distribute the warnings across the 
team for them to be resolved.
Figure B.19
Exporting the 
warnings
In the example shown in Figure B.19, we have 47 warnings in the file. How many warnings in 
a file are too many? That depends on your model, computer capabilities, what the warning types 
are, and your deliverable. For instance, if you are delivering a model to your client or to the con-
tractor, you might have a zero-warning requirement. In that case, all warnings must be resolved 
prior to delivering the model. If you are still actively in the design phase of the project, however, 
you will always have some warnings—it is an inescapable part of the process of iteration. As 
you refine the drawings, problems will be resolved, and as you add new content to the model 
that is in need of resolution, new ones will be created. If you are not worried about a model 
deliverable, you can get away with having fewer than 1000 warnings in the project without too 
much trouble. That said, the cleaner the model, the smoother it will run.

912  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
Another option for finding and resolving warnings is available in the contextual tab of the 
ribbon. When you select one or more objects that have warnings associated with them, you will 
see the Show Related Warnings button at the end of the ribbon. Click this tool to display the 
warning dialog box, and only the warnings related to the selected elements will be displayed. 
This is a good way to resolve model issues as you and your team develop a project. Being proac-
tive about model quality will save you time in the long run. As Benjamin Franklin once said, 
“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Other Tips and Shortcuts
Beyond all the things you can do to hone your skills, you will begin to learn a number of tips 
and shortcuts as your experience grows using Revit Architecture. Here is a compilation of some 
of those tips and tricks:
Let the software do the math.    Revit Architecture is like a big calculator, and it’s very 
good at doing math correctly. Don’t want to spend the time trying to figure out what your 
room size is after you subtract a 3 5/8″ stud and 5/8″ piece of gypsum board from an 11′-2″ 
room? Don’t. If you need to modify a dimension, simply add an equal sign and a formula 
(Figure B.20), and Revit will calculate the value for you. You can do a lot of math within the 
Properties palette. Revit will support everything from simple calculations to the more complex 
Boolean equations.
Figure B.20
Use an equal sign to 
perform calculations.
Figure B.21
Adding an elevator to 
a shaft
Make elevators visible in your plans.    You want to create a shaft that will penetrate all the 
floors of your building and put an elevator in it that will show in all your plans. You could 
do that with an elevator family and cut a series of holes in the floors by editing floor profiles, 
but sometimes those holes lose their alignment. Fortunately, you can do both things at once 
using the Shaft tool found on the Opening panel of the Architecture tab. Here, not only can 
you cut a vertical hole through multiple floors as a single object, but you can also insert 2D 
linework to represent your elevator in plan (Figure B.21). Every time the shaft is cut in a plan 
view, you will see the elevator linework.

Other Tips and Shortcuts |  913  
Orient to view.    Creating perspective views of isolated design elements can be quick and 
easy in a plan or section, but let’s say you want to see that same element in 3D to be able to 
work out the details. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Create a plan region or section cut isolating the area in question. If you’re using a section, 
be sure to set your view depth to something practical.
	
2.	 Open the Default 3D view or any axon of the project.
	
3.	 Right-click the ViewCube®, select Orient To View, and select your view from the context 
menu.
Now, your 3D view will look identical to your section or plan region, but by rotating the 
view, you’ll be able to see that portion in 3D.
Tune your shortcuts.    You can edit your keyboard shortcuts without the hassle of rooting 
through your hard drive looking for a TXT file. To edit your shortcuts, click the Application 
menu and select Options. Choose the User Interface tab and then click the Customize button. 
The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box (Figure B.22) will allow you to edit those shortcuts. Consider 
making common shortcuts the same letter. So instead of pressing VG to get to your Visibility/
Graphic Overrides dialog box, make the shortcut VV for quicker access.
Drag and drop families.    You need to load a family into a project, you have the Explorer 
window open, and you know where the family is, but you don’t want to go through the 
Figure B.22
Editing your keyboard 
shortcuts

914  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting   
laborious effort of navigating across your office’s server environment to get there. No problem. 
You can drag and drop families from Explorer directly into the project file.
Double-click families to edit.    You no longer need to highlight a family and then mouse 
all the way to the ribbon to choose Edit Family. If you want to edit the family, simply double-
click it and the family will launch in the Family Editor. You can customize other double-click 
settings in the Options dialog box, accessed on the Application menu.
Double-click the mouse wheel to activate the Zoom To Fit command for even faster view 
navigation!
Copy a 3D view.    You made the perfect 3D view in your last project, and you can’t figure out 
how to get it into your current project. Fortunately, there’s a way to copy views from one proj-
ect to another. Open both files in the same running instance of the software and then follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 In your perfect view, right-click the 3D view in the Project Browser and choose Show 
Camera from the context menu.
	
2.	 Press Ctrl+C to copy the selected camera.
	
3.	 In your new model, use Ctrl+V to paste the camera, and your view and all its settings are 
now there.
Use a quick-cut poché.    Want to change everything that’s cut in a view without having to 
select every family and change its properties? A quick-cut poché is, well, quick:
	
1.	 Open the view you want to modify.
	
2.	 Using a crossing window, select all the elements within the view.
	
3.	 Right-click and choose Override Graphics In View ➢ By Element from the context menu. 
As shown in Figure B.23, you can choose any filled region in the project and assign it to 
anything that is cut within your model.

Graphics for a  
quick-cut poché

Additional Resources |  915  
Move your ribbon.    Did you know that you can reorganize the tabs on the ribbon and place 
them in any order you’d like? Hold down the Ctrl key and select a tab (like Insert). You can 
drag it left or right to change the order in which they appear.
Additional Resources
A number of resources are available to help you along the way to improve your Revit 
Architecture skills, solve problems, or create new content. In our digital age, there is a wealth 
of information online to help you learn or communicate with users far and wide. So before you 
spend hours trying to solve a particularly challenging problem on your own, you might check 
some of these tools:
Help    Clicking the question mark icon in the upper-right corner of the application will 
take you to the Autodesk Help site at http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2017/ENU. 
This site will give you a basic synopsis of all the tools, buttons, and commands available 
in the application. If you don’t wish to use the online help resource, you can switch to the 
traditional local help file by searching your computer for the version of the Revit.ini file 
specific to your version of Revit software. For the individual user, the Revit.ini is located 
here:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Autodesk Revit 2017
Edit the file in a text-editing application. Find the section heading named Documentation, 
and edit the values as follows:
[Documentation]
UseHelpServer=0
HelpFileLocation=″C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2017\Program\Help\
en-US\WBH\index.html″
HelpBrowser=0
The value for HelpFileLocation in the example above may vary, depending on the localized 
version of the software or modifications to the default installation path. You can also change 
the HelpFileLocation variable to any location on your company’s server.
UseHelpServer can be set to 0 for offline help or to 1 for online help. HelpBrowser is an integer 
that controls the Internet browser used when calling the help content. Set this variable to 0 to 
use the default browser or to 1 to always use Internet Explorer. The variable OnlineHelpLocale 
can be used to direct links to online help into a specific language. Use a locale designation 
such as enu for English-United States or fra for French.
Subscription Support    If you have purchased Revit Architecture on subscription, Autodesk 
offers web-based support. Autodesk’s responses are speedy, the advice is top-notch, and 
chances are your problem has been seen before. Subscription Support can be accessed online 
at http://subscription.autodesk.com.
AUGI    Autodesk User Group International (AUGI) is a source for tips and tricks as well as 
excellent user forums. The forums are free to participate in, and they’re a great place to ask 
questions, find answers, or discuss project workflows. AUGI is located online at www.augi.com. 
Once you’re there, head to the AEC forums.

916  | Appendix B  Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting
