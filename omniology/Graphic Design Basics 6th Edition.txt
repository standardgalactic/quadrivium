PREFACE
Graphic Design Basics introduces students to an exciting and demanding 
fi eld. Design is linked tightly to society as it both refl ects and helps to shape 
the world around us. Designers are part of this dynamic, important process. 
To enter this fi eld requires discipline-specifi c information, hands-on prac-
tice, and an understanding of time-honored principles. Th e sixth edition of 
this text continues to weave a concern for design principles with specialized 
information about contemporary applications in the fi eld of graphic design. 
It continues to showcase inspiring, contemporary work in the fi eld.
Following in the tradition of the previous editions of Graphic Design Basics, 
the sixth edition off ers students a comprehensive introduction to the fi eld of 
graphic design that stresses theory and creative development. Th is edition 
includes additional beautiful, full-color visuals that refl ect many stylistic 
directions. Th e designs and illustrations are chosen from some of the best 
work in historical and contemporary design. Although graphic styles are 
constantly evolving, the structural underpinnings of good design remain 
constant. Th e application of these basic principles leads to successful design 
solutions.
Th e tools of the graphic design fi eld are changing quickly, off ering oppor-
tunities for new complexities of creation and delivery of content. Th e sixth 
edition of Graphic Design Basics provides a guide to generating success-
ful fi les for electronic prepress. It also interweaves samples of successful 
Web design throughout the chapters. “Digital Focus” boxes highlight the 
importance of the computer in graphic design. Th e added “Gallery Profi les” 
introduce the reader to biographies of leaders in the fi eld of graphic design.
Th e pedagogical features in Graphic Design Basics are useful for both 
students and instructors. Each chapter of the sixth edition begins with “Ter-
minology” and “Key Points” to prepare students to get the most out of the 
material. Th e Terminology and Glossary introduce and explain theoretical 
and technical terms, while the Bibliography opens the door to further dis-
coveries and is helpfully arranged by chapter. Th e accompanying Web site is 
a vital part of the text and includes links for additional exploration.

PREFACE
Graphic Design Basics introduces both the form and the function of 
graphic design. It works well for courses in the fi eld of design, as well 
as related courses dealing with visual communication and advertising. 
Updated projects and exercises challenge students to internalize the lessons 
in the text and to learn by doing. Goals and objectives for exercises as well 
as suggestions for critique help students get the most out of these exercises. 
Written and oral presentations are emphasized.
Major changes to the body of the text include the increased presence of 
Web design and new images of the best contemporary designs as well as 
the addition to Digital Focus boxes and Gallery Profi les. And importantly, 
the accompanying Web site explores and expands each chapter’s content.
Chapters 1 and 2 present an introduction to the design process and to the 
fi eld of design history. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 discuss the vital principles of 
visual perception, dynamic balance, and gestalt and how they relate to 
graphic design.
Chapters 6 and 7 focus on principles and practices of text and layout 
design in both print and Web applications. Traditional and electronic color 
are discussed in Chapter 8 along with information about the application 
of color theory on and off  the computer. Illustration and photography are 
presented in Chapter 9, with new samples of a wide variety of digital and 
analog artwork. Chapter 10 gives an enlarged overview of the goals, media, 
and methods of advertising design.
Chapter 11 discusses the process of getting a design successfully into print, 
with an updated step-by-step guide for electronic prepress. Th e second 
part of Chapter 11 gives an overview of preparing fi les for the Web and 
compares the similarities and diff erences between print and Web design.

KEY POINTS
Th is chapter defi nes the fi eld of graphic design and describes its processes. It describes and 
illustrates the stages in the development of a fi nished design. Finally, it introduces potential 
career choices to demonstrate the wide parameters of this challenging fi eld of study.
PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES
Th is book is about applying the principles of visual perception to the practice of visual 
communication. Th e premise is that a course of study in graphic design should begin by 
applying the principles and theory of basic design. Interwoven with information about 
how we perceive and shape a two-dimensional surface will be its application to graphic 
design problems. As you learn specifi c graphic design terminology and techniques in 
this text, you will also discover how closely this ties in with the basic theory of 2-D 
design introduced in previous classes.
Students oft en believe that a class in graphic design or computer graphics is about the 
hardware and soft ware. Th at’s only a partial truth. Th e computer is a powerful, com-
plex, exciting tool to be mastered, but the end product is no better than the concept 
that defi nes it. Th e computer is a tool and a partner that aids in the development of an 
original concept. Th e artist and designer are responsible for the research, concepts, and 
visual development necessary to realizing the fi nal design.
Graphic design is sometimes defi ned as problem solving. Problems in graphic design 
almost always relate to visual communication. Th ere are specifi c methods of creating a 
design that communicates visually and conceptually. Th is text discusses them in simple 
and straightforward language and contains many fi ne illustrations throughout, from 
various periods of art and design history. Discover how applying basic design theory 
and principles can enhance communication. Explore the nature of visual perception, 
the role of visual illusion, and the relationship between visual and verbal communica-
tion, as well as the full range of basic design skills.
Th e study of shapes on a fl at ground yields a great deal of information about how we 
see, understand, and interact with the image on the page. Th is information can be 
applied to solve a wide range of graphic design problems.
A designer is not in search of one solution, but several. Th ere is no one correct answer in 
graphic design, but a rich set of possibilities. Th is book presents principles such as gestalt 
unit forming, balance, emphasis, and eye direction as tools, not as rules. Use them to 
increase your options and widen your vision. Th ese methods may become intuitive aft er 
a while, but in the beginning, practice studying and consciously applying them. Later, 
you will learn to interpolate and experiment, combining formal study with a more per-
sonal, intuitive approach. Th e poster by John Mattos (www.johnmattos.com) shown in 
Figure 1–1 incorporates several design principles to deliver a dynamic sense of excitement. 
Th is portrait was created for the Baltimore Sun newspaper in the Illustrator program.

WHAT IS GRAPHIC DESIGN?
Graphic design is traditionally defi ned as problem 
solving on a fl at, two-dimensional surface. Package 
design, Web design, and multimedia expand the fi eld 
into 3-D and time-based 4-D applications. New-media 
designers sometimes refer to themselves as information 
architects, referring to the importance of organizational 
hierarchy. Th e organization of information is a vital part 
of all graphic design.
Th e designer conceives, plans, and executes designs 
that communicate a specifi c message to a specifi c 
audience within given limitations—fi nancial, physi-
cal, or psychological. A poster design, for example, 
may be restricted to two colors for fi nancial reasons. It 
may be physically restricted in size by the press it will 
be run on or because of the mailing method. It may 
be restricted by the standard viewing distance for a 
poster in a hall or store window, by the size of a Web 
surfer’s screen, or by the age and interests of the group 
for whom it is intended. Nevertheless, the designer 
must say something specifi c to a given audience about 
a given product or piece of information. Communica-
tion within specifi c parameters is the vital element in 
graphic design.
It is this element of communication that makes graphic 
design such an interesting and ever-evolving contempo-
rary fi eld. Designers must present current information 
to modern taste with up-to-date tools, staying informed 
about trends, issues, inventions, and developments. Th e 
Web site design by Planet Propaganda in Figure 1–2 is 
an excellent and lively but at the same time disciplined 
example (www.planetpropaganda.com).

What Is Graphic Design?
Design education is a lifetime activity. Constant change 
requires constant renewal. Graphic design is not a 
career for a slow-paced, nostalgic person. To keep up 
with this fast-changing fi eld, you must approach the 
basic principles, new technologies, and practices with 
a fl exible and curious mindset.
Values
Our current Western society is based on processing 
information more than producing goods. We are in 
the Age of Information, no longer the Industrial Age. 
Th e Industrial Age was characterized by a population 
evenly divided between agricultural and manufactur-
ing industries. Th e development of large-scale energy 
production and metallurgy are examples of technologi-
cal innovations vital to the Industrial Age.
Th e Age of Information is a term applied to the period 
when movement of information became faster than 
physical movement, during the late 20th century. Th e 
product itself, the information disseminated, the point 
of view illustrated, and the mode of communication 
used all contribute to shaping the world in this Age of 
Information.
Ask early in your career how you feel about goals and 
values. As a designer you will make career decisions 
that shape your life and contribute to shaping the char-
acter of our society. Figure 1–3 is an example of design 
work that expresses a personal vision for peace created 
by illustrator Ronald J. Cala II.
A successful designer vividly described one of his early 
career decisions. His fi rst job out of college was as a 
junior designer at a small advertising fi rm, where he 
was put to work designing a hot dog package. Aft er 
preparing several roughs, he presented them to the 
client, only to be sent back to the drawing board. 
Rejected time aft er time, the designer grew more 
familiar with hot dogs than he ever wanted to become. 
He persevered, learned the basics, and now has his own 
fi rm specializing in educational and service-oriented 
accounts. Th is allows him more creative freedom and 
work that is consistent with his personal values.

What Is Graphic Design?
April Greiman, a well known contemporary artist and 
designer, created this mural (Figure 1–4), titled “Big 
Bowl of Rice Finished.” A video still of this 8200-square-
foot public art commission was captured and translated 
into oil paint. Rice is a symbol of abundance. Th is is an 
example of creative freedom that is expressed through 
an integration of media on a large scale.
Most beginning design jobs do not usually off er many 
opportunities for the exercise of creative freedom. For 
the most part, we are designers working in a con-
sumer society. Designers are integrally involved in the 
production and marketing of consumer goods and 
disseminating information. However, we must consider 
our potential impact on society. Th e major artistic 
movements of the 20th century each had a theory of 
society that provided a structure and direction for their 
artwork. Th e futurists, constructivists, dadaists, and 
surrealists actively helped defi ne and refl ect their soci-
ety and their role in relationship to it. As designers, we 
have a vital role that needs to be continually examined 
as it shift s and changes.
Creating a design that is appropriate for a given 
product and its audience may not always give you an 
opportunity to exercise your own sense of aesthetics. 
Laying out a motorcycle products catalog may not pro-
vide much of an opportunity to experiment with visual 
eff ects. But the application of sound design principles 
always applies. Th is in itself can be very rewarding. In 
addition to directing the visual to a particular audi-
ence, the designer must also consider the individual 
client’s preferences. Th ere are many diff erent kinds of 
jobs in this fi eld, and a beginning designer is wise to 
plan on staying at an entry position only until skills 
and experience permit advancement.
Each of us must satisfy our own values in our career 
path, as well as learn to satisfy the requirements of the 
workplace. Try asking yourself these questions: Are 
there products or points of view you do (or do not) 
want to promote? How important is sala  ry? What 
will make this career successful for you? What kind of 
lifestyle do you want for yourself? How hard are you 
willing to work? Where do you want to be in 10 years? 
How can you plan to achieve your goals?
Design Fields
Th e fi eld of applied design includes industrial design, 
environmental design, graphic design, and Web and 
multimedia design. Industrial design is the design and 
development of three-dimensional functional objects. 
Figure 1–5 shows a strikingly elegant teapot by Mari-
anne Brandt, considered an important landmark in the 
history of functional design. Ms. Brandt (1893–1983) 
is best known as a Bauhaus designer and metalworker, 
although she also worked in a variety of other media. 
She is regarded as one of the leaders of the Bauhaus 
style. Brandt’s designs for household objects such as 
teapots, lamps, and ashtrays are considered the origins 
of modern industrial design.
Machines, tools, kitchen implements, and other 
products are among the objects shaped by the indus-
trial designer. Package design for these objects is oft en 
placed in the category of graphic design because it

must be designed and printed fl at before assembling. 
Th e industrial designer attempts to simplify the use 
and manufacture of objects as well as increase their 
safety and effi  ciency.
Environmental design is a large general category that 
includes the design of buildings, landscapes, and inte-
riors. Again, the designer attempts to fashion designs 
that are safe, effi  cient, and aesthetic. Environmental 
design develops physical environments. It focuses on 
engaging people as they move through space. Deborah 
Sussman has long been a leader in the fi eld of environ-
mental graphic design. Figure 1–6 shows her dynamic 
integration of typography and environment. She has 
worked at the interface of graphic and environment 
design for more than 30 years. Her credits include the 
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Seattle’s opera house, 
and Disney World. She creates permanent and tempo-
rary installations for architectural and public spaces.
Graphic design is the design of things people see and 
read. Th e fi eld is constantly expanding. Posters, books, 
signs, billboards, advertisements, commercials, bro-
chures, package design, Web sites, and motion graphics 
are what graphic designers create. Th ey attempt to 
maximize both communication and aesthetic quality.
Web and multimedia design are the design of interac-
tive, oft en motion-based graphics. Graphic designers 
are oft en expected to have skills in both print and Web 
design. Multimedia design is information in more than 
one form. It may include the use of text, audio, graph-
ics, animations, and full-motion video. Figure 1–7 
shows a still from Planet Propaganda’s TV ad sampler 
for the Wisconsin Film Festival. View the full multime-
dia creation on this book’s accompanying Web site. 
Buildings, environments, products, Web sites, and 
written communications aff ect us whether they have 
been carefully and deliberately designed or not. A 
printed piece always communicates more than words 
alone, because it uses a visual language. It may, how-
ever, communicate exactly the opposite of the intended 
message. It can damage the image of a company or 
cause. Learning to apply the theory of design and infor-
mation processing to the practice of graphic design 
helps achieve the intended communication. Th ere is an 
intricate relationship between form and function. Th at is 
the underlying premise of this text. All information is 
structured to help with this goal.
Designers must interface with fi elds other than their 
own. Th ey need to address the basic marketing con-

dynamic 3-D signage for the Hollywood & Highland devel-
opment, which houses the Kodak Theatre (home of the 
Academy Awards), cinemas, shopping, entertainment, and 
overnight accomodations. The designs for project identity, 
signs and graphics use the interplay of shadows and light 
to evoke Hollywood glamour. Deborah Sussman is recog-
nized as a pioneer of environmental graphic design. Visit 
their Web site for more details. Courtesy of the studio.

The Design Process
cerns of the client; the concerns of colleagues such as 
illustrators, photographers and Web designers; and the 
requirements of the printing and online distribution 
processes.
Some graphic designers do a whole range of work—
typography, illustration, photography, corporate 
identity, logo design, and advertising. Others specialize 
in only one of these areas. Whatever area of design or 
illustration you pursue, it is always best to follow the 
design process.
THE DESIGN PROCESS
Research
Th e fi rst step in preparing a design solution is research, 
or determining the parameters of the problem. Who 
is the audience? What constraints are there in format, 
budget, and time? What is the goal of the project?
Th e next step is to gather and study all the related 
materials. Presenting this design to a client (or an 
instructor) will be easier if it is backed with solid 
research and justifi ed from a perspective the client 
will understand. Designers may work in a large fi rm 
or agency where most of the research and informa-
tion gathering is done by marketing professionals. 
Visual research, however, is the designer’s area. 
It’s important to know what has been done before 
and what is being created locally and nationally for 
this type of design situation. Develop a feeling for 
contemporary work by studying design annuals, peri-
odicals, and Web sites.
Designers also keep an electronic and/or print fi le of 
anything that is interesting or well done. A personal 
fi le of such samples can be useful to look through for 
ideas to build on. Subscribe to graphic design maga-
zines and plan to save all the back issues. Th e Internet 
is also an excellent source of good design. For example, 
the AIGA Web site shows thousands of award winning 
designs. Never simply lift  another designer’s solution; 
that is unethical. Looking at how someone else solved a 
particular problem, however, is part of your education. 
Designers are expected to build on the work of others. 
We do not create in a vacuum, but are infl uenced and 
inspired by the thousands of samples of good and bad 
design we are exposed to every day.
Your challenge as a beginning designer is to expand 
your visual vocabulary. Use that vocabulary to build 
new designs. Th is is similar to an author using a word 
vocabulary developed over time. An author does not 
have to create a new alphabet or a new language in 
order to create an original piece of literature. He or she 
needs to combine these elements in an original fashion.
As part of the research stage, search for a creative 
approach to your design problem in as many ways as 
possible. Build your visual and conceptual vocabulary. 
Try looking up a dictionary defi nition of your topic. Look 
in an encyclopedia for additional background. Search the 
Internet for information on the topic. Use a thesaurus. 
Make a word-association list of everything you can think 
of that is associated with your topic. Save personally 
signifi cant visuals and collectibles. Approach a design as 
both prose and poetry. Be both logical and intuitive.

CHAPTER 1  Applying the Art of Design
Thumbnails
A designer needs to explore many alternative solutions. 
Th umbnails are the second step in the design process. 
Th ey are idea sketches that provide visual evidence of 
the thinking, searching, and sorting process that leads 
to fi nal solutions.
Exercising the mind with thumbnail sketches is like 
exercising any muscle. Th e more it is exercised, the 
more powerful it gets. Th e more you work to develop 
ideas through small, preliminary sketches (pencil or 
computer), the richer will be the range of solutions 
available to choose from for the fi nal design. Never 
shortcut this stage, because it determines the strength 
of the fi nal solution. For a student, the thumbnails are 
more important than the fi nal project, because they 
demonstrate thinking, experimentation, and growth. 
Keep these thumbnails. Th e ideas in them may be of 
use to you in other projects, and prospective employers 
may wish to see evidence of the fl exibility and tenacity 
of your thinking.
Figure 1–8 shows a series of thumbnails created 
by designer Candy Th ieme for her client. She used 
Adobe Illustrator to generate very polished “thumbs.” 
PmFAQtory’s goal is to provide prospective clients 
across the United States with project management–
related consulting services and products. Th e shield 
device refl ects a strong defense in battle. Th e triangle 
refl ects scope, time, and cost. See this book’s accom-
panying Web site for more information on this design 
process. 
Th umbnails are usually small because they are meant 
to be fast and not detailed. Th ey are drawn in propor-
tion to the dimensions of the fi nished piece. Fill a sheet 
of paper with ideas. Never reject an idea; just sketch it 
and go on. Work through the idea with your pencil or 
mouse from every perspective you can imagine. Th en 
try taking one good idea and doing several variations 
on it. If you’re using a pencil, tracing paper or light-
weight bond is excellent for this purpose. You may also 
want to cut and paste and recombine existing images 
1–8 Freelance designer Candy Thieme created this series 
of thumbnail proposals for her client’s logo. The ﬁ nal 
choice is shown in a business card prepared for press 
output in Adobe Illustrator. A description of the process 
can be found at this text’s Web site.

The Design Process
for new eff ects. It may be faster to work at a size deter-
mined by existing elements. In that case, the thumb-
nails may become larger or smaller. Th e principle of 
“sketching through” ideas holds true no matter what 
the size or format of your preliminary investigation. Be 
as neat and precise as is necessary to show the relation-
ship between elements and their general shapes. Th e 
stages of thumbnails, roughs, comps, and camera-ready 
art oft en blend together when executed on a computer. 
Th e danger with this blending is that although soft ware 
may help provide quick, workable solutions, it can be 
tempting to shortcut the planning stages. Th umbnails 
are oft en successfully done by hand. Th ey are vital to 
good design and in whatever size or stage of polish 
they must exhibit fl exible, tenacious visual thinking. 
Figure 1–9 shows how the pen-and-ink thumbnails for 
the cover design of the fi ft h edition of this text investi-
gated a variety of approaches.
Roughs
Once the range of ideas has been fully explored, select 
the best thumbnails for refi nement into more pol-
ished half or full size designs called roughs. Talk this 
choice over with other designers and with the instruc-
tor. Later, as a professional designer, you will present 
the thumbnails to an art director or the roughs to a 
client for review. Or you may be the art director who 
is reviewing someone else’s design. Oft en, consider-
able redefi ning and rethinking occur at these stages. 
Th e thumbnail process may begin all over again. Be 
prepared to be fl exible in this fi eld.
When using computer, you may want to do a full-size 
rough. Th e purpose is to test whether the original 
idea works on a larger scale. Take this opportunity to 
work out small problem areas that you could not deal 
with or foresee at the thumbnail stage. Th e typestyle,

the other shapes, the relationship of these elements 
to the edge of the format, and the color and value 
distribution can all be refi ned at this stage. Figure 1–10 
shows three of the rough designs presented for the 
cover of the previous edition of this text. Consider 
which you prefer, and what new design you would 
propose.
Comprehensives
Th e comprehensive, or comp, is the fourth step in the 
design process. It is the piece of art presented to the 
client for fi nal approval. Although based on the rough, 
it is much more precisely executed. Once again, it is 
important to consult with art directors, editors, or the 
instructor before choosing the rough idea to refi ne for 
a fi nal solution.
Th e client can judge the design solution from the comp 
because it looks much like the fi nished printed piece. 
Th ere is no need to explain “what would go there” or 
how “this would be smoother.” A comp is usually com-
puter generated, with all components assembled and 
exactly positioned. It can include such diverse elements 
as photographs, computer-generated type, electronic 
illustrations, and a scanned pen-and-ink rendering.
In most projects from this text, the comp will be the 
fi nal step. Th ese comps will form the basis of a student 
portfolio that is built upon throughout a course of 
study. In the workplace, the fi nal stage is the printed 
project.
Comps take diff erent forms depending on the media 
for which they are intended. Television and fi lm ideas 
are presented as storyboards, with key scenes drawn 
in simplifi ed and stylized fashion, or as abbreviated 
animation saved on CD. Th e three-dimensional comp 
for a package design may be presented in multiples in 
order to demonstrate the stacking display possibili-
ties of the package. Figure 1–11 shows the potential 
complexity of a CD package. A multipage publication 
such as an annual report or a newsletter is usually 
represented by the cover and certain key pages in the 
layout design. A Web site proposal, on the other hand, 
is presented to the client with a fl ow chart and key 
pages completed.
Roughs and comps can be sent to a client for approval 
via CD, e-mail, or fax. Th is streamlines the process and 
makes the designer and client’s diverse locales a less 
important consideration.

CHAPTER 1  Applying the Art of Design
Presentation
Practice promoting your concept verbally before present-
ing the visual solution. Refer to the client’s perspective 
and goals. Discuss the design enthusiastically in terms 
the client or art director can understand. Be prepared, 
however, to listen and to compromise. If revisions 
are called for, note them carefully. In this text, stu-
dents are oft en asked to write a brief presentation to 
accompany the visual solution. Class critiques provide 
an opportunity to practice verbal presentation and 
listening skills.
Ready for Press
Once accepted, the job is now ready for production, 
as discussed in Chapter 11. Th e comprehensive shown 
to the client may look exactly like the fi nished piece, 
but it oft en cannot be used to produce the fi nal printed 
product. Everything must be sent to the printer ready 
for press. In a two- or three-color design, printer’s inks 
must be indicated. Paper selection is an important part 
of the process.
Th e fi le must be cleanly prepared, with all links and 
fonts included. Electronic files that print well inside 
a classroom may not “RIP” on an imagesetter at the 
printing company. Figure 1–8 shows a final print-
ready version of a file prepared in Adobe Illustra-
tor. Many designers are responsible for selecting 
and communicating with a printer. Often the work 
must be bid on by two or three printers, giving each 
an opportunity to estimate costs. Finding a good 
printer and establishing an easy working rela-
tionship are important. A good printer can be an 
excellent reference for answering tricky production 
questions and suggesting alternate solutions to an 
expensive design.
Th e fi rst chapters in this text focus on building con-
cepts and understanding design structure, whereas 
later chapters discuss the reproduction process. Build 
a strong design before focusing on how to reproduce 
it. Begin the fi rst project with a respect for precision, 
accuracy, and cleanliness. Th ere should be no compro-
mise with perfection in this line of work.
CAREERS
Th e design fi eld encompasses many working environ-
ments. What suits one person may feel like a limitation 
or undue pressure to another. It is wise to have an idea 
of what the opportunities are before beginning a job 
search. Th e following categories give an idea of the 
array of design positions available.
Design Studios
Clients with various needs and backgrounds may seek 
the assistance of a design studio. Th e studio will have 
designers, production artists, account service repre-
sentatives, and oft en illustrators and photographers on 
staff  or on call. Design studios hire freelance creative 
help when their regular staff  is too busy or lacks spe-
cifi c skills to handle a project. Designers working in a 
studio generally have other artists around to discuss 
and share ideas. Th e number of working hours spent 
on each assignment is logged and the time billed to a 
client’s account or to the studio itself. A high value is 
placed on an ability to work quickly and with a clear 
understanding of the client’s needs and preferences. 
Clients consist primarily of various advertising agen-
cies and large and small companies or institutions. Th e 
graphic design work prepared for these clients includes 
brochures, mailers, illustration and photography, cata-
logs, display materials, Web sites, and promotional vid-
eos. Studios vary in size and in their client roster. Small 
studios with only a couple of designers who have good 
skills and equipment can provide full-service design. 
Such a small studio can provide a rich opportunity for 
design variety. Larger studios can provide room for 
advancement and a stimulating creative environment 
with other designers. Figure 1-12 shows an illustration 
by Matt Zumbo, who has his own design studio.
In-House Design
Many institutions employ their own in-house design 
staff . Th ese in-house designers serve the particular needs 
of a wide variety of institutions, including hospitals, 
banks, newspapers, insurance companies, publishers, 
museums, colleges and universities, and large and small 
manufacturing concerns. In-house design organizations 
vary greatly according to the type of product or service 
their institution provides. Figure 1–13 is a personal 
statement by university designer McRay Magleby. For 
many years, Magleby was creative director at Brigham 
Young University, where he and his staff  produced 
publications, books, and posters. Recently, he worked for 
the University of Utah, while also creating independent 
design projects. How magazine named him as one of the 
“Twelve Most Infl uential Designers Today.”
In-house designers work on projects that relate to the 
parent institution’s activities. Individual designers 
may keep track of their hours if the design depart-
ment bills its time to other departments. But many 
in-house design operations off er services free to the 
other departments within the company. Individual 
designers may work closely with the client or receive

An in-house design organization may lack the challenge 
of interpreting and representing various clients that a 
design studio provides. However, an advantage to work-
ing in an in-house operation is the opportunity to get to 
know one company in depth by developing a relationship 
with it and its various departments. Oft en the deadline 
pressure is less and the job security better than in a 
studio. Th e growth of computer soft ware has caused a 
boom in in-house design as more and more companies 
fi nd it possible to meet many of their publication needs 
in-house.

CHAPTER 1  Applying the Art of Design
Printing Companies
Many positions for designers exist at local printing 
companies. Th ese companies sometimes have their 
own in-house design departments or hire interns to 
do prepress work. A printing company can be an 
excellent place to gain valuable experience in the tech-
nical aspects of reproduction.
Advertising Agencies
Ideas and sales are the cornerstones of the advertising 
agency. It is dominated by people who deal in words. 
Account executives bring in the jobs and develop the 
advertising concepts with the creative director. Th e 
creative director, designer, and copywriter execute the 
concepts, although the number of people involved and 
the exact tasks vary from agency to agency. Projects 
cover all forms of print and multimedia advertising, 
including fi lm and video work, TV, packaging, display, 
print ads, billboards, and Internet applications. A good 
creative director is versatile. He or she is skilled at con-
ceptualizing and presenting ideas verbally and visually 
as well as directing others and organizing assignments. 
More money is spent on advertising than on any other 
area of graphic design, which is refl ected in the salary a 
designer can expect to earn in this fi eld.
Freelance
Working as a freelance artist allows a maximum 
amount of freedom, but it calls for certain business-
related skills. Personal promotion, networking, and 
a constant vigilance to fi nd new customers will help 
establish a freelance career. Good organizational skills 
in billing and record keeping, excellent design and 
illustration ability, and hard work keep a freelance 
business going. Computers make it possible to live 
outside a metropolitan area and still maintain client 
contact once it is established. One of the drawbacks to 
a freelance career is the lack of health insurance and 
retirement benefi ts. It can also be comparatively lonely 
though creatively fulfi lling work. Figure 1-12 was cre-
ated by Matt Zumbo, who has his own illustration busi-
ness. Visit his web site to see the full range of artwork 
created for a wide variety of clients.
New Media
Web site creation calls for design skills in page layout, 
logo design, scripting, illustration, typography, and 
animation. Many companies now use the Internet to 
communicate with prospective clients, and designers 
play an important part in facilitating this informational 
and persuasive communication. Motion graphics and 
multimedia design are exciting and rewarding careers.
THE CHALLENGE
Th e challenge of being a graphic designer involves 
working through the restrictions and demands of the 
design process. It involves visualizing the completed 
job, although the actual fi nished product will not be 
done by hand. It may be completed on a press with 
printer’s paper and inks, with elements that may have 
been photographed or drawn by other artists, and with 
copy written by others. Or it may be shown on a Web 
site or via another electronic mode of presentation. It 
involves meeting personal design standards as well as the 
needs of the client and the audience. It calls for organiza-
tion and self-discipline to meet the constant deadline 
pressure. In the classroom, students generally get one 
project at a time and a generous length of time to com-
plete it. Th e emphasis in school is on learning. On the 
job, designers work on several projects at once and must 
uphold design standards while concentrating on time 
and money issues. Designers must constantly update 
their education and stay current with new technologies. 
Technology makes major changes in the design fi eld 
every year, and greater changes are always on the way.
Th e fi nal design challenge is to take a responsible stance 
in the world. Traditionally, it has been the fi ne artist 
who has set new visual trends and opened fresh cre-
ative ways to see ourselves. Th e designer now also plays 
this role. Figure 1–14 by illustrator and artist Diane

DIGITAL FOCUS
Careers
Graphic designers work at an array of jobs, using 
a variety of software to prepare their ﬁ les. Opin-
ions differ on how best to prepare a student for 
this ﬁ eld. Some academic programs separate their 
software instruction from their classes in graphic 
design concepts but teach them concurrently. 
Other programs begin the ﬁ rst classes with non-
digital techniques, intending to build strong design 
skills through concentrating on principles before 
spending time on software rendering skills. Some 
programs integrate the two from the beginning 
in all classes, believing they are best and most 
efﬁ ciently learned together. Whichever approach 
a program takes, a designer needs a command of 
both graphic design principles and concepts and 
the related digital techniques.

EXERCISE
As a class, research the types of employment 
opportunities in your geographic area. Find 
samples of a design ﬁ rm, an in-house facility, 
and an advertising agency. Arrange a ﬁ eld trip. 
If a ﬁ eld trip is not an option, do the research on 
the Internet, investigating the designers in your 
area or those presented in this chapter. Prepare a 
brief report, sharing the verbal and visual informa-
tion with classmates.
Visit the accompanying Web site for research links 
and step by step interviews with the artist. 
Exercise
One of the issues facing contemporary design is the 
impact of our printed product on the environment. Recy-
cled paper products are part of an attempt to lessen the 
negative impact of printed materials on the environment. 
Online graphics are also helping. Th e aesthetic qualities 
of design aff ect our lives in many ways, but the total eff ect 
of a design solution has numerous varied and important 
impacts on our lives. As designers, we are continually in 
the process of redefi ning our fi eld. We need to examine 
how our culture and other cultures function, and how 
our perceptions and our values shape, and are shaped by, 
the world around us.

HISTORY
KEY POINTS 
For a graphic designer, the movement of cultural ideas is as important to understand 
as changes in visual style. In fact, they are closely related. Design is aff ected by areas as 
diverse as concepts in fi ne art, science, psychology, and the development of new tech-
nologies. Most of these combined interests are shown in the whimsical contemporary 
creation in Figure 2–1 by Nam June Paik. Th e study of design history can provide 
inspiration and insight into the future of design. Th is chapter’s brief overview shows 
how design developed both as an art form and as a refl ection of society. Hopefully, it 
will set the stage for further study. Th e history of art and design can provide a great deal 
of inspiration to contemporary designers.
THE BEGINNING
Th e birth of graphic design can 
be traced back 30,000 years to 
cave painting or about 550 years 
to Gutenberg’s invention of the 
printing press and its use of mov-
able type (Figure 2–2). Whatever 
we choose to call the origins, the 
explosive development during the 
last decade of the 19th century is 
a good place to begin this chapter.
Th e Industrial Revolution brought 
about new attitudes and inven-
tions, both of which contrib-
uted to the sudden growth of 
graphic design. It was a period 
of rapid industrial growth, 
when machines and large-scale 
production replaced hand tools. 
It began in the mid- to late 1700s in England and spread to other countries in the 
1800s. Th is period lasted in the United States and Europe through most of the 1800s, as 
nations shift ed from an agricultural to a manufacturing base. A spirit of innovation and 
progress gave rise to a new interest in providing information to an entire culture rather 
than only to an affl  uent elite. Th e growth of population centers, industry, and a money-
based economy all increased the need for the dissemination of information. Advertising

CHAPTER 2  Graphic Design History
fl ourished during this exciting time, and great strides 
were made in printing. Th e fi rst photographic metal 
engraving was invented in 1824; the fi rst halft one 
screen was made in 1852. A halft one screen is a pattern 
of dots of diff erent sizes used to simulate and print a 
continuous-tone image in color or black and white. 
Color process work was fi rst successfully printed in 
1893. Th e fi rst automated steam press for lithography 
was designed around 1868, and the fi rst off set press 
in 1906.
Advancement in stone lithography color prints in the 
1880s encouraged artists to work directly on the stone 
for multiple reproductions of large-scale posters. Th ey 
were freed from the stiff , geometric confi nes of the 
letterpress. Stone lithography involves drawing the 
image on a stone by using a greasy black lithographic 
pencil. Plates are made for each color. Th e resulting 
burst of sensual and decorative images in the advertis-
ing posters of the time is classifi ed as art nouveau. Th e 
movement began in France, and the artists most closely 
associated with its development are the Frenchmen 
Jules Chéret (Figure 2–3) and Henri de Toulouse-
Lautrec and the Czech Alphonse Mucha (Figure 9-24).
Toulouse-Lautrec was primarily a painter and print-
maker who produced only about 32 posters as well as 
music and book jacket designs. Mucha is best known for 
the furniture, carpets, jewelry, and posters he designed 
for the famous actress Sarah Bernhardt. Jules Chéret is 
now called the father of the modern poster. He produced 
more than a thousand posters, some of them close to 
7 feet tall. Th is size was achieved by joining sections 
mounted on walls. Posters brought art out of the galler-
ies and into the streets and homes of the working class. 
Art nouveau became an international style that spanned 
the period from 1890 to 1910. Its organic, decorative 
quality stressed the invention of original forms that were 
oft en inspired by nature. Th ese forms and shapes were 
applied not only to graphic design but also to product 
design and craft s. Its infl uence has lasted much longer 
than the offi  cial dates for the period.

The Beginning
All of the functional arts grew during this time. In 
the United States, Louis Tiff any created stained glass 
windows, lamps, and glassware. Figure 2–4 shows early 
advertising design in the United States fl ourishing in 
the form of trade cards. Th ese are small cards that busi-
nesses would give to potential clients. Th ey are an early 
form of our business cards.
Scottish architect, designer, and watercolorist Charles 
Rennie Mackintosh; his wife, Margaret MacDonald; and 
her sister, Frances MacDonald, developed furniture and 
cutlery designs as well as interior and graphic designs 
that celebrated the organic forms of nature (Figure 2–5).
An English artist whose work is an important example 
of art nouveau style is Aubrey Beardsley. A curving, 
sensual line and a compelling tension between the 
fi gure and background (Figure 2–6) characterize his 
illustrations for Oscar Wilde’s Salome and other books. 
A prolifi c artist with an enduring reputation, Beardsley 
died at age 26.
Among the many North American art nouveau art-
ists is Maxfi eld Parrish, an illustrator for Harper’s 
and Life magazines as well as many other clients 
(Figure 2–7). Parrish worked as an illustrator for 
the fi rst three decades of the 20th century, creat-
ing book, magazine, and advertising illustrations 
inspired by art nouveau. Figure 2–8 is by the highly 
prolifi c German designer Ludwig Holwein, who also 
produced artwork for three decades, primarily creat-
ing advertising posters.
Th e legacy of art nouveau is not only its stylistic surface 
treatments but also its concern with the interrelationship 
of materials, processes, and philosophy. Not all reac-
tions to the Industrial Revolution embraced progress. 
William Morris founded the Kelmscott Press in 1890 
against what he regarded as the mass-produced, 
inferior, inhuman product of the machine. Styles of 
past eras were being copied in art schools and factories 
with an emphasis on quantity over quality. He and the 
writer-philosopher John Ruskin wished to renew an

CHAPTER 2  Graphic Design History
appreciation for handcraft ed, unique, labor-intensive 
products. Morris worked in many diff erent media, 
including fabric, rugs, wallpaper, furniture, and typog-
raphy. Th anks to Morris, the common person’s home 
and furnishings became worthy of an artist’s design. 
His highly stylized hand-printed books and hand-
woven tapestries are wonderful examples of English 
art nouveau (Figure 2–9). Morris was a key fi gure in 
the English arts and craft s movement. Th is movement 
originated in England around the middle of the 19th 
century, and its infl uence spread to continental Europe 
and the United States. It rejected the heavy ornamenta-
tion of the Victorian style in favor of good craft sman-
ship and clean design. An intensely romantic idealist, 
Morris was deeply concerned with the ethics of art. 
He equated bad design with a faulty ethical system. 
He is credited, along with the Bauhaus, with bringing 
about a renewal of the standards of craft smanship. His 
work was an inspiration to European modernists who, 
in turn, greatly infl uenced American art of the 20th 
century.
THE TURN OF THE CENTURY
Th e turn of the 20th century brought fundamental 
changes in our understanding of the world. In 1905 
Albert Einstein made public his theory of relativity 
and altered our ideas of space and time. We began to 
consider them interrelated variables instead of isolated 
absolutes. Aft er Sigmund Freud published Th e Inter-
pretation of Dreams in 1909, dreams were no longer 
considered simply fantastic, clearly divided from real-
ity. Sexuality also was no longer safely reserved for the 
bedroom but appeared in various symbols in everyday 
life. Th e accepted boundaries of reality began to shift .
Th e philosophy of existentialism further undermined 
faith in absolutes by suggesting that there is no single 
correct answer or moral action. Instead we are individ-
ually responsible for shaping meaning. Th is philosophy 
argues that humans defi ne themselves by the choices 
and actions they freely and consciously make. Subjec-
tivity rules over absolutes.
Meanwhile, travel and the growth of a communications 
network made it possible for us to hear of cultures 
with diff erent lifestyles, beliefs, and perceptions. Th is 
communications explosion and the related technology 
continue to be one of the most important infl uences on 
society today. As designers we play an important part 
in its development. Art and design both refl ect society 
and help shape it.
In the beginning of the 20th century, cubism empha-
sized the fl at surface of the canvas. Th e relationship 
between the fi gures and the picture plane itself was 
ambiguous. Cubism infl uenced many movements, 
including futurism. (See Figure 2-12.) As cubism

The Turn of the Century
developed, shapes became increasingly abstracted, 
showing objects from multiple points of view, with 
transparent overlapping. Such shapes denied an 
absolute, inviolate place in space for any single object. 
In these respects, cubism infl uenced the subsequent 
development of 20th-century design. Nature was no 
longer the only form of reality to depict. Th e human 
mind itself played a part in structuring reality, and 
subjectivity ruled over absolutes. Th e cubist practice 
of integrating letterforms into paintings infl uenced the 
typography of subsequent art and design movements.
In Germany, Friedrich Nietzsche and the nihilist 
rebellion contributed to expressionism, which appeared 
around 1905. Th e nihilists championed the indepen-
dence of the individual, questioning the validity of all 
forms of preconceived ideas and social norms. Th e 
expressionist movement aspired to show subjective 
emotions and responses rather than objective reality. 
Th e idea that art is primarily self-expression led to a dra-
matic nonnaturalistic art, typifi ed by Oskar Kokoschka 
and Ernst Kirchner (Figure 2–10).
In Paris in 1905 the fi rst exhibition of a group of art-
ists who would be called les fauves (“the wild beasts”) 
was held. Led by Henri Matisse and similar in look to 
expressionism, with its open disregard of the forms 
of nature, fauvism favored wildly expressive, subjec-
tive, and nonlocal colors. Fauvism ended around 1908; 
expressionism ended around 1920. Neo-expressionism, 
infl uenced by the expressionists and the fauves, shows 
up today in contemporary illustration. Th e concept 
of local color versus arbitrary color enriches artwork 
today.
In 1890 the German psychologist Christian von Ehren-
fels published an essay called “On Gestalt Qualities.” 
In it he proposed that the gestalt (total entity) is larger 
than the sum of its parts. Ehrenfels suggested that the 
parts interact to form a new whole. Our perception of 
an object is infl uenced by the arrangement of objects 
around it. Th is work pointed the way to another new 
idea. Reality could be seen as dependent on context 
rather than as absolute. Th is is an important part of 
our contemporary understanding of design and visual 
perception.
In 1910 at the Frankfurt Institute of Psychology, Max 
Wertheimer, an admirer of Ehrenfels, began research 
on apparent movement, which is the basis for the

CHAPTER 2  Graphic Design History
motion picture. He asked why we perceive some 
images as belonging together and others as not. He 
arrived at the gestalt principle of unit forming, which 
describes how we organize and interpret patterns from 
our environment. Simply put, things that are similar 
will be perceptually grouped together. (For a more 
detailed description of unit-forming factors, see Chap-
ter 5.) Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffk  a carried on 
Wertheimer’s investigations, and later Rudolf Arnheim 
applied these principles to art and visual perception 
throughout much of the 20th century.
Germany also gave birth to Peter Behrens, a pictorial 
and graphic artist who moved into architecture. He was 
an artist of the Deutsche Werkbund, founded in 1907. 
Inspired by William Morris and the English arts and 
craft s movement, the Werkbund artists believed in exam-
ining the moral questions inherent in art and in prevent-
ing commercial and industrial abuse. Behrens received 
the fi rst corporate identity job in the history of design. 
AEG, a large German corporation, asked him to design 
everything including its architecture and its advertising 
and products (Figure 2–11). Behrens taught Walter 
Gropius, who would later become famous as a leader 
of the Bauhaus, which we will discuss soon. See the 
accompanying Web site for links to investigate these 
ideas that surfaced in the early 20th century. 
MODERNISM
Th e development of the European modernist era 
spanned roughly from 1908 to 1933, from the early 
days of cubism until Hitler’s rise. Modernism encom-
passed fi ne art, graphic design, and architecture 
through various movements, including cubism, 
futurism, Plakatstil, suprematism, Dada, de Stijl, 
the Bauhaus, and constructivism. Many artists and 
designers fi t into multiple categories.
Th e years before World War I brought new movements 
that continued to expand our notion of reality. Futur-
ism showed time itself on canvas by capturing motion 
through multiple images. Th e movement was estab-
lished around 1909 by the Italian poet Emilio Marinetti 
and developed by artists such as Giacomo Balla, Gino 
Severini, and artist-designer E. McKnight Kauff er, who 
spent much of his career as an illustrator. Th e futurist 
artists were so named for their optimistic belief that 
the machines of the Industrial Age would lead to a 
better future. Ironically and sadly, many artists of the 
movement were killed in World War I. Figure 2–12 
is a futurist painting of men and machines during the 
war. Th e combination of war, art, death, and a belief 
in machines is poignantly displayed in this painting. 
Futurism’s infl uence, however, continued beyond that 
period. Motion pictures were popular by 1910, and 
they widened our visual reality, creating images that 
moved through time, as the futurists hoped their paint-
ings would do. Th e futurists, originating in Italy in the 
early 20th century have ties to cubism.
Plakatstil, a fl at-color pictorial design style that 
maintained a balance between 2-D design structure 
and imagery, emerged in Germany early in the 20th 
century. Lucian Bernhard created a compelling series 
of advertising posters using imagery made from fl at 
colors with an emphasis on shape, combined with the 
product name (Figure 2–13).
Around this same time, another movement surfaced that 
would also infl uence graphic design. Dada was founded

ment itself, had no meaning, according to the Dadaists.

Th e Dadaists were extremely important in 20th-century 
art and philosophy because they questioned meaning 
itself with an assault on all accepted values and conven-
tional behavior. Marcel Duchamp exhibited such things 
as bicycle wheels, urinals, and bottle racks, challenging 
the criteria by which we defi ne something as art. He 
stated, “I was interested in ideas—not merely in visual 
products. I wanted to put painting again at the service of 
the mind.” Th e Dada poet Guillaume Apollinaire created 
a series of “Calligrammes” around 1918 that seemed 
to break every known rule of typography. His concrete 
poetry was poetry in which both typography and layout 
add to the overall meaning. Th e written word exists as 
visual marks of white on black or as patterns of sound.
One of the many Dada publications, Der Dada, 
introduced photomontage, which was characterized by 
an intentional disorder. Letters of all types and sizes, 
various languages, and dictionary illustrations mingled 
(Figure 2–14). Figurative photographic images were 
treated with the same freedom from conventions. With 
“rayographs” or photograms and techniques such as 
solarization, Man Ray made an important contribution 
to graphic design in the form of photomontage.
Hannah Höch (Figure 2–15) and John Heartfi eld (Figure 
5–4) were also important photomontage artists, creating

rich, unexpected visual eff ects. Both Höch and Heartfi eld 
made anti-Hitler images that spoke with images about 
political realities. Kurt Schwitters, another Dada artist, 
combined cubism with Dada for a series of collages that 
remain a rich visual resource for artists today.
ABSTRACT MOVEMENTS
Th e fi rst totally abstract poster is attributed to Henry 
van de Velde in 1897 (Figure 2–16). A Belgian art nou-
veau artist, he moved to Germany in 1906 to teach and 
became interested in architecture and a more struc-
tural approach to art. He was an architect, designer, 
educator, and painter, and his ideas contributed to the 
later development of the Bauhaus movement. Van de 
Velde’s work is regarded as a precursor to 20th-century 
abstract painting. His only poster was for Tropon, a 
concentrated food product. In his writing he called for 
a new art that would integrate the best of the decorative 
and the applied arts of the past.
Th e fi rst abstract painting is attributed to Wassily 
Kandinsky. He and others were working in an abstract 
fashion by 1911. Such paintings, in Kandinsky’s words, 
issued from “inner necessity.” For Kandinsky a painting 
was above all “spiritual,” an attempt to render insights 
and awareness transcending obviously descriptive 
realism. Author of On the Spiritual in Art, he joined 
the Weimar Bauhaus around 1920.
Constructivism began as a Soviet youth movement. 
Th e Russian Revolution of 1917 involved many Rus-
sian artists, who combined political propaganda and 
commercial advertising in support of the new state 
enterprises and revolutionary change. Civic-minded 
artists designed posters and packaging intended to 
attract buyers to state products. Advertising became 
a means for artists, poets, and others to advance the 
goals of Soviet society. Kasimir Malevich, Aleksandr 
Rodchenko, and others were abstract painters whose 
goal to directly reach viewers’ consciousness adapted 
readily to advertising propaganda for the good of 
Soviet society. Th e state enterprises fl ourished with 
the support of painters turned graphic designers

media, including fi lmmaking and set and costume 
design for fi lm and theater. He designed posters for 
several fi lms by using photo collage.
El Lissitzky was a Russian constructivist and designer 
who devoted a great deal of eff ort to propaganda 
work (Figure 2–18). He also developed the rules of 
typography and design that laid the groundwork 
for the development of grid systems. Designing a 
book of Vladimir Mayakovsky’s poetry, he wrote, 
“My pages relate to poetry in a way similar to a piano 
accompanying a violin. As thought and sound form 
a united imagination for the poet, namely poetry, so 
I have wanted to create a unity equivalent to poetry 
and typographical elements.” Lissitzky experimented 
with the photogram and foresaw the importance 
photography would come to have in graphic design. 
Th is innovative thinking and design work spread 
its vision to other countries. In Germany, Lissitzky 
and the Bauhaus infl uenced advertising and packag-
ing design. Th e contemporary designer Paula Scher 
uses the strong constructivist approach of Lissitzky’s 
layouts to create a modern design that deliberately 
mirrors this movement (Figure 2–19).
Closely related to constructivism, de Stijl developed in 
Holland, where artists fl ed to avoid direct involvement 
in World War I. It fl ourished during the 1920s in Europe 
and strongly infl uenced the later Bauhaus work. De Stijl 
was anti-emotion and based on a utopian concept of 
style. At fi rst glance, it may look similar to the Bauhaus 
movement described later, but de Stijl was more con-
cerned with formal aesthetic problems than with func-
tion. Th e most widely known painters of the period are 
Piet Mondrian and Th eo van Doesburg (Figure 2–20). 
Th eir style is the epitome of de Stijl, with straight black 
lines set at right angles to one another and a careful 
asymmetrical balancing of primary colors.

Henry van de Velde in 1906, closed at the outbreak of

Abstract Movements
Werkbund, became the Bauhaus director. In 1922 the 
constructivist El Lissitzky met with Th eo van Doesburg 
and László Moholy-Nagy in a congress of constructiv-
ists and Dadaists in Germany. Th eir exchange of ideas 
formed a core for the Bauhaus aft er 1923. Th is German 
design school shaped 20th-century graphic design, 
product design, furniture, and architecture.
Expressionism, Dada, constructivism, and de Stijl 
infl uenced the Bauhaus in its early years. By the late 
1920s, the Bauhaus was emphasizing functional 
graphic design. Th e Bauhaus trained artists in all 
areas. It attempted to bridge the gap between pure and 
applied art, to place equal importance on all areas of 
arts and craft s. It stressed clean, functional forms. Its 
weavers, metalsmiths, and carpenters did not attempt 
to produce works of art, but rather good and useful 
designs in which form was tied to function. Th e indus-
trial designer was born from this movement. Bauhaus 
publications featured asymmetry, a rectangular grid 
structure, and sans serif type.
Th e contributions by artists of the Bauhaus have been 
vastly important and continue to exert a strong infl u-
ence in contemporary design. Bauhaus artists who were 
infl uential in the development of graphic design include 
Josef Albers, who is known for his research into color 
and structural relationships (Figures 8–12). His wife, 
Anni Albers, was a gift ed fi ber artist. László Moholy-
Nagy developed photography as illustration. He saw the 
camera as a design tool that could be integrated with 
typography to create a new and better communication.
Bauhaus artist Herbert Bayer created several typeface 
designs, including Universal. In keeping with the 
Bauhaus philosophy, he believed in removing personal 
values from the printed page, leaving it purely logical 
and functional in design. Bayer typically avoided using 
capital letters in printed material and used extreme 
contrast of weight and size to establish a visual hierar-
chy. Aft er the Nazis forced the closing of the Bauhaus 
in 1933, many of its artists immigrated to the United 
States, where they contributed to the growth of Ameri-
can architecture and graphic design.

CHAPTER 2  Graphic Design History
New typography is a term that came to identify the 
new, Bauhaus-inspired approaches to graphic design. 
Its chief German proponent, Jan Tschichold, designed 
typefaces that emphasized clarity. Considered one of 
the most infl uential typographers of the 20th century, 
he used white space to create visual intervals in an 
asymmetrical layout, while an underlying horizontal 
and vertical structure unifi ed the page.
Th e Swiss also continued to develop the ideas of the 
Bauhaus in typography and layout design from the 
1950s onward. Work from this period came to be 
known as Swiss Design or the International Typographic 
Style. Major practitioners included Josef Müller-
Brockmann (Figure 4–3), Emil Ruder (Figure 7–5), 
and Armin Hofmann. Th eir emphasis on visual unity 
and formal grid elements contributed greatly toward 
shaping the design fi eld. Personal expression was seen 
as less important than order and clarity. Th e predomi-
nant graphic design style in the world by the 1970s, 
it featured a strong reliance on typographic elements, 
usually sans serif typefaces in a fl ush left  and ragged 
right format.
FIGURATIVE MOVEMENTS
Art deco appeared as a defi nite style in Paris around 
1925. It was especially infl uenced by art nouveau and 
also by African sculpture and cubism. Although it 
developed at the same time as the Bauhaus, art deco 
emphasized the fi gurative image with decorative 
appeal. It was applied to architecture, clothing, graphic 
design, advertising, packaging, craft s, and furniture. 
Artists associated with this movement included the 
Russian Erté and the Frenchman Georges Lepape, 
who contributed to Vogue magazine. Perhaps the 
best known and most respected art deco artist, who 
continues to have a strong infl uence today, is A. M. 
Cassandre, a Ukrainian-French artist. His posters and 
advertisements show the infl uence of cubism, but the 
forms retain a recognizable physical identity balanced 
with an intricate gestalt unity (Figure 2–21). It is a very 
recognizable style. For a time, art deco was out of favor 
in the eyes of architects and designers because it did 
not follow the Bauhaus tenets of functional, nonor-
namental design, but today many infl uences coexist. 
Surrealism also surfaced in the 1920s. Now the style is 
oft en incorporated into the eclectic mix of contempo-
rary design.
Owing a philosophical debt to Dada for its question-
ing attitude, surrealism was joined by several Dada 
artists. Th is literary and artistic movement was based 
on revealing the unconscious mind in dream images, 
the irrational, and the fantastic by juxtaposing 
incongruous subject matter. Th e writer André Breton 
was infl uential in starting this movement, which 
then found visual expression. Th e surrealists drew 
inspiration from Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams. 
Like the author James Joyce, who used stream-of-
consciousness techniques rather than rational, linear 
development of characters, surrealists sought to reveal 
the subconscious.
Surrealism exerted a strong infl uence on illustra-
tion and advertising. René Magritte (Figure 2–22) is 
much imitated today, and in fact he created quite a lot 
of advertising illustration, working for a time in an 
agency he created with his brother. Other surrealists, 
such as Max Ernst and Man Ray, show the infl uence

of Dada in their unorthodox and compelling arrange-
ment of elements. Surrealism’s search for unconscious 
motivation and innovative combinations continues 
to interest today’s designer/advertiser. In the 1930s 
many surrealist artists put found objects in strange 
combinations that evoked poetic and unconscious 
associations. Figure 2–23 by illustrator Matt Zumbo 
shows the contemporary illustrator's interest in art his-
tory. Georges Seurat was a French Post-Impressionist 
painter. A Sunday Aft ernoon on the Island of La Grande 
Jatte (1884–1886) is his most famous painting, which 
this work is based upon.
AMERICAN DESIGN
European modernism (whose movements we’ve just 
read about) greatly infl uenced design in the United 
States. Modernists believed that each new generation 
must build on past styles in new ways or break with 
the past in order to make the next major historical 
contribution. Many samples of modernist American 
graphics are shown throughout this text. Modern art 
is associated with innovation and progress. Other new 
art forms began to attract the attention of curators and 
critics in the 1970s, and the demise of modernism is 
oft en dated to that decade, although some argue that 
it continues as a highly functional movement today, 
especially in the design fi eld.
László Moholy-Nagy came to Chicago in 1937 to 
direct the New Bauhaus. It closed aft er one year, and 
Moholy-Nagy operated his own Institute of Design 
from 1938 to 1946. Th is school off ered the fi rst 
complete modern design curriculum in America. 
Th e Illinois Institute of Technology is a descendant 
of the New Bauhaus.
Lester Beall, an American-born Chicago artist, 
embraced modern design and European infl uences 
from cubism, constructivism, and Dada. Working in 
New York in the 1940s, he combined drawing, symbols, 
photography, and mixed typefaces into a coherent, 
eclectic design. Many young American designers of 
the time drew inspiration from European modern art 
and design, including Paul Rand. Rand realized that 
his role as a designer involved reinventing the problem

presented by the client (Figures 2-24, 3-22, 10-4, 10-7, 
and 10-12). He focused on restating the problem, 
and he drew inspiration from painters such as Klee 
and Miró. His books on design and his life’s work are 
extremely important contributions to the fi eld.
Th rough the 1930s and early 1940s, Cipe Pineles 
learned editorial art direction from one of the masters 
of the era, Dr. M. F. Agha, at Condé Nast publications. 
She became (at Glamour magazine) the fi rst autono-
mous female art director of a mass-market American 
publication. She was the fi rst art director to hire fi ne 
artists to illustrate mass-market publications. Aft er 
achieving national prominence as art director for 
Glamour, British Vogue, and Seventeen, Pineles became 
the fi rst female member of the New York Art Directors 
Club. She was one of the few female designers to gain 
recognition during this period. Cipe Pineles’s career 
spanned almost 60 years, up to her death in 1991. 
Designers from this period synthesized the infl uences 
of the European avant-garde and design movements to 
create new designs for magazines, posters, advertise-
ments, and corporate communications. Figure 2–25 
shows Cipe Pineles at work.
By the 1950s, marketing research was an important 
infl uence on business decisions. Advertising designers 
dealt with the proliferation of national television and 
radio networks, the emergence of large chain stores, 
and the importance of public perception and corpo-
rate identity. Th e International Design Conference in 
Aspen was founded in 1951 to assess and discuss the 
role of design in the commercial environment. Th e 
Aspen Design Summit continues to meet, coordi-
nated by the American Institute of Graphic Arts 
(AIGA) and the International Design Conference in 
Aspen (IDCA). Design students are encouraged to 
participate.
Th e 1950s saw the emergence of design curricula in 
universities and art schools and the articulation of an 
important concept. Leo Lionni—then art director for 
Fortune magazine, as well as an author, an illustrator, 
and a fi ne artist—stated that “Whatever [the designer’s] 
activities, they involve, to some, and various, extent, 
the shaping, interpretation and transmission of values.” 
Th is issue of values and the role of design in society is 
an important topic.
Push Pin Studios was founded in 1955 in opposition to 
the spirit of Swiss Design. Th e founders were Seymour 
Chwast, Reynold Ruffi  ns, Ed Sorel, and Milton Glaser. 
Glaser stated, “We frequently fi nd corruption more 
interesting than purity” (see Figures 4–7 and 4–9). 
Th is studio revived art nouveau, art deco, and narrative 
illustration, turning to visual history for inspiration. 
Th is attitude, with its historical references, heralded 
postmodernism. Th e studio’s founders continue to 
contribute to the shape and direction of design in the 
21st century.
During the mid-20th century the media theorist 
Marshall McLuhan noted the infl uence of television 
on communication and wrote about the potential for 
a global village united by a shared vision. McLuhan 
saw print media as an isolationist infl uence, giving rise 
to categorization, linear sequencing, and dogmatism. 
Television, according to McLuhan, has the potential 
to reunite society into a new global village. It certainly 
exerts a major infl uence on advertising and communi-
cation and, thus, on society. McLuhan’s writings remain 
thought-provoking today as media continue to evolve, 
infl uence, and restructure our society. See his Gallery 
Profi le in Chapter 11.
Magazine design was a creative area in the 1960s. 
In 1964 Ruth Ansel and Bea Feitler took charge of 
Harper’s Bazaar as co–art directors. Drawing inspira-
tion from pop art and underground images, Harper’s 
Bazaar represented the glamour and glitter of the 
1960s.
Herb Lubalin, a major fi gure in the fi eld, was art direc-
tor for the countercultural magazines Avant Garde, 
Fact, and Eros (Figures 2–26, 5–13, 5–17, and 5–29). 
Alternative publications with political and cultural 
commentary fl ourished during the 1960s but were 
oft en short lived because of various lawsuits.

Postmodernism
In the 1970s the term postmodernism was fi rst applied 
to architecture. A questioning of rational Swiss Design 
led to New Wave, postmodern graphic design. Th is 
period is said to question the modernist concept of 
constant innovation and progress. Contradictory and 
coexistent trends from a variety of historical periods 
provide rich concepts for study in postmodernism. 
April Greiman’s early work is an example of New Wave 
design, mixing formal experiments with popular and 
personal imagery (Figure 2–27). Th e remainder of the 
20th century saw history as a shopping mall of styles. 
Art deco and art nouveau were among the styles that 
were revived and revised, as decorative and fi gurative 
work regained respect.
Women had an important impact on design from 
this time forward. Designer and educator Katherine 
McCoy joined in questioning the modernist ideal of a 
permanent, universally valid aesthetic. She encouraged 
the production of visually rich and complex designs, 
believing that there is more to design than the clear, 
impartial transmission of information. McCoy believes 
designers interpret and communicate cultural values 
through the forms they create. (See Figure 2–28.)

(MIT) developed the Visible Language Workshop—a 
multidisciplinary, multimedia program that brings 
together artists, designers, computer scientists, sociolo-
gists, and others to study communication in the elec-
tronic age. Electronic media have been used to explore 
and invent eclectic, personal art and design work. 
Figure 2–29 is a fi ne example of the visual complex-
ity of Japanese postmodernism. Th is design combines 
visual motifs from a variety of cultures and periods, 
including Édouard Manet’s painting Th e Fifer and 
Michelangelo’s Medici tombs.
Form and Substance
During the 1980s the question of style over substance 
became an important issue. Th eorists such as Stuart 
Ewen questioned the role and impact of advertising 
design on society. He wrote (and continues to write) 
books on advertising and morality. Fine artist Bar-
bara Kruger worked for a time as a layout artist and 
used that skill to develop an “advertising campaign” 
that is anti-advertising. Her mock ads and billboards 
used typographical devices and images to expose the 
persuasion-consumption cycle of commercial advertis-
ing (Figure 2–30).

CHAPTER 2  Graphic Design History
originally came from the Defense Department. In 
1962 at MIT, Ivan Sutherland created the fi rst interac-
tive computer graphics display. A light pen touched to 
the video screen could draw a line stretched from the 
previous point. Although its early development was 
tied to defense and aerospace, computer graphics now 
has a wide variety of applications, such as engineering, 
medicine, geology, graphic design, animation, the fi lm 
industry, and the Internet. Professor Charles Csuri was 
a pioneer in early computer graphics and animation. In 
1967 he produced more than 14,000 still frames, which 
exploded a line drawing of a bird and reconstructed 
it. Th e Museum of Modern Art purchased the fi lm for 
its permanent collection as representative of the fi rst 
computer-animated artworks. Read more about the 
history of computer graphics in Chapter 11.
Interactivity
Text, photography, animation, illustration, sound, and 
video can now be combined and linked by using a vari-
ety of desktop programs. Unlike books, fi lm, or video 
that present linear information, the new electronic 
media can be truly interactive and present nonlinear, 
animated browsing opportunities.
Th e Internet off ers not only interactivity but also free-
dom from the physical constraints of traditional media. 
CD-ROM storage and DVDs off er interactivity, but 
only the Internet travels through time and space with 
few physical barriers. Th is medium is transforming the 
nature of communication as well as physical and politi-
cal boundaries. Web sites carry an enormous amount 
of information as shown in Figure 2-31.
THE FUTURE
During the 20th century we have progressed along a 
visual escalation from photography to fi lm to video 
to computers to the Internet. Computer graphics 
has come a long way since the original moving-ball 
display in the 1950s. Th e digital desktop has come a 
long way since the Macintosh was introduced in the 
mid-1980s. Th e Internet has become a vehicle for 
marketing products and disseminating information of 
all kinds. Web site production is an important market 
for graphic designers as the complexity of these sites 
DIGITAL FOCUS
Postmoderrn Medium
The computer made possible the visual and con-
ceptual layering that is the hallmark of postmod-
ernism in graphic design. By the late 1980s, type 
could be overlapped to create a rich visual texture 
and be intertwined with the photographic image. 
Thanks to the computer, by the last decade of the 
20th century typography could be used to explore 
multiple meanings rather than strictly to clarify a 
ﬁ xed message. The Internet is a very postmodern 
medium, with its interactive, nonlinear ﬂ ow. The 
impact of ever-developing computer technology 
inﬂ uences our style and our content. Ideas change 
technology, and technology inﬂ uences ideas.
Ä
An interest in the intellectual and historical founda-
tions of design led to the 1983 publication of Philip 
Meggs’s History of Graphic Design. Th is comprehensive 
and thoughtful text provides a foundation for many 
contemporary design history classes.
NEW TECHNOLOGIES
New technologies always infl uence the course of 
graphic design. We can trace our history and devel-
opment from medieval manuscripts to Gutenberg’s 
printing press to hot type to cold type to computer-
generated type and images. Later chapters discuss the 
stages in this development in greater detail. In the 
opening years of the 21st century, the use of electronic 
technology has revolutionized design and communica-
tions. Style and content are aff ected by the technology 
used in their creation. Th is chapter’s brief history of 
design has shown the relationship between design 
and technology, citing the invention of the printing 
press and of stone lithography as examples of earlier 
technologies that aff ected design and societal patterns 
of communication. Th e mid-20th century’s emphasis 
on clarity and structural integrity has been replaced 
by an interest in rich textural layers of information, as 
graphics are now generated with soft ware programs 
that encourage stylistic complexity.
The Development of Computer Graphics
Computer graphics, the use of computers to draw 
images, dates back to 1953, when a simple visual 
display of a bouncing ball was used to calculate and 
show military targets. Funding for the development of 
computers and computer graphics in the United States

rapidly increases. Our ability to communicate with 
interactive visuals and to create presentation video and 
3-D animation is also a developing market for graphic 
designers (Figure 2–32).
Virtual reality is another developing technology. 
It extends the senses, allowing a person to move 
through and interact with a computer-simulated 
environment by wearing special glasses and cloth-
ing or other sensors. Th ese monitor physical move-
ments and gestures in the alternate, virtual world. 
Psychologist R. L. Gregory stated in his book Eye and 
Brain, “Th e seeing of objects involves many sources 
of information beyond those meeting the eye when 
we look at an object. It involves knowledge of objects 
from previous experience and not only sight but 
touch, taste, smell, hearing, and perhaps also temper-
ature or pain.” What will the impact of virtual reality 
be on design and communication?
In the early years of the 21st century, it is interesting to 
remember the important developments at the turn of 
the last century. Th e future will be exciting and chal-
lenging for designers intent on maintaining an empha-
sis on issues of values and content while learning and 
using a proliferation of new media.

3–1 Figure/ground relationships have been an 
important element of design in many different 
cultures over the centuries.
PERCEPTION
KEY POINTS
A successful visual whole, or gestalt, is achieved by the careful combination of parts. A 
graphic designer works with shapes in both word and image, so this chapter stresses 
creating and perceiving shapes in typography and imagery. Figure/ground is also 
discussed, because it is a vital part of understanding and working with shape. If we are 
aware of how the eye and brain organize marks on a surface to give them meaning, we 
will be much more successful in creating designs that do what we intend. Figure 3-1 is 
an example of fi gure/ground relationships in crochet work.
SEEING AND BELIEVING
Graphic designers do more than decorate a surface. Th ey work with the fundamental 
principles of visual perception. When we look at a printed page, whether it is covered 
with type, illustrations, or a photograph, there is more than meets the eye. Th e brain is 
sift ing and cataloging the visuals. We carry a load of experiences, innate responses, and 
physiological considerations that interact with the designs we see, whether they are in 
print, Web, or other venues. Designs that eff ectively use that process of visual percep-
tion have the creative strength of sight itself on their side.
As soon as the fi rst mark is made on a blank sheet of paper, it is interpreted by the eye. 
We cannot see only a fl at mark on a fl at piece of paper. Our past experience, our expec-
tations, and the structure of the brain itself fi lter the information. Th e visual illusions 
created through this process are a real part of perception. Realism in art and design is 
not an absolute but a convention that our culture and personal background create from 
visual data.
Search for Simplicity
Gestalt psychologists investigated the way humans process information from a two-
dimensional surface. Th ere is an interplay of tensions between shapes on a fl at surface 
because the appearance of any one element or shape depends on its surroundings. Any 
mark drawn on paper stimulates an active, interpretive response from eye and brain. 
We fi nish uncompleted shapes, group similar shapes, and see foreground and back-
ground on a fl at surface. Th e experiments of Gestalt psychologists led them to describe 
a basic law of visual perception: Any stimulus pattern tends to be seen as a structure as 
simple as conditions permit. Th is law is similar to the principle of parsimony known 
to scientists, which states that when several hypotheses fi t the facts, the simplest one

CHAPTER 3  Perception
should be accepted. Th e eye and brain choose an 
interpretation.
In science, elegance and success result from explaining 
a phenomenon with the minimum number of steps. A 
similar elegance can be achieved on the printed page. 
A great deal may be happening on a page although few 
marks exist. In fact, adding more marks without under-
standing their eff ect can oft en make less happen. Th at 
is poor design.
In this and following chapters, we discuss the manner in 
which Gestalt psychologists believe our brain interprets 
and groups the images on a fl at surface. Gestalt theory 
is generally recognized as a useful tool for designing 
visual images so they will be comprehended as we 
intend. No single theory, however, explains all there is 
to visual perception. Much has yet to be discovered.
Interpretations
Th e lines in Figure 3–2 demonstrate our busy interac-
tion with simple marks drawn on a page. Th e resulting 
interpretations are infl uenced by the culture in which 
we live. We accept the black mark in Figure 3–2a as 
nearer than the fi eld it occupies, although they both 
exist on the same physical plane on the surface of the 
page. Adding a second mark of a larger size (Figure 
3–2b) requires another interpretation involving depth. 
Th e larger mark can seem closer in space than the 
smaller one. A line placed vertically that divides the 
space (Figure 3–2c) enhances the two-dimensional 
quality. Use an angled line (Figure 3–2d), and a sense 
of space begins to develop. Add another angled line 
(Figure 3–2e), and suddenly the eye may see the per-
spective of a road or railroad tracks running at an angle 
into the distance. Th e addition of changes in size and 
value enrich our possible interpretations.
Visual perception, and thus communication, is always 
colored by interpretation. Context, personal experi-
ence, and culturally inculcated systems of signs and 
symbols play a strong role in perception. Later chapters 
discuss this phenomenon from varying perspectives. 
Semiotics is the study of infl uences on our perception. 
It goes beyond linguistics to incorporate the visual 
language of sign and symbol (Figure 3–3). Th e fi eld of 
semiotics oft en breaks down visuals into the categories 
of icon, symbol, and index. An icon looks like the thing 
it represents. A road sign with an image of a deer is 
an icon. A road sign with a circle and slash, meaning 
“forbidden,” is an example of a symbol, which has a 
culturally accepted meaning. Words are also consid-
ered symbols of the thing they reference. An index is 
a visual we have learned to associate with a particular 
meaning. For example, a thermometer is an index of 
temperature. A footprint can indicate a deer. A nest can 
suggest a bird. Th e study of semiotics crosses between 
the fi eld of linguistics and the fi eld of visual language. 
Working to apply the concepts of icon, symbol, and 
index to thumbnail designs can enrich the range and 
depth of your solutions.
FIGURE/GROUND
If we are aware of how the eye and brain organize 
marks on a fl at surface to give them meaning, we will 
be much more successful in creating designs that do 
what we intend. Th e most fundamental organizational 
principle of sight for an artist working on a fl at, two-
dimensional surface is fi gure/ground. It is sometimes 
called positive/negative space. An ability to see and 
structure both fi gure and ground is crucial to the 
designer. You must learn to create and evaluate eff ec-
tive fi gure/ground relationships. Whenever we look at 
a mark on a page, we see it as an object distinct from its 
background. Th is distinction is the fundamental fi rst 
step in perception. A thing (fi gure) is visible only to the 
extent that it is seen as separate from its background 
(ground). Th is theory applies to every area of percep-
tion. A tree, for example, can be seen only in relation

to the space around it, the “not-treeness.” We can look 
at the shapes and lines of a photograph and recognize a 
picture because of fi gure/ground grouping. Figure 3–4 
shows a contemporary illustration with a dynamic 
fi gure/ground relationship that encourages varied 
readings. Is the white fi gure in profi le, or do the white 
and black combine into a single fi gure? Th is design is 
both abstract and fi gurative. Th e repeated oval shapes 
in mouth and notes make a symbolic visual tie between 
mouth and music.

CHAPTER 3  Perception
fi gure lying against a black ground. We can change 
our focus from the insects to the white space and back 
again. At its best, design becomes inseparable from 
communication. Form becomes content.
Categories
Every fi gure appears to lie at some location in front of 
the ground. A successful design depends on handling 
both areas. Many beginning artists concentrate only 
on the mark they make and are not aware of the white 
space surrounding it. It is vital to remember that the 
space, or ground, is as integral a part of the page as the 
fi gure placed on it. Th e three main categories in fi gure/
ground shaping are stable, reversible, and ambigu-
ous. Some designs incorporate more than one kind of 
fi gure/ground relationship (Figure 3–6).
Stable Figure/Ground
Each two-dimensional mark or shape is perceived in 
an unchanging, stable relationship of object against 
background. Th e illustrator Aubrey Beardsley played 
deliberately with the tension of a stable fi gure/ground 
relationship on the verge of breaking down (see Figure 
2–6). Th e poster shown in Figure 3–7 by Emile Preeto-
rius also has a great deal of compelling fi gure/ground 
tension as the shadows carve out white space. Logo 
designs make creative use of a variety of fi gure/ground 
relationships, as discussed in Chapter 5. Figure 3–8 is a 
logo created by a young designer for his student portfo-
lio that makes good use of fi gure/ground relationships. 
As this student did, consider building a portfolio by 
donating your design skills to a local not-for-profi t 
organization.
Reversible Figure/Ground
Figure and ground can be focused on equally when 
positive and negative elements attract our attention 
equally. What was initially background becomes fore-
ground. Because we cannot simultaneously perceive 
both images as fi gure, we keep switching between 
them. Th is is perhaps the most enjoyable type of fi gure/
ground to explore. Th ere are many examples in this 
chapter to enjoy and examine, including Figure 3-29b.
Ambiguous Figure/Ground
In some puzzle pictures, one fi gure may turn out to 
be made up of another fi gure, or of several diff erent 
fi gures (Figure 3–9). Th e designs in the exercise at 
the end of this chapter are good examples of a whole 
design that is made up of many individual, repeated

shapes. In Figure 5–1, the animals created to make 
playful alphabet letters also form an ambiguous fi gure/
ground. Th e gestalt notion that the whole is more than 
the mere sum of its parts is clearly illustrated by these 
examples.
Conditions
Once mastered, fi gure/ground grouping is an invalu-
able tool in all areas of graphic design, including logo 
design, layout, screen graphics, and illustration. It is 
richly complex and deserves study. Here are some 
conditions under which one area appears as fi gure and 
another as ground. Use these principles when complet-
ing the fi rst exercise at the end of this chapter.
  Th e enclosed or surrounded area tends to be seen as 
fi gure; the surrounding, unbounded area as ground 
(Figure 3–10a).
  Visual texture makes for fi gure perception. Th e eye 
will be drawn to a textured area before it is drawn to 
a nontextured area (Figure 3–10b).
  Convex shapes are more easily seen as fi gure than 
concave (Figure 3–11a).
  Simplicity (especially symmetry) predisposes an area 
to be seen as fi gure (Figure 3–11b).
  Familiarity causes a shape to pull out from its sur-
roundings. As we focus on it, it becomes fi gure while 
the surroundings become ground (Figure 3–11c).
  Th e lower half of a horizontally divided area reads as 
the solid fi gure to which gravity anchors us (Figure 
3–11d).
  Black tends to be viewed as the predominant fi gure 
more readily than does white.
Several conditions aff ect fi gure/ground perception 
in the time honored diagram in Figure 3–12 and the 
artwork in Figure 3–13. Can you identify them?

Letterforms
How does this fi gure/ground phenomenon aff ect 
letterforms, the basic ingredient of the printed page? 
Stop now and study Exercise 1 at the end of this 
chapter. As you do the exercise, you will realize that 
fi gure/ground aff ects letterforms the same as any 
mark or image on the page. Using type eff ectively 
depends on seeing both the shapes of the letters 
and the shapes between, within, and around them. 
Pay close attention to the shape of the ground areas 
shown at the bottom, called counters (Figure 3–14). 
Th is has direct application in logo and layout design 
(Chapters 5 and 7).
Because we tend to read for verbal information and not 
for visual information, nondesigners are rarely aware 
of the appearance of type itself. Th ey read it but do not 
“see” it. To work eff ectively with typography, one must 
recognize it as design.
For the fi rst several chapters, we will be concerned with 
type as a pure design element while learning to identify 
it and learn its language. To begin with, only display, 
or headline-size, letterforms are used. Look closely at 
the letter a shown in fi ve typestyles in Figure 3–24 and 
study all the parts of their structure, paying close atten-
tion to the diff erent counter shapes. Renaissance artist 
Albrecht Dürer constructed his own typestyle. His 
structural diagrams demonstrate the careful shaping 
and measurements necessary when hand-constructing 
letterforms (Figure 3–15). Computer soft ware has sim-
plifi ed the creation of new typestyles, but a discerning 
eye is still the most important ingredient—that and a 
love and respect for type design.

49
Shape
SHAPE
Design is the arrangement of shapes. Th ey underlie 
every drawing, painting, photograph, and graphic 
design. It is easy to become enamored with the subject 
matter of a design and forget about basic shapes. A 
designer must develop the ability to see and think in 
terms of shapes even though those shapes look like 
dots or apples or oranges or letterforms (Figure 3–16). 
Shape occurs in both fi gure and ground, in both type 
and image, and in both abstraction and realism.
Shape versus Volume
A shape is an area created by an enclosing bound-
ary that defi nes the outer edges. Th e boundary can 
be a line, a color, or a value change. Shape describes a 
two-dimensional artwork; volume describes a three-
dimensional work, such as a ceramic pot, a sculpture, 
or a piece of furniture. A rectangle and a circle are 2-D 
shapes, whereas a box and a sphere are 3-D volumes 
(Figure 3–17). Just as a 2-D surface can give the illu-
sion of volume, as shown in the “box” camera, a 3-D 
sculpture can use 2-D shapes to enrich its surface 
design. Figure 3–18 shows a richly textured theme of 
repeated rectangles in the surface treatment and basic 
structure of a contemporary teapot design.
Grouping Shapes
Every shape is aff ected by surrounding shapes. Th e 
normal sense of sight grasps shape immediately by 
identifying an overall pattern. Grouping letters into 
words makes it possible to recall the letters more 
accurately than when they are presented alone. If it 
is possible to also group marks into a recognizable or 
3–16 Look for similarity of shape 
in type and image.
3–17 This rectangle can be made to resemble a camera, 
but it is still made up of only two-dimensional shapes.

CHAPTER 3  Perception
repeating shape, the eye will do so, because it is the 
simplest way to perceive and remember the marks. 
Th e letters in word are easier to remember than o, d, w, 
and r. A well-designed logo or illustration or Web page 
with repeating shapes also makes the design easier to 
recognize and remember.
For the graphic designer, the shape of a circle may 
represent the letterform O, a diagram of a courtyard, a 
drawing of a wheel, or a photograph of a French horn. 
Figure 3–19 shows how beautiful a circular shape 
can be. Th ese objects are not linked by subject mat-
ter to any common theme. Th ey are linked by shape. 
Repetition of basic shape can bring unity to a group 
of seemingly disparate objects. Th e designer works 
with so many diff erent objects that to be blind to their 
shapes would result in utter chaos on the page. Repeat-
ing similar shapes in diff erent objects is an excellent way 
to bring visual unity to a design.
The Form of Shapes
An artist may choose to represent an object or a person 
realistically, by an image similar to an unaltered photo-
graph. Actually, reality is a little more diffi  cult to defi ne 
than that, and philosophers have been working on it 
for centuries. We know that visual reality is created in 
part by the viewer’s interaction with what meets the 
eye. In later chapters we’ll discuss other factors that 
contribute to our visual perception.
An artist/designer may also represent an object in a 
purposeful distortion or stylization that can emphasize 
an emotional quality, as in Figure 3–20, a beautiful 
example of shape fi nding from 18th-century Japan. 
Th is woodcut illustration, which emphasizes shapes, 
looks as if it could be created in a contemporary vector 
graphics computer program with a lot of points on a 
curve. Th e history of art and design off ers many such 
inspirations for computer solutions.
3–19 Beautiful shapes can be found in many objects. The 
circle is integral to the structure of this French horn.

Shape
Abstraction is another approach to illustration and 
design. It implies a simplifi cation of existing shapes. 
Details are ignored, but the subject is oft en still rec-
ognizable. Oft en the pure design shapes of the subject 
are emphasized, as in Figure 3–21, a Japanese portrait 
created in the late 20th century that uses squares. How 
many can you fi nd?
Purely nonobjective shapes are abstractions that have 
no recognizable realistic shapes. Th e constructivists 
worked with nonobjective shapes to give structure and 
character to their designs. Nonobjective shapes are 
the basis of the invisible, underlying grid structure of 
layout design.
Letterform Shapes
Th e ability to see and use shapes is especially important 
with letterforms. True, they are symbols of something, 
but fi rst and foremost they are pure shape, a funda-
mental design element. Successful layout and logo 
design depend on creating unity through the play of 
similarity and variety of letterform shapes.

CHAPTER 3  Perception
Th e distinction is oft en made between geometric 
shapes and curvilinear, organic shapes. Figure 3–22 
shows the logo for ABC designed by Paul Rand, who 
skillfully repeated basic geometric shapes.
Typestyles oft en have diff erent expressive qualities 
depending on their shapes. Th ose with hard, straight 
edges and angular corners have a colder, more reserved 
feeling than typestyles with graceful curves, which 
have a relaxed, sensual feeling. To become sensitive 
to the shapes in a letterform, look carefully at its 
anatomy (Figure 3–23). Th en learn how these vary 
between typestyles. Chapter 6 discusses the history 
and classifi cation of typestyles. Right now, however, 
concentrate on making comparisons between a few 
classics (Figure 3–24).
Terminology
Th e following list of terms and defi nitions will help you 
know what to look for when comparing shapes in let-
terforms. Again, reference Figure 3–23.
Ä
DIGITAL FOCUS
Vector and Raster Graphics
There are two kinds of image ﬁ les in computer 
graphics: vector graphics and raster graphics. 
Vector graphics are like a cross-stitch embroi-
dery pattern in which the yarn stays as separate 
interwoven strands. Raster graphics, on the other 
hand, are like a woven fabric in which the color 
pattern is dyed into the cloth. The vector “strands” 
can be separated and moved independently, but 
raster “fabric” cannot.
Vector graphics involve creating shapes that 
are clean edged and defined as geometric 
objects. Each vector object, whether a shape or 
a drawn line, can be easily selected and edited, 
repositioned, and transformed. Vector graph-
ics are resolution independent, which means 
that they retain crisp edges when enlarged. This 
is a powerful concept. However large or small 
you transform a vector file, it remains perfectly 
sharp. Typography, logo design, and some forms 
of illustration are created in vector programs 
such as Illustrator, and in page layout programs 
such as InDesign. Raster programs such as Pho-
toshop are excellent for image manipulation and 
can best be used for typography that will not 
need to be resized. 
COUNTER 
Counters are the white shapes inside a letter. Duplicat-
ing a letterform accurately calls for close attention to 
both the white and the black shapes (the ground and 
the fi gure). When drawing a letterform or design-
ing with one, think of yourself as creating the white 
shapes.
SERIF 
A serif is a short line that projects off  the main stroke of 
a letter at the bottom or the top. Letters without serifs 
are called sans serif.

CHAPTER 3  Perception
3–25a Ascenders and descenders 
determine type size. These are both 
72 pt.
ASCENDER 
An ascender is the part of a lowercase letter that 
rises above the body of the letter. Th e letter e has no 
ascender, but the letter t does. See Figure 3–25a.
DESCENDER 
A descender is the part of a lowercase letter that falls 
below the body of the letter. Th e letters a, b, c, d, and e 
have no descenders, but the letter g does.
TYPE SIZE 
Type size is measured by points For example, 72-point 
type is 1 inch high, as measured from the top of the 
ascender to the bottom of the descender. See Figure 
3–25a.
X-HEIGHT 
Th e x-height is the height of the body of a lowercase 
letter such as x or a. It does not include the ascender 
or descender. Th e x-height varies in typefaces even 
though the point size is identical. Th is variation is why 
diff erent typestyles of the same point size may appear 
larger or smaller. Th us 10-point Garamond has a small 
x-height and long ascenders and descenders; 10-point 
Univers has a larger x-height and smaller ascenders 
and descenders. See Figure 3–25b.
Th e Swiss designer Adrian Frutiger developed Univers 
in 1954. It was the fi rst typestyle available in many font 
style variations with a consistent x-height throughout.
TYPEFACE 
A typeface is a style of lettering. Most typefaces vary a 
great deal, as you can see when you develop an eye for 
the diff erences. Each family of typefaces may contain 
variations such as italic and bold in addition to regular, 
or roman.
FONT 
A font is a specifi c size and variation on a typeface. 
(For example, Baskerville Bold is a diff erent font from 
Baskerville Italic, and 12-point Baskerville Italic is a 
diff erent font from 24-point Baskerville Italic.) Cur-
rently, however, the terms font and typeface are oft en 
used interchangeably.
BASELINE 
Th e line that typography sits on is called a baseline.
STRESS 
Stress is the distribution of weight through the thinnest 
part of a letterform. It can be seen easily by drawing a 
line through the thinnest part of an o and observing 
the slant of the line (Figure 3–26).
Using this terminology, choose three typestyles to ana-
lyze and ask yourself the following questions:
How much variation is there between thick and thin 
strokes?
Which style has a short x-height? Which style has a tall 
x-height?
Which has the longest ascenders and descenders?
What are the diff erences in the serifs? Which type has 
the most vertical stress?
What are the similarities among letters that belong to 
one style?
3–26 Stress varies greatly 
between typestyles.
3–25b The Univ-
ers typestyle has a 
consistent x-height 
in all its family of font 
variations.

EXERCISES
These exercises are carefully crafted to allow the 
student to express the basic content of this chapter 
by creating designs that emphasize ﬁ gure ground 
and shape relationships.
These exercises can also be used to gradually intro-
duce skills in vector graphics, such as reversals, cut 
and paste, rotation, and grid placement. Noncom-
puter classes can do well learning these concepts 
with pencil, pen, and graph paper.
1.  Place a letterform inside a rectangular format, 
using a Helvetica typestyle. Place the letter and 
its values so the letter (uppercase or lowercase) 
becomes ground instead of ﬁ gure. Familiarity 
with the shape can make this exercise difﬁ cult 
(Figure 3–27).
2.  Group several copies of an arrow to form an 
interesting symmetrical pattern. Emphasize 
the creation of shapes in ﬁ gure and in ground 
(Figures 3–28a, b).
3.  Choose one of the typestyles shown in this 
chapter. Repeat a letterform in a symmetrical 
pattern, as shown in Figure 3–29. What do you 
see as ﬁ gure? Why? Can you change the ﬁ gure 
into ground? Critique these exercises before or 
along with the ﬁ nal project.
PROJECT
Figure/Ground and Letterforms
Applying ﬁ gure/ground to letterform shapes is the 
best way to really see typography. Choose two let-
terforms from the type styles shown in this chapter. 
If they are your initials, you may choose to use your 
design for a business card and letterhead later. 
Create a design that uses one letter as the ﬁ gure 
and another as the ground. This relationship can 
be stable, reversible, or ambiguous. Remember the 
importance of thumbnails, exploring a minimum of 
15 possibilities.
Fit your design within an 8 x 10" (20 x 25-cm) 
format. Keep your letters “true to form” and “letter 
perfect.” Do not stretch, warp, or skew the original 
shapes; resizing is ﬁ ne. Use solid black or white 
shapes. You can (1) extend the edge of a shape, 
(2) overlap a form, or (3) hide an edge by placing 
a black letter against a black background or white 
against white. Bring out the beauty, variety, and 
personality of those shapes. Figures 3–30 a, b, c 
are student designs based on this project. Figure

Begin by looking as a class at the results of the 
exercises. What forms of ﬁ gure/ground do you 
see? Which are the most successful and interesting 
examples of reversible and of ambiguous ﬁ gure/
ground? Identify the typestyle used in your two 
favorites. How does the anatomy of this typestyle 
contribute to the look of the ﬁ nal piece? Where 
do you see repetition of shape? Which is the best 
example of gestalt, where the whole is more than 
the sum of the parts? Spend some time looking,

Critique
learning, and talking about these exercises, with 
everyone participating. You won’t agree about 
everything. That can make for a good discussion. 
The instructor will make comments, identifying 
which designs he or she thinks are most successful 
and explaining why.
When ﬁ nished with the ﬁ nal project, you are ready 
for the next part of the critique. Present your solu-
tion to the class orally, along with your thumbnails. 
Tell which typestyle you’ve chosen and why. Explain 
why you chose this design from your thumbnails. 
Discuss your use of symmetry or asymmetry and 
repetition of shape. What is the ﬁ gure/ground 
relationship in your design? How do you think the 
design might be improved? Ask the class for com-
ments on how to improve it. Hopefully, the instruc-
tor will let you make changes based on the class 
critique. That way, critical comments can be used 
constructively. Again, ask the instructor to make 
some ﬁ nal comments about what works and why. 
Consider voting on the best three solutions.

TOWARD A 
DYNAMIC 
BALANCE
KEY POINTS 
Th e elements on a page are a combination of type and image, of photography and 
illustration. Understanding how to make these diverse elements work together calls for 
a knowledge of the visual language of balance (Figure 4–1). Th is chapter examines how 
type and image are placed in a composition intentionally to direct the eye and achieve 
visual unity. Th e fi nal assignments are type based, to emphasize that placement and 
command of the visual language of typography is crucial in page layout.
VISUAL AND INTELLECTUAL UNITY
Two kinds of unifi ed communication occur in graphic design. Intellectual unity is idea 
generated and word dominated. Th e mind, not the eye, makes the grouping. Visual 
unity, in contrast, is created by placement of design elements perceptible to the eye. 
In the most successful designs, these reinforce one 
another.
Th e poster in Figure 4–2 by the famous early 20th-
century designer A. M. Cassandre is unifi ed both intel-
lectually and visually. It is a poster for an optician, so 
it is intellectually unifi ed by the slogan, the emphasis 
on the eyeglasses, and the bright, clear area of vision 
through which the eyes peer at us. It is visually unifi ed 
through a complex series of events as the small type 
frames the subject’s eyes and leads our eyes down and 
into the O of Leroy. Th e size of this small type echoes 
the size of the serifs on the larger name. Th e vertical-
ity of the typography in Leroy is echoed by the bright 
rectangle surrounding the face.
Imagine that a designer and a writer are hanging a gal-
lery show of a photojournalist’s work. Th e designer is 
hanging photographs together that have similar value 
and shapes. Th e writer is following behind, rehanging 
the photos together according to subject matter: a pic-
ture of a burning building next to one of fi refi ghters. 
One is thinking of subject matter (intellectual unity); 
the other is looking at design (visual unity).

CHAPTER 4  Toward a Dynamic Balance
As a design student, you are learning to see the visual 
unity in a composition and to create with an eye for 
it. Few people have this skill. Study the form of your 
design. Once you have mastered the visual “language,” 
you will be able to use it to strengthen both visual and 
intellectual communication. Both are important and 
should work together.
Design as Abstraction
Abstract art drew attention to pure visual design. It 
was “about” color, value, shape, texture, and direction, 
although oft en incorporating recognizable imagery. In 
a purely nonobjective painting by Th eo van Doesburg 
(Figure 2-20) we are intrigued by the breakup of space 
and the distribution of value and color. Th ere is no 
“picture” to distract us from the visual information. 
Th e de Stijl movement had a tremendous infl uence 
on graphic design as layout artists began arranging 
their shapes and blocks of type into asymmetrically 
balanced compositions.
A good graphic artist must be a good abstract artist, 
using both pictorial and nonobjective elements. 
Figure 4–3 shows an International Typographic Style 
layout by Swiss designer Josef Müller-Brockmann 
that demonstrates a strong eye for pure design shapes 
reminiscent of de Stijl’s surface divisions and strong 
horizontal/vertical orientation. Figure 4–4 by contem-
porary Louisville designer Julius Friedman shows a 
de Stijl infl uence on letterhead design.
Graphic design is essentially an abstract art that com-
bines a greatly varied array of elements into a formal 
2-D structure. A work should be balanced and visually 
compelling in its own right as well as supportive of 
an idea. Design is a visual language. Th e 20th-century 
movements in art and design contributed greatly to our 
current understanding of that language. Th e fi elds of 
Gestalt psychology and semiotics have also helped us 
understand how meaning is formed from visual data.
Working Together
In a design fi rm, the visual design of a project is given 
full consideration. In an ad agency, however, copywrit-
ers oft en dominate. Many other places that employ 
designers also have word people in key positions.

Visual Dynamics
61
Th ese people tend to be sensitive primarily to words 
and ideas (intellectual unity). Th ey are not trained in 
visual communication. For this angle they rely on you. 
Together you can ensure, as the Bauhaus would say, 
that the form of a design matches its function.
Constructivist El Lissitzky said, “Th e words on the 
printed page are meant to be looked at, not listened 
to.” How do we look at designs, and how do we create 
visually unifi ed ones? Th e answer has a great deal to do 
with balance.
VISUAL DYNAMICS
A ladder leaning precariously against a wall will make 
us tense with a sense of impending collapse. A diver 
poised at the top of the high dive fi lls us with suspense. 
We are not passive viewers. We project our experience 
into all that we see, including the printed page. How do 
we project our physical experience into that fl at, rect-
angular surface? Kinesthetic projection (sensory experi-
ence stimulated by bodily movements and tensions) is 
operating, whether we deal with pictures of people or 
the abstract shapes of type design. Figure 4–5 by Don 
Egensteiner demonstrates the attraction of gravity on 
type. Western culture reads a page from top to bottom, 
a movement that matches our experience with gravity. 
It is harder for us to read a design of words or images 
that asks the eye to go from bottom to top.
We project emotional as well as physical experience 
onto the page. An illustration of a man stabbed causes 
discomfort due to such projection. Visual form stirs up 
memories and expectations. Th at is why visual percep-
tion is so dynamic.
Loose strokes that allow the process of construction to 
show through also arouse this dynamic tension. Th e 
visible brushstroke or “mark of the maker” pulls view-
ers into the process of creation. Many interesting and 
appealing printed pieces are created by allowing the 
tension of the creative process to show through, as in 
a delightful visual pun on the St. Louis arch shown in 
Figure 4–6.
As you saw in Chapter 3, any mark made on a sheet 
of paper upsets the surface and organizes the space

around the mark. Th is dynamic tension is not contained 
in the paper itself, or in the graphite, ink, or computers 
we use. It is created by our interaction with the image.
Top to Bottom
We are uncomfortable with shapes clustered at the 
top of a page, with open space beneath them. We have 
observed in the world around us that many more 
things are at rest on the ground than in the sky. If they 
are not “standing” on anything, we feel suspense as we 
wait for them to fall. We experience a design as top-
heavy much more quickly than as bottom-heavy.
Milton Glaser, a contemporary designer and illustrator 
helped found Push Pin Studios in 1954 and has been 
a major force in graphic design since then (see Chapter 
2). He deliberately plays with this top-to-bottom tension 
in his double portrait of dancer Nijinsky (Figure 4–7). 
All that anchors the dancing, gravity-defying feet are the 
line of the baseboard under the left  foot and the verti-
cal line at the corner.
Type designers have long believed in the importance 
of putting extra weight at the bottom of a letterform to 
make it look fi rm and stable. Th e 8 and 3 in Figure 4–8 
look top-heavy when viewed upside down. Book design-
ers customarily leave more space at the bottom than at 
the top of a page. Th ey understand that a sense of balance 
cannot be achieved by simply placing identical mar-
gins at the top and bottom of a composition. Th is is the 
same principle used when matting artwork. Th e bottom 
measurement is slightly greater than the top, allowing 
for an optical center that is slightly diff erent from the 
mathematical center.

63
Visual Dynamics
Vertical and Horizontal
We fi nd horizontal and vertical lines stable, probably 
because they remind us of our vertical bodies on the 
horizontal earth. Milton Glaser again deliberately vio-
lates this sense of stability in Figure 4–9. As he com-
ments, “Th e diagonal of this fi gure gives the illustration 
its surreal perversity.”
We fi nd diagonal lines dynamic because they seem in 
a state of fl ux, poised for movement toward the more 
stable horizontal or vertical. Th e de Stijl artist Th eo van 
Doesburg deviated from Mondrian’s horizontal and 
vertical compositions, stating that the modern human 
spirit felt a need to express a sharp contrast to the right 
angles found in architecture and landscape. An oblique 
angle is one of the quickest, most eff ective means of 
showing tension.
Th is tension can be created by placing a single shape at 
an oblique angle or by placing the entire composition 
at an angle. Th is kind of design solution can surprise 
and interest the viewer.
Left to Right
Western cultures read from the left  side of the page 
to the right, and this experience infl uences the way 
we look for balance between the sides of a design. 
Th e left  side is more important, as our attention goes 
there fi rst. Pictorial movement from the left  toward

CHAPTER 4  Toward a Dynamic Balance
the right seems to require less eff ort than movement 
in the opposite direction. See Figure 4–10. An animal 
speeding from right to left , for example, seems to be 
overcoming more resistance than one shown moving 
from left  to right. You can explore this left -to-right bal-
ance by holding your designs up to a mirror. Th ey may 
now appear unbalanced.
Overall
Every two-dimensional shape, line, fi gure/ground 
relationship, value, and color possesses visual dynam-
ics. We have seen the dynamic value of a kinesthetic 
reaction, or empathy with the image. Th ere is more to 
the dynamic of perception, however. We have all seen 
images of a supposedly moving fi gure that appears in 
awkward, static immobility. Th e objects of dancer or 
automobile can lead us to expect movement, but only 
skillful control of visual language can evoke it. Success-
ful communication requires balance, the directing and 
conducting of visual tensions.
BALANCE
Every healthy person has a sense of balance. It allows 
us to remain upright and walk, run, or ride a bicycle. 
Our eyes are pleased with a balanced composition, just 
as we are pleased with our ability to ride a bicycle and 
not wobble. Figure 4–10 creates a focus on the bicycle 
product, as the large fi gure on the left  directs our gaze 
at the riding woman. Th e interwoven dark values help 
unite the composition, and the placement of the typog-
raphy again draws our gaze across the bicycle. All of this 
is a visual balancing act. Lack of balance in a design will 
irritate viewers and impair the communication. In iso-
morphic terms, we identify our physical structure with 
the physical layout/structure of the page and can feel in 
danger of “falling off  the bicycle.” How do we create a 
unifi ed, “rideable,” and well-balanced design?
When the dynamic tension between elements is bal-
anced, we are most likely to communicate our intended 
message. Otherwise, the eye is confused. It shift s from 
element to element, wanting to move things so they 
sit right on the page, as we want to straighten a picture 
hanging crooked on a wall. Th e viewer so bothered will 
pay less attention to the quality or content of the picture.
Balance is achieved by two forces of equal strength that 
pull in opposite directions, or by multiple forces pull-
ing in diff erent directions whose strengths off set one 
another. Th ink of visual balance as a multiple rope pull 
where, for the moment, all teams are exerting the same 
strength on the rope. It is not a state of rest, but a state 
of equal tension.
If artists always employed the simplest and quietest 
form of balance, their art would seem dull. Too much 
predictability and unity disturbs us just as too much 
chaos does. We are animals of change and tension. We 
strive for growth and life. A simple decrease in visual 
tension resulting in a quiet balance will not satisfy us 
for long. An interplay between tension-heightening 
and tension-reducing visual devices seems to satisfy us 
and match our kinesthetic and emotional experience. 
We yearn for diversity as well as unity.

Balance
Symmetry
Th e two basic types of balance are symmetry and asym-
metry. In symmetrical balance, identical shapes are 
repeated from left  to right in mirrored positions on 
either side of a central vertical axis. Figure 4–11 is a 
symmetrical stained-glass window design by architect 
Frank Lloyd Wright. Figure 4–12 is a symmetrical 
logo design by contemporary designer Margo Chase. 
Some symmetrical designs also repeat from top to 
bottom, oft en in a pattern of radial symmetry (in 
which the elements radiate from a central point). 
Symmetrical balance dominated Western painting 
and architecture until the Renaissance. It dominated 
graphic design throughout the fi rst centuries of the 
printing trade, when type was carefully set in centered, 
formally ordered pages. Th e traditional book form 
is a classic example of symmetry (Figure 4–13). 
Figure 4–14 shows the most classical form of symme-
try of all, the human body, in this digital photo-based 
painting by illustrator Matt Zumbo.
Symmetrical design, with its sense of order, is useful 
whenever stability and a sense of tradition are impor-
tant. It uses contrasts of value, texture, and shape 
to relieve boredom and introduce variety. Th ere are 
various ways to achieve symmetry. Th e most com-
mon has a similarity of form on either side of a central 
dividing line. Symmetrical balance can happen even 
when images are not precisely identical on either side 
of this axis. Some diff erences may occur in shape, 
color, or value. Th e important consideration is whether 
the overall balance of shape, value, and color remains 
primarily symmetrical. Th at symmetry may be vertical, 
horizontal, radial, or overall.
Asymmetry
Asymmetrical design evokes a greater sense of move-
ment and change, of possible instability and relative 
weights. It is like taking your bicycle through an obstacle 
course. It is a contemporary balance that refl ects the 
changing times. Symmetrical design has a logical 
certainty that is lacking in asymmetrical design. In sym-
metrical design, a 2-in. (5-cm) square in the upper left  
dictates another such square in the upper right. In asym-
metrical design, that square could be balanced by a vast 
number of shapes, values, colors, or textures. Th e eff ects 
can be diffi  cult, challenging, and visually exciting.
Asymmetrical designs are balanced through contrast 
to achieve equal visual weight among elements. To be 
eff ective, contrast must be defi nitive. Shapes that are

almost but not defi nitely diff erent are irritating to the 
eye. Figure 4–15 is an asymmetrical design that uses 
several forms of contrast in both fi gures and letter-
forms to achieve a balanced, intriguing design.
Balance through Contrast
Symmetry achieves balance through likeness; asym-
metry achieves balance through contrast. Th e easiest 
way to achieve visual unity would be to make one 
shape into an overall symmetrical pattern on the page. 
A full book page with nothing on it but a solid block 
of type is visually unifi ed, no matter what the words 
say. It is also visually dull. In the case of novels, this 
visual dullness is deliberate. Th e reader is directed to 
the content of the words without distraction. In most 
publications and advertising design, however, this 
unity must be tempered with contrast if it is to attract 
and hold the viewer. Th e designer is usually working 
with many diff erent elements. Most successful designs 
rely on a carefully juggled balance of similarities and 
contrasts.
Th ere are two considerations in setting up balance 
through contrast: weight and direction. Visual weight is 
the strength or dominance of the visual object. Visual 
direction is the way the eye is drawn between elements 
over the fl at surface. Balance is determined by the 
natural weight of an element and by the directional 
forces in the composition. Weight and direction are 
infl uenced by several forces that are listed next.

Illustrated. 1983. An example of asymmetrical balance.

LOCATION 
Th e center of a composition will support more weight 
than the edges. Although a shape is most stable when 
in the center, it is also visually “light.” Small shapes at 
the edges of a composition can balance large ones in 
the middle (Figure 4–16a).
SPATIAL DEPTH 
Vistas that lead the eye into the page have great visual 
strength. We project ourselves into the spatial illusion, so 
it seems to have greater presence of size (Figure 4–16b).
SIZE 
Visual weight also depends on size (Figure 4–16c)—
the larger the heavier. Size is the most basic and oft en 
used form of contrast in graphic design. Th e contrast 
between large and small should be sharp and defi nite 
without overpowering the smaller elements so they 
cannot contribute their share. Most successful designs 
benefi t greatly from size contrast in type or in image. 
In layout design, the contrast is oft en between large 
and small photographs and between headline and text 
type, as in the 1931 poster design by Max Bill shown in 
Figure 4–17.
An interesting sort of size contrast is contrast in 
expected size. Th e expectedly large element is played 
small and vice versa, resulting in a visual double take, 
as in the 1935 poster depicting skiing and ski goggles 
shown in Figure 4–18.

CHAPTER 4  Toward a Dynamic Balance
TEXTURE 
A small, highly textured area will contrast with and 
balance a larger area of simple texture (Figure 4–19a). 
Th is rule refers to visual texture, not tactile texture. 
Contrast of texture is especially useful with text type 
(type smaller than 14 point, used to set the body of 
copy).
ISOLATION 
A shape that appears isolated from its surroundings 
will draw attention to itself more quickly, and have 
greater visual weight, than one surrounded by other 
shapes (Figure 4–19b).
SUBJECT MATTER 
Th e natural interest of subject matter will draw the 
viewer’s eye and increase visual weight. It can also create 
directional movement as we move our eyes between lov-
ers or follow the eye direction of a fi gure. Our eyes are 
drawn to the realistic representation of something that 
interests us (Figure 4–19c). Th e design in Figure 4–20 
is by Herb Lubalin, an important American designer 
from the last half of the 20th century. Th e subject is 
playfully suggested with placement.
VALUE 
Areas of high contrast have strong visual weight. A small 
area of deep black will contrast with and balance a larger 
area of gray when both are placed against a white back-
ground (Figure 4–19d). Th e creation of light and dark 
areas in a drawing, a painting, a photograph, or an illus-
tration produces a dramatic play of values that delights 
the eye. Alexey Brodovitch designed these pages for a 
visual arts magazine in the 1950s (Figure 4–21). Th e high 
contrast of texture and size, and the cropping of images, 
create an extremely well-balanced and dynamic layout.
Typography also uses value contrast. Th e contrast of 
a black, heavy type against a light one helps relieve 
boredom and makes the page more readable. Contrasts 
between headings and body text and the white areas 
of paper can create three distinct weights: the black 
bar of the heading is played against the gray, textured 
rectangle of the body text, both of which contrast with 
the white areas of the background page. Designers

SHAPE 
Th e shape of objects generates a directional pull along 
the main structural lines. Complicated contours also 
have a greater visual weight than simple ones. Th ere-
fore a small complex shape will contrast with and bal-
ance a larger simple shape (Figure 4–22a). One block 
of type may be set in a long, thin ragged rectangle 
while another is set in a large, square block form. 
Contrast in shape also works with single letterforms. 
You may play the round openness of an O against 
the pointed complexities of a W, or the shape of an 
uppercase A against a lowercase c (Figure 4–22b).
STRUCTURE 
In type design, structure refers to the contrasting char-
acteristics of type families. It is a kind of contrast of 
shape. Compare the G in Baskerville with the G in Hel-
vetica (Figure 4–22c). Th ey are the same basic shape, 
but their diff erences are important in typography. Th eir 
structures—thick/thin, serif/sans serif—are diff erent. 
4–22a–c
Th e logo design in Figure 4–23 plays with both con-
trast and similarity, as well as delivering a clever visual 
pun equating the V with facial structure.
COLOR 
Th e brighter and more intense the color, the heavier 
it will be visually. A large gray-blue shape will be 
balanced by a small bright red shape. A small bright 
intense green will contrast with and balance a large 
toned-down, low-intensity green. In graphic design, 
you won’t always work with full color. Each additional 
color costs money, so it must be used wisely. A second 
color can be used to enliven a magazine from cover to 
cover or only on those pages that are cut from the same 
printed signature. Remember, in one-color design, that 
color need not be black. It can be a rich gray, a deep 
green, or any color you can envision working with 
your combination of type and image. Figure 4–24, by 
renown designer April Greiman, shows a creative use 
of a limited color palette as well as a creative integration 
of type and image.

DIGITAL FOCUS
Manipulating Letterforms
Vector programs like Adobe Illustrator allow you to 
type in a letterform and transform it by typestyle 
and placement, as well as by using the commands 
for rotate, reﬂ ect, scale, and shear. You must enter 
each letter individually, or use the cut and paste 
functions to manipulate an individual letterform. 
These functions were used in Figure 4–25. Figure 
4–26 also makes use of the pen tool to add and 
subtract vector points, and the scissors tool is 
used to eliminate points. Converting type to outline 
is a good way to gain control of vector points, but 
the type tools will no longer work on the letter-
forms. These assignments give students an oppor-
tunity to gradually increase their software skills as 
well as explore creative solutions that will be of 
use in later chapters. The Web site accompanying 
this text has more information.

PROJECT 1: WORD ILLUSTRATION
This project asks you to concentrate on placement, 
contrast, and kinesthetic projection to create a bal-
anced and interesting design. Figure 4–25 shows 
student designs based on this project.
Choose a word to illustrate. Practice on those 
listed here, then choose your own words. A 
dictionary and thesaurus (online or in print) can 
be useful tools. Base these thumbnails and your 
project on existing typestyles. Search for an 
appropriate one for each solution. Do not use 
pictures or distort your letterforms into pictures to 
tell your story. Let the letterforms communicate 
their message visually through size, color, value, 
shape, structure, texture, placement, and kines-
thetic projection. Tell visually what the word says 
intellectually. Be able to describe the tensions and 
balancing forces.
Execute your design so it ﬁ ts within an 81⁄2 x 11" 
(21.5 x 28-cm) format. Use black and incorporate 
one shade of gray or color, if it will strengthen your 
design. If you use a computer-generated solution, 
stay within the same design limitations of size and 
color. Do not use software to lure you to distort the 
basic shape of the letterform. Enjoy it for its clarity 
and beauty of design, retaining its integrity.

Create an animal out of typographic forms. Choose 
a typestyle and stay with its family of fonts, resizing 
and rotating as desired. Choose the typography 
carefully, looking for both shapes and the feeling 
the typestyle communicates. Feel free to reverse 
values, overlap, and cut and paste to create your 
animal, but again, avoid stretching and distort-
ing the proportions of the type for this assign-
ment. Place your animal somewhere within the 
rectangle of an 81/2 x 11" (21.5 x 28-cm) page, in 
either a vertical or a horizontal format. Be sensitive 
to the edges of the overall composition and the 
open spaces. Figure 4–26 shows several playful 
and creative student solutions that make use of 
software functions that include type/create outline, 
cut/paste, object/group/ungroup, resize and rotate, 
and delete vector points. Visit Chapter 4 on the

GESTALT
KEY POINTS
Th is chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of visual gestalt that underlie all 
design structure. Gestalt theory is explained and examined by showing its practical 
application to symbol and logo design. Th e function of symbol and logo design in the 
graphic design fi eld is discussed in terms of the relationship between form and content. 
All gestalt principles introduced here can be applied in future chapter assignments in 
layout, illustration, Web design, and more.
THE WHOLE AND THE PARTS
Th e Gestalt school of psychology, which began in Germany 
around 1912, investigated how we see and organize visual 
information into a meaningful whole (Figure 5–1). Th e con-
viction developed that the whole is more than the sum of its 
parts. Th is whole cannot be perceived by a simple addition of 
isolated parts. Each part is infl uenced by those around it.
WHOLE
As you read these words, you perceive the whole word, 
not the individual letterforms that make it up. You can still 
pause and examine each letter individually, but the word 
is more than the sum of its separate letterforms (Figure 5–2).
Similarly, when you sew a shirt, you begin with pieces of 
fabric cut into parts. When the parts have been assembled, 
a new thing has been created. Th e collar, the facing, and the 
sleeve still exist, but they have a new “whole” identity called 
a shirt.

CHAPTER 5  Good Gestalt
Giuseppe Arcimboldo, a painter from the 16th century, 
demonstrated the principle clearly in the portrait in 
Figure 5–3. A close examination reveals the separate 
parts that make up this head.
Th e early Gestalt psychologists and many other re-
searchers into visual perception have discovered that 
the eye seeks a unifi ed whole, or gestalt. Knowing how 
the eye seeks a gestalt can help you analyze and create 
successful designs. By knowing what connections the 
eye will draw for itself, you eliminate clutter and pro-
duce a clearly articulated design.
GESTALT PRINCIPLES
A designer works not simply with lines on paper, but 
with perceptual structure. Learn these gestalt percep-
tual principles and you can take advantage of the way 
object, eye, and graphic creation interweave. A beauti-
ful example can be found in the editorial illustration 
by John Heartfi eld (1891–1968) shown in Figure 5–4. 
Heartfi eld was a follower of the Berlin Dada movement, 
and he oft en used photomontage to create strong state-
ments. Figure 5–4 makes a powerful comment through 
its use of similarity. Th e fi gure on the top is a medieval 
depiction of a man being “broken on the wheel.” In this 
form of torture, the victim would be tied to a wagon 
wheel and struck with a blunt weapon to break the 
bones. Th e fi gure on the bottom is a photo collage by 
Heartfi eld that shows a man symbolically caught and

GALLERY PROFILE
John Heartﬁ eld (1891–1968)
A versatile artist, John Heartﬁ eld was a graphic 
designer, photomontagist, and stage designer. He 
was born Helmut Herzfelde in Berlin, Germany in 
1891. In 1914 he was drafted into the military. His 
experiences as a soldier in World War I led him to 
believe that art must address social conditions. 
Helmut Herzfelde was so angry about the anti-
British feeling in Germany that he protested by 
changing his name to John Heartﬁ eld in 1916.
In 1917 Heartﬁ eld became a follower of the Dada 
movement in Berlin. He often worked with pho-
tomontage, using the medium to create pictures 
that made extraordinarily powerful political and 
artistic statements. In 1920, Georges Grosz, 
Raoul Hausmann, and Heartﬁ eld, organized the 
First International Dada Fair at the Berlin. In 1933 
Heartﬁ eld ﬂ ed Nazi persecution in Germany set-
tling in Czechoslovakia. During the mid 1930s, 
he worked in Czechoslovakia for the socialist 
magazine, A.I.Z., where he used photomontage 
to attack Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party. These 
are the works he is best remembered for. Under 
fear of arrest, Heartﬁ eld was forced to leave for 
England in 1938 where he remained as an active 
artist and designer until settling in East Germany 
after World War II. John Heartﬁ eld is known as 
a leading designer, painter, and journalist of the 
Dada movement in Berlin.

tortured in the swastika symbol for Hitler’s regime. Th e 
similar shape and placement make the artist’s point that 
“As in the Middle Ages . . . so in the Th ird Reich.”
Similarity
When we see things that are similar, we naturally group 
them. Grouping by similarity occurs when we see 
similar shape, size, color, spatial location (proxim-
ity), angle, or value. All things are similar in some 
respects and diff erent in others. In a group of similar 
shapes and angles, we notice a dissimilar shape or 
angle. In the diagram in Figure 5–5 the gray square 
draws attention because it is diff erent from the 
squares surrounding it. Th e three letters i in simi-
larity are shown to be similar by treating them in a 
similar fashion to each other but diff erently from the 
other letterforms.
Grouping by similarity is true for realistic subject 
matter as well as nonfi gurative design forms. Th e 
symbol and logotype created for Alcoa by Saul Bass 
(1920–1996), a renowned American designer, relies on 
similarity of shape. Count the triangles in Figure 5–6.
Proximity
Grouping by similarity in spatial location is called 
proximity, or nearness. Th e closer two visual elements

location.

are, the more likely we will see them as a group. In 
Figure 5–7 the four squares on top seem to form a 
group whereas the eight squares on the bottom appear 
to belong to a diff erent group. Figure 5–8 uses a close 
and careful placement of all the elements to create a 
winery logo. Similarity is important, but so is the close 
proximity and careful placement of the elements. Fig-
ures 5–9 and 5–10 place shapes in close proximity that 
never touch but form a dynamic whole through prox-
imity and more gestalt unit-forming principles listed 
next. Th e proximity of lines or edges makes it easier for 
the eye to group them to form a fi gure. When you fi n-
ish the chapter, come back to these marks and analyze 
the combination of unit-forming principles at work.
Continuation
Th e viewer’s eye will follow along a line or curve. Con-
tinuation occurs when the eye is carried smoothly into 
a line or curve that links adjoining objects. Th e dia-
gram in Figure 5–11 shows how the eye will follow the 
interruption of the black outline, seeing a continued, 
implied shape (in this case an X). Th is principle is used 
extensively in layout design to unite various elements, 
oft en by placing them along invisible grid lines.
Shapes that are not interrupted but form a harmonious 
relationship with adjoining shapes please the eye. Th e 
symbol of the U.S. Energy Extension Service (Figure 
5–12) uses continuation to emphasize the moving,

dynamic nature of energy. In this example the ends of 
the e line up with the ends of the arrowhead, forming 
a continued line that harmoniously unites the shapes. 
Th e Family Circle logo by Herb Lubalin and Alan 
Peckolick (Figure 5–13) creates continuation by lining 
up the verticals of the two i letterforms and also lining 
up the l and r forms. Th e eye draws a line down those 
vertical shapes that makes a new whole out of two dif-
ferent words. American graphic designer and photog-
rapher Herb Lubalin (1918–1981) was the editorial 
design director for several distinguished publications. 
His work is shown several times throughout this text.
Closure
Familiar shapes are more readily seen as complete than 
incomplete. When the eye completes (closes) a line or 
curve in order to form a familiar shape, closure has 
occurred. Th e diagram in Figure 5–14 shows white 
circles appearing as the eye and brain close the open 
areas into a familiar circular shape. Figure 5–15 is a 
symbol created by the 1 plus 1 Design fi rm. Do you 
see the white plus sign created by the fi gure/ground 
relationship? Th is is a visual closure as our eyes fi nish 
the form. Part of the closure in this example includes a 
sudden conceptual connection and understanding of 
the name of the fi rm. Th is sort of connection is espe-
cially useful in trademark design. Closure is sometimes 
accompanied by an “Oh, now I see!” reaction. An 
elegant editorial statement is made in Figure 5–16 in 
this opera symbol when we recognize the link between 
a musical note and a heart.

Figure 5–17 by Herb Lubalin calls for active conceptual 
participation by the viewer to achieve an intellectual 
closure with the O shape and a womb. Th e playful 
shape in Figure 5–18 for an eyewear company on closer 
inspection forms spectacles. Another “Oh”! A wide 
variety of applications for this logo are shown on the 
accompanying Web site. 
 
Figure/Ground
Th e fundamental law of perception that makes it pos-
sible to discern objects is the fi gure/ground relation-
ship. Th e eye and mind separate an object (fi gure) 
from its surroundings (ground). As you read this 
page, your eyes are separating out words (fi gure) from 
ground (paper). Oft en the relationship between fi gure 
and ground is dynamic and ambiguous, off ering more 
than one solution to the searching eye, as we dis-
cussed in Chapter 3. Th e diagram in Figure 5–19 lets 
us see black bars on a white central background or 
see white squares on a black ground. Gestalt relation-
ships in graphic design are always intended to help 
structure an appropriate communication. Th e most 
structurally beautiful design is not successful if it 
fails to present the subject appropriately. Figure 5–20 
presents a fairly abstract symbolic notion of the deliv-
ery and exchange of information. It creates a lively 
fi gure/ground relationship with the white squares in 
the background. Similarity in the linear treatment 
and repeated arrow shapes unite the overall symbol. 
Finally, the two directional arrows suggest the notion of 
interactivity.
5–19 The perception of ﬁ gure/ground underlies much of 
symbol and logo construction.

Trademarks
Sometimes referred to as a positive/negative space 
relationship, the fi gure/ground principle is crucial to 
shaping a strong design (see Chapter 4). You must be 
aware of creating shapes in the “left  over” ground every 
time you create a fi gure. M. C. Escher (1898–1972) cre-
ated the wonderful example of a reversible fi gure/ground 
relationship shown in Figure 5–21. Th ere is no dominant 
foreground. As soon as our eyes fasten on an image, the 
surrounding background lays claim to our attention, 
reversing the fi gure. Escher, born in the Netherlands, is 
one of the world’s best-known graphic artists, creating 
hundreds of lithographs, wood engravings, and woodcuts.
Th ere are a variety of fi gure/ground relationships to 
investigate. Figure 5–22 uses a reversible fi gure/
ground relationship similar to the yin-yang symbol. 
Figure 5–23 uses a reversible relationship, where it is 
possible to focus on either the plus or the h forms.
TRADEMARKS
Th e interplay of gestalt principles occurs in all areas of 
art and design but is clearest in the creation of logo and 
symbol trademarks. Here form and function are closely 
related. We have examined the gestalt formal structure 
of trademarks. Next we consider the function of these 
marks. Th e fi nal project in this chapter will ask you to 
relate these two considerations.
Functions
Symbols and trademarks have served many functions 
in history. Th e early Christians relied on the symbol of 
the fi sh to identify themselves to one another secretly. 
In the Dark Ages, family trademarks were used. No 
nobleman in the same region could wear the same coat 
of arms as another. Figure 5–24 shows a typical coat of 
arms. Th ese “arms” came to mark the owner’s posses-
sions. Peasants used simpler housemarks, which were 
especially useful because few people could read. Also, 
each medieval artisan inscribed a personal mark on 
his or her products and hung out a sign showing his or 
her calling. During the Renaissance, the three golden 
balls of the Medici family symbolized money lending. 
Th e Medici mark can still be seen today, co-opted by 
modern pawnbrokers. More recently, in the western 
United States each cattle rancher uses a unique brand 
or mark to identify the ranch that owns individual 
cattle (Figure 5–25).

CHAPTER 5  Good Gestalt
Today trademarks are widely used by corporations. A 
trademark is any unique name or symbol used to iden-
tify a product and to distinguish it from others. Th ese 
unique marks can be registered and protected by law. 
Th eir primary use is to increase brand recognition and 
advertise products and services. Th e use of trademarks, 
or logos, fl ourishes as individuals identify themselves 
on letterheads, résumés, and home pages. Consumers 
come to rely on the quality associated with a trademark 
(think of Coca-Cola) and are willing to try new products 
identifi ed with that recognized trademark.
Making “Marks”
Unlike other forms of advertising, the modern trade- 
mark is oft en a long-term design. It may appear on 
letterhead, company trucks, packaging, employee 
uniforms, newsletters, and so on. Designers can spend 
months developing and testing one trademark. Only a 
strong design with a simple, unifi ed gestalt will stand 
the test of repeated exposure.
Keep several points in mind when developing a mark:
  You are not just “making your mark on the world;” 
you are making a mark to symbolize your client and 
your client’s product. It must refl ect the nature and 
quality of that product to an audience. Research the 
company, product, and audience. As designer Paul 
Rand said, “A trademark is created by a designer, but 
made by a corporation. A trademark is a picture, an 
image . . . of a corporation.”
  Th e mark is oft en reproduced in many diff erent 
sizes, from the company vehicle to a business card. 
Your design must remain legible and strong in all 
circumstances.
  Because this mark may be reproduced in newspaper 
advertising or with severely limited in-house dupli-
cating facilities, it must reproduce well in one color.
  Many trademarks are seen in adverse viewing 
conditions, such as short exposure, poor lighting, 
competitive surroundings, and lack of viewer inter-
est. Under such conditions, simplicity is a virtue. A 
simple, interesting shape with a good gestalt is easier 
to remember than a more complex design.
Some designers refer to all trademarks as logos, whereas 
others have a complex system of subtle categories. Th e 
two most common categories of trademarks, however, 
are symbols and logos.
Symbols
Merriam-Webster’s Eleventh Collegiate Dictionary says 
a symbol is “something that stands for or suggests 
something else by reason of relationship, association, 
convention, or accidental resemblance; especially: a 
visible sign of something invisible. . . . an arbitrary or 
conventional sign used in writing or printing relating 
to a particular fi eld to represent operations, quantities, 
elements, relations, or qualities.” Historically impor-
tant symbols include national fl ags, the cross, and the 
swastika (Figure 5–26).
5–26 The ﬂ ag, cross, and swastika are examples of 
historically important visual symbols.

83
Trademarks
Th e symbol is a type of trademark used to represent 
a company or product. It can be abstract or represen-
tational, but it does not usually include letterforms. 
It represents invisible qualities of a product, such as 
reliability, durability, strength, or warmth.
A symbol has several advantages, including the 
following:
1.  Original construction
2.  Simple gestalt, resulting in quick recognition
3.   A strong association that “colors” the symbol’s 
interpretation
Figure 5–27, a symbol proposed for the Califor-
nia Conservation Corps by the critically acclaimed 
designer Michael Vanderbyl, demonstrates all three 
qualities. It is an original mark, unlike any other, and it 
makes excellent use of the fi gure/ground relationship. 
We cannot see the baby without the presence of the 
parent. Th e whole that is formed by these strong, seem-
ingly simple shapes can be quickly recognized. Th e 
associations that this symbol stimulates are positive 
and nurturing. Form and content reinforce one another 
in this fi ne design.
A pictogram is a symbol used to cross language barriers 
for international signage. It is found in bilingual cities, 
such as Montreal, for traffi  c signs. It is also found in 
airports and on safety instructions inside airplanes. It 
is representational rather than abstract, as shown in 
Figure 5–28.
Symbols can also be examined in the light of semiot-
ics, which shows how an image takes on a culturally 
accepted meaning that goes beyond its merely recog-
nizable shape. As mentioned in Chapter 3, the study 
of images in semiotics involves the categories of icon, 
symbol, and index.. An icon is a sign that looks like 
what it represents. Realistic drawings and photographs 
are examples. Symbols, like the images shown in Figure 
5–26, have culturally determined signifi cance. For 
example, the eagle and the Statue of Liberty are symbols 
for the United States. Th e theory of semiotics goes on to 
defi ne an index as a sign that bears a direct relationship 
to the object it represents without simply showing that 
object. For example, the shadow of a building indicates 
its presence; a feather can indicate the presence of a 
bird. Symbols, icons, and indexes are all good concep-
tual approaches in the development of a trademark 
symbol and oft en are combined in a single mark.
Logos
Th e second category of trademark is called a logo or 
logotype. Th e logo is a unique type or lettering that 
spells out the name of a company or product. It may be

adopted for the California Conservation Corps is an excel-
lent integration of form and content. Courtesy of the artist.

Trademarks
hand lettered, but it is usually constructed out of varia-
tions on an existing typeface. Historically, it developed 
aft er the symbol, because it requires a literate audience.
When you create a logo, choose type that suits the 
nature of your client and audience. Figure 5–29 was 
created for Reader’s Digest by one of the most respected 
logo designers, Herb Lubalin. Th e clean, bold typestyle 
makes it easy to see the play on similar shapes that 
creates the “family connection” hidden in the word. 
Figure 5–30 was created for the Ditto Corporation, 
a duplication products manufacturer. Compare this 
typestyle with the one before. Although both are sans 
serif, each is distinctively suited to its use.
Ä
Digital Focus
Layers
Most logo designs are created using vector 
graphics. Because vectors can be enlarged or 
reduced with no loss of detail or resolution, they 
are the logical choice for logos that will appear on 
trucks, letterhead, signage, and other applications. 
Raster graphics can form the underlying basis for 
scanned imagery that is imported into a vector 
program and traced over in successive layers. The 
raster scan is then deleted, and the ﬁ le ﬂ attened 
before sending to print. It is always wise to save a 
ﬁ le with all the original layers in case you need to 
revise them.
Class Discussion
Choose a logo design from this chapter, or bring 
in an example to discuss. Analyze the gestalt unit-
forming principles at work. If you prefer, bring in 
an example that needs improvement. Figure 5-32

5–32 Chris Eichman, working with Bennett Syverson, 
created many thumbnail concepts for Rayovac’s new

strongest logos were tested with focus groups and 
sent back to the drawing board. After several revisions 
based on input from various stakeholders, the ﬁ nal 
design is currently on packaging being sold across the 
United States.
Th e advantages of a logotype include (1) original con-
struction and (2) easy identifi cation with the company 
or product because the name is included.
A combination mark is a symbol and logo used 
together. Th ese marks can be more diffi  cult to construct 
with a good gestalt because of their complexity. Th ey 
are oft en used, however, because they combine the 
advantages of symbol and logo. Th is design for the Word 
Wildlife Fund incorporates the initials for World Rescue 
Team with endangered animal outlines. (Figure 5–31).
In all these marks, gestalt principles help create a uni-
fi ed and striking design. With good gestalt, form and 
function interweave in a powerful whole.

EXERCISE
This exercise emphasizes the dynamic importance 
of simple shapes while requiring precision using 
vectors.
This assignment is best accomplished by using a 
vector graphics program with the grid turned on, 
using guides and rulers. If necessary, all assign-
ments in this text can also be done with graph 
paper using ink or collage (Figure 5–33).
1.  Select a circle 1⁄2" (4 cm) in diameter (or slightly 
more), and practice overlapping two circles to 
create new and varied shapes. Then try three 
circles. Do not use line or gray tones—only 
shape and black-and-white values. Reverse one 
out of another for more interesting effects.
2.  Place a circle in various positions within a 
square. Again, do not use line. Use black-and-
white shapes. Experiment with size and border-
variations.
3.  Set up a series of vertical lines so the white 
lines gradually diminish while the black lines 
expand. Start by making a series of vertical lines 
1⁄4" (5 mm) apart. Each line can then be incremen-
tally thickened.
4.  Create a break or anomaly in a series of vertical 
lines.
5.  Examine the illustrations in this chapter and iden-
tify the unifying gestalt features in each mark, to 
enrich the development of your own logo.
6.  Use one or more of these exercises to develop 
an appropriate symbol for a company of your 
choice.

USING 
VISUAL 
LANGUAGE
KEY POINTS 
Innovations in technology have greatly aff ected the development of our visual record 
of the spoken language. Historically, the tools used to create letterforms have largely 
determined the shape of those letterforms. Th is chapter briefl y introduces the historical 
development of typestyles, explaining the relationship between style and technology 
starting with the Book of Kells (Figure 6–1) and ending with 21st-century type design. 
It describes the role of text type in page layout, including size, line length, style, leading, 
spacing, and format.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION
Since a person fi rst made a mark in the sand for another to fi nd, we have been com-
municating with a visual language. Th e earliest forms of visual communication were 
pictorial drawings of everyday objects, such as weapons and animals. As the need to 
communicate grew, these pictures were combined to convey thoughts and ideas that 
eventually led to the creation of letterforms.
With visual language, an individual’s mark could be seen and understood aft er the 
maker had moved on or even died. Civilization developed along with our visual record 
of the spoken language. So did the importance of the individual and his or her written 
“voice.”
Alphabets
Th e earliest known alphabet emerged in Egypt some 4,000 years ago. Its inventors 
adopted pictorial characters from Egyptian writing to represent sounds in a diff erent 
language. Th at language was spoken by a western Asian people then living in Egypt. For 
the most part, characters in Egyptian writing represented entire words or other mean-
ingful units of language. In contrast, each character in the fi rst alphabet represented a 
single sound within a word. Th e development of the alphabet revolutionized commu-
nication. To master Egyptian writing required memorizing hundreds of characters; to 
master the alphabet, one needed to learn fewer than 30.
By 1000 b.c. the Phoenicians were using the alphabet. A nation of traders, they needed 
an effi  cient, condensed writing system to record business transactions. As time passed, 
the Phoenician letterforms grew more abstract and linear. Th e Greeks adopted the

alphabet from the Phoenicians a few centuries later. 
Unlike the Phoenicians, however, the Greeks developed 
letters to represent vowels as well as consonants. By 
700 b.c. the Greek alphabet had spread to the Italian 
peninsula, where the Romans eventually learned it, fur-
ther modifying it to suit the sounds of Latin. Gradually 
the Roman alphabet evolved into a form almost identi-
cal to that used in most western European alphabets 
today (Figure 6–2).
As designers working with the letters of the alphabet, 
we have thousands of years of history behind us. Th e 
shape of letters has been largely determined by the 
tools used to create them. Th e Phoenicians, Greeks, 
and Romans applied ink to reed brushes or pens for 
writing on papyrus. Th is method created letters with 
a pattern of thick and thin strokes and frequently 
rounded forms. Th e Greeks and Romans also used a 
sharp, pointed stylus to write on a wax-coated tablet, 
resulting in strokes of even thickness. Important 
inscriptions were carved into stone with a chisel. 
In early stone inscriptions, letters tended to have 
simpler straighter lines, perhaps because curves 
were more diffi  cult to carve. Eventually, however, 
the Roman alphabet, even as cut into stone, came to 
have a greater variety of straight and curved forms 
than its predecessors. Also, this alphabet came to 
have a fi nishing line, or serif, at the top and/or foot 
of vertical elements. A by-product of the way the 
letters were carved, serifs gave the Roman alphabet 
an unprecedented sense of overall harmony. But 
these letterforms were diffi  cult to write and took up 
a lot of space on increasingly expensive papyrus. So a 
simpler, more condensed, more easily written script 
developed. Eventually the classic capital letters came 
to be used with smaller letters, setting a precedent for 
our upper- and lowercase style. Handwritten papy-
rus scrolls kept the alphabet alive during the early 
Middle Ages.
Our most common typefaces are imitations of early 
handwriting or modifi cations of early typefaces mod-
eled aft er the lettering in manuscript books. Th e inven-
tion of the fi rst printing press with a system of movable 
type was around 1440, when Johannes Gutenberg 
assembled a mechanical press using metal type molds 
to create inked text blocks pressed onto paper.
INFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY 
Innovation in printing technology during the Indus-
trial Revolution (18th–19th century) contributed to the 
development of new typestyles. Advances in mechani-
cal design and cast-iron parts were applied to the print-
ing press in the early 1800s, allowing for a much larger 
printed sheet. Th e London Times was the fi rst publisher 
to replace the hand press with a steam-powered print-
ing press, which could make more than a thousand 
impressions an hour. Another important innovation of 
the 1800s was the invention of the Linotype machine 
in 1886 by Ottmar Mergenthaler. It replaced hand 
typesetting with a keyboard-operated machine that 
generated lines of type cast in melted lead. Th ese lines 
of type were locked into slim wooden cases before 
printing. Th e demand for increased advertising and 
other forms of print media led to the development of a 
variety of type designs.
Th e invention of phototypography in the 1960s her-
alded the Age of Information, as it became increasingly

easy and important to disseminate information by 
word and image. Computers now make it possible to 
quickly develop seemingly infi nite variations on exist-
ing typestyles quickly. Specialized soft ware makes the 
creation of new styles simpler and more accessible than 
ever before, and digital presses continue to speed print 
production. Whatever technology used, in whatever 
century, the eye and mind of the designer remains a vital 
factor. Figure 6–3 integrates type and image by match-
ing quality of line and color.
TYPE CATEGORIES
Like the alphabet itself, typographic design has under-
gone a long development. A brief look at its history will 
help you assemble and recognize types with similar 
attributes, or type categories. History provides a key to 
proper use.
Th e type category we refer to as old style, with gently 
blended serifs leading into thick and thin strokes, 
was created around 1470 by Nicolas Jenson, a French 
printer working out of Venice. French typographer 
Claude Garamond based a typestyle now known as 
Garamond on Jenson’s design. Th is classic remains 
in use today, and a version of it is shown in Figure 6–4. 
Around 1530 Garamond established the fi rst type 
foundry—a business set up specifi cally to market type-
faces to printers. Th e many fonts Garamond created 
were extremely precise and legible, setting a standard 
for typographic beauty that is still recognized today. 
During the early 1700s William Caslon designed a 
typeface based on Garamond’s classic typestyles that 
was so widely adopted it became the standard for Brit-
ish newspapers.
A modern revival of 15th-century Italian types 
occurred in Europe and the United States around 
1890. Englishman William Morris produced a type 
called Golden that recalled the spirit of the 15th 
century. Golden was based on type designs by Nicolas 
Jenson in the 1470s. Morris set up a hand press in a 
rented cottage, establishing Kelmscott Press, which 
was committed to meticulous hand printing, hand-
made paper, and hand-cut woodblocks. Th e press 
celebrated the book as an art form. From 1891 until 
1898, Kelmscott Press produced 53 diff erent titles 
and more than 18,000 volumes. Golden, Troy, and 
a smaller version of Troy, called Chaucer, were all

Morris’s typeface creations based on Jenson and Gothic 
styles (see Figure 6–5).
Most roman types today (a regular or normal version 
of a typestyle) have variations available called italics. 
Italics are slanted letterforms that relate to the original 
typestyle but do not duplicate it. Around the turn of the 
16th century, Venetian printer Aldus Manutius (credited 
with being the fi rst publisher) and his type designer, 
Francesco Griff o, developed italics as a way of fi tting 
more letters on a line to save space. For about 40 years, 
italic was simply another style of type, until an italic was 
consciously developed from an upright roman mold. 
Today most roman types have matching italics as well as 
several other variations, such as bold and condensed.
Roman faces with strong contrast between thick and 
thin strokes and with thin serifs were developed in 
the 18th century. Th ese faces are generally classifi ed as 
transitional. Because they were designed specifi cally 
for the printing industry, they printed more clearly and 
precisely than their predecessors. A widespread interest 
in copperplate engraving at the time encouraged the 
development of types that incorporated a very fi ne 
line. Baskerville is a serif typeface designed in 1757 by 
the Englishman John Baskerville. Planning to increase 
legibility, he increased the contrast between thick and 
thin strokes, with sharper and more tapered serifs and 
graceful curves. Th e result was a lovely, refi ned design, 
considered a transitional typeface (Figure 6–6).
Th e typefaces Didot and Bodoni imitated the engraver’s 
tool with precise hairline strokes. Th e term modern 
is used to describe these 18th-century typestyles. Th e 
Italian type designer and printer Giambattista Bodoni 
was infl uenced by Didot and Caslon. His entire Bodoni 
type family ushered in the modern era of hairline serifs 
and strong contrast between thick and thin strokes.
Th e 19th century saw the development of many new 
typefaces with a wide variety of looks. Among these 
faces were sans serifs and the Egyptians. William Morris’s 

93
Type Categories
revival of the old, classic typefaces occurred during 
this time.
Since the early 19th century, serif and sans serif types 
have alternated in popularity. Great interest sur-
rounded sans serif during much of the 20th century. 
Bauhaus designers in Germany during the 1920s began 
designing sans serif faces such as Futura. In the 1950s, 
Univers and Helvetica became the dominant typefaces 
used by design professionals. Th e sans serif domi-
nance lasted throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Newer 
versions of Helvetica show more consistency among 
font variations. Large x-height and beautiful positive 
and negative shapes accompany a clean precision and 
understated elegance of line. Th e horizontals are cut 
along a common line.
Figure 6–7 is a layout by contemporary designer 
Paula Scher that uses sans serif type to evoke an 
earlier era. Designed in 1984 for the Koppel & Scher 
fi rm, this small book featured the fi rst two para-
graphs of several famous novels. Each spread was 
designed in the period style popular when the novel 
was written. Today’s designers are able to choose 
from a rich array of old and new typestyles. In fact, 
such an extensive array of fonts is available on every 
computer that selecting one can be quite diffi  cult. 
A basic familiarity with typography will help you 
develop a discerning eye.
Historic Type Families
OLD STYLE 
Characteristics of old style faces include thick- and 
thin-stroke serifs that seem to merge into the main 
strokes. Th is feature is called bracketing. Garamond 
and Caslon are examples. Created in the early 1600s, 
Garamond (Figure 6–4) was the fi rst typeface designed 
to appear uniformly printed rather than hand lettered. 
It remained the principal typeface for more than 200 
years, with many derivatives.
TRANSITIONAL 
Th is category of type combines features of both old 
style and modern, emphasizing thicks and thins and 
gracefully bracketed serifs as in Baskerville. It is lighter 
than old style and has a more precise, controlled 
character. It is less mechanical and upright than the 
modern faces.
Baskerville has straighter and more mechanical lines 
than the old style typefaces, with fl atter serifs that 
come to a fi ne tip. Increased contrast between the thick 
and thin strokes of the letterforms, as well as rounded 
brackets, give it more delicacy than old style faces such 
as Caslon.
John Baskerville made several technical innovations 
that aff ected the appearance of his type. He passed

printed sheets through heated copper cylinders to 
smooth out the rough texture of the paper then in use. 
Th is smooth surface made it possible to reproduce 
delicate serifs clearly. Figure 6–8 shows text-size Gara-
mond and Baskerville fonts in diff erent leading (space 
between lines). When working with typography, the 
three factors—typestyle, point size, and leading—are 
interrelated.
MODERN 
Th e modern styles evolved from transitional types. 
Th ey show still greater contrast between thicks and 
thins. Modern typefaces are characterized by hairline-
thin serifs that join the body with a stiff  unbracketed 
corner. Th ere is strong vertical stress to the letters.
Bodoni (Figure 6–9) fi ts this category. It was cre-
ated in the late 1700s by Italian printer Giambat-
tista Bodoni. Bodoni was infl uenced by the work of 
Baskerville and François-Ambroise Didot, a French-
man who also gave Europe a fully developed type 
measurement system.
EGYPTIAN 
Th e fi rst slab serif typestyle was introduced around 
1815. Th e category was dubbed “Egyptian” because 
Egyptian artifacts and Egyptian travel were in vogue. 
Napoleon’s conquest of Egypt aroused great enthusi-
asm for that country. During this period, type design 
became less predictable and more eclectic. Type 
characteristics were mixed and recombined, producing 
many variations. Th e heavy square serifs in this cat-
egory oft en match the strokes in thickness. Th ere is less 
diff erence between thicks and thins than in the modern 
and transitional periods. Clarendon and Century are 
examples of this group.
Th e popularity of square slab serif type decreased greatly 
in the early 20th century but then revived somewhat 
in its latter decades. Lubalin Graph (Figure 6–10), 
designed in 1974 by Herb Lubalin and drawn by Tony 
DiSpigna and Joe Sundwall, has the characteristics of 
Egyptian typestyles.
SANS SERIF 
William Caslon created the original sans serif in the 
early 1800s. Th e 1920s saw the development of sans 
serif type families including Gill Sans, created by 
Eric Gill, as well as Herbert Bayer’s Universal. In the 
1950s, designers of the International Typographic Style 
examined available typefaces and found them lacking. 
Weight changes were not subtle enough, and the vari-
ous weights and widths in a type family oft en lacked 
coherency. Th is disorder was natural, because fonts 
within a family were oft en designed by diff erent people. 
Th en a young Swiss type designer named Adrian 
Frutiger developed a sans serif face called Univers. He 
created a completely consistent family of types in all 
possible weights and widths.
Several classic sans serif typefaces were designed at the 
German Bauhaus (see Chapter 2). Infl uenced by the 
Bauhaus, the Swiss fi rm Haas worked with the German

Stempel foundry in 1957 to produce Helvetica (Figure 
6–11). It is still considered by many designers to be 
the perfect type—versatile, legible, and appropriate in 
a wide variety of applications. Figure 6–12 is a design 
from 1923 using a grid layout and sans serif type by El 
Lissitzky. (Note its similarity to Figure 6–7.) A leading 
Russian constructivist, Lissitzky believed in the power 
of graphic design to infl uence social order. He helped 
export constructivist theory and style to the rest of 
Europe through his printed work and lectures.
MISCELLANEOUS FACES 
Many fonts do not seem to belong to any category. 
Th ey are oft en experimental, ornamental styles of 
limited application, sometimes created by hand. Th ese 
eccentric types are rarely suitable for text type, but they 
do fi nd appropriate usage in display headings, such as 
the book cover in Figure 6–13 by Diane Fenster, where 
type and image are delicately integrated.
It is possible to use specialized ornate styles in display 
headlines and not hamper readability too greatly. In 
large amounts of body copy, however, every subtle varia-
tion has a cumulative eff ect that can seriously hinder 
readability. A classic all-purpose typestyle will remain 
legible and unobtrusive as body type. Selecting an 
appropriate text type calls for a sensitive, educated eye.
TYPE FAMILIES
Th e fi ve categories of typestyles we have discussed are 
fi lled with typefaces, such as Bodoni and Baskerville. 
Each typeface is composed of a type family that comes 
in a variety of weights and sizes. A type family is all 
the variations of a particular typeface. Helvetica, for 
example, is available in a series of variations described as 
light condensed, medium condensed, bold condensed, 
ultra light, ultra light condensed, ultra light italic, light, 
medium, regular, medium light, bold, bold italic, and 
bold extended. Figure 6–14 displays the Helvetica family.
A specifi c variation in a specifi c size is called a font. 
For example, 18-point Helvetica italic is a font. A great 
variety of shapes exist in a single font. Th ese various 
shapes can be successfully combined into a unifi ed 
design because of their similarities in width, brackets, 
serifs, and x-height. A well-designed combination of 
type fonts is an excellent example of the interplay of 
repetition and variety that makes for good design.
Computerized layout gives the designer the ability 
to make a wide variety of changes in these carefully 
designed fonts. Vector programs allow type to be 
mirrored, scaled with varying horizontal and verti-
cal values, and otherwise manipulated for eff ect. Th e 
precomputer hot type technology was based on actual 
physical pieces of metal shaped into letterforms. Th ese 
could not be stretched or set to overlap unless the sheet 
was printed twice and the font recast. Now that nearly 
everything is possible, an enthusiasm for exploration 
needs to be tempered by respect for the subtle and 
complex beauty of a font.

CHAPTER 6  Using Visual Language
Selection
How do you select which style of type to use? What 
factors are involved in designing with text type? Select-
ing the type for a given layout means making decisions 
in six interrelated areas: type size, line length, typestyle, 
leading, spacing, and format.
Designers sometimes set their own type as they develop 
a layout design. But whether you set the type yourself 
or design it for someone else who prepares it, the six 
characteristics mentioned earlier need to be specifi ed. It 
is important to develop a fi ne critical eye for type qual-
ity, watching for problems such as uneven letterspacing 
and low resolution. Inking problems can be caused by a 
reversal of a serif typestyle. (Figure 6–15).
Size
Text type is any type that is less than 14 points in size. 
A point is a unit of measurement based on the pica. 
Th ere are 12 points in a pica and approximately 6 picas 
in an inch, so there are 72 points in an inch. Th e point 
system of measurement was introduced in the 18th 
century, because the small sizes of text type called for 
a measuring system with extremely fi ne increments 
(Figure 6–16). Type size is measured in points until it 
reaches about 2 inches (5 cm) high. It is available from 
5 points to 72 points on desktop computer menus, or 
larger sizes can be specifi ed.
Th e easiest way to measure type without a computer 
is by comparing it with a type specimen book and 
matching the size visually (Figure 6–17). It can also be 
measured with a point-and-pica ruler. Remember to 
measure from top of ascender to bottom of descender. 
When choosing a type size, keep the audience in mind. 
Type smaller than 10 points is oft en diffi  cult for older 
people to read.
Type size can be diffi  cult to judge on the computer 
monitor, because the screen image may not be the 
same size as your fi nal printed page. Also, the vertical, 
backlit quality of a monitor is a diff erent medium from 
the printed page, and we interact with it diff erently. 
Beginning designers tend to choose sizes that are too 
large when they fi rst start designing with type on the 
computer. It is easier to judge the eff ect of typography 
accurately in a printed proof than onscreen. However, 
if the fi nal format will be a Web page, its eff ectiveness 
should be judged on the screen rather than in printed 
form.
Line Length
Line length also is measured by the pica system. It is the 
length in picas of a line of text type. Th e dimensions of 
the page itself, however, are usually expressed in 
inches (or centimeters). For example, 8-point type 
may be set in a 22-pica line length on an 
8 1/2 x 11" (22 x 28-cm) page format. Or it may 
simply fl ow to fi ll a predetermined column layout 
in your layout program.
Th e length of a line is closely related to the size of 
type. A small point size such as 6 point or 8 point 
on a line 44 picas long is diffi  cult to read. Th e type 
seems to jump around along the midsection of the 
line, and the eye must search for the beginning of 
each new line. Th is trouble is worse when there is 
insuffi  cient space between lines. Usually you want 
the reader’s eyes to move smoothly, never being 
forced to slow down or lose their place. Th e stan-
dard line length and point size ratio for optimal legi-
bility is a line 50 to 70 characters long. To remember 
this ratio, keep in mind that for optimum readability, 
line length in picas should be approximately double 
the point size. An 8-point type sits well on a 16-pica 
line. However, variations on this theme can be used 
purposely to slow the reader down.
Style
When you choose text type, legibility is a prime 
consideration. Although there are many elegant 
and accessible styles, stay away from styles with an 
excess of ornamentation.
Next, seek a type appropriate to the audience, the 
publication, and your own sense of aesthetics. 
Sans serif has a modern feel and is highly legible in 
the limited amounts of copy used in most annual 
reports, newsletters, and so on. Th e serif types are 
generally more traditional and classical in feeling. 
Th ey are easier to read in large amounts. Many of 
the newer styles strive to combine the virtues of 
serif and sans serif type.
Trends arise in type just as in music, clothes, and 
lifestyles. Notice how they change from year to 
year. Use the fashionable typestyles only when they 
seem both appropriate and aesthetically pleasing.
Th e printing process can help determine typestyle 
selection. Delicate hairline serifs are not appropri-
ate when a heavy ink coverage is required, because 
the ink will block up the serifs and result in a 
blotchy look. Heavily textured paper will also make 
a delicate serif unadvisable. Th e texture of the 
paper will cause the fi nely inked serifs to break up.
Beginning designers oft en combine several type-
styles in a typographical layout. Th ey choose each 
for its own beauty and interest but forget the eff ect

of the whole design. Diverse styles usually refuse to com-
bine into an organized whole and have an undisciplined 
and chaotic look. Many experienced designers prefer to 
work within one type family, drawing on its bold, italic, 
and roman faces (see Figure 6–14). Th ey achieve a look 
of variety without risking going outside one family. Th is 
course is certainly the safest for a new designer.
Exciting layouts, however, oft en do mix distinctively 
diff erent typefaces. Mixing takes sensitivity to how the 
styles aff ect one another and contribute to the whole. 
A good rule of thumb when choosing to mix type 
families is to make certain they are very diff erent. Th e 
composition will work if there is either deliberate simi-
larity or defi nite variety. It can confuse and displease 

100
CHAPTER 6  Using Visual Language
the eye if the distinctions are muddy. Figure 6–18 is a 
design by well-known designer Paula Scher that uses a 
variety of typographic treatments to present the 1919 
book Metamorphosis by Franz Kafk a. Contemporary 
designers in print and online graphics have many more 
choices of typefaces, and opportunities to work with 
design eff ects, than ever before. Take a look at Figure 
6-19 on this book’s accompanying Web site. 
Leading
Leading (pronounced like the metal lead) describes the 
vertical spacing between lines of type. Th e historical ori-
gin of the term goes back to hot-metal typesetting, when 
a thin strip of lead was inserted as a spacer between lines 
of metal type. Th is type and leading were locked together 
into a galley, inked, and printed. Leading strongly aff ects 
the look and readability of the layout. Type is consid-
ered to be set solid when no space is inserted between 
the descender of the top line and the ascender of the 
bottom line. A 10-point type set on a 10-point leading 
is an example of solid leading. Herb Lubalin’s design for 
Avant Garde magazine in 1967 uses very tight leading 
(see Figure 7–12). How much leading should you use? 
Several factors aff ect that decision, including type size, 
line length, typestyle, and available space.
TYPE SIZE 
Leading should be proportionate to the size of the type. 
Although there is no one correct leading for a certain 
type size, we oft en fi nd 10-point type set on 12-point

leading. Th is means an extra 2 points of space have 
been inserted between the lines of type. A larger or 
smaller type size may require less leading. A 14-point 
type may need only 14- or 15-point leading, for 
instance. It is rare to fi nd minus leading, or a 10-point 
type set on 9-point leading. Current typesetting tech-
nology makes it possible to set one line of type on top 
of another and to weave entire paragraphs over each 
other for visual texture. Th e important criteria always 
are as follows: Is it appropriate? Does the form follow 
and enhance the communication function?
LINE LENGTH 
Line length is an important factor in determining 
leading. Th e longer the line, the more leading is 
appropriate. With longer line lengths, the eye tends 
to wander. If there is insuffi  cient space between 
lines, you will fi nd yourself reading the line above or 
beneath and having diffi  culty fi nding the beginning of 
each line.
TYPESTYLE 
Th ree aspects of the typestyle also aff ect leading: 
x-height, vertical stress, and serif versus sans serif. 
Th e x-height, as you know, refers to the size of the 
body of the letter, without its ascender or descender. 
Th e x-height of Helvetica is much greater than the 
x-height of an older type such as Baskerville. Con-
sequently Helvetica probably requires more leading 
because it does not have lots of extra white space 

102
CHAPTER 6  Using Visual Language
packed around its body. It has relatively short ascend-
ers and descenders, so the lines of type appear closer 
together (Figure 6–20a).
Th e vertical stress of a typestyle also aff ects leading, 
because the stronger the vertical emphasis, the more 
the eye is drawn up and down instead of along the line 
of type. Hence the greater the vertical stress, the more 
leading is required. A typestyle such as Baskerville has 
a stronger vertical stress than Garamond and therefore 
requires more leading.
A serif helps draw the eye along in a horizontal direc-
tion, so serif type is generally considered easier to read 
than sans serif type. Sans serif type usually requires 
more leading than serif styles to keep the eye moving 
smoothly along.
Spacing
Letterspacing is the amount of space between letters of 
a word (Figure 6–20b). A good fi gure/ground relation-
ship between letterforms is as important with text type 
as with display type. If the letters are spaced too far 
apart, the eye must jump between letters, and reading 
becomes strained.
Whether designing with text type or display type, keep 
an eye out for the creation of equal volumes of white 
space between individual letterforms. Kerning is a term 
that describes the specifi c adjustment of space between 
individual letterforms. IO, for example, will require 
spacing diff erent from MN (Figure 6–21).
Th e amount of space between words is called word 
spacing. If word spacing is too great, it is diffi  cult for 
6–20a Identical point sizes can have very different 
x-heights.
6–20b Letterspacing can vary from very loose to very tight. 
It is easily adjusted in many software programs. This is 
called tracking.
6–21 Spacing between individual letterforms must vary to 
please the eye. This is called kerning.

the eye to move quickly along the line of type. Th ere 
is a tendency to pause between individual words. Th e 
reader should be unaware of the space between words 
and aware instead of their content.
Word spacing usually is not a problem with text type, 
unless the type is being set in a justifi ed format (fl ush left  
and fl ush right edges). To make the lines come out even, 
the computer will insert extra space between words. If a 
line is long, with many words, this addition is not notice-
able. However, if the line is short, large white holes seem 
to appear in the copy (Figure 6–22). Look at your local 
newspaper, and squint. Oft en rivers of white will appear 
in the columns of text type as a result of a poor combina-
tion of justifi ed type on a too-short line length.
Format
Format design refers to the arrangement of lines of 
type on the page (Figure 6–23). Th ere are two basic 
categories: justifi ed and unjustifi ed. In justifi ed type, 
all the lines are the same length, so that the left  and 
right edges of the column of type are straight. Th is 
format is commonly used in newspaper layout and in 
text and trade books. It is appropriate when speed and 
ease of reading are the primary considerations. Justi-
fi ed copy is considered by many to be slightly easier to 
read than unjustifi ed copy. Th e straight, squared-off  
columns of type give an orderly, classical feeling to the 
page.
Unjustifi ed copy can be arranged in a variety of ways: 
fl ush left , fl ush right, centered, and asymmetrically. 
Th e New Typography proponents of the 1920s believed 
ragged right type was more readable than justifi ed type. 
Unequal line length was also an important part of the 
International Typographic Style.
FLUSH LEFT 
Th e fl ush left  format calls for a straight left  edge and 
a ragged right edge. Typewritten copy is usually fl ush 
left . Th is format is commonly used in annual reports, 
brochures, identifi cation lines under photographs, and 
whenever you want a slightly less formal look than can 
be achieved with justifi ed type. One of the benefi ts of 
this format is that it is possible to avoid hyphenated 
words. Page layout soft ware programs usually allow the 
user to set parameters for hyphenation. A designer can 
specify how many hyphenated line endings can happen 
in succession and just how ragged the right or left  edge 
can become.

Paula Scher (b 1948)
Paula Scher (b. 1948) has been at the leading 
edge of graphic design for nearly 40 years. Scher 
earned her BFA at the Tyler School of Art in Phila-
delphia and began her career in the 1970s as an 
art director for Atlantic and CBS Records. In 1984 
she cofounded the Koppel & Scher design ﬁ rm. 
In 1991 she joined Pentagram as a partner. Her 
teaching career includes more than two decades 
at the School of Visual Arts in NYC, along with 
positions at Cooper Union, Tyler School of Art, 
and Yale University. Her award-winning work 
has been exhibited all over the world and is 
included in the permanent collections of MOMA, 
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and 
many more.
Scher has developed identity and branding 
systems, promotional materials, environmental 
graphics, and packaging and publication designs 
for a broad range of clients. Several spreads from 
her Great Beginnings brochure are included in 
these chapters.

CHAPTER 6  Using Visual Language
FLUSH RIGHT 
Th e fl ush right format is unusual and diffi  cult to read. 
It has a ragged left  edge and is used for design eff ect 
in special situations. It is diffi  cult for the eye to search 
out the beginning of each new line without a common 
starting point.
CENTERED 
Centered copy is oft en found in headlines or invita-
tions but rarely in standard copy. It is a slow-reading, 
classical format that encourages the reader to pause 
aft er each line. It is important to make logical breaks 
at the end of each line. Th is format has a pronounced 
irregular shape and packs a lot of space around itself. 
Th e white space and irregular outline can draw the eye 
strongly. Consider the content of your material, how 
rapidly it should be read, and the overall look of the 
page before deciding on a centered format.
ASYMMETRICAL 
Asymmetrically arranged type can put across the 
point of a poem or an important statement. Asym-
metry is also used in display type to achieve better 
balance among letterforms. Contour type is a form 
of asymmetry that fi ts the shape of an illustration, fol-
lowing its contour. Type that is set around the squared 
edge of a photo is called a runaround. Occasionally 
type will be set in the shape of a contour itself.
Th e ancient Egyptians and Greeks originally experi-
mented with this format. It was used early in the 20th 
century by the poet Apollinaire and more recently by 
contemporary designers. Figure 6–24 is an asymmetri-
cal typographic illustration.
Style and Content
Typography sets a visual tone depending on the 
variables we have just examined. Th e style, the leading, 
and the format all contribute to a nonverbal com-
munication that has a great deal to say. Th is visual 
communication, or visual language, aff ects the image 
of the client. It is a function of the choices the designer 
has made—partly as a personal preference, partly in 
response to the client’s needs, and partly in response to 
contemporary design trends. Th e type design shown in 
Figure 6-25 presents old style typography placed on a 
very modern interactive exhibition.

CHAPTER 6  Using Visual Language
Specifi c typestyles and layout designs are associated 
with historical periods. Typestyles can evoke the 
mood of an era just through careful type selection 
and usage. Th e 20th century in the United States 
saw many styles come into vogue and then fade out. 
Typestyles refl ect their era’s philosophical and techno-
logical status.
Wood display type was widely used in the 1800s. By 
the latter part of the century, these wooden typestyles 
became elaborate, beautifully decorative designs. Type-
styles and trends continued to change, refl ecting the 
sensibilities and technology of the time. Th e Broadway 
typestyle was popular in the 1930s; the sans serif styles 
of Helvetica and Univers were widely used in the 1950s 
and 1960s. Today’s styles show an appreciation for clas-
sic style as well as an eclectic willingness to experiment 
with unusual graphic eff ects, as digital typesetting 
encourages stylistic innovation.
With the advent of digital typography, special eff ects 
with type and layout design have become easier to 
achieve than ever before. Experimentation is good, espe-
cially when tempered by a fi rm knowledge of traditional 
typographic design principles. Figure 6–26 shows some 
examples of digital options for type placement. Th e 
vertical treatment is not generally recommended.
Some Problems
Once the format for the layout is selected and the type 
is set, some awkward accidents may occur. If you are 
aware of these potential problems, you can avoid them.
Widows and orphans are romantic names designating 
short, isolated paragraph-ending lines. A widow is a 
short line that appears at the top of a printed column 
and is most distressing when it appears at the top of a 
new page. An orphan is a short line that appears at

DIGITAL FOCUS
More about Type
Computer programs that work with vector graphics 
typography can generate a wide variety of typo-
graphic effects. Type can be keystroked directly 
(or placed from word-processing programs) into 
Illustrator, Freehand, or InDesign and others, 
with a wide variety of effects to choose from. The 
same block of type can be placed with a variety 
of sizes, fonts, spacing, and formats using these 
programs. With all these choices available, it is 
more important than ever to develop a good eye 
for type use. In your program of choice, experi-
ment with type on a path, type inside an area, and 
varying formats, and become familiar with an array 
of fonts and spacing options. Keep an eye out for 
elegance, understatement, clarity, and beauty. But 
an element of “fun” can also be a great addition.
the bottom of a column or page, or a single word or 
word part that appears on a line by itself at the end 
of a paragraph.
Hyphenation can also become a problem, especially 
if the line length is short and the format is justifi ed. 
Too many hyphenated words will interfere with read-
ability. Hyphens should always fall between syllables, 
and they should not chop a word into unrecognizable 
segments.
A DESIGN SUMMARY
Designing well with typography is a delicate thing. It 
relies on so many interrelated variables that it cannot 
be reduced to a simple formula. Here, however, are a 
few general guidelines:

107
Execution
  When choosing typestyles, remember that it is wise 
to either stay within the same type family or mix 
very diff erent fonts. For example, two similar serif 
fonts will be more diffi  cult to use together than a 
serif and a sans serif. Staying within a family is safe. 
It gives a wide but unifi ed choice.
  Th e design principles of proximity, similarity group-
ing, and focal point are all important to consider in 
layout design. Variations in point size and font style 
function as a code to guide the reader. Th e head-
ing and subheading formats in a text, for example, 
should be carefully chosen to visually group infor-
mation and highlight topics. Each heading should be 
placed closer to the information it introduces than to 
the unrelated paragraph above it.
  Decide what kind of speed you want from your 
reader. A justifi ed format is the quickest read; ragged 
right takes a little more intimate involvement on the 
part of the reader. A centered format is a slow read, 
presenting itself line by line rather than as a grouped 
paragraph. Mixing these formats can give the reader 
visual clues about the content. Th e running text in 
a chapter may be justifi ed, for example, while the 
photo captions are all ragged right.
  Every element that goes onto a page is important. 
Every element contributes to the whole, so take 
nothing for granted.
EXECUTION
Specifying and Correcting Copy
When you specify or “spec” copy, you provide all the 
information necessary to set the fi nal type for lay-
out: typestyle, point size, leading, format, line length, 
sometimes letterspacing, and special instructions. 
Almost always some corrections are needed in typeset 
copy, due to last-minute revisions or errors caught 
late. Proofreading is an easier job now, with the spell-
check feature available on type-based programs. Use it 
always. However, do not rely on it to always be correct. 
Take a look. Did you mean lie or lien? Th ey both pass a 
spell check.
You can use proofreader’s marks to request error cor-
rections from a design point of view, such as damaged 
copy, poor breaks in words, or incorrect fonts. Th ese 
time-honored proofreader’s marks for communicating 
with a typesetter are shown in Figure 6–27.

EXERCISE
Study various magazines, newspapers, and other 
publications for samples of different typographic 
treatments. Which are successful, and which are 
ﬂ awed? Choose two of the less effective samples 
for analysis. Determine their line length, leading, 
point size, and typestyle, making recommenda-
tions for improvement. Prepare these for a class 
discussion.
PROJECTS
Typographical Illustration of a Poem
Select a poem or a portion of an interesting and 
emotive piece of prose (song lyrics are OK) that 
is no longer than 20 lines. Set it twice. The ﬁ rst 
time, follow the standard guidelines for typography 
to enhance readability, paying close attention to 
leading, line length, spacing (kerning and tracking), 
and format. Select one type family, limit the fonts, 
and restrict the point-size variation. Look at Josef 
Müller-Brockmann for inspiration.
The second time you set the copy, break as many 
rules as you wish while creating an effect appropri-
ate to the piece and your feelings about it. Experi-
ment with complexity and diversity. Use a vector 
graphics program for this project. If your class is 
using Photoshop, feel free to incorporate imagery 
that echoes your type treatments (Figure 6–28).
Book Cover Design
Book covers are like small posters. They attract 
readers with their strong visuals. Create two cov-
ers for books that are part of a reissued series by 
a 20th-century author. The covers for this series 
should be visually united to indicate that the books 
are part of a series. Consider similar color, layout, 
graphic technique, and so on. Be sure the cov-
ers are also varied enough to hold interest. Use 
a primarily typographic treatment. Paula Scher’s 
designs for the Great Beginnings series shown in 
this chapter may provide good inspiration for this 
project. Figure 6–29 is a professional cover design 
that effectively uses an integration of type and 
image.

Critique
Design the entire cover for this assignment, includ-
ing front, spine, and back. Include appropriate 
information. Include space for the ﬂ aps and print 
the ﬁ nished pieces, folding them around an actual 
book for ﬁ nal presentation. Consider incorporat-
ing an image. The research part of this assignment 
is important. Be familiar with the author’s writing 
so that your design reﬂ ects the content and tone 
of the writing. Spend time at a local bookstore, 
or online (but a bookstore smells better) looking 
at the competition’s cover designs and searching 
for designs that are primarily typographic. Look at 
a series, and consider how the cover designs are 
united. Figure 6–30 shows a solution to a similar 
problem.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

CRITIQUE
Answer the following questions for your own design 
and for another from the class. What typestyles 
were used in the solution to this design problem? 
Are they appropriate to the subject matter? Why? 
Consider all the characteristics of the chosen fonts. 
Ask yourself questions such as the following: Can 
the choice of point size be improved? Do you see 
any widows or orphans? How can they be avoided 
in this design? How do the type and/or image con-
tribute to establishing a mood appropriate to the 
book’s content?

LAYOUT 
DYNAMICS
KEY POINTS 
Page layout, whether in print or Web format, calls for a skillful balancing of diverse 
visual elements throughout the design (Figure 7–1). Multiple pages, and sometimes 
multiple documents, must be integrated with one another through the repetition and 
variation of visual (and related conceptual) themes. Th is chapter discusses how to use 
grid and path layouts to achieve a dynamic, unifi ed design between pages. Everything 
you have studied in previous chapters about visual gestalt is relevant here.
THE BALANCING ACT
Layout design is a balancing act in two senses. First, it relates the diverse elements on 
a printed page in a way that communicates and has aesthetic appeal. Ideally, the form 
enhances the communication, no matter what style is being used. Figure 7–2 uses type 
placement to illustrate the fear of fl ying and all it symbolizes. Every element on the 
page aff ects how the other elements are perceived. Layout is not simply the addition of 
photographs, text type, display type, or artwork. It is a carefully balanced integration of 
elements.

CHAPTER 7  Layout Dynamics
Th e layout artist must select an appropriate typeface 
from the vast array available. Th e format, size, and 
value contrast of the typographical elements should be 
closely related to accompanying photographs and illus-
trations. Layout may be the most diffi  cult balancing act 
a designer is ever called on to perform.
A good relationship between fi gure and ground is 
essential. Th e careful shaping of the white ground of 
the page gives cohesion and unity to the fi gures or 
elements placed on it. No left over space should be 
unshaped (undesigned) because open white space 
functions as an active, participating part of the whole 
design. Pages can be designed with a symmetrical lay-
out or an asymmetrical layout. Figure 7–2 uses asym-
metry on the left  page and symmetry on the right page 
to achieve its overall design. In either case, sensitivity 
to fi gure/ground grouping and white space enhances 
the readability and beauty of the page.
A careful balancing of contrast can give the page 
dynamic, unpredictable energy that will draw the read-
er’s eyes. Chapter 4 discusses contrasts in size, shape, 
value, and texture, showing how a combination of 
similarity and contrast creates a balanced and success-
ful layout. Chapter 6 discusses the use of typography 
and design elements in a single-page layout. Th is 
chapter discusses the balancing of multiple pages that 
is relevant in both print and Web design.
SIZE AND PROPORTION
Th is diffi  cult balancing act calls for sensitivity to 
proportion—the organization of several things into a 
relationship of size, quantity, or degree. Artists have 
understood the importance of size relationships for 
centuries. Th e Parthenon expressed the Greeks’ sense 
of proportion. It was based on a mathematical prin-
ciple that came to be known as the golden section. Th e 
15th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer 
used the golden section to analyze and construct his 
alphabet (Figure 7–3). Th e 20th-century architect Le 
Corbusier applied the proportions of the golden mean, 
or section, to architectural design. It is based on a rect-
angle that can be subdivided into a square. Th e square 
can be divided into two rectangles with the same pro-
portions as the original. Each resulting small rectangle 
can be subdivided to produce the same results. Figure 
7–4 shows a diagram of those proportions. Ultimately, 
however, any mathematical system is only a tool to 
aid the designer’s intuitive feeling for proportion and 
a sense of balance and energy in contrast. When the

113
Size and Proportion
contrast between elements is too great, harmony and 
balance are lost.
Th e division of a page into areas in harmony with one 
another is at the heart of all layout design. Figure 7–5 
shows how Emil Ruder, an infl uential 20th-century 
Swiss designer of the International Typographic Style, 
worked at bringing a page and its elements into har-
mony. He felt that the relationships between type sizes, 
between printed and unprinted areas, between type 
and image, and between various values of gray must all 
be harmoniously proportionate.
When we refer to size, we usually use words like big or 
small. Th ese terms are meaningless, however, unless 
we have two objects to compare. A 36-point word in a 
page with a lot of text type will seem large. On a spread 
with a 72-point headline, it will seem relatively small. 
An element large or bold in proportion to other ele-
ments on the page makes an obvious visual impact and 
a potentially strong focal point. Do not be afraid to use 
a very large element, as in Figure 7–2, where the letter 
T makes a bold graphic statement. Several magazines 
use a larger format than is standard. Th is is another 
example of size contrast. Next to other magazines on 
the news racks, they have the impact of a comparatively 
large and impressive display.
Another way of determining size is to have a standard 
expected size in mind. If we refer to a large house cat, 
“large” may mean more than 12 inches (30 cm) high. 
If we refer to a large horse, we have a diff erent size in 
mind. Deliberately violating this expectation can create 
a dynamic, unusual eff ect. Mixing standard relative

Visual Rhythm
sizes creates strong tension and compelling interest, 
as shown in the surrealist Rene Magritte’s painting in 
Figure 7–6.
Another approach to confusing our sense of size 
and scale is showing objects larger than life. On the 
printed page, viewers have come to expect things to 
be shown smaller than they really are. We have no 
problem accepting a photograph in which the Empire 
State Building appears 3” (8 cm) high, but magnify a 
relatively tiny object, and we get a visual jolt that makes 
us pay attention. Imagine a photograph of a common 
housefl y 20 times its actual size. Figure 7–7 shows a 
creative play on portfolio size by designer and educa-
tor Karen Roehr. Th is tiny portfolio, when mailed to a 
potential client, draws attention because it is so much 
smaller than expected.
VISUAL RHYTHM
Another important consideration in layout design is 
visual rhythm. Life itself is based on rhythm. Th ere is a 
rhythm to the passing days and seasons. Th e tempo of 
our days may be fast or slow. Th e growth and gradual 
decline of all natural life forms has a rhythm. Cities 
have particular pulsing rhythms. Diff erent periods in 
our history have seemed to move to various beats. Our 
current age has an eclectic/quickened tempo compared 
with a hundred years ago.
Visual rhythm is based on repetition of shapes, values, 
colors, and textures. Recurrence of shapes and the 
spacing between them set up a pattern or rhythm. 
It can be lively and lyrical or solemn and dignifi ed. 
Rhythm is crucial in many visual artists’ work, includ-
ing the London subway illustration in Figure 7–8, in 
which repeated shapes in water, woods, and sky vibrate 
with energy. Th e bird and boat reinforce each other, 
carrying our eyes in a race toward the lower right of 
the composition, while the rounded triangles of sail-
boats (in primary colors) set up a counterpoint to the 
primary rhythm.

CHAPTER 7  Layout Dynamics
7–9 Letterspacing, size, font, and placement affect tempo.
Th ere are many ways to use rhythm in typography. 
Within a single word, a rhythmic pattern of ascenders 
and descenders and curves and straights is created. 
Th e rhythm may be symmetrical or asymmetrical. 
Letter and word spacing can set up a typographical 
movement of varying tempos, as can changes in value 
and size (Figure 7–9). Th e total layout of the page is 
another opportunity to form a rhythmic pattern. Th e 
lines of type can form a rhythm of silent pauses, of 
leaps, of slow ascents and descents. An endless variety 
of rhythms can be created this way.
Th e spacing and size of photographs can intermingle 
with typography. An alternating rhythm may reserve 
every right page for a full-page photograph while the 
left  page is textured with smaller units of text and other 
elements (Figures 7–10a, b).
Another form of rhythm is progressive rhythm. Th e 
repeated element changes in a regular fashion, as in 
Figure 7–11, in which the typography beautifully 
echoes the image. Text type may be used in changing 
values from regular to bold to extra bold and back 
again. An illustration may be repeated on successive

pages, each time with more of the image displayed. 
Change in a regular manner is at the heart of a progres-
sive rhythm.
GRID LAYOUT
A sense of pacing and rhythm can be set up through-
out an entire publication with the aid of a grid. A grid 
layout is an invisible structure that underlies the page 
and functions as a guide for the placement of layout 
elements.
When and why is it appropriate to use a grid? Large 
publications usually require one to keep order. Grids 
may also be used in single-page designs, such as adver-
tisements and posters, as in Figure 7–12, created by the 
20th-century American designer Herb Lubalin. Grids 
are used to bring continuity to single pages or multiple 
pieces of a design series. A grid is most useful when it 
brings an organized unity not only to a single page but 
also to facing pages, an entire publication, or a series of 
publications.
Layout design that uses a grid is as fl exible and creative 
as its designer is. Th e grid has been accused of bringing 
a boring conformity to page design. Grids, how-
ever, can help generate distinctive, dynamic images. 
Th ey allow for experimentation with all the forms of 
contrast. A grid functions like a musical instrument. 
A piano, for instance, has a limited number of keys of 
fi xed tone and position. It is possible, however, to play 
many diff erent musical compositions through place-
ment, rhythm, and emphasis. Figure 7–13a by Herb 
Lubalin brings many diff erent elements into harmony 
by using a grid.
Keeping the Beat
A musical composition has timing or a beat that 
pulses beneath all the long and short notes. In a visual 
composition, a grid oft en keeps this beat. Just as a 
four-beats-to-the-measure musical score would not be 
cut off  at 3.5 beats, a grid layout that has four sections 
across will not end at 3.5. Whether the fourth unit is 
fi lled with an element or left  as a white ground, it gets 
its full count and full visual weight. Within these four 
musical counts may be a mixture of quarter notes, half 
notes, and whole notes. Th e four-unit grid may hold 
one large four-unit element, two half-unit elements, or 
four quarter-unit elements. Th e beauty in any com-
position, whether visual or auditory, comes once the 
structure is set up and the variations in pacing, timing, 
and emphasis begin.
Playing the Theme
An underlying musical theme, as in Beethoven’s Sixth 
Symphony (the Pastoral), appears over and over in 
diff erent guises, tying the symphony together into a 
whole. An underlying visual theme accomplishes the 
same for a visual composition. A layout for a publica-
tion unfolds through time, just as a musical concert 
does. Each page must be turned before the next is 
revealed. It cannot be seen and grasped at one viewing, 
like a painting, an advertisement, or a poster. Unify-
ing it requires a theme. Oft en this theme includes both 
a purely visual design theme and an editorial content 
theme.
Th e editorial theme could be the repetition of quotations 
on a particular topic. It could be a contrast of “then and 
now,” a set of interviews—anything that seems to tell an 
interesting story related to a common topic. Advertis-
ing campaigns are usually based on an editorial theme. 
Specialty publications such as annual reports, which 
revolve around one company, may also use an editorial 
approach. Th e artist Web sites shown on page 118 have 
a natural cohesion of theme that is enhanced by the 
consistent layout structure (Figure 7–13b).
A visual theme almost always accompanies the edito-
rial theme. It may be the repeated use of a single 
thematic photograph on several pages throughout the 
publication. It may be a particular repeated arrange-
ment of typography—or of the grid itself. Several 
images in this chapter show two-page print spreads 
that make sensitive use of an underlying structure to 
bring unity to the pages.

ornamental screens and textiles (Figure 7–14). It has 
formed the basis for quilt design, architecture, and 
navigation. Eastern cultures, Native Americans, Afri-
cans, Western designers, and a host of others have 
used it. Th e squared grid, in which each of the four 
sides of a unit is equal to the others, is the simplest 
variation, but it is capable of yielding sophisticated 
results, whether used in quilts or layout design 
(Figure 7–15).
Renaissance artists developed a method of examining a 
subject through a network of strings and then drawing 
on paper similarly divided into sections. In the 20th 
century, the grid became interesting to artists as a shape 
in itself. Frequently drawings, illustrations, and paintings 
allow the grid structure to show through, just as Bauhaus 
architects insisted that the structure of their buildings 
show through.
Today many layouts that have a strong grid structure 
trace their origins to the de Stijl movement. By 1918 
both van Doesburg and Mondrian were using dark 
lines to divide their canvases into asymmetrical pat-
terns (Figure 2–20).

Path Layout
A more recent fi gure associated with the grid layout 
is Swiss designer Josef Müller-Brockmann. He had 
tremendous infl uence on the structure and defi ni-
tion of graphic design. He stated that “Th e tauter the 
composition of elements in the space available, the more 
eff ectively can the thematic idea be formulated.” Copy, 
photographs, drawings, and trade names are all subser-
vient to the underlying grid structure in this modernist 
approach, which continues to have a strong infl uence 
on contemporary design (Figure 4–3).
Grid design is incorporated into our current technol-
ogy. Dedicated page layout programs like InDesign 
and Illustrator do an excellent job of accommodating a 
grid-based layout. Th ey allow the designer to construct 
a grid or use a prepackaged one and specify type to fi ll 
the columns.
Choosing a Grid
Grids diff er from one another as much as the minds 
that create them. Th ey vary from the familiar three-
column format to overlapping squares to a variety of 
contemporary creations.
Th e fi rst consideration when choosing a grid is the 
elements it will contain. Consider the copy. How long 
is it, how long are the individual segments, and how 
many inserts and subheads does it contain? If the copy 
is composed of many independent paragraphs, the 
underlying grid should break the page area up into 
small units. If the copy is a textbook of long unbroken 
chapters with few visuals, however, a complex grid is 
wasted; most of its divisions will seldom be used.
Now consider the art. A publication that uses many 
photographs and illustrations will call for a grid dif-
ferent from that of a publication that is copy heavy. 
Whenever many elements need to be incorporated into 
a layout, a more complex grid, broken down into many 
small units, is the most useful. It will give more pos-
sibilities for placing and sizing images.
You can create your own grid that corresponds to the 
number of elements and the size of your page. Th e 
tinier the grid units, the more choices you will need to 
make about placement. Th e more placement options 
there are, the greater the chance that the underlying 
unity will be lost. In other words, sometimes a simple 
grid is the best choice.
Both the vertical and the horizontal divisions in a grid 
are important. Th e vertical dividers determine the line 
length of the copy. Both the vertical and horizontal lines 
determine the size of photographs or artwork. Remem-
ber to relate line length and type size to make it easy 
for the eye to read and keep its place. Forcing large type 
into small grid units makes for slow, diffi  cult reading.
Constructing the Grid
Th e vertical divisions of the grid are usually expressed 
in picas or in inches, as is the line length of copy mea-
sured for typesetting. Th e horizontal divisions are most 
frequently measured in points, as is leading. A 10-point 
type, for example, with 2 points of leading between 
lines would be set on 12-point leading. Th is type could 
be specifi ed at a 21-pica or 31⁄2-inch line length. Th e 
column width would correspond. Th e structure is usu-
ally sounder if the elements themselves align with the 
grid edges and only suggest the presence of the grid. 
With precise alignment, our eyes will draw an invis-
ible line of continuation between elements that forms 
a much stronger bond than a physical inked line, as 
shown in Figure 7–16.
Grid structure and the path layout discussed next are 
both used to bring balance and harmony to page design. 
Both depend on the eye and mind detecting such unit-
forming factors as repetition and continuation, tem-
pered with a deliberate contrast or variation for eff ect.
PATH LAYOUT
Th e path layout assumes no underlying, unifying grid 
structure. Rather, the designer begins with a blank 
sheet of paper and attempts to visualize the elements 
on it in various arrangements. Th is complex approach 
can yield tremendously varied results. Th e unity comes 
from a direct reliance on unit-forming factors. Th is 
reliance is sometimes unconscious, but beginning 
designers should learn and practice it on a conscious 
level. It can lead to excellent results.
7–16 The invisible line of continuation between elements 
on a grid helps create a uniﬁ ed composition.

122
CHAPTER 7  Layout Dynamics
Th e word path describes this less structured, more 
spontaneous approach because the designer is attempt-
ing to set up a path for the eye. Th e goal is to guide the 
eye skillfully through the various elements. To do so, 
there must usually be a clear entry point, or focal point, 
and a clear path to the next element and the next. A 
simple symmetrical and centered path layout is used 
eff ectively in Figure 7–1.
Focal Point
Th e focal point, or the point of entry into a design, is 
the fi rst area that attracts attention and encourages the 
viewer to look further. If at fi rst glance, our eyes are 
drawn equally to several diff erent areas, visual chaos 
results and interest is lost. Focal points can be set up in 
many diff erent ways, but they all have to do with creat-
ing diff erence or variety. Whatever disrupts an overall 
visual fi eld will draw the eye. Th e focal point should 
not be so overwhelming that the eye misses the rest of 
the composition.
Th ese diff erences could become the focal point:
  A heavy black value set down in a fi eld of gray and 
white.
  A small isolated element set next to several larger 
elements near one another.
  An irregular, organically shaped element set next to 
geometric ones.
  A textured element set next to solid areas. Text type 
can oft en function in this manner.
  An image or word that is emotionally loaded.
PHOTOGRAPHY IN A LAYOUT
An important element in layout design is the photo-
graph. An art director or designer must learn what 
makes a good photograph and how to use it to best 
advantage. Copywriters, photographers, and designers 
depend on one another’s skills. Poor page design can 
make a beautiful photograph lose all its impact and 
appeal. Conversely, a poor photograph can be strength-
ened by a good design.
Dynamic photos, strong in design and human inter-
est, can be made to look lifeless with certain design 
mistakes. One problem can be the paper choice. If it is 
too absorbent for the reproduction method, it will ink 
poorly, so the value contrast in the reproduced photos 
will be muddy. Another common mistake is lack of 
size contrast. When photos of similar sizes compete 
for attention, the eye will be drawn to none. Other 
elements on the page may also point away or detract 
from the photographic image.
Figure 7–17 by Emil Ruder shows diff erent ways of 
placing a photograph on a grid layout. Practice some 
variations yourself, attempting to establish a visual 
pacing. A similar grid and photographs for placement 
can be found on this text’s accompanying Web site. You 
can practice cropping and resizing these photographs 
in Photoshop. 
 
Cropping
Sometimes photographs can be improved by the 
designer’s careful cropping. Cropping is eliminating 
part of the vertical or horizontal dimension of

a photograph to focus attention on the remaining por-
tion. Cropping is also used to fi t a photograph into an 
available space by altering its proportions. When crop-
ping to fi t a space, use discretion, because cropping can 
destroy the mood and design of the image.
Sometimes a photograph, like an overwritten para-
graph, can be improved by deleting excess information. 
Th e format is fi xed in a camera, but the action being 
photographed may be taking place within a compact 
square area or a long, thin vertical. Trimming away the 
meaningless part of the image on the sides will improve 
the impact. It can also enhance a feeling of rhythm, as 
shown in Figure 7-18.
Cropping a photograph can make it dramatic. If you 
wish to emphasize the height of a tall building, for 
example, cropping the sides to make a long, thin rect-
angle will increase the sense of height. Cropping the 
top and bottom of a long horizontal shot will increase 
the sense of an endless horizon.
Cropping causes us to focus on the dramatic part of the 
image in Figure 7–18, a poster for the Cincinnati Ballet 
Company. Th e feet present a theme of repetition and 
variation and set up a wonderful visual rhythm.
Resizing
All the traditional resizing methods are becoming less 
important, as designers usually resize, crop, and experi-
ment with the results on the computer. Th e important 
thing to understand is the concept of ratio. You must 
maintain the integrity of the photograph, without 
expanding or distorting the image to fi t a space. Always 
maintain the original (or cropped) height-to-width 
ratio when rescaling a photograph. Th e soft ware can 
help with that if you check the retain-proportion box 
or hold down the shift  key when resizing.
Selecting
A designer may receive the photographs to work with 
or have the opportunity to order specifi c photos shot. 

124
CHAPTER 7  Layout Dynamics
You may also elect to shoot them personally. It is a wise 
idea for anyone considering a career in graphic design 
to take a course in photography.
Choose photographs for your layout on three consider-
ations: the quality of the print or digital fi le, the merit 
of the design, and the strength of the communication.
Photo retouching programs make it easier to correct 
problems with print quality. It is helpful to understand 
what good reproduction qualities in a photograph are 
in order to recognize and retain them. Watch for good 
contrast between darks and lights, a full tonal range, 
sharp focus (where appropriate), and lack of scratches, 
dust spots, and other imperfections. Th e Digital Focus 
box above discusses the relationship between digital 
resolution and resizing.
Multipanel Design
Folders and brochures present a layout problem slightly 
diff erent from that of magazines, newspapers, and 
DIGITAL FOCUS
Resizing
When resizing a digital image it is important to pay 
attention to the resolution. Resolution refers to 
the ﬁ neness or sharpness of an image, based on 
the number of pixels per inch (ppi). Plan on 72 ppi 
for screen images and 300 dots per inch (dpi) for 
most print applications. When an image is resized, 
the resolution changes. As the image gets larger, 
the resolution decreases, because the same num-
ber of pixels are covering a larger area. To ﬁ ll the 
space, the pixels get larger and coarser.
If you need to change the resolution or size of your 
digital image, open it in Photoshop and select 
Image . Image Size. Look at the resolution and 
document size. Check the constrain-proportions 
box to keep the horizontal and vertical dimensions 
proportionally true. Uncheck the resample-image 
box to make the resolution increase and decrease 
with changes in the ﬁ le’s physical size, as shown 
in Figure 7–19. Checking the box will let you 
maintain a resolution while changing the physical 
size, and vice versa. If you enlarge the image size 
signiﬁ cantly, however, it will not stay a clear image, 
because the increased pixels are interpolated, 
or generated by the program, and do not reﬂ ect 
actual data. Locking in a resolution while reducing 
size will produce crisp results.

books. A brochure is actually more a three-dimensional 
construction than a two-dimensional layout. Contrast-
ing size and visual rhythm to achieve harmonious 
proportions remains important.
Th e additional element of the fold complicates matters. 
Brochures may fold and unfold into unusual shapes 
(Figure 7–20). Th ey may unfold several times and at 
each successive unfolding present a new facet of the 
design. Use this opportunity to tell a story. Each panel 
can give additional information, with the front panel 
acting as a teaser. Never give your punch line on the 
front panel. Lead up to it. A successful front panel will 
lure the reader inside. Th e succeeding panels will build 
interest and develop a theme. Th e panels in Figure 
7–21 gradually unfold to reveal the message “Imagine.” 
If the brochure is a self-mailer, the address and stamp 
are placed directly on the back.
Other special decisions go into a multipanel design: 
the size of the piece, the number of folds and their

direction, and the fl exibility of the paper. Usually, when 
preparing a comprehensive, the designer will try to use 
a paper similar to the one on which the brochure will 
fi nally be printed. Th en the client can hold and unfold 
the design. 
Th e brochure or fl yer will oft en be part of a unifi ed 
publication series. Th en you must sustain the visual 
and intellectual theme of the entire series.
Layout Styles
During the discussion of design history presented in 
Chapter 2, you learned that the European-infl uenced 
modern style was exported to the United States during 
the 1940s. Characterized by sans serif typography and 
the belief in a universally shared aesthetic, the mod-
ern style saw order as the spirit of a modern, rational, 
technological civilization. Th e development of the 
grid system seen in the work of Swiss designers Josef 
Müller-Brockmann, Emil Ruder, and others fi t into 
this perception of design as a wedding of science and 
aesthetics in a rational world.
Design in the 1960s became more eclectic and 
inclusive. Th e 1970s saw a questioning of the rational 
Swiss Design approach that led to the development 
of New Wave or postmodern graphic design. Th e 
designs of the International Typographic Style and 
modernism were seen as too reductive. A new interest 
in complex, layered forms and meaning developed. 
April Greiman’s work shows the exuberance of this 
inclusive, eclectic style, which celebrates complexity 
and diversity while Greiman’s work retains a strong 
sense of underlying structure (see Figure 7–22). As 
postmodernism has grown, art and design history 
has become a great visual resource for inspiration, a 
resource in which all styles are potentially meaning-
ful. Art nouveau, art deco, pop art, Swiss modernism, 
and personal intuition may all be combined to gener-
ate the postmodern design.

Conclusion
computer technology aft er the fall of the Berlin Wall 
in 1989. Much of their work is created for German 
cultural institutions. Graphics are now generated and 
prepared for prepress with soft ware that encourages 
complexity and refl ects our society’s complex struc-
ture and informational mix. Electronic mail, facsimile 
transmissions, and low-volume desktop publishing 
decentralize information processing. Th e Internet is a 
great experiment in democracy, because information 
can be disseminated and accessed on personal comput-
ers beyond anything previously possible.
CONCLUSION
Layout is a balancing act that creates unity among the 
diverse elements on a page. An underlying grid can 
unite the many pages of a large publication. When 
GALLERY PROFILE
April Greiman (b.1948)
April Greiman (b. 1948) created her ﬁ rst electronic 
designs on the Macintosh in 1984. She experi-
mented with overlapping images and graphical 
elements, bitmapped fonts, and digital collage 
in spatial relationship, combining her respect 
for modernism and Swiss graphics (see Chapter 
2) with new possibilities made conceivable by 
computer technology. In 2002, she formed a new 
design consultancy in Los Angeles called April 
Greiman Made in Space.
Her designs span print graphics, Web and 
motion, and architectural applications. The work 
demonstrates her philosophy that the pixel is the 
“DNA,” the “architecture” of the computer. She 
is fascinated with revealing the structure of that 
architecture, when appropriate, by making refer-
ence to it in her design projects.
Born in metropolitan New York, Greiman studied 
graphic design at the Kansas City Art Institute 
and also in Basel, Switzerland. In 1976 she 
moved to Los Angeles and in a few years became 
the director of the Visual Communications Pro-
gram at the California Institute of the Arts. There 
she began to work with computer graphics and 
video, combining her interest in Swiss graphics 
with the multilayering made possible with com-
puters and digital data. Her work in print, Web, 
and architectural elements has made her one 
of the most inﬂ uential ﬁ gures in contemporary 
design.
Katherine McCoy is another important fi gure in 
education and postmodern design who articulates and 
defi nes the nature of the multiple layers of communica-
tion possible in the contemporary visual design (Figure 
2-28). She writes about design criticism and consults 
in graphic design, marketing, and interior design for 
cultural, educational, and corporate clients. McCoy’s 
Web site at www.highgrounddesign.com contains an 
excellent discussion of contemporary issues.
Technological innovations contribute greatly to the 
changing face of design. Th e IBM PC and Apple 
Macintosh dominated the widespread use of comput-
ers in design that began in the 1980s. Th e computer 
brought a great deal of fl exibility and made easy shift s 
of type size, shape, and style accessible to designers.

turing of typography by a contemporary design group

CHAPTER 7  Layout Dynamics
combining copy, illustration, and photography, unity 
can also be established by fi nding similar shapes, angles, 
values, and typestyles. Like a musical composition, a 
layout needs pacing, rhythm, and theme. Th is problem-
solving approach stems from an understanding of visual 
language developed by 20th-century modernism.
Variety or contrast is important too. Many kinds of 
contrast—in visual texture, value, shape, typestyle, 
and size—can create a focal point or visual path in a 
layout. A combination of contrasting historical styles 
is currently used to provide a rich, visually complex 
design. Multiple layers of communication created 
with this approach are a feature of postmodern style. 
Whatever the historical style, it is more than merely 
an aff ectation. Movements in art and design refl ect the 
structure and values of society and help disseminate 
those values. Both modernism and postmodernism 
have been informed and enriched by an understanding 
of how visual information is processed and meaning 
is derived. Th is understanding is fundamental to all 
forms of graphic design.
Finally, whatever the style, your layout should strive to 
do justice to the intentions of the copywriter, the pho-
tographer, the illustrator, the client, and yourself.

EXERCISES
1.  Use the sample grids shown in Figures 7–24a–b  
to design several rhythmic layouts. If you choose 
to use collage or pasteup, use old magazines 
and cut out photographs, cropping where 
necessary and adding some version of comped 
type blocks. If you use a computer, refer to the 
accompanying Web site to access photos and 
sample layout grids also on the accompanying 
Web site. 
2.  Select several magazines or annual reports and 
ﬁ gure out their grid structure. Can you ﬁ nd one 
with an interesting complexity and nuance? Look 
for stylistic inﬂ uences. Bring one publication in for 
class discussion of strengths and weaknesses.
3.  Save samples of brochure designs that appeal to 
you and study them for future inspiration. Look 
for interesting multipanel samples that unfold the 
message in sequential steps. Plan to keep a ﬁ le 
of such samples throughout your career. Share 
what you’ve found with others in the class.
PROJECT
Two-Page Layout
In consultation with your instructor, choose a short 
story, myth, or fable. Select a visual and concep-
tual theme appropriate to your story. Incorporate 
original imagery and create a two-page layout 
with a grid structure. After doing several roughs 
by experimenting with at least two different grids, 
choose the most successful. Prepare a ﬁ nal pol-
ished version using any method you prefer. Figure 
7–25 uses shaped type and an original illustration 
to create a visual path layout with a good ﬁ gure/
ground relationship. “Nymph” (Figure 7–26) is a 
well-integrated grid layout with an excellent air-
brush illustration that makes a strong use of ﬁ gure/
7–24a, b An underlying grid 
of squares (shown in a) can be 
applied to a cover design (shown

THE DYNAMICS 
OF COLOR
KEY POINTS 
Color for the designer and color for the fi ne artist are similar at the creative stage, 
because a fundamental knowledge of color theory is vital to both designer and fi ne 
artist. Also, in preparing art on the computer for the Web, for multimedia, or for the 
printing process, the designer needs to be familiar with how color is infl uenced by 
its intended publication venue. A great deal of new terminology and concepts will be 
introduced, but fi rst we’ll brush up on color as a creative, pigment-based, and artistic 
communication (Figure 8–1). Th en we will consider color from the computer and 
printing perspectives.
DESIGNING WITH COLOR
Every student who has completed an elementary course in art has heard that color is 
a property of light. Many people do not fully understand those words, however, until 
years aft er their art degree is completed. A young painter several years past her BFA tells 
a story of looking around her living room for a composition to paint. “I considered the 
objects in the room and the space they occupied; 
the corners of the ceiling and the negative spaces 
in the staircase. I looked at the carpet and saw 
the standard ‘landlord green.’ And then I looked 
at the carpet again and realized that my mind 
was processing ‘landlord green,’ but my eyes were 
actually looking at black geometric shapes swim-
ming beside a shining pastel/fl uorescent color 
of fresh spring leaves. Th e sun was shining in the 
window of my dark living room and transform-
ing my carpet. Color is a property of light, 
I thought. Oh!”
Color has been accurately described as both “the 
way an object absorbs or refl ects light” and “the 
kind of light that strikes an object” (Figure 8–2). 
Th e artist’s carpet would have appeared to have 
a diff erent color had it had a deep shag texture 
or a slick, shiny surface. It would have appeared

CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
a diff erent color under an incandescent or fl uorescent 
light, bright natural sunlight, or light overcast by cloud 
cover. Even the angle from which it was viewed would 
have had an eff ect.
Isaac Newton fi rst passed a beam of white light 
through a prism and saw it divide into several colors. 
Th e colors of the light-wave spectrum are red, orange, 
yellow, green, blue, and indigo (Figure 8–3). In phys-
ics, mixing the colors of the light wave together pro-
duces pure white light. It is such light waves, bouncing 
off  or being absorbed by the objects around us, that 
give the objects color.
Th e three primary colors in white light are red, green, 
and blue (RGB). Th ey are called additive primary colors 
because together they can produce white light. Th e 
eye contains three diff erent types of color receptors, 
each sensitive to one of the primary colors of the light 
spectrum. Th is seems to suggest an active connection 
between our physiological makeup and the world in 
which we live. A powerful concept.
Th e artist and designer should understand that color 
depends on light. Color is not an unchanging, absolute 
property of the object. It is dynamic and aff ected by 
its environment. We’ll learn more later about RGB 
as it applies to computer monitors, photography, 
and the Web.
Why wait until Chapter 8 to study color? Because it is 
so powerful, it can overwhelm choices about shape, 
fi gure ground, eye direction, and more. If you have 
chosen to begin working with color earlier in the 
course, remember to integrate all the other design 
considerations and not let color become a crutch for 
an otherwise weak solution.
The Color Wheel
For the artist and print designer, mixing pigments will 
never produce white. Black is the sum of all pigment 
colors. Several color wheels have been developed to 
help us understand the eff ects of combining pigments.
Th e traditional pigment-based color wheel, developed 
by Herbert Ives, begins with the subtractive primary 
colors red, yellow, and blue. Mixing these hues pro-
duces secondary colors. Mixing the secondary colored 
pigments with the primaries produces a tertiary color. 
Th e term subtractive means that a pigment absorbs, or 
“subtracts,” a segment of white light in order to refl ect 
back its particular hue. Th e visual eff ect produced by 
combining such pigments is actually the sum of their 
subtractions. For the artist and print designer, that can 
mean a less brilliant result than is produced by a single 
pigment.
Th e Munsell color wheel is based on fi ve key hues: red, 
yellow, blue, green, and purple. Mixing these primaries 
forms secondaries. Although these two classifi cation 
systems diff er, the basic look of the resulting colors 
is similar. Th e color wheel is only a workable system, 
not an absolute. Figures 8–4a, b show the Ives and the 
Munsell color wheels. Th e cyan, magenta, yellow, and 
black (CMYK) process colors used in off set printing 
are also a pigment-based subtractive gamut that we’ll 
discuss later in this chapter.
8–3 Light waves of many colors join to make white light.

133
Designing with Color
Properties of Color
Every color has three properties: hue, value, and inten-
sity. Hue is the name by which we identify a color. Th e 
color wheel is set up according to hue.
Value is the degree of lightness or darkness in a hue. 
It is easiest to understand value when looking at a 
black-and-white image. Th e darkest value will be 
close to black, and the lightest close to white, with 
a range of grays in between. Value also plays an 
important role in all color images. Every hue has its 
own value range (Figure 8–5). Yellow, for example, 
is normally lighter than purple. Its normal value in 
the middle of a yellow value scale will be lighter than 
purple. In a value scale, the color values lighter than 
normal value are called tints; those darker than normal

CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
value are called shades. When working with pigments, 
the addition of white lightens a value, whereas the 
addition of black darkens it. Figure 8–6 shows a design 
created using a variety of values of green.
Th e third property of color is intensity, or saturation. It is 
a measure of a color’s purity and brightness. In pigments 
there are two ways of reducing the intensity of a color: 
Mix it with a gray of the same value, or mix it with its 
complement (the color opposite on the color wheel). 
Low-intensity colors have been toned down and are 
oft en referred to as tones. Colors not grayed are at their 
most vivid at full intensity, as shown in the array of high- 
and low-saturation colors in Figure 8–7. Figure 8–8 
shows high-intensity colors applied to children’s toys.
Color Schemes
Color combinations are grouped into categories called 
color schemes. Colors opposite one another on the color 
wheel are called complements. Art that combines these 
colors is said to be using a complementary color scheme. 
Complements heighten and accent one another and 
are oft en used to produce a bold, exciting eff ect. A split 
complementary scheme includes one hue and the hue 
8–6 Different values of a single or similar hue can create a 
highly varied effect.
8–7 These two complementary hues are used at varying 
intensities.

(on the color wheel) on either side of its direct comple-
ment. Colors next to one another on the color wheel are 
called analogous. An analogous color scheme is generally 
considered soothing and restful. A monochromatic color 
scheme is composed of one hue in several values. Th ese 
color schemes are shown in Figure 8–9.
In color there are no real absolutes. Th at is why this 
information is oft en called color theory. It is unusual, 
but quite possible, to produce a tense, dramatic eff ect 
using analogous colors or a soothing, harmonious 
eff ect using complementary colors. Remember, these 
principles are not rules but useful guidelines. An artist 
or a designer may choose to violate them for eff ect. 
Figure 8–10 shows a dramatic use of an analogous 
color scheme made dynamic by the use of strong value 
contrast and shapes.
THE RELATIVITY OF COLOR
Our perception of color is infl uenced by many con-
siderations. For example, the way each color looks 
to us is strongly aff ected by what surrounds it. Th is 
phenomenon is known as simultaneous contrast. We 
automatically compare colors that sit side by side.

CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
When complements (such as red and green) are placed 
side by side, they seem to become more intense. Th ey 
complement one another. A gray placed beside a color 
appears to have a tinge of that color’s complement in it 
because our eye automatically searches for it. Th erefore 
a neutral gray beside a red will appear to be a greenish 
gray; the same neutral gray beside a green will appear 
to have a reddish cast.
Simultaneous contrast also aff ects value. A gray 
placed against a black ground will appear to have a 
lighter value than the same gray placed against a white 
ground. Th e same hue will look very diff erent on vari-
ous background colors. Figure 8–11 shows many of 
these eff ects.
One designer fi rst experienced this eff ect when she was 
a child visiting her aunt for dinner. Butter in her own 
home was a yellow stick brought home from the store. 
On the aunt’s farm it came straight from the cows, aft er 
a little churning. Th is fresh butter did not have yellow 
food coloring added to it. When her aunt placed it on 
the table on a yellow plate, the niece would not eat it. 
It looked white and could not be the real thing. Who 
would eat white butter? Th e aunt, however, knew about 
simultaneous contrast, although not by that name. 
She whisked the butter plate away and returned with 
the same butter, this time on a white plate. Th e young 
girl was delighted with the “new” butter. Th is time, 
compared with the white plate it sat on, the fresh butter 
looked yellow.
Simultaneous contrast means that color is relative to 
the colors surrounding it. Th is fact was fi rst discovered 
in the 19th century when a French chemist named 
Michel-Eugène Chevreul, also a merchant who dyed 
fabric, was disturbed by apparent inconsistencies in 
his bolts of cloth. He discovered that his dye remained 
consistent, but the viewing conditions did not. Bolts of 
the same color appeared to be diff erent colors, depend-
ing on the color of the fi ber samples around them. He 
went on to research and document color properties. In 
the 20th century, Josef Albers made a further intensive 
study of color. Albers experimented with simultaneous 
contrast and contributed greatly to our understanding

The Psychology of Color
Red and yellow and their variations are referred to as 
warm colors, perhaps because we associate them with 
fi re and the sun. Blue and green are considered cool 
colors. Th ey also happen to be the colors of sky, water, 
and forests. Th e diff erence in the wavelengths of these 
colors may also account for our reactions to them.
Associations
Personal memories play a part in color perception as 
well. If your mother usually wore a particular shade of 
blue, and you loved your mother (and she loved you), 
that shade of blue has good associations for you. It 
seems a warm, friendly color, although to other eyes it 
may look cool.
Along with personal associations, we have cultural 
associations with color. Th ey oft en appear in the 
English language in the United States as “black anger,” 
“yellow-bellied coward,” “feeling blue,” and “seeing red.” 
On her wedding day, a bride in Western culture wears 
white, the color of purity. Black is a funeral color and 
the color of mourning. Th ese are not absolute associa-
tions; they change from culture to culture. For example, 
people in India wear white to a funeral. For a wedding, 
they favor yellow. Th ese cultural diff erences continue to 
blend together and change with our increasing sense of 
a global community.
We can describe our culture’s general color associa-
tions. It is by no means a description to be memorized 
and taken as gospel. Color psychology is complex, 
aff ected by many considerations, but if you can com-
bine this information with a light hand and a sensitive 
eye, it may prove useful.
RED 
Red is a dramatic, highly visible hue. It is associated 
with sexuality and aggression, with passion and vio-
lence. It is also an offi  cial hue found in most national 
colors. Red is oft en the favored color of a sports car 
or a sports team. A dignifi ed, conservative executive, 
however, is unlikely to choose red for a primary car or 
a corporate logo unless its intensity is toned down or 
its value darkened toward black.
BLUE 
In its darker values, blue is associated with author-
ity. Our executive may favor a navy blue car, suit, and 
logo. A middle-value blue is generally associated with 
cleanliness and honesty and has a cooling, soothing 
eff ect. It is used as a background color in package 
design because of its quiet, positive associations. Even 
at full intensity, blue retains a calm quality, as seen in 
GALLERY PROFILE
Josef Albers (1888–1976)
Josef Albers (1888–1976) was born in Germany 
and taught at the Bauhaus from 1923 to 1933, 
when he left for America. While at the Bauhaus, 
Albers ran part of the preliminary course and 
taught a 3-D workshop “materials class.” The au-
tonomy of the student was important in this work-
shop, which emphasized discovery and invention. 
In the United States, he taught at Black Mountain 
College and Yale University.
Albers married Anni Albers (1899–1994), a 
German-born ﬁ ber artist, who was a student at 
the Bauhaus. In 1933 both were asked to teach at 
Black Mountain College, an innovative school in 
North Carolina. Josef Albers taught there for the 
next 16 years, and it was at Black Mountain that 
he began his color studies. Anni taught weaving 
there and created her own signiﬁ cant body of 
work. From 1950 to 1958 Albers served as head 
of the design department at Yale University.
Albers began his Homage to the Square series in 
1949 and worked on it for the next 25 years. Fig-
ure 8–12 shows a painting that is the result of this 
series. He carefully recorded the technical details 
of each piece, fascinated with the optical effects 
created through color contrasts. The entire series 
has only one shape, a square. In the series it is 
placed in various locations, at varying sizes, with 
a concentration on what happens as color chang-
es are introduced. As a painter, a theoretician, 
and a teacher, Albers was an important inﬂ uence 
on generations of young artists and designers.
of that eff ect. Figure 8–12 by Albers shows his devo-
tion to investigating the eff ects of color and shape.
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOR
Relativity also holds true in the psychology of color. 
Colors have the power to evoke specifi c emotional 
responses in the viewer—some personal and some 
more universal. In general, for example, warm colors 
stimulate people, whereas cool colors relax them. Inte-
rior designers pay close attention to this relationship 
when they consider the color schemes for locations 
such as a bedroom, a dentist’s waiting room, or the 
newsroom of a daily paper. Imagine sitting in a dentist’s 
chair, staring at a bright red wall.

using a variety of tints and full intensity hues for a soft  
but vibrant eff ect.
YELLOW 
Yellow is oft en used in food packaging because it is 
associated with warmth, good health, and optimism. 
Th ere still are reminders in the English language that 
yellow also has been associated with cowardliness and 
weakness. Th at does not appear to be the case cur-
rently, however. Even cultural associations are subject 
to change.
GREEN 
Green is associated with the environment, cleanliness, 
and naturalness. Soothing and cooling, it is conse-
quently a favored color among manufacturers of such 
products as menthol cigarettes and noncola beverages. 
Th ese products benefi t from a visual association with a 
healthy environment.
Selecting Color
When choosing a color, consider the psychology of the 
audience. A game or toy intended to appeal to children 
should have colors diff erent from one intended to 
reach adults considering retirement plans. Our color 
preferences change as we grow older. In general, youth 
prefers a more intense color that signals urgency and 
excitement. Th e subtle color preferences of age are 
more oft en associated with restraint and dignity. Color 
trends also change regularly in areas such as fashion 
and home décor.
The institution you are designing for should also 
affect the selection of color. Banks tend to prefer 
the darker values and the blues and grays associ-
ated with authority and stability. A physical fitness 
club would probably want more vibrant and intense 
colors. A restaurant may choose complementary 
colors that are toned down to an attractive and 
intimate level.
Personal color preference is not the only, or even the 
primary, consideration for a designer. Choice of color 
should refl ect fi ve psychological factors:
1. Cultural associations with color
2.  Th e profi le of the audience and its color 
preferences
3.  Th e character and personality of the organization 
represented
4.  Th e designer’s personal relationship with color
5. An awareness of current color trends
VISUAL PERCEPTION
Whenever we create or view an image, we bring a load 
of personal experiences and cultural background that 
help us make sense of that image. We structure the 
image as we create it on the screen or on paper. We 
also structure it in our brain and eye in the process of 
viewing it. Th e image depends on the artist and the 
viewer.
Realism in art and design is not an absolute. It is an 
interaction between the artwork and the mind and 
eye of the viewer, as we can see in Georges Seurat’s 
8–13a American Players Theatre publication cover created 
by the Planet Propaganda design ﬁ rm. A highly saturated 
blue gives this design a dynamic impact.

Understanding Electronic Color
A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884 (Figure 8–14), 
where abstract color dots appear as people in a park. 
Seurat painted series of dots, but the result is that we 
see a summer day. An artist and designer works not 
simply with the elements of line, shape, and color. 
Basic principles of design and visual perception are a 
vital part of this interaction. Th e principle of similar-
ity grouping occurs when we recognize similarities in 
shape, size, color, texture, and so on. Th is similarity 
helps visually bind a composition together, as in the 
texture of Seurat’s dots.
In the process of recognizing similarity, the eye and 
brain also identify elements that are diff erent. Again, 
in Seurat’s painting, the color makes an important 
diff erence that allows us to “read” the painting. A 
dynamic interplay of similarity and diff erence makes 
for an active, successful design.
UNDERSTANDING ELECTRONIC COLOR
Color on a computer monitor is created in a man-
ner much like a pointillist painting by Georges Seurat 
(Figure 8–14). In the painting, our eyes optically blend 
individual paint spots to create an illusion of soft ly 
blended colors. Computer images are composed of 
individual dots called pixels. Th e pixel is a rectangle of 
light on the computer screen that can be set to diff erent 
colors. Th e more pixels, the better the resolution and 
clarity of the image. Th e resolution is determined by 
the hardware (Figure 8–15).
When designers work with a 24-bit system, each pixel 
is represented by 24 bits of color information: 8 for red, 
8 for green, and 8 for blue. Th ere are 256 possible val-
ues for each of these three colors. Th ese diff ering values 
of red, green, and blue can be combined to produce 
more than 16.7 million colors.
Color Models
Designers study color theory in order to use it eff ec-
tively. Color theory remains the same whether it is 
applied to a traditional design or an electronic one. But 
when using electronic color, it can be helpful to study 
its practical diff erences. Figure 8–16 shows some of the

CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
8–17 Red, green, and blue are the primary colors in the 
additive system. Red, green, and blue together produce 
white. In this light-based system, cyan, magenta, and yel-
low are secondary colors.
8–18 In four-color offset printing, cyan, magenta, and 
yellow are the primary colors, and their overlapping pro-
duces the look of full color. Although the overlap of cyan, 
magenta, and yellow produces a black effect, black ink is 
added for density.
many ways to view and create color wheels and value 
studies on screen. We must understand the various 
ways color is created in order to see the fi nal design 
printed and looking the way we intended. Th e previous 
section of this chapter discussed creating color using 
pigment-based subtractive primaries. You need to be 
familiar with three diff erent color models when using 
computer graphics.
RGB 
Unlike a pointillist painting, an image on the computer 
monitor is displayed in the additive primaries RGB 
(red, green, blue). It is a backlit image made by adding 
light. An image on the monitor may display colors in 
RGB that cannot be duplicated in the refl ective copy 
of CMYK printing. Be prepared if the image on a 
printout does not match the image on the computer 
screen. Th e images are displayed in diff erent color 
gamuts, or models (discussed shortly). Calibrating 
the monitor will help. Onscreen design is produced 
and viewed in RGB and is discussed further in a later 
chapter. Figure 8–17 shows how RGB overlaps to 
form the CMY process color gamut. K stands for the 
black ink that is added for density.
CMYK

mixing and blending paint or colored pencils. When

saturation, and lightness (value). Adobe Product screenshot

Understanding Electronic Color
the monitor’s colors are transferred to paper or the 
fi le is ripped for off set reproduction, it is printed in 
the subtractive model of CMYK. Th e CMYK model is 
the basis for four-color process printing composed of 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks. Remember, the 
K stands for black, which is added to give density to 
the fi nal print. For additional information on CMYK, 
see “Process Color Separations” later in this chapter. 
Figure 8–18 shows the overlapping CMY of transpar-
ent printing inks producing a variety of colors.
HSL
Hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) are terms familiar 
to us from the world of color theory and a discus-
sion of the properties of color. Photoshop allows the 
user to manipulate colors using this model and other 
models by moving pop-up menu sliders. Th e inten-
sity of a color diminishes when its saturation slider is 
moved (Figure 8–19a). Th e lightness control varies a 
color from white to black (this corresponds to value in 
pigment-based color models). Th is can be a satisfy-
ing color model to use, because it is the most intuitive 
and closest to the way mixed pigment color is used 
in painting and drawing. You can switch to CMYK to 
prepare the prepress fi le.
Another Color Wheel
Th e RGB/CMY color model positions the two sets of 
primaries equidistant from one another. Each second-
ary color is between two primary colors; each color on 
the wheel is between two colors that are used to create 
it; and each color is directly opposite its complement. 
Th is is a helpful model to study in order to understand 
what is happening on the computer monitor.
Red and blue make magenta. In order to decrease 
magenta in an image, the red and blue must be 
decreased. Whatever is done to a color, it has the oppo-
site eff ect on that color’s complement. In other words, 
decreasing red will increase cyan (Figure 8–19b).
Various computer programs that allow designers to 
do color correction have pop-up menus allowing 
this kind of manipulation. Photoshop is an eff ec-
tive color correction soft ware in common usage by 
designers, although there are other dedicated color 
management programs. Its sliders allow the user to 
manipulate color quickly and see the resulting eff ects. 
It also allows the user to work from numbered per-
centages in order to specify colors that will match a 
CMYK print. And, fi nally, it allows the user to switch 
between color models, specifying that an image be 
created in RGB, CMYK, spot color, black-and-white, 
or duotone modes.
Color Gamuts
Th e visible color range of a color model is called a 
gamut. As Figure 8–20 shows, the eye can see more 
colors than can be created in either the RGB or CMYK 
color models. Th e gamut of RGB, however, is larger 
than that of CMYK. Th is means that if a design is cre-
ated with the RGB mode, some of its colors probably 
cannot be printed using CMYK process colors. Pho-
toshop will show an alert symbol (a triangle with an 
exclamation mark inside it) in the picker palette if your

sents colors that can be printed on coated paper.

CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
color is not printable. Th is allows you to substitute a 
printable color before sending the fi le for reproduction.
COLOR IN PRINTING
In addition to applying the psychology of color theory to 
design work, you must stay within restrictions imposed 
by the technology of mass reproduction. Designs must 
be created within the limitation of the budget, equip-
ment, expertise, and time available for a particular proj-
ect. Th e designer’s use of color must be not only creative 
and appropriate but also practical and printable.
Tint Screens
In mixed pigments, adding a diff erent pigment-based 
hue creates color changes. White is altered to gray by 
the addition of black; red is altered to a light pink by 
the addition of white; and mixing blue and yellow cre-
ates green.
Additive color on the RGB computer monitor is cre-
ated though varying intensities of light, as just dis-
cussed. When the fi le is sent to press, in order to create 
a tint or a light value of a hue, the printer cuts back 
on the density of the ink through varying tint screens. 
Screens are available in gradients from 10 percent to 
90 percent. Th ere is a similarity between the tint 
screens of printing inks and the application of trans-
parent watercolor. In both cases, white is made by 
allowing the white of the paper to show through, and 
applying less pigment or ink makes lighter values.
In appearance, the value scale of printer’s screens is 
similar to a value scale mixed by an artist combining 
pigments. However, if you look at the printer’s scale 
under a magnifying glass, the screened dots will show 
up. All commercial printing is a form of optical illusion 
achieved not by sleight of hand, but by dot screens. 
Th e same black ink is applied to paper for a 90 percent 
gray or a 10 percent gray, but the dot screen fools the 
eye into believing it is diff erent. Where there are larger 
dots, the ink looks blacker. Solid ink is not screened 
but printed at 100 percent.
Th ere is an analogy here with the computer screen. 
Th e image onscreen is composed of dots, or pixels, of 
varying colors. Th e image the printer creates is also 
composed of dots, this time of solid colors of ink. Th e 
monitor uses varying intensities of light to create (addi-
tive) color, and the printer uses varying densities of ink 
(subtractive pigment) (Figures 8–21a, b).
Figure 8–22 shows 10 percent to 100 percent tint 
screens of the three process colors: yellow, magenta, 
and cyan. Try looking at them with a magnifi er. 
Changing the hue or making an ink appear darker is 
done by combining screened percentages of diff erent 
colors. To change a cyan to purple, for example, a tint 
screen of magenta could be laid over it. Th e new color 
eff ects generated by using overlapping screens of pro-
cess colors are referred to as fake colors (Figure 8–23). 
Figure 8–24 shows the overlapping of two spot colors 
using the Pantone© color formula guide electronically 
within soft ware programs.

CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
When overlapping screened percentages of color or 
halft one screens of photographic images, you may 
encounter a moiré eff ect. A moiré pattern occurs when 
two sets of parallel lines or screens are crossed. It looks 
like a set of window screens stacked together, creating 
odd patterns. Watch for this problem and avoid it by 
changing the angle of your screens or by not overlap-
ping diff erent halft one screens.
It is important to visualize screened color combina-
tions correctly before sending them to the printer. Th e 
“comp” may have been generated on the computer and 
shown onscreen, or it may be output as a proof print to 
show the client and the printer. Th e goal is to arrive at a 
printed piece that matches expectations.
Spot Color or Process Color?
If you are using one to three spot colors, several 
numbered guides are available to assist you. Th e most 
complete, the Pantone© matching system, consists of 
a full line of color specifi cation books coordinated 
by numbers. Th ese formula guides, fi rst developed in 
1963, enable you to specify a color number that the 
printer can match by using a reference guide. Th is is 
much more scientifi c than specifying that a logo be 
printed in “a bright cool red.” Each ink color has its 
own number.
Choose the ink color from the guide and enter it on 
your computer (as shown in Figure 8–24), or tell the 
printer its number. Th e printer then prepares the 
ink you have specifi ed. To get the desired blue for a 
two-color design, you might specify a spot color of 
Pantone© 313 with a 20 percent screen of black. Various 
reference books show screened percentages of these ink 
colors. Th ey also show what happens when you com-
bine two diff erent ink colors in screened percentages. 
Using spot colors is usually less expensive than using 
full process colors.
Process Color Separations
Th e off set reproduction of a full range of color, rather 
than just two or three colors, is done with CMYK pro-
cess color. Th e three primary colors in process printing 
are yellow, magenta, and cyan, as we have discovered. 
Th e addition of black as a fourth color gives depth and 
solidity to the image. Th ese four printer’s inks produce 
the visual eff ect of full color (Figure 8–25).
Once the designer has given the printer a full-color 
illustration or photograph to reproduce, either tradi-
tionally or electronically transferred, the printer sepa-
rates out the process colors. Artwork is separated into 
three color exposures from which the fi nal prints are 
made. A black separation is also made. When the press 
is inked with each of these four colors, and the color 
is laid down onto the paper, an illusion of full color 
results. Th e varying densities of halft one dots overlap 
and lie beside one another, mixing optically. It is a truly 
eff ective illusion.
As with spot color tint screens, the mixing happens not 
within the pigment, but within the eye of the viewer. 
Unlike the even dot coverage of tint screens, a process 
color separation is made of dots of varying densities 
that correspond to the color density in the original 
image. Th is variation is why such a complex range of 
colors can be produced from only four process colors.

Color in Printing
Cutting Costs
Each additional ink used in a design means the off set 
printer must do additional work ripping fi les and ink-
ing the press. Th e more ink colors you use, the more 
printing the design will cost. Combining screened 
percentages of inks will enable you to get the most out 
of each color and can decrease the cost of the job.
Another way to get more color into a job without 
increasing the cost is by printing on colored paper. 
Excellent reference books (many free from paper 
companies) deal with using colored inks on colored 
papers. Th e color of the paper will show through, 
subtly altering the look of the ink. White ink is seldom 
used in the printing industry, because opaque white is 
diffi  cult to achieve. A study of the way tint screens, ink, 
and paper interact will help achieve the desired eff ect at 
a minimum cost.
Halftones, Duotones, and Tritones
Photographic prints used for halft ones should have 
an extended tonal range with good contrast. If your 
negative has good detail, it can be converted to a good 
halft one. Although a poor negative or print with loss of 
detail can be improved, it cannot be converted into a 
high-quality halft one.
Duotones and tritones are commonly used techniques 
for printing black-and-white photography by using spot 
colors. Although these halft ones are limited in color, 
there are many options to consider (Figure 8–26). 
Electronic manipulation can selectively enhance the 
tonal range, and diff erent line screens can be employed 
from coarse to very fi ne. A halft one can be printed over 
a solid color or over a screened color to create a fake 
duotone eff ect. Generating two halft one negatives from 
the same image creates a duotone. By printing these 
negatives in various colors, you can achieve various 
eff ects. Duotone eff ects depend as much on how you 
use the two colors as on what colors you specify. For 
example, a black-and-violet duotone can be run with 
8–26 A monotone, duotone, and tritone are shown here.

148
CHAPTER 8  The Dynamics of Color
the black dominant or the violet dominant. Th e density 
range of each plate can be extended or compressed, 
producing shadow detail in one color while accenting 
the highlights in the other color. Th e tritone uses three 
colors for still more creative options. Black combined 
with two colors yields a new eff ect, as does printing 
with a warm black instead of a true black. A tritone can 
also be created during printing by using varnishes as a 
third color (Figures 8–27a, b).
Whereas designers used to depend on samples and 
their instincts to specify these techniques, now it is 
possible to simulate them quite accurately on the 
computer. Th e eff ects of varnishes and various paper 
surfaces on ink color, however, are still diffi  cult to 
visualize before printing.
Technology is changing fast in the design and printing 
industry, but many principles stay the same. A good 
design sense and a working knowledge of color theory, 
coupled with a basic foundation in computer graphics, 
will see you through.
PROCESS COLOR SEPARATION 
SUMMARY
Th e digital image can be previewed on a color moni-
tor. Th is display uses RGB colors, but the fi nal image is 
converted and printed with subtractive primary colors 
(cyan, magenta, yellow, or CMY), with the addition of 
black (K).
Translating the three RGB values into four CMYK 
values results in variations caused by switching from 
an additive (RGB) system to a subtractive (CMYK) 
system. Th is entire translation process can be done on 
a personal computer as well as on higher-end systems.
Th e fi nal step is to turn the CMYK values (which are 
continuous-tone separations) into four halft one fi lms. 
Th e halft ones are translated into fi lm for making print-
ing plates. In the halft one fi lm, various sizes of halft one 
dots simulate color shades. In a digital press environ-
ment, the fi lm step is skipped. Files are sent directly 
from computer to press.

EXERCISES
1.  Find printed samples of monochromatic, 
analogous, and complementary color schemes. 
Search for samples of color used in graphic 
design, advertising, or packaging that convey a 
particular mood and reach a particular audience.
2.  Find an example of a two-color design that uses 
tint screens to achieve a multicolor effect. Make 
notes and discuss them with your instructor.
3.  Find a duotone or tritone and use a magnify-
ing lens to compare it with a traditional process 
color photograph. Then compare these halftone 
effects with the tint screen you analyzed.

Critique
4.  Using a program such as Photoshop, practice 
converting from RGB to CMYK to HSL and 
manipulating the colors by using slider controls 
(see Figure 8–27).
Experiments
Create your own shapes, or use the one shown on 
the Web site 
 and try these effects:
Use colors you dislike to see if you can achieve a 
desirable effect with them.
Try for discordant color effects.
Choose a mood before choosing a color palette.
Analyze the preferred color choices of your favorite 
ﬁ ne art painter and use that color palette.
PROJECT
Word and Image Poster
Prepare two full-color posters that combine the 
image of a famous person, place, or thing with a 
related word. The word related to each image can be 
a name or an association the image brings to mind. 
Pay close attention to integrating the typography 
with the image through various gestalt unit-forming 
techniques and color choices (Figure 8–28).
Choose a complementary, split complementary, 
monochromatic, or analogous color scheme and 
create two color versions of the poster. Use tint, 
tone, and shade to give your color schemes differ-
ent personalities. Be creative with color choices. 
Local color designs try to keep realistic color (the 
sky is blue), but there are other choices. The use of 
arbitrary color frees you to assign whatever color 
seems desirable. The sky may become yellow to 
enhance the purple backlit tree trunks (as in Figure 
8–1), or a man’s hair may become dark blue in an 
analogous color scheme of cool hues.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Experiment using color to express a mood appro-
priate to an image.
Practice integrating word and image from the 
standpoint of design, concept, and content.
Control color and learn more about it by using 
different models and creating variants of tint, tone, 
and shade.
Learn more about how to create and use electronic 
color.
CRITIQUE
Your instructor may choose to have you display 
your work in print or do the initial critique on the 
monitor.
Present your work to the class. Discuss the follow-
ing attributes of your ﬁ nal solution:
Why did you choose this particular subject?
What is the color scheme and why is it appropriate 
to the subject?
Did you use local or arbitrary color? Why?
How is the typography integrated with the image?
Discuss the process followed to produce 
this image, and discuss any problems you 
encountered.
Ask the class and the instructor how your work 
could be improved. Based on the discussion, make 
any changes that seem wise.

ILLUSTRATION 
AND 
PHOTOGRAPHY 
IN DESIGN
KEY POINTS 
Graphic designers work with illustrators and photographers. Oft en designers also cre-
ate illustration and photography themselves. Th is chapter describes the various types 
of illustration and photography that appear in print and on the Web. It also discusses 
methods for creating and critiquing images.
Oft en the graphic designer is called on to create or acquire illustration and photography. 
Th e boundaries between design, illustration, and photography are less rigid than in the 
past, especially as electronic media make photographic manipulation and electronic 
painting tools available to a broad range of professionals. Every graphic designer needs 
to be familiar with the basics of image generation and manipulation. It is a rewarding 
and enjoyable part of the fi eld and can lead to a career concentration in this area.
THE DESIGNER-ILLUSTRATOR
Illustration is a specialized area of art that uses images, usually representational or 
expressionist, to make a visual statement. Illustration is artwork created for commer-
cial reproduction, possibly in print form, as animation, as motion graphics for various 
venues, or for Web delivery. Many drawings and paintings done as illustrations look and 
function as fi ne art and are exhibited and collected as such. Many painters have worked 
as illustrators at some point in their careers, and vice versa. Th e 20th-century painter 
Edward Hopper earned his living as an illustrator for the fi rst half of his career; Pablo 
Picasso and William Blake illustrated books.
Some designers never actually do an illustration themselves; instead, they purchase 
freelance illustrations. Many illustrators are freelance artists who maintain their own 
studios and work for a variety of clients. Figure 9–1 shows a sketchbook cover by the 
stylistically distinctive freelance illustrator David McLimans. Th e interior pages are full 
of his creative explorations (Figure 9-2).
Some studios have illustrators who do nothing but illustration, working with designers 
who are in charge of typography, photography, layout, and art direction. But oft en the 
fi eld has a need for illustrators who design and designers who illustrate.
Some people feel that editorial illustration is the highest and most artistic form of 
design, as it exists in the cusp between fi ne art and design. Nevertheless, however much 
an illustration created for print reproduction may resemble a painting, the restrictions 
an illustrator works under are similar to those in other areas of graphic design. Th e

CHAPTER 9  Illustration and Photography in Design
illustrator works with the guidance of an art director, 
must be concerned about how the work will be repro-
duced, has to meet a deadline, and is responsible for 
satisfying a client and achieving a defi ned purpose.
WHY ILLUSTRATION?
Illustration may be chosen instead of straight pho-
tography for several reasons. It can show something 
about the subject that cannot be photographed, such as 
detailed information about how photosynthesis works. 
Also, by enhancing details, illustration can demonstrate 
certain particulars more clearly than a photograph. For 
example, it can enlarge tiny engine parts that are dif-
fi cult to see or photograph. Illustration can also elimi-
nate misleading or unnecessary details that confuse an 
image, thereby forcing the eye to focus on important 
characteristics. Also, an illustrator may be allowed 
where a photographer and camera are prohibited, as 
in a courtroom. Also, illustration is an eff ective way to 
present highly emotional, narrative, or fantasy-based 
material.
Although photography is capable of creating surreal 
and strongly emotive images, illustration is still more 
fl exible. It is capable of turning out images of pure 
fantasy, by both electronic and hand techniques. Fig-
ure 9–3 by Professor Roy Behrens is a combination of 
hand-cut and electronically pasted collage eff ects.
Many examples of both contemporary and historical 
illustration appear throughout this book. Illustration 
has a variety of looks, depending on the medium, the 
style of the illustrator, and the purpose of the illustra-
tion. Th e artwork can be drawn, painted, constructed 
through mixed-media collage, or computer generated. 
It can be three-dimensional or a combination of 2-D 
and 3-D imagery. Th e illustrator may use a revived art 
deco style, a new wave or postmodern look, a highly 
personalized style, or an informational, descriptive 
rendering technique. Professionals usually concentrate 
on a consistent personal style. Th e multimedia fi ne art 
in Figure 9–4 by Romare Bearden and the lithographic 
poster by Koloman Moser in Figure 9–5 show powerful 
sources of inspiration that can be found in the history of 
both fi ne art and design.

Why Illustration?

154
CHAPTER 9  Illustration and Photography in Design
If the fi eld of illustration varies in medium and style, 
it also varies in intent. Th e purpose for an illustration 
may be to present a product, tell a story, clarify a con-
cept, or demonstrate a service. Th e following section 
lists these varied purposes. For detailed information 
about contracts, trade practices, and pricing, consult 
the Graphic Artists Guild Handbook: Pricing and Ethical 
Guidelines. It is a valuable reference updated yearly 
with information for illustrators as well as designers.
ADVERTISING AND EDITORIAL 
ILLUSTRATION
Advertising and editorial illustration are two important 
divisions in the fi eld with quite diff erent focuses. Adver-
tising illustration is intended to sell a product or a ser-
vice—almost anything that can be off ered to a consumer. 
Figure 9–6 is a poster design that encourages the public 
to use the London subway system, called the Tube, to 
visit interesting places such as the Tate Gallery. Th e paint 
mimics a subway map that Londoners are familiar with.
In advertising illustration, commonplace objects must be 
shown with style and are oft en enhanced with dramatic 
highlights and textures. A creative concept can lead to 
delightful artwork that goes beyond product presenta-
tions, as in Figure 9–7. 
 In the fi eld of advertising 
illustration, illustrators work with art directors, account 
executives, and copywriters. Th eir work may need to 
please many people of various opinions. Th e best prices 
for illustration are paid in the advertising fi eld.
In editorial illustration, the artist may concentrate 
on communicating emotion or opinion through an 
expressive treatment of line, shape, and placement. 
Th e fi eld of editorial illustration can off er the freedom 
to experiment with media and to obscure details in 
favor of mood. Most important, editorial illustration 
can convey a concept or story by using a purely visual 
language as shown in Figure 9–8, making a statement 
concerning the United Nations’ lack of eff ectiveness. 
Th e following sections discuss various uses for editorial 
and advertising illustration.
Recording and Book Illustration
Illustrators are used extensively to make creative pack-
aging for recording and book illustration. Many record 
covers have become collector’s items, and several 
books have been published on these covers. CD and 
DVD covers are also a creative avenue for illustrators. 
Although smaller in format than record covers, they 
provide an opportunity to integrate type and image 
and to express conceptual content.
Book jacket illustration is vital to the promotion 
and sale of a book. Some book publishers give the 
illustrator specifi c instructions, along with detailed 
notes from the art director. Th e illustrator may be 
asked to read a lengthy manuscript.
Artists who illustrate a book’s interior add an impor-
tant ingredient to the value of the book. Children’s 
books, depending on the age of the target audience, 
oft en require illustration throughout. Payment for 
illustration varies from a fl at fee for books in which the 
freelance illustrator contributes but is not the author 
to a royalty contract for books in which the illustra-
tor is responsible for a major part of the impact and 
content. Children’s book illustration is a rewarding fi eld 
because unlike most adult books, children’s books are 
commonly illustrated throughout. In books for young 
children, artwork must tell much of the story, with 
little reliance on the text. It is responsible for generat-
ing excitement, engaging nonreaders and advancing 
the plot. Some of the best current illustration appears 
in beautifully designed and illustrated children’s books 
directed to a variety of ages. Arthur Rackham was one 
of the many excellent children’s book illustrators from 
the turn of the 20th century (known as the Golden Age 
of Illustration) (Figure 9–9).

posters for Hoard’s Dairyman’s yearly Wisconsin cow-
judging contest. The pencil sketch at the top right is Matt’s 
2006 poster concept inspired by the TV program Desper-
ate Housewives. His process includes thumbnails, pencils, 
and color studies. His ﬁ nished illustrations are done with 
a traditional underdrawing on illustration board, scanned, 
and then value and all color added with Photoshop tools. 
The delightful humor behind these poster concepts joins 
with Matt’s amazing skill to create an unexpected and 
powerful result. See accompanying website.

CHAPTER 9  Illustration and Photography in Design
Magazine and Newspaper Illustration
Magazines depend on illustration to set a tone and 
pique a reader’s interest. A single image oft en must 
carry all the visual information for the accompany-
ing story. Th e designer responsible for layout must 
integrate the illustration into the overall layout without 
detracting from the artwork. Ideally, treatment of the 
headline and text reinforces the art through repetition 
and careful placement. Figure 9-10 by Dugald Stermer 
features hand-drawn imagery as well as hand-drawn 
typography.
Sometimes small spot illustrations are dropped into 
a page of text to enliven the visual presence. Th ey are 
oft en black-and-white and executed in pen and ink. 
Newspapers oft en use black-and-white spot art in 
editorial sections. Many diff erent kinds of illustration 
can be found as you search through the sections of a 
newspaper. Fashion, sports, editorial, product, and 
technical illustration of charts and graphs are all there. 
Newspapers oft en use color only on the front pages of 
each section or for special feature articles. Newsprint 
does not reproduce details and nuances in tonal quality 
well, and the newspaper industry does not pay as well 
as some other fi elds of illustration, such as corporate 
work for annual reports.
Th e illustration in Figure 9–11 by freelance illustrator 
David McLimans accompanies an article in Th e Progres-
sive magazine. Th is publication and its contributors are 
concerned with political activism. Oft en payment is not 
the only reason people become artists and illustrators.
Artist and illustrator Sue Coe has done many illustra-
tions concerning animal rights, the meatpacking indus-
try, and much more. Her commentary on political 
events and social injustice is published in newspapers, 
magazines, and books; her prints and drawings are 
included in several major museum collections. She 
hopes her work will infl uence people to bring about 
change (Figure 9–12).

Advertising and Editorial Illustration 
Fashion Illustration
Fashion illustration is a specialized area of advertising. 
A strictly literal drawing lacks the appeal of a drawing 
that presents the garment in a romantic, stylized manner. 
As a result, fashion illustration does not always simply 
convey information about the garment. It oft en attempts 
to persuade the viewer with the mood of the illustration. 
An important and interesting drape or texture of the gar-
ment or accessory, as well as the model’s height, pose, and 
curves, is oft en emphasized for eff ect. Fashion photogra-
phy shows a similar concern. A fashion illustrator draws 
from either a live model or a photograph of a model 
wearing clothes furnished by the client. Th e growth in 
the beauty and cosmetic areas, including related package 
illustration, has kept this fi eld vibrant (Figure 9–13).
Illustration for In-House Projects
Educational institutions, government agencies, cor-
porations and businesses, and not-for-profi t entities 
hire illustrators to generate material targeted at inter-
nal audiences. Th e assignment oft en calls for editorial 
illustration—that is, the communication of a concept. 
Annual reports, corporate calendars, brochures, 
posters, Web sites, and an array of other materials are 
produced to communicate the nature of the institu-
tion to its employees and constituents. Depending on 
the company, in-house staff  designers may be asked 
to provide illustrations as a part of their regular job. 
Figure 9–14 is a highly creative piece done by an 
in-house department for UCLA. It uses a combina-
tion of photography and drawing to give it a 2-D/3-D 
appeal.
Greeting cards as well as medical and technical 
illustration are other markets that call for illustration, 
both freelance and in-house. Th e Artist’s and Graphic 
Designer’s Market, published by F+W Publications, lists 
more than 2,500 companies that hire freelance design-
ers and illustrators.

CHAPTER 9  Illustration and Photography in Design
Greeting Card and Retail Illustration
Greeting card and retail illustration involves retail 
products such as apparel, toys, greeting cards, calen-
dars, and posters. Th e major greeting card companies 
publish cards created by staff  artists, but they commis-
sion some outside work as well. Varieties of greeting 
cards include seasonal cards, special-occasion cards, 
and everyday cards. A new direction for growth is 
cards targeted at specifi c lifestyle audiences, such as 
working women and seniors. Illustration for cards and 
retail goods may be paid as fl at fees or royalties.
Medical and Technical Illustration
Medical illustrators are specially trained artists who 
oft en have a master’s degree in the fi eld with a com-
bined pre-med and art undergraduate degree. Th e 
accuracy of information as well as the clarity and 
eff ectiveness of presentation are vital in this fi eld. Th e 
artist must be better than a camera in his or her ability 
to simplify, clarify, and select only what must be shown 
for complete communication. Illustrators should have 
knowledge of the human body and a background and 
interest in science and medicine.
Technical illustrators create highly accurate render-
ings of scientifi c or technological subjects, such as 
geological formations and chemical reactions as well as 
machinery and instruments. Th ey oft en work closely 
with scientists or technicians in the fi eld, and they 
produce art for a wide variety of publications, adver-
tisements, and audiovisuals.
Animation and Motion Graphics
Expanding fi elds for illustration include Web graphics 
and various forms of motion graphics. Th ese fi elds use 
illustration in the form of both scanned print-based 
artwork and artwork created electronically for online, 
CD-ROM, and fi lm and video presentation.
Another expanding fi eld that requires illustrators is 
3-D imaging.
Th e computer has made an important impact in 
the fi eld of illustration, especially for the designer-
illustrator. Th e Web site shown in Figure 9–15 exem-
plifi es the fl exibility of digital illustration. Visit this site 
to see the wide array of acclaimed designs created by 
the California-based but internationally recognized 
artist April Greiman.

Getting Ideas
gouache and other painting media, sculptural con-
struction, and computer generation. Figures 9–16a, b 
by Matt Zumbo, a Milwaukee-based illustrator who 
owns his own business, show a skillful integration 
of hand and electronic techniques. His choice of a 
complementary color scheme enhances the drama 
in the fi nal piece.
Illustrator, Photoshop, and Painter get a lot of use, 
and professional computer systems come with their 
own specialized soft ware programs. Programs such 
as Illustrator are vector graphics (object-oriented) 
programs that allow the creation of clean, precise, 
editable images. Painter is a raster program that gives 
a more intuitive feeling to the process of creating an 
image. However the artwork is originally created, 
computer graphics allows an ease of editing that cannot 
be ignored. When the client asks, “Can you make this 
change?” it is a lot easier to say yes when working with 
a digital image—even one that started with hand-
drawn media, such as Figure 9–16.
Computer-generated and photographically based work 
will not completely replace hand-created illustration, 
however, because many people feel that hand-created 
images are appropriate when a warmer, more human 
touch is desired. Computer technology can always 
enhance, and aid the creation of, drawn and painted 
artwork. Th e artwork can be scanned, and then the 
fi nal touches or revisions can be completed electroni-
cally. Computer technology is also helpful in archiving 
and transferring fi les. What is currently threaten-
ing illustrators is not computer-generated work but 
stock illustration that is readily and cheaply available 
electronically.
Whatever their artistic style, illustrators must be aware 
of all the technical information concerning color 
separations and printing methods. Die cuts, embossing 
techniques, and specialty inks may also play a part in 
the fi nal product.
GETTING IDEAS
Th e illustrator goes through the same planning and 
visualizing procedures described in Chapter 1. Th e fi rst 
step is getting to know the assignment. Th is research 
may call for reading a manuscript or understanding 
how a product functions.
Next comes the idea stage. Look at illustrations by 
other artists. Many annuals and periodicals show 
the most current illustrations. Step-by-Step Graphics

DIGITAL FOCUS
Gradients
Illustrators use electronic painting and drawing 
materials to create a wide range of subtly blended 
colors. Creating gradients enables you to enhance 
the blended color effects in your digital illustration. 
The gradient tool in raster and vector programs 
such as Photoshop and Illustrator can create 
multicolor linear and radial blends. You can ﬁ nd 
the existing gradients in the Swatches window or 
construct your own custom gradient. Open the 
Gradient window and click a color gradient swatch 
to observe the change. In Photoshop the window 
opens when the gradient swatch in the Properties 
bar is clicked. To make a custom gradient, click 
the color tab on the bottom slider in the Gradient 
window. Then pick a color from the Color window. 
If the color isn’t exactly what you want, it can be 
adjusted in the Color window. Adjust the color 
as many times as you want, moving the Gradient 
slider tabs. Save your custom gradient by click-
ing New in the Gradient Editor or by dragging the 
color to the Swatches window. You can create a 
more advanced look by placing semitransparent

and How present ideas and techniques in the fi eld of 
illustration. Th e CA Illustration Annual and many 
illustration sourcebooks such as the Workbook and 
the Graphic Artists Guild’s Directory of Illustration are 
excellent sources to see the standards and styles in a 
particular fi eld.
Classics from the history of illustration can also pro-
vide food for visual thought, as shown in Figure 9–18, 
which references Alphonse Mucha. Great artists such as 
Dürer, Seurat, and Magritte have provided inspiration 
for illustrators. Look through books of both fi ne art and 
simple descriptive photography for subjects related to 
your project. 
Th umbnail sketches should explore the subject from 
every angle—high and low, as well as tightly cropped 
and at a distance. Imagine diff erent kinds of spatial 
treatment: a Western perspective, isometric, surrealis-
tic. Sketch these ideas, trying them in diff erent media. 
Exploration is especially valuable to student illustra-
tors who have not yet developed a particular style. As 
you progress from sketches to roughs, you may need 
additional reference materials. Figure 9–19 shows a 
page from Barbara Nessim’s 40th sketchbook. She is an 
internationally known artist, illustrator, and educator. 
Th rough the years, when searching for an idea for an 
illustration job, she will go to her many, many sketches 
for inspiration.

Contemporary Vision
REFERENCE MATERIALS
Drawing from life means drawing from an actual object, 
landscape, or human model. Such work is most practical 
when using a still-life setup or a landscape. Models can 
get tired, and they can also get expensive. Drawing from 
life, however, may give illustrations immediacy and a 
vitality that drawing from photographs cannot.
Drawing from a photograph is convenient for many 
reasons. Th e camera has already converted the subject 
into a two-dimensional language. Cropping is easily 
visualized by placing a few pieces of paper around the 
photo’s edges. Th e subject never gets tired.
Reference materials can add authenticity to your work. 
Th e Internet is an excellent source of images. Once the 
source photos are legally obtained, adapt them to the par-
ticular situation. Figure 9–20 is a portfolio piece that uses 
multiple photographic references. It is a good idea for all 
designers and illustrators to begin a clip fi le of their own 
with images of many diff erent subjects. Old magazines 
are a great source. You may be able to organize magazines 
by categories instead of cutting out the photographs. 
Life, People, and Newsweek magazines would fi t into a 
“people” category; Smithsonian, National Geographic, and 
Audubon would fi t into a “nature” category.
When working with photographs, respect the pho-
tographer as an artist. Do not duplicate a photograph 
exactly unless it has been shot specifi cally for you or 
by you, or you have purchased the right to use it. A 
noncommercial student portfolio has more leniency 
than you will fi nd in the professional world. Copyright 
infringement laws concerning the use of photographs 
have gotten increasingly tight in recent years. Th e 
source photograph must be substantially altered before 
it will be legal to reproduce it as personal artwork. Clip 
art denotes copyright-free images that can be used as 
is or altered to suit your needs. Books and CDs of elec-
tronic and print-based clip art are available from many 
publishing sources, such as Dynamic Graphics and 
EyeWire. Dover is the best print source for wonderful 
old line-art engravings on every subject (Figure 9–21).
Th ere can be disadvantages to working with clip art or 
relying too closely on photos. Th e preexisting image 
makes many decisions about composition, lighting, and 
size. Th e photograph can also provide only one kind of 
spatial representation. Th ese limitations can be over-
come by remembering to use the clip art or photos as a 
source, not as an answer. Reference sources need not be 
taken literally; they should be interpreted creatively.
CONTEMPORARY VISION
Th e invention of off set lithography brought an explo-
sion of illustration in the late 1800s. Coming into the 
20th century as a vital force, and aided by new advances 
in printing technology, illustration retained its ability 
to draw inspiration from the fi ne arts. Painters in the 
early 20th century followed an investigation begun by 
Cézanne, and their art refl ected the relativity of space, 
time, point of view, and emotional coloring. Discoveries 
in science, psychology, and technology supported their 
depiction of reality as changeable. It could shift , alter, 
and be processed by the brain in a variety of ways. Th e 
artist could interact with reality and help shape it.
Much of the art of the 20th century deals with picture 
plane space—the construction of a fl at pattern on the 
fl at surface of the paper or canvas. Th ere is less illusion 
to this work than in previous art; it does not attempt to 
deny the fl at surface it exists on by emphasizing perspec-
tive. Constructivism and the de Stijl movement worked 
with picture plane space. Cubism presented reality from 
multiple points of view within the same plane. An object 
might be portrayed simultaneously from the top, the 
front, and the sides. Th e concept and handling of picture 
plane space is a strong infl uence in contemporary 
illustration. Designers and illustrators have always been 
aware of the fl at surface because they have also worked 
with typography, which encourages fl at patterning.
Th e fauves and the German expressionists in the early 
20th century also emphasized the fl at patterning of the 
surface, using bright, fl at colors to create images that 
were personal and highly emotional. Th is expressive 
quality currently takes various forms in editorial illustra-
tion. Th e emotionally charged image in Figure 9–22 by 
Alan E. Cober created for the now-closed Dallas Times 
Herald uses a visual pun to match the topic of tools of 
violence making up the face of violence. It becomes what 
it represents, integrating form and function.

CHAPTER 9  Illustration and Photography in Design
9–23 Alphonse Mucha. Studio photograph of model.
An interest in other forms of spatial representation 
began to appear in the mid-20th century. Trompe l’oeil 
artists revived an interest in life-size images inside a 
space that looks only inches deep. A French term mean-
ing “fool the eye,” trompe l’oeil works extremely well as 
an illusion of spatial reality. Our culture will probably 
never lose its admiration for this sort of artistic reality.
Th ere are more artists, designers, and illustrators now 
than ever before in history. We have the benefi t of a 
mass communications network to keep us informed of 
what is happening currently in art and design. Design-
ers and illustrators are combining many materials 
and styles, concepts, and technologies to produce a 
rich variety of images and techniques. Th is makes the 
21st century a truly exciting time to be a designer and 
illustrator.
THE IMPACT OF PHOTOGRAPHY
Paul Delaroche, a 19th-century French painter com-
menting on the invention of photography, reportedly 
exclaimed, “From today painting is dead!” He was 
commenting on the invention of the daguerreotype 
and was an advocate of this new form of creating 
images. Although some artists feared this invention, 
others embraced the new medium as a tool and an 
opportunity. From the beginning of photography, 
illustrators have used photographs as aids. Th e art 
nouveau illustrator Alphonse Mucha carefully posed 
models amid studio props and photographed them 
as a reference for his poster designs (Figures 9–23 
and 9–24). Such well-known 20th-century illustra-
tors as Maxfi eld Parrish and Norman Rockwell also 
relied heavily on posing and photographing models 
as a visual reference for later paintings. Photographer 
Eadweard Muybridge is well known in the design com-
munity for his photographic series documenting the 
movement of people and animals. Muybridge mounted 
photographic silhouettes of a trotting horse on a glass 
disk, which was rotated and projected onto a screen 
through a device invented by the photographer and 
called a “zoopraxiscope.” Th is was fi rst demonstrated 
to the public in 1880, in what some consider the fi rst 
moving picture. Th is may have served as inspiration for 
9–24 Alphonse Mucha. Art nouveau poster design based 
on the photographic reference shown in Figure 9-23.

The Designer-Photographer
Th omas Edison’s invention of the cine camera and per-
forated roll fi lm. Muybridge’s books remain a valuable 
resource for illustrators today (Figure 9–25).
THE DESIGNER-PHOTOGRAPHER
Oft en the designer is called on to create or locate, and 
then integrate, photography into a layout design. A work-
ing knowledge of how to evaluate photographs is useful.
Photography is a strong, expressive tool with which 
to prove a point, explore a problem, or sell a product. 
Many people believe that the camera does not lie. 
Th ey believe that an illustrator can change things 
around and make people or situations out to be better 
than they really are, but such people fail to realize 
that the camera also represents a point of view. Th is 
suspension of disbelief makes the camera an eff ective 
tool for persuasion and communication. It is also this 
belief in the “photograph as document” that is chang-
ing with the digital image and the growth of photo 
illustration.
People want to know if they are looking at a manipu-
lated image. Th e staff  working on the cover for the Feb-
ruary 1982 issue of National Geographic magazine had 
diffi  culty getting a photograph of Egyptian pyramids to 
fi t the magazine’s format. Because the image was stored 
digitally on a computer, it was a simple matter to move 
the Great Pyramid of Giza to fi t the format. When that 
photo manipulation became public knowledge (it was 
widely reported), people’s faith in photographic reality 
was badly shaken.
No photograph is truly candid. Its subject is selected, 
framed, and shot by an individual who is interacting 
with the environment. Moreover, a situation will change 
just because a camera is introduced. Another editing 
and selection process occurs when the contact prints 
are viewed. Darkroom and computer manipulation 
may infl uence the last stages. All of these processes 
place photography fi rmly in the camp of interpretive 
art. A photograph can tell the truth, but that truth is 
fi ltered through the eye and intent of the photographer.

precursor to the eff ects now possible with computer-
mediated photography (Figure 9–26). John Heart-
fi eld’s work continues to be an inspiration to editorial 
illustrators.
Designers use photographs and work with photogra-
phers throughout their careers. A photograph may be 
needed to document an event, illustrate a story, sell 
a product, or put across a point of view. In all cases, 
the photograph must be evaluated in terms of print 
quality, design quality, and ability to communicate. 
It is advisable to study and learn to appreciate good 
photos, through a class in darkroom work and/or in 
Photoshop. A photograph communicates in a particu-
lar and powerful way. We have a special relationship 
with photography, based on history, memory, and the 
photograph’s similarity to the retinal image.
SPECIALTIES
Photojournalism
Photographs fall into two general categories: candid 
and staged. Most photojournalism is candid. It is not 
shot in a studio or with hired models. Photojournal-
ism attempts to capture a news event on location with 
immediacy and honesty. When a feature story is run in 
a newspaper, whether in print or online, an art director 
or editor may ask for a photo essay that will illustrate 
a feature story with a single image or a sequence of 
images that give a sense of movement, establish a nar-
rative, or set an emotional tone.
Staged photographs are oft en used in advertising and 
product photography. Th ey are tightly directed and 
require elaborate studio lighting. Hired models can

DIGITAL FOCUS
Photography
The criteria for good design in a photograph are 
similar to good design in layout or illustration. 
A digital photograph can be accessed, manipu-
lated, and transformed with incredible speed and 
efﬁ ciency. Digital cameras skip the analog stage 
entirely, although scanners ensure that any analog 
photo can also become digital. Multiple varia-
tions of a single image can be generated when the 
image is digital, and color editing and retouching 
can be easily accomplished. Mistakes are never 
fatal, because the original image is stored on disk 
(providing the disk and disk reader do not go out 
of date). Because so many variations are quickly 
possible, a critical eye for gestalt properties is 
important. Contemporary artist-educator Susan 
Ressler created the ﬁ ne art image in Figure 9–27 
by digitizing original objects for a complex and rich 
series of manipulations. Her ﬁ nal piece suggests 
a conceptual similarity between veins in leaf and 
hand. The most important aspect of photography 
remains in the eye and mind (and perhaps heart) 
of the artist. The concept, the design, the element 
of communication, and excellence of the output 
determine the quality of a photographic image.

make shooting time expensive. Product photographers 
are usually less concerned with truth telling than 
photojournalists and more concerned with presenting 
a product in the most favorable light.
Product Photography
Whenever the intent of photography is to promote 
or sell a product, it is called product photography. Th e 
product may be food, automobiles, furniture, clothing, 

168
CHAPTER 9  Illustration and Photography in Design
fi ne art, or a wide range of other items. Still-life pho-
tographs enhance the beauty and desirability of many 
products. Oft en this sort of product is prepared for the 
camera with special gels and coatings that intensify 
lighting eff ects.
Whether the assignment comes from an art director at 
an advertising agency or directly from the client, the 
product photographer is oft en told what to shoot within 
narrow specifi cations. Th e challenge in this form of pho-
tography is to help sell or present the product in a way 
that is personally and aesthetically satisfying.
Most photographers doing this kind of work are free-
lancers, and many work through an agent, or rep, who 
solicits work from clients. Major catalog houses and 
department stores have their own in-house photo-
graphic staff  and facilities. Many regional advertisers 
also use an in-house photographic staff . However, 
national advertisers usually hire dependable freelancers 
whose previous work suits the project at hand.
When shooting a fashion layout for a catalog, news-
paper, or direct-mail piece that calls for a model, 
the photographer works with an art director and 
with assistants who help with the details of clothing, 
makeup, props, and so on. All people at a shoot should 
show respect for one another’s professional abilities.
Corporate Photography
Large corporations need a great deal of photography 
for annual reports, presentations, and other publica-
tions. Th e company’s art director or designer oft en 
hires a photographer for an individual assignment 
and off ers suggestions regarding the project.

ated this sensual photo illustration in

A public relations (PR) executive also may become 
involved in the considerations. Sometimes a staff  
photographer does the photographic work. Th is pho-
tographer is typically a generalist working out of the 
PR department and shooting everything from candid 
news release photos to carefully composed and lighted 
architectural interiors.
Architectural photography calls for special skill in han-
dling building interiors and exteriors. Lighting an interior 
so that the bright chandeliers as well as the details in dark 
corners of the room are all properly exposed and not 
distorted calls for considerable expertise (Figure 9-28) 
Photographing exteriors of tall buildings oft en requires 
special equipment that corrects for parallax.
Architectural photography is a specialty in itself, and 
those who specialize in it work for a variety of inte-
rior design fi rms, landscape designers, and corporate 
accounts.
Photo Illustration
Photography can illustrate a wide array of projects such 
as narrative story, a feature article on restaurant dining, 
or a CD cover. Photographic illustrations are some 
times closely art-directed by the designer. Th e neces-
sary props and set may be provided, or the photogra-
pher may be asked to fi nd or construct them.
Th is form of illustration leaves room for creative inter-
pretation, but communication remains the primary 
objective. Digital photography and digital collage is the 
basis for the CD cover by California-based artist and 
illustrator Diane Fenster shown in Figure 9–29.

PROJECT
Design a new cover for a CD you enjoy, incorporat-
ing photography and/or illustration. Find several 
images that are appropriate. You may research and 
obtain authorized copies, shoot the images your-
self, locate copyright-free art, generate the imagery 
through your own drawings, or check the Web. Do 
not appropriate a professional photographer’s or 
illustrator’s work from magazines or other printed 
sources unless you plan on substantial manipula-
tion. Choose or generate the images you will work 
with based on print quality, design quality, and 
visual information.
Combine the imagery with the title of the recording 
and the name of the artist. Prepare your piece to 
actual size. Always keep your treatment appropri-
ate to the subject matter, and remember to use the 
gestalt unit-forming techniques to integrate word 
and image. You can choose to complete the CD 
package, including all typography.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Practice working with thumbnails to develop a 
variety of creative solutions.
Practice creating and integrating imagery in a layout 
design, making type and image work together.
Strive to create an illustration that communicates 
visually, without dependence on words.
CRITIQUE
How do type and image in your design reinforce and 
echo each other? Are there repeated shapes?
How does this solution relate visually to the content 
of the music? Consider tempo, type choice, and sym-
metrical or asymmetrical treatment of type and image.
How is ﬁ gure/ground treated? Discuss these factors 
in your own design and in one other.
Request and recommend changes to improve this 
design for your portfolio.

WHAT IS 
ADVERTISING 
DESIGN?
KEY POINTS 
Th is chapter discusses the diff erences and similarities between advertising design and 
graphic design. Various areas of advertising design are presented, including 2-D and 
3-D print applications, television, and Internet and Web design. Th e importance of 
design structure to a successful ad campaign is discussed, as well as the importance 
of market research and working with a team in this fi eld. Figure 10–1 shows an early 
example of advertising design, created in 1914. Th is style, that incorporates a single 
word and image, is known as Plakatstil.
THE PURPOSE OF ADVERTISING
Advertising diff ers from purely informational graphic design in intent. It seeks primar-
ily to persuade, and the presentation of information is usually secondary to that intent. 
Th e person who enters advertising design oft en is a multitasker who understands the 
marketing perspective and works with a copywriter. Th e copywriter is usually more 
involved in gathering information from the client or account executive, whereas the 
designer/art director remains more involved through the production stages. A success-
ful designer in this fi eld knows about local, regional, national, and/or international mar-
kets for the product. Th e fi eld is highly competitive and fast paced and appeals to people 
interested in the psychology behind designs that sell.
Th e successful advertisement (1) attracts attention, (2) communicates a message, and 
(3) persuades an audience. Advertising can have many diff erent looks. It may appear on 
television, in newspapers, in direct mail, in magazines, on billboards, on outdoor dis-
plays, online, and on point-of-purchase displays. Whatever the medium, it is character-
ized by an attempt to appeal to an audience, with the intent to boost sales, profi ts, and 
market share, or in the case of not-for-profi t organizations, simply to persuade.
Th ere certainly can be elements of information in an advertisement. Th e consumer may 
buy a product based on information supplied by advertisements. Future purchases are 
then based on fi rsthand assessment of the quality of the product. Equipment ads typi-
cally come with information about specifi c attributes that are important in the decision 
to purchase.
Th e ads most useful in informing consumers are probably regional ads announcing 
events such as plays, concerts, and meetings. Consumers may miss an opportunity to 
participate without an advertisement.

CHAPTER 10  What Is Advertising Design?
Th ose who explain the persuasive function of advertis-
ing maintain that advertisements exist primarily to 
change perception. Advertising hopes to convince the 
consumer that a product has certain desirable quali-
ties or associations. Th us, soft  drinks and blue jeans 
become associated with youth, zest, and popularity. 
Ads that promote them “sell” an attitude and a lifestyle, 
and buyers have youth and zest “rubbed off ” on them, 
with little information provided about the product.
Th e clearest example of persuasive advertising can 
be found in national advertising, especially of long-
standing, leading products. Consumers no longer need 
a lot of basic information on these products. What sells 
such products are the associations consumers have 
with them. Many of these associations are generated by 
advertising and have nothing obvious to do with the 
actual products.
To summarize this introduction, many advertisements 
have both persuasive and informative qualities. Th e 
closer an advertisement comes to pure information, the 
closer it comes to graphic design. Th e closer a graphic 
design such as a poster comes to not only announc-
ing an event but also persuading ticket purchases, the 
closer it comes to pure advertising. Figures 10–2 and 
10–3 are newspaper ads that are part of an integrated 
campaign created for the Minnesota Zoo by Rapp 
Collins Communications, a well-known contempo-
rary design fi rm in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Several 
examples of this wonderfully humorous and eff ec-
tive ad campaign are used throughout the chapter. 
An integrated advertising campaign crosses media 
boundaries, producing ads with a repeated visual and 
intellectual theme in various forms of print, Internet, 
and other media.

Types of Advertising
175
TYPES OF ADVERTISING
Retail and national advertising are two major catego-
ries of advertising. Each can be divided into several 
major areas, including newspaper, direct mail, and the 
Internet.
Retail advertising is so named because a retail establish-
ment oft en sponsors it. It tends to be informational, 
especially when announcing special discounts or avail-
ability. It oft en attempts to get people to go to spon-
soring stores to buy items they have seen advertised 
nationally. Studies show that retail advertising encour-
ages price competition.
National advertising is advertising run by manufactur-
ers with a nationwide distribution network for their 
product. It tends to be persuasive. It began when 
manufacturers wanted to diff erentiate their brands 
from similar or identical brands, and when there 
was a national delivery system for advertisements. 
Figure 10–4 shows the step-by-step animation of a 
national TV presentation of the trademark designed 
by Paul Rand as part of the Westinghouse corporate 
identity system.
Television
A large percentage of total advertising dollars is still 
spent on television commercials, although the Internet 
is making a serious inroad. Th e content of national 
television advertising is strongly persuasive. Com-
mercials may take the form of a network advertisement 
shown on national shows; a spot advertisement pre-
pared nationally and shipped to local areas; or a local 
advertisement prepared and shown locally, as in the ad 
for the Minnesota Zoo shown in Figure 10–5.

Paul Rand (1914–1996)
Paul Rand (1914–1996) was an important Ameri-
can graphic designer known for his logo and cor-
porate designs for companies such as IBM, UPS, 
ABC, and Westinghouse. He was a proponent of 
the Swiss style of graphic design (International 
Typographic Style). Stylistically, this movement 
emphasized the use of a grid, sans serif typefac-
es, and ragged right text layout. It is discussed 
earlier in this text.
His early work was inﬂ uenced by the German 
advertising style Plakatstil (object poster) shown 
in Figure 10–1. One of Rand’s strengths was his 
ability to explain how his identities would address 
speciﬁ c needs for the corporation. This is some-
thing all successful contemporary advertising 
designers must be able to communicate.
Rand designed packaging, marketing materials, 
and assorted communications for IBM for more 
than two decades, including the well-known Eye-
Bee-M poster (Figure 2–24). Steve Jobs called 
Rand “the greatest living graphic designer.”
Rand was a modernist. His book A Designer’s 
Art showcases a great deal of his work and his 
design philosophy. His book Thoughts on Design 
is important to shaping the concepts in the 
contemporary ﬁ eld of graphic design. He created 
trademarks up to the day he died at age 82. His 
legacy has a large impact on the ﬁ eld of advertis-
ing and design.
“Ideas do not need to be esoteric to be original or 
exciting.” (Paul Rand, A Designer’s Art)
Market research is important in all advertising, especially 
the heavily persuasive kind. It is a study of consumer 
groups and business competition used to defi ne a 
projected market. Market researchers survey the area 
where a product or service will be off ered and use the 
results to determine the cost of doing business, assess the 
competition, estimate potential sales, and so on. Th e two 
primary marketing considerations in television advertis-
ing are program attentiveness and viewer volume.
Program attentiveness is how strongly viewers concen-
trate on a show. Maximum attention ensures maximum 
recall. Unlike an ad on the Internet or in print media 
such as newspapers and direct mail, a television ad 
occurs within a specifi c time and cannot usually be 
“reread.”
Th e second marketing consideration in TV advertising is 
the number of people viewing programs. Certain hours 
are considered peak viewing periods. Th ese prime-time 
slots cost prime dollars. Because so much money is at 
stake, a great deal of research goes into ad eff ectiveness.
Usually a television advertisement is initially prepared 
in the form of a storyboard. When prepared two-
dimensionally, it consists of two frames per scene: 
one carrying a visual depiction of the scene, the other 
carrying words to be spoken by an announcer or a cast. 
Th e storyboard depicts only key scenes.
Th e visual is oft en prepared so it will carry the message 
even if the TV volume is muted, as shown in Figure 
10–6. Th e product name is oft en superimposed over 
the scene at the end of the ad. Th e audio is oft en writ-
ten to also carry the message alone, in case the viewer 
is temporarily out of the room or unable to see the 
screen.
Newspapers
Newspaper advertising carries both regional and 
national ads. National advertising oft en arrives as a fi le 
ready for insertion. Th e creative work has been done 
at the company’s ad agency. However, regional display 
advertising oft en requires designing by the newspaper’s 
staff  of artists and copywriters. Most newspapers now 
have a Web presence and hire designers to create and 
maintain their Web sites.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES 
Specifi c challenges face the designer in newspaper 
advertising. First, the designer must oft en include 
diverse art elements and typefaces in a single ad. A logo 
and other elements relating to a national campaign 
must oft en be incorporated into an ad for a local sale. 
Oft en multiple companies share the cost of an adver-
tisement if their logos appear in the ad. Th is diversity 
of elements can make creating a well-designed, attrac-
tive advertisement a challenge. Second, the designer 
must create within the limitations of cheap, absorbent 
newsprint and hurried printing to meet daily, some-
times hourly, deadlines.
Single-item ads for large institutional clients such as 
banks may use a full page with room for white space. 
Th ese ads allow more leeway for design. No mat-
ter how many elements the advertisement contains, 
whether it is national or local, whether it is reproduced 
on newsprint or expensive glossy paper, good design 
always aids communication. Given some creativity, it 
also attracts attention and helps persuade the audience. 
Figures 10-2 and 10-3 are creative examples of such 
advertisements.

Types of Advertising
Th ere are advantages to newspaper advertising. You 
can fi nd out how many people are looking at ads 
through subscription and newsstand sales. Advertis-
ers can anticipate the number of people their ads 
will reach. Moreover, the circulation is localized. It is 
therefore easy for a retail outlet to reach the people 
most likely to be interested in and able to travel to a 
nearby sale. Finally, the copy can be changed daily (if 
it’s a daily paper), and the updated ad will still reach its 
audience without great expense.
THE AUDIENCE 
Th e readership for a mainstream newspaper is diverse. 
Newspaper advertising can be targeted to a limited 
extent, however, by considering the type of reader 
attracted to a certain type of paper. Th e readership of 
the Wall Street Journal, for example, diff ers from that of 
the New York Post.
10–6 Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches has long been known for Subs So Fast You’ll Freak™. But 
the age of globalization, not to mention Jimmy’s penchant for hyperbole, called for a new, bigger 
tagline: World’s Greatest Sandwich Delivery. Stills from this 30 second commercial courtesy Planet 
Proganda Studio.
Advertising rates are based on the size of the ad, 
the circulation of the paper, and the position of the 
ad within the paper. Th e sports, society, home, and 
fi nancial sections are areas where advertisements 
allied to special subjects are likely to be seen by the 
desired group of readers. Advertisers pay extra dollars 
to ensure that the appropriate audience sees their ad. 
Other positions within the paper that are worth extra 
money are the outside pages, the top of a column, and 
next to reading material.
Direct Mail
Direct-mail advertising comes in many forms. It is 
an exciting and growing area of advertising that has 
boomed partly because of the credit card business 
and partly because of today’s busy lifestyles. Forms of 
direct mail include letters, fl yers, folders and bro-
chures of various dimensions and formats, catalogs,

and booklets. A single mailing may consist of several 
pieces, such as an outside envelope, a letter, a brochure, 
and a business reply card. It may be part of a campaign 
of related pieces that are mailed out over a period of 
weeks.
Direct mail accounts for most third-class mail and 
a considerable amount of fi rst-class mail. Increas-
ingly, the Internet is an important way for advertisers 
to target specifi c audiences with tailored messages. 
Direct mail is advertising in which the advertiser also 
acts as publisher. Th e advertiser produces a publication 
(rather than renting space in someone else’s), selects 
the mailing list, and sends the publication directly 
to the prospects through the mail. A highly targeted 
form of direct mail includes printed communication to 
investors such as annual reports. Th ese can be high-
quality, high-dollar publications that carefully present 
an integrated corporate identity. Figure 10–7 shows the 
Westinghouse Electric annual report cover from 1971, 
using the logo created by Paul Rand. Notice the similar-
ity between Rand’s print cover design for Westinghouse 
in Figure 10–7 and his TV storyboard in Figure 10–4.
Online delivery of sales material is a fast-growing 
market, as corporations increasingly fi nd it appropriate 
to communicate with their audience directly via the 
Internet. Th is medium calls for an integration of the 
corporate identity program into the pages of Web sites 
and other forms of advertising. Figure 10–8 shows an 
online annual report for Th e Salvation Army.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES 
Th e advantages of direct mail are substantial. First, the 
advertiser can use a mailing list that has been compiled 
to reach a specialized audience. Businesses can either 
buy a list or develop their own. Th e primary sources of 
names are mailing-list brokers. Th ey are in the business 
of building and maintaining lists of individuals likely to 
have an interest in a given topic. Lists are usually rented 
for onetime use, because they go out of date quickly 
and must be constantly updated. Second, direct mail 
does not have to compete for attention with other ads 
on a newspaper page or on television. Th ird, it is fl exible 
in format. Th is feature makes direct mail an enjoyable 
challenge to the designer. Th e size, paper, ink color, and 
folding characteristics are all additional variables to be 
designed. A piece that folds is a three-dimensional prob-
lem. It must succeed visually from a variety of positions. 
Th e design develops from front to back, building interest 
and encouraging the reader to continue.

Types of Advertising
One disadvantage of direct mail is that people can be 
hostile to it. If the audience throws away the envelope 
or catalog without even opening it, communication has 
failed.
Internet forms of advertising include Web sites for 
catalogs, e-mail messages alerting customers to sales 
opportunities, and banner ads that may feature move-
ment and sound and increasingly elaborate “movies.”
Other Forms of Advertising
ONLINE ADVERTISING 
Online advertising uses the Internet and a system of 
interlinked documents contained on the Internet called 
the World Wide Web for the purpose of delivering 
marketing messages to attract customers. Figure 10–9 
is a delightful online ad created for Ray Ban sunglasses. 
Examples of online advertising include ads on search 
engine results pages, banner ads, social network 
advertising, Web page ads, online classifi ed advertising, 
advertising networks, and e-mail marketing.
One major benefi t of online advertising is the immedi-
ate publishing of information and content that is not 
limited by geography or time. And the emerging area 
of interactive advertising presents fresh challenges for 
designers.
Most online advertising has a cost directly related to 
usage or interaction of a customer with an ad. Th us, 
another benefi t to the advertiser is the effi  cient use of 
the investment.
Th e three most common ways in which online adver-
tising is purchased are CPM, CPC, and CPA.
CPM (Cost per Mille)—”Per mille” means per thou-
sand impressions, or loads of an advertisement.
CPC (Cost per Click)—Advertisers pay each time a 
user clicks on their listing and is redirected to their 
Web site.
CPA (Cost per Action)—Th e advertiser pays only for 
the number of users who complete a transaction, 
such as a purchase or signup.
It is wise to keep in mind that the use of online adver-
tising has implications on the privacy and anonymity 
of users.
MAGAZINES 
Magazines also off er a forum for advertising. A 
wide variety of magazines are published. Th ere are

general-interest magazines, such as Newsweek and Life, 
and specialty or “class” magazines, such as computer, 
religious, sports, and health publications. Th ere are 
trade and professional magazines, such as Print, Com-
munication Arts, and ARTnews, as well as professional 
publications for doctors, engineers, and so on. With 
magazines it is possible to target a specifi c inter-
est group. If advertisers have a product to promote, 
they may choose magazine advertising because many 
magazines have a national circulation. However some 
national magazines have regional versions, targeting 
diff erent parts of the country. Figures 10–10a and b are 
part of an advertisement series created for the Environ-
mental Law and Policy Center concerning the need to 
reduce pollution in the Great Lakes. Th e copy reads, 
“Th e Great Lakes are a source of drinking water for 
millions of people. As well as a recreational treasure. 
To learn how you can reduce pollution and help keep 
them clean, contact the Environmental Law and Policy 
Center at www.elpc.org.”
BILLBOARDS 
Th e billboard shown in Figures 10–11a, b, c is part 
of the highly successful Minnesota Zoo campaign. 
When designing for billboards, remember that the 
message will be seen from a moving vehicle at a 
distance of at least 100 feet (30 m). Th e visual and 
the copy must be kept simple, but it is surprising how 
many billboards violate this principle. Type for bill-
boards should be more than 3 inches (8 cm) high at 
100 feet (30 m) and more than 12 inches (30 cm) high 
at 400 feet (120 m). A message of more than seven 
words is diffi  cult to read. A single image is easiest to 
grasp. It should have a strong intellectual and visual

unity. Th e problems presented by transit advertis-
ing and outdoor advertising in general are similar to 
those for billboards. Because the audience is always 
in motion, the form of the appeal must be bold and 
simple, eliminating details.
POINT OF PURCHASE 
Point-of-purchase ads and package design are other 
important forms of advertising. Both are primarily 
three-dimensional and should present a look consistent 
with the other promotional materials established for a 
product. Figure 10–12, designed by Paul Rand, shows

DIGITAL FOCUS
Online Design
The Internet is growing in importance as a form of 
advertising. Modern businesses are searching for 
ways to cut overhead costs and target new market 
segments as well as improve communication 
and proﬁ t margins. Web site design and Internet 
marketing strategies provide powerful applications 
that enable a company to achieve those goals. 
A design that reﬂ ects the corporate identity and 
unites a site from page to page is a vital part of 
this interactive advertising medium.

design. Th e term point of purchase describes the display 
that is present along with the product in stores. Studies 
have shown that people frequently make purchases 
on impulse. More than one-third of purchases in 
department stores and almost two-thirds of purchases 
in supermarkets are infl uenced by the display of the 
product, and its package design. Th e display in stores, 
especially supermarkets, consequently plays an impor-
tant part in advertising products. Package design can 
be considered a form of point-of-purchase advertising 
and is an interesting area to investigate.
Personal Promotion
A special form of advertising that brings out the 
most creative and delightful work samples is personal 
promotion. Th is is the campaign an individual creates 
to advertise freelance services or to promote a small 
design fi rm. It can take many diff erent forms, but the 
goal is to design a creative sample that shows the best 
of concept development, illustration, and design skills. 
It must reach and appeal to the appropriate audience. 
Figure 10–13 shows one piece from a direct-mail print 
campaign designed by photographer Nora Scarlett. 
Photographic postcards numbering 1–10 were sent to 
her mailing list.
CORPORATE IDENTITY
Companies have used trademarks to identify them-
selves since the early Renaissance, as discussed in 
Chapter 5. Th is practice grew and fl ourished with the 
Industrial Revolution and culminated in the 1950s with 
complete visual identifi cation systems. Names associ-
ated with this golden age of corporate identity include 
Paul Rand, Saul Bass, and Lester Beall.
Many large companies and institutions now have a 
master corporate identity plan that coordinates all their 
designs. Th is plan begins with the trademark and applies 
it to the layout of business cards, letterhead, advertise-
ments, product identifi cation, packaging, and Web 
presence. Even the company uniforms and vehicles form 
part of this identity program. In fi gures 10–14a and 
b, the Eyeware Gallery logo (see Fig 5-18) is applied to 
singage and billboards. Corporate identity is a specialized 
branch of advertising and design that creates a unifi ed

PROJECT
Choose one of the following assignments:
Magazine Advertisements
Design two magazine advertisements in an 81⁄2 
x 11" (20 x 28-cm) format for a nonproﬁ t public 
service organization. Your task is to warn two dif-
ferent readerships of a hazard you are concerned 
about. Consider alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, 
and environmental and social problems. The primary 
audience for one ad is 18- to 24-year-olds; the pri-
mary audience for the other ad is up to you. Identify 
the magazines in which each ad will appear. Figures 
10-10a and b are a good example.
Research issues that may be targeted and discuss 
them in class.
Prepare one of the ads for black-and-white repro-
duction, including an image, a headline, and a few 
lines of body copy. Prepare the other ad for full-
color reproduction. In your thumbnails, try various 
approaches, including a path layout, a grid layout, 
and a simple dominant image. For each ad write 
an accompanying explanation of your subject, your 
message, and how the message relates to the visual 
design choices you made. Figure 10–15 is a student 
solution for a similar project.
Personal Promotion
Prepare a personal promotional campaign. Create a 
logo for yourself as an independent designer-illus-
trator, apply it to a business card and letterhead, and 
prepare a brochure for your promotional mailing. The 
research stage of this assignment primarily involves 
looking at other personal promotional campaigns. 
Set your standards high. Try to top the professionals. 

image of a corporation through a systematic application 
of constant design elements. Every aspect of typography 
and imagery and their application must be considered 
part of an integrated presentation.
Th is integrated presentation shows the corporation 
to the public in a positive and memorable light. It not 
only communicates an image, but also attempts to 
persuade the public that the corporation, and hence 
its products, are superior. A graphics standard manual, 
distributed to company personnel, details the appropri-
ate use and placement of the trademark and related 
materials. Th is identity program must be fl exible 
enough to be adapted to future needs.
WORKING WITH OTHERS
Advertising takes teamwork. Th e designer must com-
municate closely with copywriters, photographers, 
illustrators, clients, and market researchers. Either the 
visual or the verbal element may be the departure point 
for developing a message. An integration of form and 
content, of design and communication is at the heart of 
good advertising.
Th e team works together to establish key information. 
Who is the audience? What is the nature of the prod-
uct? Where will the ad appear? What is the purpose 
of the ad? What is the budget? Once these questions 
are answered, the designer can begin to translate this 
information into visual form.
A successful ad attracts attention, communicates 
through its unifi ed arrangement of elements, and per-
suades through the interaction of strong and appropri-
ate copy and layout.

185
Critique
Write an explanation of your message and how 
it relates to the visual design choices you made. 
What is your market? How are you addressing it?
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Experiment with researching an issue and targeting 
(or appealing to) a particular audience.
Practice both communicating a message and per-
suading an audience.
CRITIQUE
Present your solutions, discussing each topic, your 
relationship to it, and the research you conducted. 
How do your choices of type, image, and layout 
relate to the topic and the audience? Be as speciﬁ c 
as possible.

KEY POINTS 
Th is chapter will introduce the structure of digital data and its application to print and 
online graphics. Part I begins with an historical overview, leading to an examination 
of how computers work. Figure 11–1 shows the pixels that make up a raster image. 
Part II covers the nuts and bolts of print reproduction, while Part III discusses fi le 
preparation for online graphics. Computers are at the core of contemporary design 
and production. Th e design fi eld is constantly expanding, as new avenues for print 
and nonprint evolve with developing technology. Th e computer is our active, creative 
partner that joins with hand and eye, reshaping our perception of ourselves and the 
world in which we live. Exciting as this electronic tool is, the greatest tool of all remains 
a fl exible, curious, open mind.
PART I
A DESIGNER’S TOOL
Th ere are many computer applications in design. Th ese include CAD/CAM (computer-
aided design and manufacturing) systems through which a designer can generate three-
dimensional models of a new automobile without touching anything but the computer. 
Print applications travel as digital fi les from the designer’s desktop to fi nal reproduction. 
Th e Internet knits us together with an exchange of visual information and data shar-
ing as never before. Readily available multimedia and animation programs, such as 
Premiere, Flash, and Aft er Eff ects, allow the designer to generate animation, interactive 
environments, and presentation graphics in a desktop environment. Flash is increas-
ingly available for cell phones.
HISTORY OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS
New ways of thinking and doing are born in response to a new medium. Our tools have 
always had an important role in shaping our society. Consider the importance to civili-
zation of the invention of the wheel and of the gradual development of hand tools. Our 
tools of visual communication have also contributed to building our world. From cave 
drawings to today’s varied personal computers, we learn, grow, and build the world around 
us with communication tools as much as with physical ones.

CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
The Moving Dot
Computers began as number crunchers in the 1940s 
around World War II. Th ey functioned as powerful 
adding machines, performing millions of calculations 
at a speed never before imagined. Th e development 
of computer graphics at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) eventually aff ected everyone in the 
fi eld of art and design. Th e fi rst animation was a mov-
ing dot on the visual display terminal, rather like the 
old computer game, Pong.
In 1953 the display of a moving dot had application in 
the defense industry. It could accurately show the track 
of an enemy bomber. Th is visual display’s invention 
was funded by and created for defense, but innovations 
in computer graphics were quickly adapted in a wide 
variety of fi elds such as, but not limited to, medicine, 
architecture, geology, communications, art, and design.
Realism in Computer Graphics
In the 1960s Ivan Sutherland (b. 1938) invented a 
device he called Sketchpad, which could draw lines in 
response to a marker pointed at the screen. Th is was the 
fi rst light pen and interactive display. Th is display could 
use hidden line elimination to depict a three-dimensional 
(3-D) object in space. Th e lines in back of an object were 
hidden from view, making for a more realistic model. 
Th e object’s background lines were omitted, remem-
bered, and recalled as the object on the screen rotated. 
Figure 11–2 shows Sutherland using his new invention 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Animation
An important development in the early days of com-
puter animation was the invention of tweening. Tween-
ing allows the animator to omit several stages of the 
animation and to concentrate on creating key steps. Th e 
computer draws the in-between stages. During the 1970s, 
3-D animation with depth cueing began to display the 
information in the background lighter than the images in 
the front to enhance the realism of the animations.
Professor Charles Csuri (b. 1922) at the College of the 
Arts at Ohio State University was a pioneer in early 
computer graphics and animation. His innovative work 
began in the early 1960s.
In 1967 his experimentation led to animated draw-
ings, including one of a hummingbird in fl ight. Csuri 
produced more than 14,000 frames, which exploded 
DIGITAL FOCUS
Desktop Revolution
The development of desktop computer graphics 
has been a vital part of the computer revolution for 
the ﬁ eld of graphic design. Just as the invention 
of the printing press and movable type in the 15th 
century made the printed word accessible to a 
newly emerging middle class, desktop computers 
took computer graphics beyond the domain of the 
scientiﬁ c and technological elite.
Apple Computer introduced the ﬁ rst Macintosh 
in 1984. The screen presented a black-and-white 
visual display at a resolution of 72 ppi (pixels per 
inch). The opportunity to integrate text and graph-
ics was limited. In 1985 Aldus introduced Page-
Maker software for the Macintosh, and desktop 
publishing began. Adobe Systems developed the 
PostScript programming language, which enabled 
printers to output a combination of text and 
images on a page, and Apple introduced a laser 
printer that used PostScript fonts. Technological 
developments continue at a rapid pace, giving 
individual designers increasing control over their 
product in a desktop environment, whether that 
product is print, Web, or multimedia design.

frames were output to 16-mm fi lm. Th e Museum of 
Modern Art purchased the fi lm in 1968 for the perma-
nent collection as representative of the fi rst computer-
animated artworks. Csuri is sometimes referred to as an 
Old Master in a new medium.
Painting and Drawing
Many artists experimented with and contributed 
to computer graphics during the 1980s. David Em 
(b. 1953) began during this period to create his illusion-
ary three-dimensional imagery, which he thought of 
as paintings. He was a pioneer in his conviction that 
computers and art were natural allies. Em started as a 
painter but in 1974 began to experiment with elec-
tronic manipulations of TV images. His introduction 
to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the research 
work of pioneer Jim Blinn led to Em’s mature computer 
art style. Figure 11–3 shows his use of the innova-
tions in computer graphics, including depth cueing and 
texture mapping.

internationally. She began working with computer 
graphics and paint systems in the early 1980s. Her 
digital art included experiments with image transfer 
to fabrics, and her explorations with available paint 
system technologies have continued to the present 
day (Figure 11–4). Several other names are important 
in the aesthetic development of this tool in the last 
decades of the 20th century. Many of them are shown 
throughout this text and on the accompanying 
Web site. 
Layered Communication
Academic institutions began to incorporate computer 
graphics into design education programs in the 1980s. 
Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan was an 
important and infl uential leader in this movement. 
Graphic designer Katherine McCoy (b. 1945) and her 
husband, product designer Michael McCoy (b. 1944), 
co-chaired the design department from 1971 to 1995. 
During that time, experimentation with computer 
graphics led McCoy and her colleagues to develop 
a highly complex layered graphic style based on a 
concept of hierarchical information. Th e relationship 
between the designer and audience was recognized 
as a two-way communication, allowing for various 
readings of the postmodern design work. Th is anti-
linear exploration of form and visual communication 
was diff erent from modernism’s precise rules. Th ese 
designs deliberately revealed the layered structure of 
the composition, as seen in Figure 11–5, where type 
and image overlap and interweave to create a rich 
visual texture.
Th e computer made possible this visual and concep-
tual layering that is the hallmark of postmodernism in 
graphic design. By the last decade of the 20th century, 
graphic designers were encouraged to move away from

the formal and structural approach of modernism 
and to work more intuitively. Postmodern typography 
could be used to explore multiple meanings rather than 
only to clarify a fi xed message.
Th e mid-20th century saw the development of ground-
breaking technology in the fi eld of computer graphics. 
In the 1970s creative artistic exploration expanded the 
applications for this technology. Th e 1980s gave design-
ers and artists access to high-end computer systems 
as well as early desktop computers. In the 1990s we 
experienced rapid development of desktop applications 
and resulting stylistic innovations. In the opening of the 
21st century, we continue to fi nd new applications for 
electronic data.
ANALOG AND DIGITAL DATA
How does this technology work? Many users are 
unaware of the structure of the hardware they are 
manipulating. What is it that sets computers apart? 
Th eir unique structure deals in digital information. 
Th e analog world is full of continuous-tone photo-
graphs, long-playing records (remember?), and clocks 
with smoothly moving hands. We ourselves live in an 
analog world, with time fl owing smoothly past, as day 
fades to night, as we grow up and gradually age.
Th e digital world, however, is full of discrete units of 
information, such as the music on CDs and the data 
on digital clocks. Each digitized piece of music and 
unit of time is a discrete entity that can be accessed 
and manipulated. When a black-and-white continu-
ous-tone photograph is examined under a magnifi er, 
all that can be seen are continuously changing gray 
values. When a digitized photograph is examined up 
close on a monitor, what can be seen are individual 
picture elements, or pixels, which give the illusion 
of continuous gray or color tones (Figure 11–6). 
Each of those pixels can be manipulated—adjusting 
value, hue, and luminosity—thus giving the designer, 
photographer, or photo retoucher tremendous control 
over the image.
11–6 Enlarging a raster image on a monitor will reveal its 
pixel structure.
11–7 All computer graphics are created 
by on and off commands, represented 
here as black and white and 1 and 0.

193
Analog and Digital Data
Analog to Digital Conversions
In a scanner or a digital camera, analog-to-digital con-
verters (ADC) change analog voltage signals to digital 
RGB values. In a fl atbed scanner, for example, a page is 
placed facedown on the scanner, and a scan head moves 
along the page, illuminating it. Th e light refl ected from 
the page strikes a series of mirrors, which redirect the 
light to a lens. Th is lens focuses the beam of light into 
a prism that splits the beam into red, green, and blue 
components. Th e red, green, and blue light beams strike 
rows of photosensitive CCD (charge-coupled device) 
cells, where they are converted into an analog voltage 
level. Finally, the analog-to-digital converter changes 
these voltage levels to digital information, storing the 
RGB levels for all the individual pixels in the image that 
appears on the screen.
The Screen Image
Raster graphics create the video display. A raster beam 
shot from electron guns illuminates the display line by 
line. As it moves across the screen, the raster beam’s 
brightness and color are determined by instructions 
from the computer hardware.
A digital image is composed of pixels, each of which 
can be individually accessed and manipulated. Each 
pixel represents a location in memory that consists of 
a bitmap that has an on or off  command stored several 
bit planes (layers) deep. All of computer graphics 
comes down to on and off  commands (Figure 11–7).
Th e resolution of the screen controls the sharpness 
and clarity of the image. You may have noticed jagged 
edges on some computer displays or printed graph-
ics. Because each spot on the visual display is a pixel 
corresponding to a spot in memory, the number of 
individual pixels in the fi le determines the resolution 
of the image (Figures 11–8 and 11–9). Th e screen, the 
fi le, and the printer may all have diff erent resolutions. 
For print graphics, a high-resolution fi le and output 
are mandatory. For online viewing, however, a lower 
resolution is adequate.
11–8 These on and off commands represent an X.
11–9 This bitmap shows the on-and- off commands repre-
sented on the monitor as pixels forming a simple X.

CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
Object-Oriented and Bitmapped Graphics
Th ere are two kinds of image fi les in computer 
graphics: vector (object-oriented) graphics and raster 
(bitmapped) graphics. Illustrator, for example, is an 
example of a vector graphics program. Images are cre-
ated by lines drawn between coordinate points rather 
than being composed of pixels (Figure 11–10). Th ese 
images can be selected and moved separately from 
other objects. Vector graphics programs create images 
with clean, sharp edges.
René Descartes (1596–1650) was a 17th-century 
French philosopher, mathematician, and physicist 
whose most remembered philosophical words were, “I 
think, therefore I am” (I am thinking, this proves I exist). 
Descartes created the Cartesian coordinate system that 
vector graphics is based on. In this coordinate system, 
x and y represent a two-dimensional graphic, and x, y, 
and z represent three dimensions. It is amazing to realize 
that computers use information developed that long ago. 
Objects created in vector graphics, such as the Illustrator 
image in Figure 11–11, are easily selected and manipu-
lated through pushing, pulling, adding, and deleting 
mathematical points with no loss of data.
Bitmapped programs use raster graphics to create 
images. Th is means that each pixel is individually 
manipulated in terms of color and size to create a 
“map” of an image. Accessing the individual bits in 
each pixel does this. Photoshop is a bitmapped graph-
ics programs. Th is type of program seems to have an 
intuitive feel, operating much like painting or drawing 
materials. However, bitmapped images lose data when 
enlarged in size, unlike vector graphics, which retain 
their clarity as they are scaled up or down.
Page layout programs accept both forms of graphics. 
Such programs are usually where type, illustrations, 
and photographs are compiled for commercial print-
ing. For example, Adobe InDesign works with outline 
vector graphics fonts to give sharp, clear, resizable 
typography, and pixel-based images can also be placed 
in the fi le.
Hardware and Software
Hardware components are the physical objects that 
make up a computer graphics system. Th e monitor 
we view images on is also known as a visual display 
terminal (VDT). Th e central processing unit (CPU), 
the main part of the system, is the portion of a com-
puter system that carries out the instructions of a com-
puter program. Th e hard drive, along with CD, DVD, 
and various portable drives, gives access to personal 
11–10 Vector graphics consist of lines drawn between 
coordinate points.
11–11 The selection points in this vector graphic are easily 
manipulated to rescale or reshape the object.

195
Analog and Digital Data
fi le storage. Th e computer case houses the hard drive as 
well as the other internal components: CPU, moth-
erboard, power supply, internal drives, RAM, video/
sound cards, etc.
Soft ware programs are sets of instructions that tell the 
computer system what to do. Soft ware is intangible, 
having no physical or “touchable” components. Th e 
term is also used to describe application soft ware such 
as graphics programs.
Memory
All of a computer’s ability to store, recall, and display 
images is based on the simple notion of on or off . A 
single piece of information equivalent to the choice 
of on or off  is called a bit. It can represent a black or 
a white pixel. Hence the term bitmapped graphics. 
A group of bits can handle grays and even complex 
colors (Figure 11–12). Eight bits are called a byte and 
can store 256 diff erent grays or colors per pixel. Th ree 
bytes (24 bits) make it possible to render 16.7 million 
colors. Full-color eff ects are achieved when eight or 
more bits represent each pixel within an image. A full-
color image will take up more memory than a gray-
scale image, because it uses more bits of information. 
Bitmaps are stacked several bit planes (layers) deep to 
achieve the number of on and off  options necessary to 
achieve full color. Figure 11–13 shows two stacked bit 
planes creating four possible numerical combinations 
per pixel. As shown, three stacked bit planes give eight 
possible combinations per location. If there are eight 
stacked bit planes in the bitmap, each pixel is one byte 
and can have 256 possible combinations, providing a 
full-color eff ect.
RAM and ROM
A computer has two kinds of memory. An integrated 
circuit chip on the computer’s motherboard has a 
permanent memory called ROM (read-only memory). 
It holds the computer’s essential operating instructions. 
Th e other kind of memory, called RAM (random-
access memory), is used to actively create your fi les. 
When you launch an application or open a document, 
it is loaded into RAM and stored there while you 
work. Enough RAM is needed to hold the soft ware 
you are using and the data you generate. RAM needs 
are constantly escalating. If your computer has limited 
RAM, buy and install as much as you can to meet your 
needs. Personal computers currently will easily hold 16 
gigabytes (GB) of RAM. RAM chips also vary in speed 
(measured in nanoseconds [ns]). Be sure to buy the 
RAM chips specifi ed for your computer.
11–12 A bit of information (top) is organized into groups 
called a byte (middle). A group of bytes make up a “word 
(bottom).”
11–13 When each pixel has two bits, as shown on the left, 
four numerical possibilities exist per location. If there are 
three stacked bitplanes, then eight possibilities exist for 
each bit, providing eight color variations per pixel.

196
CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
Most RAM chips are installed onto memory module 
boards. Th ey are fairly easy to plug in and can be added 
to your system to increase its memory capacity. Each 
system has a particular confi guration of inline memory 
module boards. Make sure RAM chips will fi t and are 
compatible with your particular board when adding to 
your computer’s memory.
Storage Devices
Where do you store the large fi les you have created? 
Hard drive space is always too small, and the need for 
more gigabytes increases every year. If you’re planning 
to work on animation and multimedia, an external 
terabyte storage device can be useful to store and back 
up work. Designers resort to a wide array of exter-
nal portable storage devices to send their fi les to the 
prepress service bureau or to archive data. Obviously, 
whatever device you choose, the vendors you deal with 
must be able to support it. Electronic fi le transfer via 
e-mail is a valuable timesaving method for sending 
graphics fi les to a client or reproduction house. A 
physical CD or an online FTP document can be used 
to send large fi les.
INPUT/OUTPUT DEVICES
Data In
Many peripheral devices are capable of capturing data 
for a computer. Scanners come in many varieties, from 
fl atbed to transparency to drum scanners. Th e higher 
the resolution a scanner can produce, the better the 
scan data will be. Excellent quality is now available for 
much less cost than in previous years.
Digital cameras are another form of input. A digital 
camera captures a continuous-tone analog image and 
converts it to digital data, saving it to a hard drive as 
bits and bytes. Digital video is now commonly available 
at the consumer level, complete with simple editing 
programs. High-end digital video cameras are used in 
the fi eld by news organizations. A transceiver allows 
images to be transmitted anywhere in the world. A 
transceiver is a device that contains both a transmitter 
and a receiver that share circuitry or a single housing. 
A tremendous variety of input devices are available, 
and careful research will help determine which will 
meet your particular needs and budget.
Data Out
As a student or a job seeker you will want both a print 
and an online version of your artwork for a design 
portfolio. Th e image on the screen should be output to 
print, and you may also plan to place it on a Web site 
or to download to a digital CD portfolio for viewing. 
Perhaps you plan to create a portfolio of analog media 
paintings or drawings. A digital capture will allow you 
to show this work in multiple venues.
A variety of printing technologies are available, and 
each creates a slightly diff erent kind of image. A basic 
description follows.
A PostScript-equipped printer that can read EPS (encap-
sulated PostScript) fi les is an important piece of equip-
ment for a professional design studio that uses various 
soft ware to create type and image fi les. PostScript is a 
device-independent format that means the fi le will print 
out at whatever dpi (dots per inch) the printer is capable 
of delivering. PostScript is well known for its use as a 
page description language in the electronic area.
An inkjet printer sprays ink drops onto paper, where 
they form characters or shapes. Archival ink sets are 
available for several product lines, producing a high-
quality, long-lasting image. Inkjets are cost-eff ective 
and suitable for most color proofi ng and student 
portfolio prints.
A laser printer is a common type of computer printer 
that produces high-quality text and graphics on plain 
paper. Th e image is produced by the direct scanning of 
a laser beam across the printer’s photoreceptor. A laser 
printer prints quickly with relatively inexpensive dry 
ink, or toner. As with most electronic devices, the cost 
of laser printers has fallen markedly over the years.
An imagesetter is a high-resolution device found at ser-
vice bureaus and commercial print shops. It uses lasers 
to expose an image onto fi lm in preparation for off set 
reproduction. Th is dry, chemical-free process can pro-
duce positive or negative fi lm separations direct from a 
computer. Th e high resolutions (up to 3,000 dpi) of the 
imagesetter combined with the quality of fi lm provide 
high-quality printing for photographs and halft ones. 
A platesetter is a machine that receives a raster image 
from a raster image processor and, in turn, creates a 
lithographic plate suitable for use on an off set press, 
thus skipping the imagesetter step.
Fine Art
Digital imagery is also created for fi ne art purposes.

PART II
PRODUCTION FOR PRINT
The Process
Th e fi rst step in preparing art for the off set commercial 
printer is the job of the graphic designer. Th e designer 
is responsible for decisions about the placement of 
elements, the location of color, the choice of imagery, 
and the typographic treatment. Once the design is 
approved, the job is sometimes turned over to a pre-
press artist who prepares the design for printing. Many 
entry-level jobs for designers are in prepress production, 
although many designers who generate their own elec-
tronic designs also prepare their own fi les for press.
Preparing art for the printing process has changed a 
lot in recent years. Currently this preparation is done 
primarily with electronic techniques. An understand-
ing of the terminology involved will provide a strong 
foundation for the new designer. It is possible to better 
understand the currently process when we begin with a 
historical knowledge of prepress production. Much of 
the terminology from the traditional hand techniques 
has carried over to the current electronic techniques.
An Historic Process
Before computers, the traditional pasteup artist pre-
pared a black-and-white version of the design that was 
camera ready. All the components of the design were 
assembled in black and white and pasted into position, 
and colors were specifi ed before sending the job to a 
process camera to have fi lm shot and plates burned. 
If any artwork was to be reproduced in full (process) 
color, it was sent separately to be color separated by a 
camera. All black-and-white photographs were also 
sent to be screened into halft ones.
A process camera produced negatives of all text and 
image materials. Th ese negatives were prepared for 
plate making by a technician called a stripper. He or she 
would cut, trim, and tape the negatives into position on 
a carrier sheet. Th e plate would then be exposed and 
put on the printing press, and the fi nal printed copies 
of the original layout would be produced on specifi ed 
paper in specifi ed colors.
In the current digital prepress version, fi les done by the 
designer or at a high-quality professional bureau are sent 
to the commercial printer. Th ere the fi nal composite 
fi le can be created. Files go through a RIP (raster image 
processor) for color separation, then are laser etched 
onto plates, or just sent straight to the digital press. Th e 
RIP is the process of turning vector information into a 
high-resolution raster image. Th e RIP takes the digital 
information about fonts and graphics and translates 
it into an image composed of individual dots that the 
imaging device can output. Th e inking process on the 
off set press remains essentially the same as it was before 
digital fi le creation. Spot or process color inks are put on 
the press rollers, and the color is printed onto paper. Th e 
diagram in Figure 11–15a shows this process.

as shown here.

199
Th e prepress and printing process requires high 
standards and good communication from everyone 
involved. Oft en the printer can answer a designer’s 
questions about the equipment a job will be run on, 
which will infl uence preparation of the artwork. Th is 
section of the chapter discusses the preparation of 
artwork for the off set press, the most common method 
of reproduction.
Terminology
To the printer, the terms art and copy refer to all material 
to be reproduced. Th e copy is the typeset material; the 
art is everything else. All photographs, illustrations, and 
diagrams are called art. In general, they fall into two 
classifi cations: line art and continuous-tone images.
OFFSET REPRODUCTION 
Th e most commonly used printing process, off set 
printing, involves three production steps: prepress (just 
discussed), the press run, and bindery. During the 
press run, the inked image is transferred (or “off set”) 
from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing 
surface. Th e off set technique is based on the repulsion 
of oil and water. Th e image to be printed obtains ink 
from ink rollers, while the nonprinting area attracts a 
water-based fi lm, keeping it ink-free (Figure 11–15b).
LINE ART 
Line art consists of a black-and-white image with 
no variation in grays except those created by optical 
mixing. In the previous prepress process, any line art 
could be pasted up directly onto a board and it was 
ready to be photographed for reproduction. Anything 
not line art was handled separately, because it needed 
to be converted at the printer’s or via electronic pre-
press into line-art dots called screens or halft ones. Th e 
printing press would reproduce only line art. Figure 
11–16a shows line-art, grayscale, and spot color images 
with an enlarged dot screen pattern beneath.
Typography, India ink drawings, one-color vector 
diagrams, high-contrast black-and-white photogra-
phy, bitmap images, and line-art scans are all forms of 
art and copy that contain only black-and-white data 
with no shades of gray. Th ese are printed as one-color 
designs, as shown in the three illustrations in Figure 
11–16b).
CONTINUOUS-TONE ART 
Art that produces a graduated or blended variety of 
values is called continuous-tone art. It includes pho-
tographs, art, and illustration done with pencil, paint, 
or any other method that produces a variety of values. 
When transferring such art to computer, the image 
is scanned or photographed digitally to reproduce a 
range of values.
Th e electronic prepress artist sends a fi le with line art 
or continuous-tone art in place and ink color specifi ed. 
Th e fi nal off set color printing on a nondigital press is 
created by making a separate negative and plate for

CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
each necessary color. Th e diff erent inks are printed 
on the paper by the press in succession. Direct digital 
imaging can skip the negative and plate stages and go 
directly to press.
SPOT COLOR VARIATIONS 
Reversals and tint screens are line-art variations that 
can add interest to one- or two-color art (also called 
spot color). Th is topic is discussed in Chapter 8. Such 
variations should be planned at the design stage. Figure 
11-16b shows three ways to enrich a one-color design.
REGISTRATION 
Registration marks, shown at the top and bottom of 
Figure 11-17, indicate how the layers of color should 
overprint. Th e crop marks are indicated at the edges of 
the image.
Th ere are three types of color register: nonregistered, 
commercial register, and hairline register. Nonregis-
tered colors do not abut. Commercial register (some-
times called lap register) means that slight variations 
in placement of color, of about one row of screen 
dots, are not important. Hairline register is a term 
for extremely tight registration, where the tolerance 
is not greater than half a row of dots. When prepar-
ing an electronic fi le, trapping becomes an important 
consideration to ensure successful tight registration of 
colors that lie side by side. Otherwise, a thin outline 
of white or dark can surround inked shapes. Some 
soft ware programs, such as InDesign, do automatic 
trapping, inserting chokes and bleeds to slightly reduce 
or enlarge the overlap of inked outlines. In most cases 
the printer or prepress service bureau will trap the fi le 
if your soft ware program has not.
Quality Issues
Careful consideration of dot gain, LPI (lines per inch), 
and paper quality is necessary to ensure quality output.
Dot gain occurs when halft one dots print larger than 
intended. It causes a printed piece to look very dark 
and full of high contrast. When examined under a 
magnifi er, the halft one dots appear to be bleeding into 
the white spaces. An absorbent paper can cause dot 
gain, as can problems with the press itself.
LPI refers to the screen frequency of the actual 
printed piece. Again, your printing company is a 
good source of information about the recommended 
LPI for your job. Th e higher the LPI, the fi ner the 
printed image, because the rows of halft one dots 
are closer together and are very small. However, the 
higher the LPI, the greater the tendency toward a 
clogging of halft one dots, or dot gain. Coated paper 
will handle higher screen frequencies than uncoated 
paper or newsprint:
133–175 LPI for coated paper stock
85–133 LPI for uncoated paper stock
60–80 LPI for newsprint
DIGITAL PREPRESS
Th e design and production stages are highly integrated 
now. Designs are previewed on the computer screen 
(or in a proof stage), changes are suggested by the cli-
ent, adjustments are made by the designer, and the fi nal 
design is sent to the production people as electronic 
fi les. Color correction, photo retouching, and color 
separations can be done on a desktop system before 
sending the fi les to a service bureau or printer for high-
resolution output to print proof or to press. Once the 
design is in digital form, there are vast possibilities for 
archiving and reutilization.
All of this may sound simple, but it is actually quite 
complex. Th ere are many ways to corrupt a digital fi le. 
Clear communication between the designer, the pre-
press technician, and the printing technician is a must.
The RIP
Once the publication fi le is assembled, the designer or 
prepress technician needs to verify that the fi le is ready 
for RIP (raster image processing). A typical computer 
11–17 Accurate registration and crop marks are vital for a 
ﬁ le going to offset reproduction.

monitor has a resolution of 72 dpi; a typical laser 
printer has a resolution of several hundred dpi. Th e 
imagesetter that will send a fi le to fi lm has a resolution 
of 2,400 dpi or higher. Th e pages may print fi ne on a 
designer’s laser or inkjet printer but fail to print on an 
imagesetter, because it calculates pixels by a diff erent 
method. It is a safe bet that if the pages do not print on 
a laser printer, they will not print on an imagesetter. 
How do you ensure that those pages are ready to RIP? 
Such considerations are especially important when 
using imported elements and multiple programs.
SOME DOS AND DON’TS
  It is important to keep an electronic fi le clean and 
neat. If you do not need something in a fi le, delete it. 
Do not cover it with a white rectangle or leave it on a 
hidden layer.
  Avoid putting fi les into fi les and then putting these 
fi les into yet more fi les. Th is process is referred to as 
nesting, and it can snarl the RIP by requiring many 
unnecessary steps in electronic memory (Figure 
11–18).
  When using multiple programs, it is best to assemble 
all the elements in your fi nal output program.
  Finish any manipulation of those elements in the 
original fi le before importing. Rotate and resize an 
image in Photoshop, for example, before sending it 
to a page layout program.
  Avoid scaling graphics up or down by large amounts. 
Th e data may distort when reduced, or you can end 
up with a large but relatively low-resolution image.
  Always scan or create an image at approximately 
the size it will be in the fi nal publication. If it is 
necessary to drastically reduce the size of an image, 
plan to also use the soft ware program to reduce the 
resolution (dpi). If you are planning to enlarge the 
image, watch what happens to the resolution. It will 
decrease as the image size increases.
Fonts
Fonts are composed of a printer font and a screen font. 
Th e printer (PostScript) fonts are outline font specifi -
cations developed by Adobe Systems for professional 
digital typesetting and allow typography to output 
cleanly to print. Th e screen font is a cruder version 
that shows up on the monitor. Screen fonts display a 
font onscreen at 72 dpi. Th e RIP needs to fi nd and use 
exactly the font used to create the document. Th e font 
cannot be some other vendor’s version of Helvetica. It 
has to be the exact one used in your publication for the 
line breaks to work out correctly. Send all printer and 
screen fonts along with your document or as a PDF fi le. 
Th is fi le is used for representing documents in a man-
ner independent of the application soft ware, hardware, 
and operating system Otherwise, plan to convert vector 
fi les such as Illustrator to “outline” (Figure 11–19). If

CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
you rasterize (convert to raster graphics) typographic 
fi les in Photoshop, they will not print as sharply as a 
vector graphics fi le.
Digital Image
In the precomputer days of off set reproduction, 
the designer sent a continuous-tone photograph or 
transparency along with the pasteup or mechanical 
and specifi ed where the image should be inserted and 
resized. Th e printer then created a halft one negative 
at the correct LPI for the press and the paper choice. 
Th e primary tool for creating a halft one today is the 
computer. Th e designer needs to be familiar with terms 
such as LPI and dpi and understand their relationship 
to ensure good results.
Th e higher the resolution an image has, the more 
dpi (dots per inch) it has. Th e term dpi refers to how 
many dots fi t within each inch to recreate the image. 
More dpi produces more data and potentially a fi ner 
reproduction of the image or typography. A 72-dpi, 
or low-res, scan, though suitable for online use, will 
show jagged edges of pixilation when printed. Most 
consumer-level digital cameras can now shoot a fi le 
that converts to 300-dpi print quality at 8 x 10 in. And 
it keeps getting better.
LPI and dpi
When a continuous-tone, chemically processed 
photograph is scanned, it is converted into dots on 
an electronic fi le. Th e more dots, the higher the 
resolution, or dpi.
Th ere is a relationship between the resolution of an 
image and the lines per inch of the fi nal printed piece. 
For a good-quality printed piece, pay attention to this 
relationship.
Do you know the optimum LPI of your printed piece? 
If not, ask the printer and look at the LPI list in this 
chapter. LPI will vary depending on the paper used for 
printing. LPI is sometimes called screen frequency or 
screen ruling. For halft ones, a fi nal dpi resolution of 
1.5 or 2 times the LPI usually works well. Th e formula 
is LPI x 1.5 = dpi scanning resolution. Remember 
that resizing the image can change the dpi, so plan 
accordingly.
SUGGESTIONS
  Using a retouching program to sharpen an image 
will produce a cleaner-looking fi le. A blurry scan 
may not be improved with higher resolution, but it 
will look better when soft ware-sharpening fi lters, 
such as Photoshop’s unsharp mask fi lter, are applied.
  When scanning, crop away the white borders. Th ey 
create data that adds to the fi le size. If any cropping 
is desirable, do it in the scanning stage.
  A line-art image will not need to be screened when 
it is scanned. When creating a line-art scan, use 
very high resolution and use sharpening. Image 
resolution does not need to be higher than the 
output resolution, but if the fi le is going to an 
imagesetter for a RIP, try for at least 800 dpi on a 
line-art scan.
  Every time photographic material is duplicated in a 
compressed JPEG fi le format, image degeneration, or 
loss of information, occurs. Do not resave JPEG fi les. 
File Links
To insert scans or other graphics fi les into a layout pro-
gram, the computer must fi nd those fi les. To fi nd a fi le, 
the computer searches along a path established when 
the graphic was imported into the layout program. Th is 
path is known as a link.
Th ere are several reasons why this link may not be 
found. If the graphic was renamed or moved to another 
folder, the link could be broken. All graphics fi les 
should be sent to the printer along with the job if the 
job has various soft ware graphics assembled in a page 
layout program. Th ese fi les should be in the same 
folder that uses the graphics.
File Formats for Print
Th e way an image is stored determines which programs 
can open, read, and edit that image. If an image is not 
stored in the proper format, it will not appear as an 
option to open or import into another program.
Photoshop’s PSD and Illustrator’s AI are standard 
formats that will import into easily into page layout 
programs.
TIFF (tagged image fi le format) is a widely used 
bitmapped fi le format. It is appropriate for scanned 
images and digital photos. Almost every program that 
works with bitmaps can use the TIFF format; it is used 
for exchanging documents between diff erent applica-
tions and computer platforms.
EPS (encapsulated PostScript) is an object-oriented 
fi le format that is excellent for storing graphics of 
any kind. Most illustration and page layout programs 
support this type of PostScript fi le. EPS is a refi ned 
form of PostScript that will allow an object-oriented or 
bitmapped program to open the fi le for editing. Files 
should be converted to TIFF or EPS before placing in a 
page layout program.

203
The Global Village
PICT is a Mac object-oriented fi le format. It handles 
bitmap and vector images well.
DOC is a fi le extension for word-processing docu-
ments, most commonly for Microsoft  Word.
Understanding the basic concept of fi le links and fi le 
formats clears up a lot of questions about why an image 
may not appear correctly onscreen when imported into 
another program. At a more advanced level, you will 
learn more about this topic.
Compression
Sometimes a fi le is simply too large for a storage device. 
In that case, data can be compressed to shrink the 
number of bytes needed for storage. Two methods are 
used to compress bitmapped data: lossless compres-
sion and lossy compression. Lossless methods give less 
compression but preserve the original image. Lossy 
methods give high compression but lose information in 
the original fi le. For example, JPEG is a lossy compres-
sion method that throws away some high-frequency 
variations in color. RLE (run-length encoding) is a 
lossless method that depends on batch-processing 
adjacent pixels with identical values.
Preparing Electronic Files 
for a Service Bureau
Th ere is a great deal to know about preparing artwork for 
reproduction. Th e better a designer understands the tools 
and procedures of off set reproduction, the better his or 
her designs will reproduce in print. All digital fi les pre-
pared for off set reproduction must be clean and accurate.
ACHIEVING ACCURATE FILES
  Assemble the fi le in a page layout program. It is 
easier to RIP fi les from a layout program than from 
an image manipulation program.
  Bring all images from Illustrator, Freehand, and Pho-
toshop into the fi nal document as EPS fi les.
  Select the automatic trapping option in the layout 
program, and ask the service bureau to check your 
trapping.
  All fi les must be CMYK if prepared for full-color 
output.
  When using Photoshop, check the color picker menu 
for an alert symbol. If the triangle has an exclama-
tion point in it, the selected screen color will not 
print accurately in printer’s inks.
  Include all original scans, fonts, and vector graphics 
links or fi les in the documents sent to the printer.
  Be sure all documents are linked. Check the links 
menu in your layout program. If fi les are missing, 
locate and include them. Soft ware such as InDesign 
and FlightCheck has an option that will check your 
document for missing items and collect the neces-
sary fi les.
  Supply all fonts used in your document or convert 
them to outline or rasterize them.
PART III
PRODUCTION FOR THE WEB
Th ere are many design similarities between print and 
Web. Th ey benefi t equally from the application of the 
graphic design basics discussed in this text. But there are 
a number of diff erences between production for print 
and production for the Web. Th is section discusses these 
similarities and diff erences and introduces the basic 
structure of designing and creating fi les for the Web.
Internet Origins
Th e Internet (or “the Net”) is a medium with few geo-
graphic boundaries. It connects millions of computers 
globally and is used for a variety of applications, includ-
ing e-mail. Th e World Wide Web (or simply “the Web”) 
is contained on the Internet and is a method of accessing 
and sharing information by using browsers. It is the larg-
est and most popular subnetwork on the Internet.
In 1969 the fi rst network connection between two 
computers (ARPANET) was successful and the Inter-
net was launched. Th is research, sponsored by the U.S. 
government, was an attempt to increase technological 
advancements. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the 
backbone of the World Wide Web, hypertext transfer 
protocol (HTTP). Computer scientists using this early 
relatively limited version of HTML (hypertext markup 
language) created the fi rst Web sites. Th ese sites were 
linear, text based, and unhampered by fi ne distinctions in 
typography because users set their font viewing prefer-
ences on their own computers. However, the Web quickly 
became a powerful and exciting tool for designers. See 
the accompanying Web site for more information.
In the 21st century, the Web and multimedia increas-
ingly take us beyond text and still images. As we know, 
human perception is a blend of sensory input from sight, 
hearing, touch, taste, and smell—all shaped by memory.
THE GLOBAL VILLAGE
Th e World Wide Web allows ease of international 
communication, as our communication and design

CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
issues become a shared worldwide experience. Th e 
new media are vitally linked to the actualization of 
Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s concept 
of a global village. Th ese media are also linked to the 
establishment and redefi nition of cultural and personal 
identity.
Th e telephone, the microscope, and the telescope are 
examples of earlier technologies that extended the 
range of our senses. Now we can see inside storms and 
along chains of molecules. From book to photograph 
to computer disk, our means of storing and retrieving 
information has grown. New-media technologies rely 
strongly on visual communication, requiring users 
to be visually literate. Designers must be knowledge-
able about both the production and the consumption 
of images. Because media technologies are constantly 
evolving, we need to be prepared to renew our knowl-
edge base constantly throughout our careers.
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES
Th e Web-based medium is very diff erent from print, 
because it is nonlinear and interactive. DVDs can also 
be burned with nonlinear, interactive information, 
using programs such as Adobe Director (formerly 
Macromedia Director), a multimedia application 
authoring platform. Th e Web, however, is the still most 
powerful of the interactive media presentation modes.
When you type an address into a Web browser such 
as Internet Explorer or Safari, your computer sends a 
request over the Internet for a specifi c URL address. 
Th e fi le at that address is then downloaded over the

Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980)
Best known for the expressions “the medium 
is the message” and “global village,” Marshall 
McLuhan (1911–1980) continues to be an inﬂ uen-
tial media theorist today. He was born in Canada 
and earned his ﬁ rst BA and MA degrees at the 
University of Manitoba, going on to study at the 
University of Cambridge, England, where he be-
came interested in perception.
McLuhan began teaching at the University of To-
ronto campus in the early 1950s, where he stayed 
through 1979. In 1951 he published his ﬁ rst major 
work, The Mechanical Bride, an examination of 
the effect of advertising on society and culture. 
The McLuhan Program in Culture and Technol-
ogy started in 1963 as the Centre for Culture and 
Technology.
In 1961, McLuhan wrote The Gutenberg Galaxy: 
The Making of Typographic Man, in which he 
shows connections between communication 
technology and cognitive organization, which 
he believed in turn affects social organization.
McLuhan’s most widely known work, Understand-
ing Media: The Extensions of Man (1964), is a 
pioneering study in media theory. In it McLuhan 
proposed that “the medium is the message,” or 
the media themselves, not the content they carry, 
should be the focus of study.

the fi le. Th e URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the 
address entered to access a particular Web site. Th is 
URL consists of three parts:
  Protocol—http://
  Domain name—www.server.com
  Pathname—folder/fi lename.ext
Th e protocol is the communications language the URL 
uses. Th e domain name is the server where the desired 
fi le is located. Th e pathname is a particular fi le at a 
site. For example, http://www.davidmclimans.com/ 
takes you to a site for a portfolio (Figure 11–20a), and 
http://www.davidmclimans.com/1.htm takes you to a 
particular page at that site (Figure 11–20b).
Th ere are many similarities and diff erences between 
print-based and Web-based design. Let’s begin by 
examining the similarities and then look at the 
diff erences.
Common Methodology
  Begin any publication by defi ning the message and 
the audience.
  Familiarize yourself with the competition.
  Research and analyze the available resources.
  Organize the content. In Web design that means 
developing a fl ow chart or site map for content. 
Figure 11–21 shows a typical fl ow chart for a port-
folio site.
  Design the visuals, developing a look and feel tied by 
a common visual and conceptual theme.
  Produce the Web site or print piece.
Design Similarities
A book or magazine presents information in a se-  
quence of pages, as does a Web site. All pages should be 
tied together with a similar visual treatment, such as a 
uniform grid, a consistent choice of font, and alignment 
of typography. Consistency in placement and visual 
treatment of items such as page numbers or navigation 
bars and buttons is important. In addition, a successful 
publication, whether online or in print, typically uses a 
visual and conceptual theme to unite the pages.
Th e 20th century produced wonderful examples of 
print-based graphic design. Th e gestalt unit-forming 

206
CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
principles of visual perception form a basis for design 
of Web graphics as well as print media. Repetition and 
variation, rhythm, continuation, and fi gure/ground 
treatment are fundamental to the design of any publi-
cation. Although various cultures have devised unique 
design solutions using these visual components, all 
cultures deal with these visual foundations.
Production Similarities
A bottom-line production similarity between print 
publication and online publication is that when a Web 
site is mounted online or a print piece is sent to press, 
all elements must be prepared correctly in order to 
function properly.
Design Differences
A book or magazine presents linear information. Th e 
pages follow each other sequentially from front to 
back, and the structure of the information fl ow is one-
directional. Information on the Web is nonlinear and 
interactive.
Because the structure of Web site information fl ow 
tends to be complex, it should be diagrammed before 
the site is created. It is possible to get stuck out on 
a limb on a Web site, with no links back into the 
information fl ow, causing a viewer to end the session. 
A successful fl ow leaves the viewer only a click or two 
from the home page.
Time, motion, and sound are important components of 
Web design. All design communicates a message, but 
it may not have the desired eff ect if the designer lacks 
conceptual or production skills.
Production Differences
In terms of production, online publication diff ers from 
print publication in many ways. Th e dpi of image scans, 
availability of fonts, appropriateness of fi le formats and 
sizes, and color gamuts of RGB versus CMYK must all 
be learned anew for their application to Web graphics. 
Consider the ephemeral quality of the online environ-
ment, with the variable characteristics of its users and 
their equipment, versus the concrete reality of the 
printed page. Th is is an important diff erence. Down-
load time is also a crucial issue in Web design that 
does not exist in print graphics. What’s more, in Web 
graphics, naming conventions must be understood and 
carefully followed. Th e Web is a picky medium, and it 
is vital to understand its rules in order to reach an audi-
ence with the intended message.
WHAT ARE THE RULES?
Naming Your Files
Filenames use diff erent conventions and restrictions, 
depending on the operating system (Windows, Mac 
OS X, UNIX, and more). Because the server computer 
mounting your site may run an operating system dif-
ferent from yours, name your fi les so that they can be 
used on a variety of servers. Keep fi lenames simple, brief, 
and descriptive, followed by a three- or four-character 
extension. Do not use spaces or other special symbols; 
use only lowercase letters and numbers. For example, a 
Web page would have a .HTML extension. Name your 
fi rst page index.html and your image and GIF animation 
assets with recognizable names of no more than eight 
characters, followed by the extension .JPEG or .GIF. Th e 
chart in Figure 11–22 shows standard fi le extensions that 
signify diff erent fi le formats. Th is is an important topic, 
because if the fi le name won’t work, the Web site won’t 
work either. Web designer Chris Eichman comments, 
“I bang my head against a wall so many times because 
of these rules. I can’t get an image to load because of a 
capital letter or a typo, or space, or forgotten extension. 
Th ese rules are such a pain!”
Keep all fi les related to your site in one folder, with 
sections grouped together by either subfolders or nam-
ing conventions. Don’t scatter your links and high-res 
images in a variety of folders.
Ä
DIGITAL FOCUS
New Technology and New Visions
An integral member of the creative design partner-
ship is the tool itself. The precursors of today’s 
computers were number crunchers developed in 
the 1940s, during and after World War II. In the 
early 1950s scientists at MIT (the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology) developed a computer 
system that could show the position of a ﬂ ying 
aircraft as a moving dot on a vector display. This 
was a forerunner of computer graphics. Today 
computer-generated graphics are revolution-
izing the way we communicate with one another 
around the globe. New technology and new ways 
of seeing are inseparable. Research that led to the 
development of the Web dates back to the 1960s 
at MIT and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). 
In 1969 the DoD commissioned a research project 
aimed at linking the separate computer networks 
of the military contractors and universities per-
forming military research. This project led to the 
establishment of TCP/IP, the protocols now used 
to allow computers to communicate with each 
other throughout the Internet.

207
What Are the Rules?
File Formats
A fi le format tells a computer what kind of fi le it is 
dealing with. It is a particular way that information is 
encoded for storage. Th e GIF (Graphics Interchange 
Format) fi le format supports storage of both still images 
and simple animations. It is a lossless fi le format, which 
means that it compresses graphics without eliminating 
detail and is designed for 8-bit (256 colors or fewer) 
graphics. PNG (Portable Network Graphics), designed 
for transferring images on the Internet, is a lossless bit-
mapped image format. Not all browsers support PNGs 
(for example, Internet Explorer has problems with it), 
but one of their advantages is 256 levels of transparency. 
Th e QuickTime format, developed by Apple, can act as a 
container for many diff erent types of multimedia such as 
digital video, animation, and music.
Th e JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is 
designed to store still photographic images. JPEG is 
best used for gradations or photographic images for the 
Internet. It produces compressed fi le formats, produc-
ing graphics with reduced fi le sizes. It is a lossy fi le 
format, which removes data from an image when it 
compresses a fi le. Designed for displaying 24-bit true 
color, it can describe a photographic-like image with a 
small fi le and a fast download.
Th e Portable Document Format (PDF) is used to send 
2-D images that are independent of the soft ware, hard-
ware, and operating system.
Resolution
Prepare fi nal Web fi les at 72 dpi. Keep in mind, though, 
that the best results oft en come from scanning or 
otherwise preparing initial images at a higher resolu-
tion and reducing the fi le later. Keep an unfl attened 
high-resolution version of your image fi les, so you 
can go back and make all necessary changes on the 
original.
Print graphics at a resolution of 72 dpi look terrible. 
However, Web graphics are displayed on monitors. 
Most monitors display images at a resolution of about 
72 pixels per inch (ppi). Th e bigger the monitor is, the 
more pixels it can display onscreen, but a larger moni-
tor simply displays a larger image, not necessarily a 
higher-resolution image.
File Size
File size, measured in bytes, is the amount of disk space 
required to store a fi le. Th e larger the images, and the 
more complex and numerous the elements added to 
a page, the longer that page will take to view in the 
browser window.
Keep graphics as small and concise as possible to 
avoid long download times and frustrated users. 
Once a graphic is used, it is downloaded and can 
be reused without wasted time. Th ese graphics are 
cached in memory, eliminating the need to download 
them again. Flat, solid areas of color reduce a fi le’s 
11–22  Web site directories follow 
strict naming conventions.

208
CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
size considerably. Top-to-bottom gradations create a 
smaller fi le size than right-to-left  gradations.
Monitor Size
For the most conservative size, guaranteed to reach 
all users, keep important elements of text and graph-
ics of your Web page within a 920 x 600-pixel area, 
using the remaining area for background color or 
design. Many computers use a screen size of more 
than 1024 x 768 pixels. To get an approximate idea 
of how your file will look on various monitor resolu-
tions, on the Macintosh go to System Preferences 
found under the Finder’s Apple. Choose Displays 
to experiment with different screen resolutions 
and size, as shown in Figure 11-23a. In a Windows 
7 platform, as shown in Figure 11-23b, right click 
on the desktop, select [screen resolution]. Select 
the resolution you wish to use. Click on [OK] then 
choose [keep changes]. Repeat these steps to select 
another resolution.
If your monitor is 800 x 600 and you change its default 
display to 1024 x 768, you’ll have more pixels, but 
they’ll be smaller. A Web fi le you create to completely 
fi ll your 1024 x 768 screen will be too large to view on 
someone else’s 800 x 600 screen.
Color
Current versions of Photoshop let you save your fi le 
for the Web and present a pop-up window of choices 
to specify the format and color table. Figure 11–24 also 
shows JPEG options.
Convert all fi les for Web to RGB mode. To make a 
smaller fi le, changing an image from RGB to indexed 
color mode reduces an image’s color usage from RGB’s 
16.8 million colors. You can choose from a number of 
standard color palettes to save computing memory and 
fi le storage and to speed up data transfers. Th ese include 
the 216 Web-safe colors, the 256-color Mac and Win-
dows system palettes, or custom palettes.
When using indexed color mode, real-life images are 
represented with better fi delity to the original by using 
adaptive palettes. Both are accessible from Photoshop’s 
Image . Mode . Indexed color command menu. If the 
graphic contains both photographic imagery and some 
fl at color elements fi lled with Web-safe colors, choose an 
adaptive palette. It is made up of colors most appropriate 
for the particular image. Dithering is most noticeable in 
solid fl at-color areas. Dithering scatters diff erent colored 
pixels in an image to make it appear as though there are 
intermediate colors in images with a limited color palette.
WEB COMPONENTS
Pages and Sites
A Web site is composed of separate, linked pages. Th e 
site must be mounted on a server if it is to be viewed 
anywhere but from a disk.

Links
A link (also known as a hyperlink) is an active part of a 
document (Figure 11–25). Clicking a link can take you 
to another part of the same Web page, to other Web 
pages on your hard disk, or to a location on a remote 
computer. Every link contains the Web address for the 
page that the link refers to. Th is Web address is called 
the page’s URL.
Tables and Frames
Tables allow you to precisely align online layout ele-
ments into columns and rows. Th ey also keep data 
from jumping around when a window is resized. Th ink 
of tables as similar to the underlying grid that provides 
structure to a print publication design.
Frames are very diff erent from tables, although they 
look similar. A frame splits a Web page into sections. 
11–25 Graphic buttons that can be used as links are often 
created in Photoshop, then placed in Dreamweaver.

210
CHAPTER 11  Production for Print and Online Graphics
Typically one stationary frame on the left  side has 
links that call varying content into the frame on the 
right side. Each frame is actually a separate Web page. 
Frames are excellent devices for controlling the presen-
tation and fl ow of information.
Animation and Sound
GIF fi les can be used to create small animations. Free-
ware and shareware products are available for down-
load to allow creating and optimizing GIF animations. 
See Figure 11–26. Flash is the top program on the Web 
for generating sophisticated motion that downloads 
quickly, as well as for designing interactive sites. Inter-
activity means that something happens in response to a 
viewer action. For example, clicking an image or button 
can cause a sound fi le or animation to run. Th ere are 
many forms of interactivity on Web sites. Th e simplest 
one is a button link to another page.
Web Software
All Web sites are created with HTML (hypertext 
markup language). Designers do not necessarily need 
to know this language, but a little background is advis-
able. Many soft ware packages write the HTML for you 
invisibly. For example, Dreamweaver is an excellent 
professional design and production tool for the Web 
from Macromedia, although several other programs on 
the market also do a good job.
Web Publishing
A great variety of online services for Web publishing 
are available. Google Sites and many others off ers a 
free Web site. Like commercial television, free sites run 
advertisements to turn a profi t, so be prepared to have 
ads running along with your pages. Th ese services off er

mounting a site.

In Conclusion
Discussion Questions
1.   How is the computer a tool like any other 
throughout history? How does it present ways 
of seeing and shaping reality that makes it sig-
niﬁ cantly different from tools of the past?
2.   What are the constants we bring to the use of 
new technology?
3.   What is truly new about the new media that 
cannot be duplicated by any other media?
PROJECTS
Web Site Review
Choose a Web site to evaluate. Use the terms 
found throughout the chapter to identify elements. 
Refer to the list “Characteristics of Good Web Site 
Design” to help you in your evaluation. Refer to the 
“Critique” section for additional ideas.
Web Page Design
Refer to the methodology discussed earlier in this 
chapter to plan and design a small Web site of 
about six pages. These will be prepared as print 
pages. For your site’s topic, research and pre-
pare a short presentation on an artist or designer 
mentioned in this text. Gather and prepare several 
images for your topic. Prepare a sample ﬂ ow chart 
to show the instructor. Then construct the pages 
in Photoshop, writing a brief amount of copy to 
include. Be sure to design button icons intended 
to act as links between pages. Print these pages 
for presentation and critique, or show them online. 
During the class critique, discuss their intended 
navigational structure and overall design theme.
CRITIQUE
The critique of a print-based or Web-based design 
should center on issues speciﬁ c to the design 
medium. The critique should also consider the 
larger issues of medium and message and cultural 
impact.
  Consider the overall complexity of the site. How 
many elements such as JPEG ﬁ les, GIF ﬁ les, 
animations, and links are there?
  How complete is the research on the site’s 
topic?
  How successfully is the visual and conceptual 
theme communicated?
  Is there a clear logic to the navigational struc-
ture?
  Are the ﬁ les error free?
  How well does each image ﬁ t your viewing 
screen? Try accessing it using a different monitor 
resolution and a different browser platform.
IN CONCLUSION
This chapter presented an introduction to the 
historical development and basic structure of 
computer graphics. Year by year, the technical data 
concerning production of print and online graphics 
will change, but the fundamentals of design will 
stay relevant. Education is a lifelong process—
especially now, as changes continue to challenge 
our understanding of the world and how we func-
tion in it.
