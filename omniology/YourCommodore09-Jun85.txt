NO, II'S NOT THE YOUR COMMODORE
bumper summer annual, even though our
cover might mislead you into thinking so.
But, with those hot and heady summer
days approaching, we hope to show what
fun computers can be.
This is a period which has seen the
reappearance of the Commodore name
in the business market. The 16-bit PC (the
PC10 or PC20, depending on whether you
opt for a ﬂoppy or hard disc version) has
been knocking around for a while now
and Commodore's darling of the Las
Vegas CES show in January, the C128, is
due for release pretty shortly. With a
machine which is compatible with the 64
and also capable of running under CP/M,
Commodore must feel they've got a
certain hit on their hands. We'll have to
wait and see. In the meantime, read our
sneak preview and judge for yourself.
But, for all you pleasure-seeking
readers who can't turn your minds to such
serious things at this time of year, we're
offering welcome release from the daily
grind. With our jolly June competition,
we hope to get you in the mood for the
holiday season.
Computer camps are deﬁnitely in
vogue. Two which include tuition on
Commodore computers in their curricula
are Camp Beaumont and Ardmore
Adventure. Both incorporate a couple of
hours computing a  day with sport
and creative activities such as drama,
video-ﬁlm making and arts and crafts.
These camps are geared to the under 17
year olds but Ardmore do offer weekend
or week breaks at Crest Hotels in the
Thames Valley, where special courses are
offered in computing. Children can stay
here with their parents free of charge.
But, these courses can set you back
anything from (128 to 088 for a week,
depending on where you go. Thank
goodness then, that such warm-hearted
and generous souls preside at Ardmore
Adventure Ltd. They have offered Your
Commodore a free week-long residential
holiday at one of their computer camps.
And because there was so much gnashing
of teeth, shedding of tears and general
anarchy i n  t h e  hallow ed Y o u r
Commodore ofﬁces over who was
going to take it, and, basically, because
we're all well over the age of 16 anyway
(even though people tell us we look years
younger...), we're giving away o u r
holiday to the lucky Your Commodore
reader who wins ﬁrst prize in our 'holiday
of a lifetime'  competition! Now, there's a
chance you shouldn't miss!
At long last, we've endeavoured to
cheer u p  those readers who, having
acquired a  spanking n e w  C 16 a t
Christmas, were beginning to think they
had a white elephant on their hands.
These readers include N. Clayola from
Malta who complains, "I have noticed
that most games listings are for the
Commodore 64 or VIC 20. Why not some
for the Plus/4?" (which is, of course,
compatible with the C16), and Mr. A.
Beales who asks of the C16, "Is it extinct
before it is born?". Well, not only are we
treating C16 games freaks to a bevy of
software reviews but, for those of you
who wish to put your new machine to
more constructive use, we've provided
your very own assembler to type in.
When w e  advertised i n  Yo u r
Commodore for reviewers, w e were
inundated with requests. So many, in fact,
that hundreds o f  yo u  w e re  l ef t
disappointed as software houses aren't
proliﬁc enough and our magazine isn't
large enough to provide enough fodder
to keep you all happy every month. But,
we're offering a new glimmer of hope to
those of you who missed out the ﬁrst time
around. From September, we will offer a
prize to the reader who submits the best
review of the month, whether favourable
or disfavourable, of their latest software
purchase. So, get writing!
The time has also come for you to
show o f f  your high scores. Arcade
supremo, Phil South, might imagine that
nobody is faster than him on the joystick-
draw, but I'm sure that many of you can
deﬂate his ego. Send in your high scores
(witnessed, please)... and, anyone
boasting a ridiculously high score will be
lured into the labyrinthine lodgings of
Your Commodore to prove their case. Be
warned!
And ﬁnally, let's end on a note of utter
confusion and silliness with confusion
reigning o ver t h e release date o f
Incentive's game, Confuzion, which they
now assure us, is in its ﬁnal stages and will
be up for grabs at the end of May, and the

Commodore attack business market
THE LAUNCH OF COMMODORE'S NEW
IBM compatible 16-bit PC at the end of
March marked Commodore's  n e w
offensive on the business market. At a
press conference to launch the machine,
David Gerrard, t h e  U K  mark eting
manager, presented Commodor e's
reasons behind launching the new PC
while Paul Welch, the UK sales manager,
outlined t h e  P C  and Commodore's
support package.
The PC is available in two models -the
PC 10 ﬂoppy-disc version and the PC 20
hard-disc v ers ion. T hey  a r e  v er y
competitively pric ed: i1675 f o r  t h e
ﬂoppy-disc machine (this is 25% cheaper
than the IBM PC) and f2795 for the hard-
disc version (cheaper than any other
hard-disc PC). The PC 10 has twin 360K
ﬂoppy-disc drives and ﬁve expansion slots
and the PC 20 one 360K ﬂoppy-disc drive,
one 10Mby te hard-dis c  a n d  f o u r
expansion slots for IBM-type boards. They
also feature an optional Intel 8087 ﬂoating

David Gerrard believes that, with
120,000 users of Commodore business
computers in Great Britain, that there are
more Commodore micros installed in
British c ompanies  t h a n any  o t h e r
machine. With the new PC, Commodore
hope to maintain and strengthen this hold
on the British business market.
A carefully planned marketing policy
has been developed to promote the PC.
Commodore intend to provide effective
support and back-up to both dealers and
users. They have set up a specialised
business sytems management team which
will operate nationally and internationally.
They hope to increase the number of
dealers having access to the new PC by
establishing a distributor network. This
network will comprise ﬁve distributors -
Norbain Mic r o Ltd., Northamber PLC,
Pete & Pam Micro Distributors Ltd., S.T.C.
Electronic Services a n d  Wes twood
Distributors Ltd. Their dealer support
scheme als o inc ludes a  three-year
warranty scheme, a leasing deal, ﬁnancial
back-up and a Commodore hotline.
The response f r o m  dealers has
certainly been very positive. At the time of
the launch there were already 3 months of
advance orders.
Says Paul Welch, "The PC 10 and PC 20
represent exceptional value for money as
they stand -  with the comprehensive
support package we have built around
the machines, we believe they offer an
unbeatable deal".

WELL, MACBETH A N D  THE HOBBIT
have been immortalised as computer
games so why shouldn't slick stories of
espionage f ollow  s uit? Hutchinson
Computer Publishing have released their
ﬁrst computer game. The Fourth Protocol
- The Game, based on Frederick Forsyth's
novel. Hutchinson also plan to release
games based on the Lone Wolf series by
Joe Dever and Garry Chalk: Flight from
the Dark, Fire in the Water and Lone Wolf
and the Ice Halls of Terror. A game based
in Len Deighton's Blitskreig is planned for
release in the Autumn.
The game is only very roughly based
on the book. As M15 investigator, John
Preston, y our aim is  t o  uncover the
plot behind Russia's Plan Aurora and
prevent breaching of the Fourth Protocol,
If you fail, a nuclear bomb will explode.
There are three parts to the game_ In
the ﬁrst, you are using MI5's central
communications computer, CenCom,
and you're surrounded by various pieces
of equipment such as a ﬁling cabinet,
telephone and calendar, all which play an
important role in the game. There are 12
interacting plots going on at once. Some
are red herrings, others are crucial and
lead to the bomb. You are given 40days to
solve the plot - 1 hour 20 minutes in real
time.
The second part is  more straight-
forward_ You'll travel around a limited
London underground system in search of
the bomb and also visit Dover and Bristol.
There are over 200 locations in all, Once
again there are red herrings. When you
have found the bomb, you get a code to
load the ﬁnal part of the game.
The ﬁnal part is arcade action. Having
found the bomb in a derelict building,
you must kill the KGB agents to prevent
them halting your efforts to defuse the
bomb. Once you enter the building, it's a
race against time before you either save
the world, if all goes according to plan, or
nuke yourself, if it doesn't.
The Fourth Protocol retails at f  12.95
(tape) and £15.95 (disc).

IT LOOKS AS IF THE C128 WON'T BE
suffering the same fate as the 16 and
Plus/4 machines -  le, lack of available
software when the machine is released.
Naturally, this is largely due to the fact that
the machine is 64 compatible so existing
64 software can be enhanced to take full
advantage of the 128's extra power.
Audiogenic certainly don't intend to
be left behind in the software race. They

A view to kill
SPECIAL AGENT 007 IS TO BE IMMORT-
alised as a computer game. Domark, the
force b e h in d Eur ek a!, b e a t  s t if f
competition t o  acquire the rights t o
market the computer game version of the
forthcoming James Bond movie, A View
To A Kill.
They were aided i n  their bid for
the game rights by the game's designers,
Chris Palmer and Dave Bishop of Tigress
Marketing. Having been approached by
Domark with a view to designing the
game, Chris and Dave visited Pinewood
studios, studied the scripts and story
boards and designed an outline of the
program. "The people at Pinewood were
knocked out", said Chris. It was certainly
no easy task, Chris continued, "We had a
very ﬁnite story from which we had to
design a game. With a James Bond ﬁlm,
you always know he's going to live. We
had to design a game which maintained
the Bond ethos but was still feasible as a
game". They claim that a lot of the Bond
touches are there, such as the humour
element.
Once Domark had acquired the rights,.
Tigress spent 2  weeks compiling the
speciﬁcations for the game. They were
determined to get it  working in their
heads before going near a programmer.
They worked v ery  closely w it h t h e
programming house, Soltstone, who are
also converting Ultimate's Underwurlde
to the Commodore 64.
The game's launch is timed to coincide
with the release o f  the ﬁlm at the
beginning of June. It is based around
three of the ﬁlm's action sequences. It is a
multiload game c ompr is ing t h r e e
modules each of which form a totally
separate game.
A view to kill starts in true James Bond
fashion with the silhouetted Bond ﬁgure
posing w i t h  h i s  g u n  t o  t h e
accompaniment o f  Bond music and
animated credits. It also features a version
of Duran Duran's title song from the
movie.
The ﬁrst module takes place in Paris
where baddie, Mayday, has  k illed
someone in a restaurant. Bond pursues
her to the Eiffel Tower where she jumps
off with the aid of a parachute. You., as
Bond, drive around the streets of Paris in a
taxi in an attempt to reach her landing
spot before she does. You are hampered
by the one way system: if you go up a
street the wrong way you are hassled by
the police. If you fail to reach her, the
game transforms into a car chase as you
pursue her around the streets of Paris. The
screen is divided into two views: a very
impressive 3-0 view from the taxi as you
whizz (or cruise) past buildings or a plan
view which scrolls over a map of Paris.
Speed limits are imposed and the time
and day (the whole game is played in real
time) are displayed. I saw this part in its
early stages, but was still very impressed.
impressed.
The second part sees our hero, this
time w it h  glamour g ir l accomplice,
Stacey, in the City Hall. They have been
captured and held there by  the evil,
Aryan-type villain of the piece, Zorin.
Having shot t he dignitary, also held
in the hall, Zorin forces Bond and Stacey
into a lift over which he throws a bottle
of ﬂaming bacardi. With t he aid o f
various gadgets, Stacey is recued. You
can then use Stacey to help you rescue

Explosions in the mine cause ﬂooding and

again, the duck-shoot mechanism is used
to acquire various objects to assist her in
her task. Bond has the option to defuse
the detonator or remove it before time
runs out.
Since the game is played in real time, if
you complete the ﬁrst or second game
under the allotted time, you have longer
to complete the subsequent game.
Although artistic licence has been
used here and there, the game apparently
sticks very closely to the ﬁlm. Not having
seen the ﬁlm or the game in full, I cannot
conﬁrm this. But I  was certainly very
excited by  what I  heard and by  the
snippets I saw. I'm anxiously waiting to see

success in the USA.

MANY GAMES THAT USE A BOARD Div-
ided into squares and 'men' that are not
all of the same shape, are compared to the
game of chess. The thought of a game that
has stood the test of playing over many
hundreds of years, being compared with
these upstart 'computer games' is in many
cases quite odious. On the other hand
Archon does  hav e rather a  l o t  t o
recommend it!
Like chess, it may be enjoyed by the
novice, even though the player may not
fully understand t h e  strategy behind
either his, or his opponent's moves for,
hidden within this game, are several levels
of player/game awareness.
Archon is played on a 'board' with
nine squares to a side. As in chess, the two
opposing sides start t h e  game b y
occupying the two rows of squares on
opposite sides o f  the 'board'. Unlike
chess, the two sides have different pieces
that have different attributes! Also, unlike
chess, w h e n  o n e  piec e challenges
another, the display changes to a separate
'battle-screen  where the two ﬁght it out
in arcade style combat. You may play
(using joystick) either a human opponent
or against the computer.
14 E a c h  side has a 'Magic User' that has
the power to cast spells in addition to
having what may be considered to be
S o f t w a r e  r e v i e w
normal ﬁghting abilities f o r  Archon,
that is..
Characters each have a  maximum
number of squares on which that they
may move. Some move on the ground
and may not pass through other pieces,
some have the ability to ﬂy over creatures
that are in their way.
The two sides represent the opposing
forces o f  'light' and 'dark', with the
'board' divided into not only white and
black squares but also a  number o f
squares that change colour as the game
progresses. The colour of a square that a
creature occupies affects its  combat
potential -  with a 'light' creature being
more difﬁcult t o  defeat o n a  lighter
coloured square.
Each side has eight different creatures
and each of these has combat character-
istics that can affect the game strategy.
Knights and Goblins, the 'pawns' of the
'light' and 'dark' respectively, can only
ﬁght at close quarters. They can 'hammer
away' w it h  their  swords and c lubs
incessantly without apparently taking a
breath b u t  their lifespan is short and
they can inﬂict only  relatively minor
damage.
A Dragon lives longer, throws its ﬁrey
breath at a distance and inﬂicts great
damage, but needs time to 'stoke up'
before it can deliver another ﬁre bolt!
Unicorns can throw energy bolts at a fairly
rapid rate and move quickly but only have
an average lifespan. Trolls and Golems are
slow but powerful and can take more
punishment.
Other creatures include Banshees,
Valkyries, Archers, Djinni, Basilisks,
Manticores a Phoenix and a Shapeshifter,
the latter mimicking the attributes of its
enemy! ne a 'Grand Master' at this game.
Finally, we come to the Magic Users -
the Wizard (light) and t he Sorceress
(dark). They both have seven spells which
may only be used once. These include
ﬁghting an enemy by  summoning an
Elemental, imprison an opposing piece.

healing wounds , resurrect a  dead
creature or reversing the ﬂow of time.
This last spell enables them to manipulate
the cycle o f  the changing coloured
squares to their advantage.
Five of the squares on the strategy
board are deﬁned as 'power points'; he
who occupies all ﬁve wins - you also win
if you eliminate all your opponents.
This is an enjoyable game at whatever
level it is played -  either as a 'bull in the
china shop' thump-up or  as a deeper
strategic exercise. It is no surprise that this
is a very popular game in the USA, or that
there is already a sequel -  Archon II -

A Remarkable Innovation in Video Graphics
Until now, creating computer graphics in colour has been both a
demanding and expensive endeavor. The Super Sketch Graphics
Tablet provides a totally unique and simple medium for creating
video graphics at a surprisingly low cost
By simply moving the stylus control arm, as you would a pencil,
Super Sketch reproduces the movement on the video screen. Four
control buttons at the top of the tablet assist in operating the graphic
functions of the software. Graphics may be created by "free hand"
or by "tracing" from drawings clipped to the pad.
Compared with other computer graphic products, it is much easier
to use than keyboard controls, does more than joysticks, paddle con-
trollers and mouse controllers, and is less expensive than touch pad
products.
A brief demonstration instantly proves the remarkable features of
Super Sketch. This product makes an excellent "Demo Display" in
retail stores because anyone can immediately produce graphics with
little or no instructions.

adventures but he also
has a couple of
graphic adventures
tucked up his sleeve.
Read what he has to
say about them.
In this case MP could well stand for
Machine Programmer. What prompts this
call to arms (they do you know...), is the
back cover of a highly recommended
book published by Compute! Books -
Computers Guide to Adventure Games'
by Gary McGath. There for all to read is a
phrase that I endorse completely. 'Words
Worth a Thousand Pictures'. This state-
ment is then ampliﬁed to make the case
for the 'text only' adventure. I can only
applaud such a sentiment from such a
respected source!
I am not opposed to an adventure
having graphics — far from it; some
paragraphs further down you will read of
two such adventures that have given me a
great deal of pleasure. But, in this world of
'ﬁnancial return', it is all too clear that the
sales of a computer game have to be high
for a software house to stay in business.
For those sales to reach large enough
quantities, a game often has to be 'hyped'
beyond its true worth! It is easier to
promote ('hype') pictures than it is words.
It is also easier for a salesman (or whatever
the up-market classiﬁcation may be!) to
quickly demonstrate a game's graphics,
than it is to have a potential buyer of
thousands of tapes, read a few 'pages' of
descriptive text especially when that
buyer may not have an afﬁnity for
'sparkling underground caverns' or 'a
curious planet on the outer reaches of the
known galaxy'. All I ask, and hope some of
you too will ask, is that the evocative
wonder of the written word be not
entirely ignored.
End of 'cry from heart', back to
Computers book. If any of you have had
the opportunity to study any publications
from this source, you will already know
that their standard is high. The price in this
country is not cheap but I have never had
the feeling that I wished I had saved my
money!

But, one transformation will not be
enough! There are even hints that up to
thrice times ten changes may be
necessary. Don't ask me to verify this —
I've only just manage to progress from an
ape!
'The Witch's Cauldron' uses a 'rapid
load' system (Hyperload), so loading time
is cut to just about ﬁve minutes. You start
your search for the means to change
shape in the Witch's Parlour. On screen
you will see various items or furniture and
— sitting quietly somewhere — a cute
green toad!
The initial action takes place in this
mind they clearly show what is necessary
to sustain interest whilst leaving your
imagination to supply the rest. Pictures
are 'drawn' by 'blocks' to the screen and
so appear very rapidly.
Fortunately, you may SAVE your
character and position within the game.
This is carried out at 'Hyperspeed' so may
be repeated often with hardly any loss of
playing time.
The ﬁrst two transformations are not
difﬁcult — once you begin to get a feel for
the program. Once past these you will
encounter the largest 'maze' you would

Level Nine Computing are in an enviable
position with their followers just waiting
for the next offering to 'snap up' as it
appears. Such is  the  well earned
reputation of one of our top adventure
software houses.
'Emerald Isle' has, at long last, arrived.
It follows Level Nine's latest pattern of
text and graphics as has been seen in
'Return to Eden'.
Here the graphics drawing routines
appear to have been speeded up slightly
but as they use a 'draw and ﬁll' technique,
there is a slight but noticeable pause
whilst they are 'drawn'. The time varies
depending upon the complexity of the
picture but is usually only between ﬁve
and ten seconds.
The program uses a fast loading system
and takes only 2

and game position; this takes about 40
seconds, which is not long to wait for the
knowledge that you have a secure base to
return to — should something go ammis•
'Emerald Isle' returns to the basic
theme of some of their earlier adventures,
where the aim is to collect 'treasures'
rather than have a ﬁnite purpose such as
in 'Erik the Viking' or 'Snowball'. The
scene is set — surprise, surprise — on an
island. You have just arrived by parachute
and are swinging gently by its cords high
up in the trees.
The parachute came as a surprise since
I had expected a more medieval plot,
perhaps even within the realms of Irish
mythology. I had even swatted up on this
mythos jus t  in case! Oh well, perhaps
next time.
The plot thickens when you ﬁnd
yourself in an aerial, wooden city, built up
at tree-top level. There are plenty of
locations for the newcomer to 'Emerald
Isle' to explore. Lots of potentially useful
items to collect and also a selection of
Level Nine's oddball puzzles to solve.
Two rather nice posters come with
each game. Before you stick these up on
your wall, look on the reverse of the one
showing 'Emerald Isle': Here be the
instructions. These are fairly rudimentary
compared with some of Level Nine's
previous games but are probably all that is
needed.

There is also a map of the island on the
back of the poster. This may not be
completely accurate • , at least one of the
locations shown does not appear to exist,
but at least it gives you some idea of what
you have yet to see!
Your aim is to collect all the treasures
that may be found on the islaod. There are
twenty of these to ferret out and you have
to determine what is or is not a 'treasure'!
But, take heart; most will be obvious once
you have found them and anyway you can
always check by keeping a close watch on
your score.
This game is not too complex, but
has some 200 locations and about 240
pictures! The CBM 64 version still has that
range of descriptive text that has become
the hallmark of all Level Nine's adventure
games.
Make n o  mistake, this game in
common with previous offerings from the
same source, is intended to keep you
guessing for days if not weeks! It is a
'seeking' game that should appeal to most
grades of adventurer. It is also a 'kindly'
game - if you die along the way, all is not
completely lost, you will be resurrected to
try again.
Yet another cave
Most present day adventurer's will
probably be fed up with hearing about
the grandfather of adventure games -
'Adventure' -  also known as 'Colossal
Cave', Variants of this game have been
produced for almost every micro.
The CBM 64 has had two for some
time, one by Level Nine and the other by
Melbourne House -  both respected
purveyors of good software. To these
must now be added a third. This time from
Ducksoft, the software arm of Duckworth
- publishers of a number of computing
books.
It is somewhat surprising that a
software house should pin its hopes on
such a revival when two versions are
already on the market. Having said that. I

would still recommend that all adventure
players have at least one version of this
undoubted classic in their collection.
So what is  this 'Colossal Cave
Adventure' like? It is said to be the
original Crowther a nd Williams
mainframe version. There are presumably
different 'original' versions because my
treasured map of 'Adventure' does not
help in this game's mazes!
This implementation has been
programmed by  Peter Gerrard, well
known for his books on the CBM 64. It
uses n o  rapid loa d system a nd
consequently takes rather a long time to
load - about 141/2' minutes. After 3 minutes
you are asked if you want instructions.
These are presented in a ﬁne gothic (?)
script, a little difﬁcult to read but they
look great!
These 'on screen' instructions tell you
very little but do follow the original
pattern. One point to watch is that the
command analyser does not accept
complex sentences and consequently to
travel north-east, you must use the
shortened form NE or otherwise the
program will look on NORTH-EAST as
NORTH.
One interesting aspect of this input
routine is the facility (sometimes) to travel
to a location by simply typing in your
chosen destination. Hence, if you are
above ground and not lost in the woods
you can travel directly to the well-house
by just typing BUILDING.
Once the main program has loaded
you return to the normal CBM script - so
there i s  n o w  n o  excuse f o r
misunderstanding the text! The choice of
colours loth for text and background
make this version easy to read and
understand.
That about sums up this game's good
points. Its bad points are so bad that I feel
that you would be wise to purchase one of
the other two CBM 64 versions! There is
no SAVE facility that I can ﬁnd and on a
game such as this has got to be a major
drawback.

If you feel that things have got beyond
your control DO NOT type in QUIT,
hoping to start again: with no warning or
request for conﬁrmation the program is
NEWed and you will have to wait a further
14+ minutes for it to load back in!
Likewise, if your lamp runs out, you are
told your score and the program returns
you t o the Commodore 'cold start'
screen. Having had this sort of thing
happen a couple of times, I'm afraid I lost
patience and mentally chucted this
program in the bin! Both Duckworth and
Peter Gerrard in particular should know
better; what a disappointment.

With this assembler
from Joe Nicholson,
you can, at last, put
your C16 to serious use.
AN ASSEMBLER I S  T H E
machine code programmer's
most important utility, as it
converts assembly language
instructions i n t o  mac hine
code, t he microprocessor's
own language. The C16 has an
excellent built- in monitor
including a  s imple ' l i n e '
assembler. However, as this
assembler does not store text in
memory there is n o way of
editing the instructions. Also, it
lacks labels which are very
useful i n  br anc hing a n d
structured programming. I n
practice, a line assembler is
tedious to use for all but short
machine code routines and, as
a machine code programmer
myself, I urgently needed an
assembler for  the C16, so I
decided to write my own.
This article describes a two-
pass assembler which has the
ability t o  handle labels and
relative jumps. I t  c an als o
produce machine code to run
from a  differ ent s tar ting
address —  us eful i f  t h e
assembler occupies a region of
memory y ou wish t o use in
your program. Note that data
and addresses can be entered
directly in decimal, or in HEX if
preceeded by a $ sign. For a
detailed description of the 6502
instruction set the reader is

This allows a series of data bytes

has reached the last line of the
assembly program and must be
the last line of the text. It may
also be placed inside a program
to stop assembly at a  given
point (useful for testing code).
Informs the assembler that all
characters following o n  this
line are not to be assembled.
Similar t o  t h e  BASIC REM
statement.
The colon precedes all labels.
The assembler can handle up to
100 two byte labels.
This allows you to deﬁne labels
as constants, eg. to set the label
ab to 320, type ":A13=320".
Relative jump —  on a  line
containing a relative jump, the
label o f  the address t o  b e
jumped TO must be preceeded
by an R.

referred to one of the standard
works on the subject such as
'Programming t h e  6502' b y
Rodnay Zaks, or the 'Mastering
Machine Code' series in this
magazine.
Directives.
There a r e  a  n u m b e r  o f
directives which the assembler
recognises in addition to the
6502 nmemonics. These are set
out in Figure 1.
Writing Text
The text is  stored in  DATA
statements as this has several
advantages, i.e. text is not lost
when editing the instructions
and there is no need for a
separate line editor making the
assembler program shorter —
an important consideration
when writing for the C16. Text
is s tored f r o m l i n e  10000
onwards. To simplify entering
text lines, two keys have been
redeﬁned:
F2 p r in t s  D A T A "  w h i c h
combined with the use of the
AUTO c o m m a n d  gr eat ly
facilitates text entry.
F3 lists the assembler text area.
Assembler's o w n
 commands
There are several commands
recognised by  the assembler
which c an b e  used t o  get
professional listings, p r in t
symbol tables etc.
A or ASSEMBLE
An obvious o n e  this ! T he
assembler prints the pass it is
on and does it's best to convert
your instructions into machine
code. If there is an error in the
list, eg, LABEL NOT FOUND or
RELATIVE J UMP O U T  O F
RANGE, it will print the error
and the line number where the
error w as  s potted. Wh e n
assembly i s  c omplete t h e
computer will display>X3K and
a ﬂashing cursor,
L or LIST
When this command is used it
prints START:? Enter the line
number you want the listing to
start from and press-RETURN.
The program will list until it
reaches an END instruction or
until you press any key.
-  Turn on printer.
All output in the program is
directed to the Commodore-
1520 printer-plotter. O utput
can b e  directed t o  other
printers by changing the OPEN
command in  line 2000 from
channel 6  t o  t h e  required
channel.
PO - turn off printer.
All output returns t o  t h e
screen.
5 or SYMBOL
Used after assembling — prints
a table of all the labels and their
addresses.
Q Q u i t  assembler.
Saving and loading text is done
by the normal SAVE and LOAD
commands in BASIC. To save
code use the Sand L commands
inside t h e  mac hine c ode
monitor which can be entered
by typing MONITOR o r  M
(shift 0).
Description o f  BASIC
program.
The program occupies about
3300 bytes. When entering
some of the longer lines it is
necessary to use abbreviated
commands, such as  ' ? '  f o r
PRINT, to avoid exceeding the
line length limit of the screen
editor. The main functions of
the assembler program are as
follows:
1
=

E2
Line 10
lump to initialise.
Lines 100-140
Read a  number /label i n
dec/hex.
Lines 200-250
Find next instruction and sort
into oper ation (CS) a n d
operand ( i3) . Find the line
number 'DATA' is on (H).
Lines 400-430
'BYT' instruction execution
loop. Read numbers from list
one a t  a  t im e  and POKE
numbers into memory. Signify
'BYT ERROR' if syntax error in
number list.
Lines 500-580
Find addressing m o d e  o f
instruction. K wil equal: 1 for
implied addressing, 2  f o r
immediate addressing, 3  for
accumulator addressing, 4 for
indirect addressing (only used
in the IMP instruction), 5 zero
page indirect X addressing, 6
zero p a g e  i n d i r e c t  Y
addressing, 7 absolute indirect
X addressing, 8  abs olute
indirect Y addressing, 9 relative
addressing, 1 0  (indirect), Y
addressing, 11 (indirect,X)
addressing, 1 2  z er o page
addressing and 13 for absolute
addressing.
Lines 800-860
Read number. If it is a label,
ﬁnd the label. If the label does
not exist print 'LABEL NOT
FOUND' and treat number as a
O.
Line 900
Deﬁne variables used in the
program and the user deﬁned
keys, le;
LS -  the names of the labels.
L% -  the addresses o f  the
I abels.
Key 2 is deﬁned as DATA".
Key 3 is deﬁned as LIST10000-.
Lines 1000-1010
Input command. Exit if  Q  is
inputted.
User commands:
Line 2000# Turn o n  printer.
Line 2040 #Turn off printer.
Lines 2070# LIST.
Line 2080#SYMBOL.
Line 2100# ASSEMBLE.
Lines 2700-2780
LIST command routine —
Disable 'GETAV if printer being
used.
Lines 5000-5110
First pass control,
Lines 5500-5530
Second pass control.
Lines 7000-7020
Deﬁne a label.
Handle directives:
Line 8000 'O RG '
Line 8010 ' ; '
Line 8020 'TRU'
Line 81130 'TEX'
Line 8150 'BYT'
Lines 9000-9240
Find command w ith appro-
priate addressing mo d e  i n
table.
Line 9300
'POKE'
memory.
c ommand i n t o
Lines 9370-9480
Process data bytes (if any) for
addressing.
Lines 9500-9690
Command table. This must
have the line number speciﬁed
as there is an increment of 10
for each letter of the alphabet
starting from 9000.
Line 9999
An essential dummy line.
Line 63000
An automatic end instruction.
Example.
Here is a demo program. If you
haven't done so already, RUN
the assembler and then Quit to
deﬁne the function keys. Press
'F2' between the line numbers
and the instructions, le line
10000 should look  lik e this:
10000 DATA";ZOOM
Use the 'AUTO 10' command
from line 10000 onwards. It is
assumed t h a t  l i n e  63000
contains 'DATA"END'.
Remember t o  SAVE t h e
assembler befor e executing
this demo program (it may not
work!). To run the demo quit
the as s embler  a n d  t y p e
'SYS1536'. You should hear a
ZOOM sound. I f  you don't,
check the text and assemble
again. I f  it still doesn't work
there could be a mistake in the
main assembler program (or
you could have forgotten to
turn up the volume control on
the TV sett).
To change the sound to one
resembling a rocket taking off,
alter line 10120 to: DATE"LDA
#4F and re-assemble. I f  you
can't s ee w hy  this  routine
works, d o n ' t  worry , I  a m
planning some articles on the
internal workings of the C16.

Phil South does a spot of
hero-worshipping while
ambling through the LET
SO, THERE I WAS, AT THE LET '85 SHOW,
with a sharp pencil, and the gleaming
whiteness of the ﬁrst page of my new
reporter's pad blinding me and a few
innocent passers-by. I  was there to
interview David Pitfall and Ghost-
busters' Crane. I  was late, though,
and had to come bark much later to get
my interview.
Blast! I had a stinking cold, and now I
had to spend all day at this lousy show. I
decided to stroll around a bit and look at
what was on display. Nothing much, I
guessed.
Flippin' heck! The place was teaming
with-celebrities; Kevin Toms of Football
Manager fame brushed past me, on his
way to the well stocked bar I suspected,
judging by the way his tongue was
dragging on the ﬂoor. Then I bumped
into some guy with long hair and a beard,
busily restarting a computer that had just
crashed. I was about to say "Oi, hippy,
get yer 'air cut" in mimicry of my arcade
hero Jeff Minter on the title page of
Psychedelia, when I realised... this WAS
Jeff Minter.
"Excuse me," I  said boldly but
unoriginally, "Are you Jeff Minter?"
"I have that dubious privilege, yes" he
said. The conversation thus begun. I
wasted no time in praising his many games
and the  unclassiﬁable Psychedelia.
Then h e  took m e  over t o  a
Commodore 64, on which was running his
new game, Mama Llama, featuring his
new favourite character, Rory the Savage
Guineapig. "Mama Llama is a sort of
crazed, freeform videogame," he
explained, "not really like anything I've
done before. It features many different
planets, different gravities, and all the
characters have inertia m o r e  realistic
like that!" H e  went on further t o
demonstrate the method of entering the
game at any level, a sort of grid affair, and
gave me a quick demo of Rory's part in the
game. "I'm going to give Rory a game of
his own next, I think. He's been the baddy
for a while now, and I reckon he deserves

Where did Rory come from? "Oh,
someone wrote in to me and said could
their guineapig be in my next game. I
thought. Rory the guineapig... hmm,
doesn't sound very menacing. But Rory

Games worth a mention from the LET
show are: Gryphon (Quicksilva), a fast,
graphically superior cartoon/arcade
game; Master of the Lamps (Activision) a
marvellous 3D jape of Aladdinesque
codebusting; Dropzone (US Gold) a neat
JetpaciDefender combo and Sorcery
(Virgin) a sort of arcade/adventure, with
a sort o f  arcade/adventure, with
startlingly good graphics, more of a
cartoon really.
Question time
Somebody asked me where I got the
name Flippo. Simple! It's a strangulation
Philip, which I use on the hi-score tables
of arcade machines I visit. Look out for
me.
The only hi-score I can present you
with this month is my current for CBS'
fantastic Impossible Mission - 2500. About
an hour and three quarters went into that,
so I think you owe it to me to try and
better it!
That's all for  now: this is the
everzapping Flippo, signing off.

Dave Crisp gets to grips with
a couple of numeric keypads
and some new joysticks.
NUMERIC KEYPADS ARE A BOON TO
anyone who enters a lot of numeric data
into their computer, whether for business
or programming. Many larger computers
and some of the Japanese machines have
them as standard but 64 users will have to
buy them as add-ons. We look at two of
the numeric keypads available.
Vollmace
This keypad consists of 16 keys; 0-9 are
marked with the remainder left blank.
This is so each key can be programmed to
make it possible to customise the pad
according to which piece of software you
are using. This is done via a machine code
routine which requires loading each time
you use it. You may get conﬂict between
the code used by the program and the
code within y our software. Although
there is little t o be done about this,
problems are rare. The software provided
for customising the keypad is easy to use
and will save a small routine to tape or
disc; this can then be loaded from within
your home written programs.
The actual keypad plugs into the two
joystick ports. The programmable keys
were very useful; with a little thought, a
lot of time and keypresses could be saved
to access things like the $ sign. This made
loading directories, etc, faster.
This is a very useful add-on. It's a
shame that you need to load software to
use it each time but that's the price you
pay for versatility.
Commercial Products
This is not a programmable pad but it does
have other advantages. The keys provided
are 1 to 9 and .(full stop). A RETURN key
would have been nice, but one can't have
everything.
It is much smaller than the Voltmace
product and looks practical rather than
pretty. If it had only been about %" less
deep, it would have ﬁtted into the storage
slot of my SX-64. The keys are very nice
and are sculptured. A ribbon connector
trails from the top. This looks a little
delicate; the pad would look better and
stronger if multi-core cable was used.
This pad scores points ov er t h e
Voltmace through being a  hardwired
connection i n t o  t h e  machine. T he
original keyboard connector piggy-backs
onto the plug provided. This requires
opening the machine and identifying the
PUSH ME,
PULL ME
Commert ial Products keypad (in front) and (behind) Voilmace keypad
relevant connector. Due to the very clear
instructions, it is an easy and solderless
job. It takes about two minutes to ﬁt it. If
you have an SX-64, connection is not so
easy, but is possible.
I can recommend either o f  these
keypads; i t  d e p e n d s  o n  y o u r
requirements -  t h e  Voltmac e f o r
programming, the Commercial Products
for business.
Joysticks
It seems that the initial ﬂood of new
joysticks has slowed down into a trickle
and the only ones that appear now are
from the well known names.

Kempston Formula 1
This is a version of the old Kempston Pro.
From what I could see there was nothing
new about it except that it had undergone
a fairly dramatic colour change. What was
once a nice, robust, unusual, long-lasting
black workhorse is now a nice, robust,
unusual, long-lasting blue workhorse.
Half a dozen friends have seen it and they
all responded with the same cry: "It's
gross!", and I certainly agree with them.
But the joystick itself is good. The
strong leaf switches give a deﬁnite 'click'
and it survived the hammering I gave it. In
my last review of the Kempston Pro I said
that, although it was a good stick, I did not
personally like it. But I've now grown used
to it. No fear of my getting to like this one
though. But it's colour makes it difﬁcult to
lose!
Kempston Formula 2
This suffers the same problem as the
Formula 1: it's blue. Apart from that, it's
not too bad. It's quite strong and lasted
well although I  d i d  begin t o  g e t
concerned about the shaft. It started to
feel a bit 'gooey' but has not given up the
ghost yet.
It was difﬁcult to examine the switches
since they are pretty well encased but,
judging by the quality of the rest of its
innards, I should imagine they are pretty
hefty. The ﬁre buttons (one on the top of
the stick and two on the base) are small
but reliable. The semi-sculptured handle
is more comfortable than it looks. This
works well, it lasts well and the quality of
the casing is excellent but there is nothing.
'new' about it.
Vulcan Gunshot 1
This looks good -  two-tone cream that
matches the 64. It is nicely styled with an
Vukan Gunshot 1 and Gunshot 2
optional autoﬁre switch. It is by far my
favourite to use except i t  didn't last!
After a few full sessions with Impossible
Mission, I found my man kept falling to
the left in kamikaze dives onto robots.
Investigations resulted in the Gunshot
being found guilty and its sentence was a
strip down to reveal its work ings.
In my article Gripping Stuff (Dec. 84
issue), I gave the Quickshot II a verbal
battering. O n  spilling the guts of the
Gunshot, I found the very same switches -
four-pointed stars o f  very thin metal
which last about as long as butter in the
sun. O n the review model, cracks had
already appeared i n  t h e  a r m  s o ,
occasionally, the arm would touch the
contact a n d  m y  s py  w o u ld  mak e
involuntary, and often fatal leaps to the
left.
On the whole, it looks good and feels
excellent -  no blisters (although that is
possibly because i t  didn't last long
Kempston Formula 1 and Formula 2
enough). But, if  something was done
about its reliability, I would like one.
There is also a rapid ﬁre version -
Gunshot II -  which is available in black.
If you could mix the insides of the Pro
with the outside of the Gunshot, I think
you would have a good joystick. As they
stand, I am not over impressed with any of
them. If I was going to buy any of them I
think I would buy the Pro and then buy a
tin of black paint and spray it!

From graphics to

a whole range of
books to suit every
Commodore user's
taste. Garry Marshall
and Evelyn Mills delve
into some of the
Title: F i l i n g  Systems A n d
Databases For The Commodore 64
Author: A.P. and D.J.
Stephenson
Publisher: Collins
Price: £7.95
THIS BOOK DEALS WITH H O W TO
write your own programs for storing
and retrieving information using the 64
and its peripherals. It deals with this in a
straightforward manner showing how the
computer can be used for a valuable and
much needed activity. At the same time, it
provides a down-to-earth but basically
orthodox treatment of its subject that
gives database users all the background
that they could need. In  this way, it
successfully bridges the gap between the
needs of the pure user and those of the
programming enthusiast, which seems to
me to be the chasm into which rather too
many books unerringly plunge.
The book starts with a  look a t
conventional, buit barely organised, ways
of storing information such as t h e
cardboard box and labelled jam jars. From
these familiar starting points, it draws out
the features that a computer-based ﬁling
system must have, and then goes on to
demonstrate the advantages that it has
over a conventional system. That some
demands will be made of the user, not
least some careful systematic thought, is
also spelt out.
This leads o n  t o  an examination
of the relevant features of computer
memory and permanent storage media.
Cassettes and discs are both discussed,
and the ways in which they store ﬁles of
information are explained. The authors
believe the cassette-based operations
are quite viable for the enthusiast, even
though they are inevitably slower than
using a disc and I am inclined to agree. To
wait a few minutes is not unbearable and,
as the authors point out, the time need
not be wasted. You can go off and do
something else and, if the system is set up
to give an audible alarm when it is ready to
continue, you can come back to it then.
The good thing about the explanations
of the storage media is that they are quite
explicit about the amount of storage that
is available, on a disc or a cassette, and
that they relate this directly to the amount
of information that can be stored, either
as a number of names and addresses or as
a number of records each carrying, say,
the details of  one stamp in a stamp
collection. At this stage we know precisely
how large a ﬁle can be stored on a di5c or a
cassette.
The importance of making programs
'user-friendly' is also discussed. This is not
a subject on which to be dogmatic, and
the Stephensons are not, The things that
can make a program user-friendly to the
beginner can be intensely annoying to the
experienced user. Even so, it is probably a
good idea to make the experienced user
pause before doing something as drastic
as destroying previously entered
information. A  pragmatic approach is
recommended and is built into the
programs in the book, but only to a
limited extent, which illustrates the idea
without distracting attention from the
essential purpose of the programs.
Deﬁnition of the essential terms, such
as ﬁles, records and ﬁelds then leads into a
discussion o f  sequential-access and
direct-access ﬁles, and the interaction
between the storage medium and the
type of ﬁle that should be employed with
It.
The development of  programs for
storing and retrieving information begins
with simple programs that effectively
simulate ﬁle-handling systems by reading
their data from a 'ﬁle' held as DATA
statements within the program. From this
familiar beginning, we naturally progress
to programs for handling data in ﬁles on
cassette and on disc and the necessary
commands are introduced as they are
needed. The programs themselves are full
of comments and are sufﬁciently well
structured t o  m ake t h em  readily
understandable. It  will be possible to
amend arid extend them with very little
fuss,
After this, various methods of sorting
ﬁles into order are introduced and
programs implementing the methods are
presented. There a re  programs i n
machine code, as well as in BASIC, since
sorting a large ﬁle can be a  lengthy
process, so that the increase in speed that
machine code gives can  b e  much
appreciated. After this, methods o f
searching a  ﬁle are explained and
implemented. If you have ever wondered
why computer books tend to be full of
programs for sorting, this one shows how
much quicker it is to ﬁnd an item of
information in a ﬁle that has been sorted
into order than in one that has not.
The ﬁnal chapters deal with ﬁles that
are organised in various different ways,
including the relative ﬁles that are unique
to Commodore.
The book is neatly rounded out by a
summary, a  set  o f  self-assessment
questions at the end of each chapter, and
a useful glossary. This is a very attractive,
practical treatment of computer-based
ﬁling systems and databases. It will appeal

to anyone who has an interest in them,
and will stimulate the appetite of people
looking f o r a  worthwhile computer
application to get their teeth into.
Title: Graphics Book For The
Commodore 64
Author: Axel  Plenge
Publisher: First Publishing Ltd.
Price:
STARTING FROM PRIMITIVE BEGIN-
ﬂings with bits, bytes, number systems
and logic operations, this is a  com-
plete guide to graphics programming
on the 64. It eventually progresses to bit-
mapped graphics, designing your own
character sets, sprites and even handling a
light pen.
The book is aimed at the graphics
programmer who will b e  writing in
BASIC, although some programs are
presented in assembly code. A complete
and coherent treatment is given showing
how all the 64's graphics features can be
accesssed. This is brought together in a
chapter called 'Fundamental graphics
programming', which manages to strike
some sort of balance between dealing
with the general underlying principles of
graphics programming and the way that
they can be brought to bear on the 64.
A chapter on the applications of
graphics deals with perspective and
producing images to represent three-
dimensional objects in a realistic way. It
also shows how to deal with animation
and graphics in ways that would b e
suitable for the fastest-moving games.
This is as good a coverage of graphics
programming for the 64 as I have seen. I
particularly like the way that the different
aspects are related to each other, giving
an overall unity to the book. As there are a
great many programs in the book, I was
pleased to read on page three that a
diskette containing all of them is available
and that the ordering information is on
the back of the book. Alas, the back page
bare!
Title: Tricks and Tips for Your
Commodore 64
Authors: Lathar Englisch, Klaus
Gerits, Michael Angerhausen
Publishers: First Publishing Ltd.
Price: £8.95
'TRICKS AND TIPS IS AN INTERESTING
book. Whilst there is nothing particularly
new in its contents for the more ex-
perienced programmer, i t  does give
the reader an  opportunity t o  pro-
gram in  machine code. I f  you don't
have an  assembler, each program is
duplicated in BASIC using machine code
numerical data. All the machine language
programs are very well documented and
fully functional.
The book deals with a  variety of
subjects including high resolution
graphics, character set deﬁning, screen
division, scrolling, cursor control and
function key programming.
BASIC is extended to copying into
RAM while there is a useful line RESTORE
routine which is lacking in the 64. The 'no
more negative numbers w ith t h e
Frequency Function' is an odd insertion in
view of the fact that a positive answer can
already be given by the 64 by a simple
formula query. Other programs include
auto-line renumbering and s o forth.
This brings u s  t o  t h e  subject o f
programming in FORTH which is brieﬂy
discussed in four pages while a rather
extensive study o f  the use of  CP/M
programming with the 64 is given. Useful
if you have the utility.
For good measure w e are given
technical d a t a  f o r  lin kin g  y o u r
Commodre 64 to a stereo output, but this
is far too brief to be useful. Thereafter,
20% of  the book is  devoted t o  Data
Management and Filing Systems with full
program listings.
Although this book is a mixture ot
various ty pes  o f  infor mation b u t ,
pleasurably, it gives you the opportunity.
to bring out that assembler and program
in machine language very effectively. No
assembler? Well the basic loaders and
programs are there with no apparent bugs
in either language. A  reasonable i t
somewhat expensive book.

machine code it  should be  clearly
understood that this is a 'language' totally
different from, and yet closely interlinked
with, BASIC; it has therefore to be studied
with considerable care and attention. The
'Machine Language Book f o r t h e
Commodore 64' provides an excellent
basis for doing this and the author is
meticulous in his discussion of the theory
and practice o f  t he language.
Complete listings are given for a 6510
assembler, single step simulator and a
disassembler; these listings are tedious to
type in, but a disc copy is available for
purchase (particulars of purchase, cost
etc. are given in Appendix F which is not
listed in the book).
A short 'Untoken' listing is also
detailed and should give no problems in
handling techniques. I t  is virtually
essential t o  utilise this particular
assembler with the book (unless you
know enough about machine code to use
another!) as most programs are structured
around the LEA (author's assembler).
Machine language programming is
devoted mainly  t o  high-resolution
graphics with some minor programs on
extending bas ic  a n d  input/output
routines for ﬁling and printing. Should
you want a  good factual tutorial o n
machine language this book can be highly
recommended.

Anirog have been in the
forefront of the Commodore
games market for a couple of
years, and were one of the
ﬁrst companies to experiment
with C16 software. Alison lijul
paid them a visit.
AS A CHILD. I LIVED NEXT DOOR TO A
house called Andora. M y  envy was
twofold. Not only was our house merely
distinguishable by its number (57) but
Andora was such a wonderful, magical-
sounding name, evoking thoughts of far-
away places i n  t h e  s un o r  fairytale
princesses. Imagine my disappointment
on discovering the total lack of magic or
mysticism attached to this name. The
Browns had Christian names - Andy and
Dora. Being a moderately bright child, it
didn't take me long to put two and two
together!
Well, ﬁfteen years on, I still possess a
modicum o f  t h a t  infantile quic k -
wittedness. So, when I visited Anil Gupta
of Anirog, and discovered that his fellow
director was a Mr Roger Gamon, I was
quick to solve the mystery behind the
name Anirog.
I visited Anil Gupta at Anirog's factory
in Dartford. Tucked away in a  dusty
corner of Dartford's Victoria Industrial
Estate, it is quite indistinguishable frort.)
the other functional buildings stretching
across the estate. But, once inside, there's
no disputing where you are. Covering the
walls, are box after box of inlay cards
bearing the famous Anirog insignia and
such household names (if your house
happens t o  c ontain a  Commodore
computer) as Flight Path 737 or PC Fuzz.
While staff mechanically stuff cards into
cassette cases, and glance disinterestedly
at me as I  stumble into their boxed
environment in search of Mr. Gupta, the
tape-copying machine hums furiously in
the background.
"You couldn't buy a computer anywhere
else except the bedding department in
Crawley"
Anil Gupta appears, a  small man
concealing a wealth o f  ingenuity and
business sense. He and Roger Carrion ﬁrst
met as design engineers at Philips where
they h e lp e d  m a k e  Philips  totally
automatic whilst increasing production
fourfold. Anil is in charge of sales and
marketing w h i l e  R oger  oversees
development at their Honey branch.
Although Anirog's birth dates back to
BEHIND
CLOSED
OOR
Anil Gupta with factory staff
February 1982, it was a while before the
two men left Philips. They started as
computer dealers, selling VIC 20s from, of
all places, the bedding department at the
Co-op in Crawley. This was certainly no
soft option/ T he proﬁts didn't come
rolling in -  but they certainly did a big
trade in  voyeurism. Says Anil Gupta:
"Enormous crowds just came to look. You
couldn't buy a computer anywhere else
except t h e  bedding department i n
Crawley. It was the only place where the
computer salesmen knew what they were
doing".
In fact, being surrounded by  beds
wasn't their main problem. Nor was it that
people wer e disinterested i n  micro-
computers; t h e  mer e size o f  their
audience contradicted this theory. Lack of
suitable software was the crux o f  the
matter.
They had opted for the VIC 20 as the
ﬁrst colour computer. This created a lot of
attention since people had never seen a
colour computer before. But most of the
software was Commodore's own, rather
poor quality, output.
Anirog only reaped the rewards of all
their hard work when they stared to
produce their own software. They weren't
the ﬁrst non-Commodore company to do
so. Anil recalls the ﬁrst Commodore show
he attended: "I bought Llamasoft's ﬁrst
game and Romic's Shark Attack.
He continues: "There were soon quite
a few people on the market with good VIC
games but Bugbyte had total supremacy.
We didn't d o  an exhibition until the
Midland Fair in April 1983. We hadn't
realised that there were so many people
interested in computers".
It was then that Roger and Anil
realised that one of them must leave to
concentrate fully on Anirog and exploit
the potential which lay ahead. Anil left in
May 1983 and set up An irog with Pauline
Lucas. in accounts and Lynn Taylor, in
sales. Both women are still part of the
Anirog team.
"Like every software house in the country
at the time, we typed our own labels and
did all our own packaging from home"
In June, he started a computer shop.
Anirog have two computer shops (one in
Dartford and one in Honey) at which they
sell a lot of bits and pieces apart from
Anirog software. The shops are not proﬁt-
able but And uses them to gauge the
market. For example, he is currently
investigating the possibilities of entering
the education market and uses t he
feedback fr om customers as a  guide.
More of this later.
They ﬁnally set up business premises in
the ﬁrst week of July. The Commodore
show had proven such a success that, says
Anil, "The money we took there paid for
our furniture and everything else".
So, w h o  w e r e  Anirog's early
programmers? They consisted of Anil's
and Roger's children and an assortment of
onlookers from the bedding department,
whom An d  an d  Roger trained as
programmers. They now have a team of 25
programmers; although they work in
house they are all employed o n  a
freelance basis. Referring to their ﬁrst
game, Cavern Fighter, a scramble type
game on the VIC 20, Anil says: "The
hardest part was trying to ﬁt it into 31/2X of
memory:'. As to initial production, "Like
every software house in the country at the
time, we typed our own labels and did all
=
=

P r o ﬁl e
our own packaging from home".
The company soon paid off very well.
Anirog now have a string of successes
behind them, probably the most famous
being their Flight Path 737. But Anil clearly
understands h o w  muc h harder i t  is
becoming to churn out one hit game after
another.
He believes that steps must be taken to
outwit, or at least keep up with, American
imports, particularly those marketed by
the company with the Midas touch, US
Gold. "United we might survive", is his
rousing call to action.
"No software house in this country is big
enough to light the Americans at their
own game"
He has formed a very loose federation
with 6 foreign companies (from Germany,
France, Spain, Canada. Belgium and
Holland) t o  mar k et e a c h  other 's
programs. For example, Slap Shot, their
current big seller, is a Canadian Game.
Says Anil: "No software house in this
country is  big enough t o  ﬁght t he
Americans a t  their  o w n  game. A n
American s oftwar e hous e us ually
produces 3-4 programs a year, funded by
(2-3,000 a time. I doubt whether any
software house in this country can spend
that on one program. US Gold is pushing
out software houses. Their games are very
good".
Anirog is diverging from the games
market. Anil is very worried about the
tough comp,'Itition. "It is very difﬁcult for
us to compete on a  shelf life of 3-4
weeks". H e  thinks that a  software
company can only compete in the games
Ro
u *m
market with an inﬁnite amount of games
but n o  Britis h c ompany  has  s uc h
resources. Anirog are now publishing
other companies' games. Apart from their
ties w i t h  6  for eign companies as
mentioned above, their sprite machine
utility, for example, is from Norway and is
the ﬁrst piece of Norwegian software to
be published over here.
Anirog w e r e  o n e  o f  t h e  ﬁr s t
companies to enter the C16 market. But,
Anil Gupta isn't very optimistic about the
C16. "I can't see it lasting very long, unless
the low price brings it up again". He
blames Commodore. Anil, in common
with a  l o t  o f  software companies,
approached Commodore when the C16
ﬁrst appeared. But, Commodore would
not loan out the C16. They insisted that all
programs must be released through them
and t h a t  ...they s h o u ld  r ec eiv e a
percentage of the royalties. The result?
"There was no software available, thanks
to Commodore's marketing".
Once C16s were generally available.
Anirog were one of the ﬁrst companies to
disassemble theirs in order to write and
market their own software. They were,
also, the only company to turbo their C16
programs. Their games have sold well.
The news from our review team is that
Anirog is one of the few companies to
produce high quality software for the C16
- f o r  ex ample. Star  Commander,
Minipedes and the inevitable Flight Path
737 (see our C16 software special). Anil is
certainly disillusioned by  the general
quality of C16 software. Referring to his
other role, he says "When you are a
shopkeeper, it breaks your heart when
children return software and say it's
rubbish".
Anil says they will produce 3 or 4 more
games this year for this machine. What
else have they got up their sleeves, then?
Two new utilities were demonstrated
at the LET Show - Voice Master and Super
Sketch. Voice Master is a digital recorder
which certainly offers a lot of potential for
the non-games market. Says Anil Gupta:
"The Saudi Arabians are fascinated -it can
help them learn to speak English".
And there is certainly keen interest
from the educational sector. Because of
its v oic e rec ognition facilities, f o r
example, handicapped people may use it
to play and give commands in adventure
games.
Super Sketch is a low-cost tool for
creating video graphics. Graphics can be
created by 'free hand' or 'tracing' from
drawings clipped to the pad. (We review
both these utilities in a separate article).
Anil is also entering the educational
software market. His wife is a teacher and
has helped convince him that there is a
greater need for good, realistically-priced
software.
Anirog's intr oduc tor y  piec e o f
educational software i s  Rhymeland
which he says "will cater for children from
8-13 years. I t  is the same program at
different levels of English and maths. It
provides value for money, is educational
and entertaining. Kids will play it because
they want to play it". This is the sort of
positive approach needed to edge the
sharks out of the educational market. Anil
says he might sell this product as a loss
leader, so long as it serves its purpose. The
2 cassettes and the booklet will sell for
£9.95.
I broached the subject of piracy. Anil
seems to have given up trying to defeat
the software pirates. He has joined various
groups such as FAST but has now stopped
answering any enquiries about pirated
versions of his games. Stacked up beside
his chair was a box-load of returned,
pirated Anirog games.
Anirog have never pursued a direct
publicity campaign. Anil seems anxious to
maintain a n  image o f  a n  ordinary,
medium-sized company. He believes that
Anirog should be judged by its products:
if people like them, they'll buy them. They
have no PR company and have done little
PR wor k  themselves, although Anil's
assistant, Clare, will now be taking on this
job.
"There is not one game which we
produce which I can actually play".
Anirog have, for a long time, been in
the forefront of the Commodore games F
E
market. But, moving t o  fresher ﬁelds
might be the right decision for the man
who confesses, "There is not one game
which we produce which I can actually
play".

Anirog are out to prove that
they're not just a games
house. Allen Webb got a -
touch of the Leonardo's while
Phil South found his voice 11

Super Sketch consists of a drawing
tablet and some software. Rather than
operate on the pressure sensing principle,
the tablet uses a stylus on the end of a
moveable ar m. B y  means o f  s ome
potentiometers, the software is able to
establish the position of the stylus on the
tablet. This position is then mirrored on
the screen by  a  small cursor. So, by
moving the stylus around a shape, the
shape can be transferred to the screen.
Connecting the tablet is easy since it just
plugs into joystick port 1.
Whilst the original American software
was on cartridge, it will be on disc and
cassette in the UK (at least the Anirog
version). O n  loading, a  title page is
displayed and nudging a button you're in
business. The tablet has ﬁve buttons at the
top. The central button controls a clamp
which is used to hold paper in place if you
want to trace a shape. The two outmost
buttons, labelled LIFT, are used to lift the
pen from the paper so you can move
about without drawing lines. LIFT also
enables you to leave the menus. You can
return to the main menu by pressing the
MENU button. T he button • marked
SELECT is used to pick menu options.
This system operates i n  nor mal
multicolour mode offering 160 by 200
resolution with up to four colours per
character block. You can, within the
colour constraints, use up to 16 colours in
your picture. The software is completely
menu driven with four menus available.
The main menu provides the main
system options such as colour change, ﬁll,
draw, erase, clear, undo and page swap
(two drawing pages ar e available).
From this menu you have access to the
R e v i e w s
ANIROG
EXTRAS
other menus. Both ﬁll patterns and
brushshape are user deﬁnable. Whilst 16
pre-deﬁned shapes are available, you can
create your own. This means that you can
design a four colour tartan design and
then paint a shape with this design. These
options offer a huge range of shadings
and colour tones.
The normal drawing options of lines,
rays, boxes, circles, elipses, copy and a
range of mirroring options are available
offering excellent ﬂexibilities. There is a
zoom window available which allows you
to carry out intricate work. A window
option allows y ou t o  work  o n  any
speciﬁed area of screen.
If there are any omissions, they are a
printer dump and information on how to
use the pictures in your own programs.
Anirog advise me that they will provide
both in the ﬁnal version.
Overall t h i s  s y s tem oper ates
faultlessly. The accuracy of the stylus is
good and this is enhanced by the fact that
there is almost a one to one size ratio
between the tablet and the screen. The
software was a joy to use being both
simple and ﬂexiple. The simplicity of the
software is exempliﬁed by the fact that my
ten year old daughter got to grips with it in
minutes. The package comes with a series
of line drawings which can be traced and
coloured. A t  the price, this system is
excellent value and great fun.
Voice Master
The instructions suggest that you might be
able to "...have your computer talking
back to you in your own voice, allow your
computer to understand what you say,
and write music and play an instrument
just by humming..." Oh really?
What you get is the basic unit, a small
brushed a lu min iu m  b o x ,  heads et
comprising a head mike and walkman
style earphone combo, and the disc with
all the programs on it. The box contains a
sort of low quality sound sampling circuit,
digitally recording the sounds you speak
into the mike, and replaying the speech
over the loudspeaker of your TV. An ideal
popular example of the results you can
get w ith this  sort o f  system is  the
"Ghostbusters!"' and "He slimed met"
from Ghostbusters by  Activision. Once
you have digitised your words, the results
can be saved and played back on any 64,
without the hardware. Good news for
games programmers!
The voice recognition part o f  the
package samples a word over and over,
so that the word can be remembered,
recognised and acted upon, even if you
get a cold. You have to speak clearly
though, it's no use saying Ifffffﬁre" if
you want your laserbase to rapid ﬁre!
Finally, the voice harp option gives
you the ability to hum or whistle a tune
into the mike, and have the computer
print it out on a musical stave. Whether
this last feature works or not, I don't have
the slightest idea, as the review copy of
the disc I  was sent didn't have the
program on it. Shame, because this was
one of the most exciting features of the
advertising!
All in all, this is a very tidy and up-to-
date piece of kit. The sampling of voice
cannot be any better quality, without
additional hardware to govern hi-quality
output. A s  a  p ie c e  o f  pr ogr am
development hardware, c omputer /
human interface, up-to-date games
design hardware, it is an essential buy for
1985. No '64 should be without one.

SITTING DO WN AT THE POKER TABLE
with such a bunch of erstwhile villains and
heroes of the likes of Matt Dillon, Black
Jake and Billy the Kid is bound to be an
education. Ev en m o r e  s o  i f  y our
education is  as sadly lacking i n  the
essentials of card school as mine is. Sufﬁce
it to say that I now have a pretty clear idea
as to precisely what you're supposed to do
with the ﬁve cards you are dealt. Would
you believe it, I even won a hand out
blufﬁng some of the biggest bluffers in
the world? You start off the game with a
thousand quid in your pocket. With a bit
of luck you could turn a proﬁt as the
computer plays every hand except your
own unles s , of course, you want a bit of
assistance which it will give without, I may
say, cheating. Moll is on hand to give you
advice whenever you want it. Most of the
time she will probably advise to throw it
all in. Perhaps that's because the air is
thick with cursing and there are more
than a few ﬁngers twitching on the trigger
of a gun. As a spectacle this is a pretty
unspectacular piece of software although

Rail Boss
Commodore
01.99
CBM 64 + 1541 Disk unit
IN THIS BUSINESS DISC BASED GAME
you are boss of a small-time railroad in the
Wild West. If you build a line through
Indian and bandit country from Home
City to the main line at Junction City you
hit the big-time and win the game.
It loaded without trouble and the 10
page manual is easy to follow. The authors
aimed both for a challenging game with
pleasing graphics and a realistic but not
too detailed s imulation. D i d  they
succeed?
Each turn represents a day. You may
sell shares, buy a loco, hire or ﬁre staff,
build track and so on. You get reports on
how you're doing and what is happening
in the locality. Unfortunately, the pace is
slow because you work through tediously
repeated menu and information screens.
I completed a game in two sessions
(there is  a  'save' feature). The only
challenge was to plod on; I don't fancy
having another go. Once you get some
track working there is  little risk o f
bankruptcy but you can't make a fortune
either because the robbers and greedy
shareholders are programmed to limit
your cash below $2100. The program only
allows one work team at a time so you
can't even plough proﬁts into faster
construction.
The graphics a r e  f a ir  b u t  t h e
presentation generally lacks polish. There
is no sound until you win when you are
treated to a little tune. The idea behind
the game is good but you don't control
enough decisions for this program to be
very interesting as  a  simulation o r
challenging as a game. I'm afraid this
railroad doesn't deliver the goods.
You control Radium Rodney who is a
diminutive beachcomber. What he seems
to want in life is to kill off a few of the
insane 'Poly tik ians ' b y  t h r o w in g
radioactive seaweed at them. Getting the
seaweed is the hard part.
Rodney must rush about the beach
collecting clumps of the said weed while
avoiding the strange variety of mutants
which inhabit the place. These creatures
range from guards to jellyﬁsh. Guards
march up and down the beach and will
shoot anyone w ho gets i n  the way.
Jellyﬁsh will sting you to death, Crabs just
nip your toe and make you jump about
the place, usually into a guard or jellyﬁsh.
Seagulls have also mutated into giant
birds which try to carry you away and
clams even try to eat you.
Once you have collected ten clumps
of seaweed, or more, you can exit the
beach and head for ten Downing Street
where the evil 'Polytikians' live. They will
appear at windows and you must hit them
at least ﬁve times to kill them. Those
'Polytikians' don't half look  lik e the
people who are running our country you
know.
The graphics are great and often very
funny. The sound effects are varied and
the sound of the sea is very realistic. The
game also includes the tune 'I do like to
be beside the seaside'. I reckon it should
have been called 'I don't like to be beside
the seaside' for this game!
Overall this  is  an addictive, good
humoured and sometimes frustrating
game. Fans of Taskset games will love it - I
did.

great sound track begins (the game's best
point). A scrolling message thanks people
who have helped with the game and also
takes a stab at us poor reviewers! Pressing

First of all you can select your break
team's colours, a nice touch but I always
used the standard default colours. Once
this is done you can try your hand at the

a large backdrop covered i n ,  what
seemed to me, meaningless grafﬁti. Your
break dancer appears in the centre of the

Having got that off my chest, I have to
say that Rocket Roger is by far the best
game of its type that I have yet seen. In
size alone i t  beats most others. The
playing area is one continuous scrolling
screen, so that the player is able to view
the entire game without ﬁrst having to
clear any screen.
The actual game play takes place in a
window which occupies the upper half of
the screen, the remainder being used to
display your score, lives and level. This
adds to the difﬁculty factor as, when you
jump, you lose sight of the ground as the
screen scrolls with you thus making it
impossible to be sure of where or on what
you will land.
The game starts above ground but, as
you zoom over high mountains with the

Donkey kick, Space Shuttle (which was
mentioned in the title screen message as a
'wind up to snotty reviewers' although
have n o  idea why), Headspin, Flip,
Backslam and Backspin.
The game has no scoring system but
ratings are given. They range from; 'You is
bad news man' which is the lowest, right
up to the top which is 'Awesome'. The
graphics are quite good and the sound
track is wonderful. However, I found the
game pretty dull and not very playable at
all. Interceptor hav e released s ome

Fortunately, very little of the scenery,
other than the monsters, is fatal to our

hazardous as is usually the case.
The motive behind all this activity is
the need t o ﬁnd and retrieve 99 fuel

the
TO DATE I'VE SEEN SIX Ex-
tended BASICs for the 64. This
package is the cheapest of the
bunch and, as such, proves an
interesting exception t o  the
rule that "You get what you pay
for".
The c ode resides i n  the
spare 4K between the ROMs
and, by using the RAM behind
the ROMs for  the graphics
screens, steals very little of the
area for BASIC, I applaud this
approach as being sensible and
extremely d e s ir a b le .  I n
common w i t h  t h e  o t h e r
packages available, the extra
commands cover the areas of
graphics, sprites, sound and
utilities. A  swift scan of the
available commands ( 36 o f
them) shows that they aren't
particularly exceptional but do
ﬁll many  gaps. Structured
programming is  completely
unsupported s o if  you want
procedures, IF. _THEN...ELSE
or REPEAT U N T IL, l o o k
elsewhere.
The utilities section covers
most areas. F o r  pr ogr am
editing t h e r e  a r e  AU T O ,
RENUM, PACK and DELETE. All
work a s  ex pec ted. PAC K
removes spaces a n d  REMs
giving you more free space.
POKE AND PEEK are available
to permit the easy tweaking of
vectors etc. POP is provided to
let you loose a RETURN from
the stack, but I consider it a
programming failure if it must
be used.
The graphics commands are
versatile b u t  a  little r udi-
mentary. Bit resolution plotting
in both high resolution and
multi- c olour  m o d e s  a r e
supported with full control of
plot c olour s . T h e  ac tual
drawing commands are thin on
the ground with only points,
lines and boxes, Neither FILL or
CIRCLE are available.
Almost a l l  conceivable
commands a r e  giv en f o r
sprites. You can turn them on
or off, specify multi-colour or
hi-res, expand them, mov e
them, change the colour and
specify priorities. T he only
missing area is the detection of
c o llis io n s .  T h e  s o u n d
commands are pretty extensive
covering most o f  the basic
functions. It's a pity that cross
modulation o f  voices is not
supported.
On the whole this is an
excellent package which is very
good value for  money. The
omissions in some commands
aren't surprising when y ou
consider that the package only
occupies 4K.
A.W.
REMEMBER ICARUS? HE WAS
the ancient Greek who tried to
ﬂy too close to the sun with his
wings of wax and feathers, with
predictable results! Well, in
this quaint game, you have to
help poor Icky to ﬁnd his father
Daedulus who has (pardon the
pun) ﬂown the nest.
Using your joystick, help
Icky to ﬂy over the land and
seascapes of ancient Greece,
avoiding villas, hills, evil Roc
birds (which try to force you
earthwards), giant bees (whose
stings are fatal), clouds with
smiling faces (which sap your
energy), and the burning sun
(which tr ies  t o  dr aw  y o u
upwards into its ﬁery embrace
- and disaster!).
You start out with ﬁve lives
and can choose from ﬁve levels
of play. Your energy can be
replenished by landing on top
of certain buildings. The lower
you ﬂy, the more points you
amass -  but watch out for the
black c at that follows y ou
everywhere, it  certainly isn't
lucky!
The opening sequence has
a nice piece of music b u t  why
does i t  only  last f o r  ﬁfty
seconds? The sprites are rather
mediocre a n d  t h e  sounds
boring. The kids should enjoy
this for an hour or two.

of structure of Commodore BASIC and
buy add-ons such as Simon's BASIC to
improve matters. PASCAL is  a  highly
structured language which will appeal to
those who want to write concise and
liking for  radioactive holidays. Leeper
moves forward only on a vertical scrolling
screen b u t  does  h e  mov e forward
whirling from side to side, gliding up and
down complete with his own shadow
giving the player an excellent perspective
on all the action. There are obstacles to
jump, raiding aliens and stationary debris
to be shot and radiation pods to be torn
asunder t o  reduce y our radioactivity
which naturally enough eventually kills
you. The object is to meander through
this scenario picking up the artifacts and
depositing them at bases whereby untold
beneﬁts w ill befall t h e  Leeper, old-
fashioned things like an extra life every
5000 points and not at some ludicrously
impossible target. As more artifacts are
intelligible programs. Lik e the UCSD
system, this is a compiler which acts on a
source code stored on disk. The source
code is written using the 64's own editor
and therefore has line numbers (a feature
not seen i n  nor mal PASCAL). T he
compiled code is then transferred to disc
and can be LOADed by use of a loader
program.
The system includes the usual PASCAL
commands but also contains a number of
extensions such as  POKE. PEEK and
graphic commands. A  SYS command is
available as a link to machine code and
found, more of the master map is revealed
at t he end o f  each sector, thereby
disclosing yet more bases. Useful items of
equipment also have to be uplifted and
can be selected from the menu which
appears after each sector. There are
hundreds of things to shoot but if you
ignore the tactical choices open, you
won't last for long. The graphics are
smooth and clear throughout and, while
the sounds aren't stunning, they've got
that pulsating quality that made the
original Invaders great. Activision just

masterpiece is one of the most addictive

option of up to four players is provided

having one turn and seeing how far he can

contrast i n  both the information and

My only qualiﬁcation would be the
lack of visual variety on each succeeding

Stephenson sort out
your data problems.
SORTING DATA INTO SOME
kind o f  order involves a n
ex c eptional a m o u n t  o f
processing time, most of which
is spent comparing relative
magnitudes. Although eac h
individual comparison can be
c ar r ied o u t  i n  a  f e w
milliseconds using BASIC, the
time taken f o r  a  complete
numerical or alphabetical sort
of, say, 1000 data items can take
minutes, rather than seconds.
Even one minute is a long time
to wait just watching a blank
screen. O f  course there are
efﬁcient and not so efﬁcient
BASIC programs but even the
best o f  th e m a re  o fte n
unacceptably s lo w .  T h e
answer, of  course, is to use
machine code subroutines
which, in general, have the
effect of changing minutes to
seconds. Before attempting to
describe them, we take a brief
look at some of the hardware
obstacles involved.
The execution speed o f
machine co d e  solutions,
however masterly in under-
lying design, must ultimately
be limited by the hardware in
general and the microprocess-
or, in particular. It is customary
to measure the speed o f  a
computer in terms of mips,
which is an abbreviation for
millions o f  instructions per
second. The 6510A used in the
Commodore 64 and the VIC is
rather slow in terms of mips —
around 0.5 mips. In contrast,
some of the mainframe giants
have a speed of about 100 mips
and the few ﬁfth generation
models a r e  pr edic ted t o
approach 1000 mips.
So, we can see that our
Commodore machines, i n
common w i t h  mos t other
E
make exceptional demands on
software techniques t o
overcome hardware deﬁcien-
cies. Perhaps we should point
out that one mip means one
million m a c h i n e  c o d e
instructions ( n o t BASIC
statements) per second. When
we consider that some BASIC
statements require ov er  5 0
machine code instructions, it is
dear that the situation is even
worse. This means that BASIC
must be the ﬁrst casualty in the
war against sluggishnes, and its
place taken by machine code.
As we have seen, sorting
data into numerical or alpha-
betical order is an inherently
slow process and programs
which frequently have to sort
data, such as ﬁling systems and
databases, require machine

We h a v e  stressed t h e

In addition t o the block o f
integer bytes, t h e  BASIC
interpreter requires  s ome
administrative •paperwork' to
be stored at the beginning of
the block. After all, the array
will have a name chosen by the
programmer, f o r  ex ample
OR). There may be more than
one array, so the array name, in
this case, AS, must be stored.
The interpreter will also need
to know what dimensions it
has. For example, is it DIM
A%(X) or is it DIM A%(X,Y). This
information and some more
bits and pieces are stored at the
beginning o f  t h e  bloc k  o f
integers ter med t h e  array
header. The details are shown
in Figure 9.2
The details of the array header
are as follows:
Bytes 1 and 2
These are reserved for the two
characters allowed for the array
name. Byte 1 will contain the
ASCII code + &BO of the ﬁrst
character and byte 2 the ASCII
code of the second character
480. But an array name can
consist of only one character,
in which case, byte 2  con-
tains only  4 8 0 .  T h e  c on-
stant $80 i n  decimal is , o f
course, 128 i n  decimal and
ensures that the msb is set to 1
for l a t e r  i d e n t i ﬁc a t i o n
Purposes.
For example, if the array was
Program Listing
named A%, byte 1 would have
$C1=($41+$80) a n d  b y t e  2
would have only the constant
$80 because there is no second
character.
Bytes 3 and 4
These represent a n address
pointer to the start of the next
array t i t  another  exists).
Incrementing the start address
of the present array by  the
contents of bytes 3 and 4 will
produce the starting address of

the next array — this can otten
be useful information.
Byte 5
This contains the number of
dimensions in the array. For
example, D I M  A%f100,3)
represents a two dimensional
array, so byte 5 would contain
binary 10 ($2). In fact, Figure
9,2 assumes this.
Bytes 6 and 7.
These two bytes hold the arras
size.
Bytes 8 onwards.
The array header ﬁnishes at
byte 7 and the actual two-byte
integers are stored sequentially
following on from the end of
the header. The ﬁrst pair is
element 0 ,  t h e  nex t  p a ir
element 1, and so on to the end
of the block. In most cases, it is
advisable to leave the space for
element 0  empty and com-
mence at element 1. I f  we
do this, we note, from previous
work, that incrementing the
start address of the array by
nine gives the address of the
ﬁrst array integer. On the other
hand, if we utilise the element 0
position, we increment by only
seven. Subsequent increments
of two will lead us through the
remaining integer pairs.
Supplying the para-
meters from BASIC
Now t h a t  w e  k n o w  h o w
integers a n d  t h e i r  ar r ay
headers are stored, we can
work Out what form of BASIC
assignments must be written
before calling on a machine
code program for processing
an array. For example:
Parameter passing
100 HB%=N%/ 256
110 LB%=N%-(11B%*256)
120 PO KE 251,LB%
130 PO KE 252,HB%
140 SYS 49152
N% = the number of integers in
the array and a BASIC integer
variable. This must be split into
two component bytes, HB%for
the high byte and LB% for the
low byte. Note from line 100
that M I %  i s  obtained b y
dividing by 256. Since N% is
already in integer form there
was no need to use the INT
function. T h e  l o w  by te is
obtained from the remainder,
using the equation in line 110.
The two bytes are then stored
in addresses 251 and 252 using

The bubble sort
Because of the importance of
data sorting, many people have
c onc entrated u p o n  t h e
problem and a  bewildering
number of different algorithms
have evolved. A  simple and
well known algorithm, is the
bubble sort. The details have
been well documented but we
will give a brief outline.
Two loops are involved. The
inner loop compares, and if
necessary, swaps adjacent
items. The largest integer in the
array always 'bubbles' down to
the bottom — hence the name.
It is  no longer necessary to
involve this  integer, s o the
outer loop count is reduced by

one and the inner loop is again
entered. On subsequent loop
cycles, the next largest integer
bubbles down to the last but
one position, and so on, until
the entire array i s  sorted.
Since a  lar ge number  o f
comparisons are necessary, the
execution speed, in BASIC, is
very slow. I n machine code
however, t h e  s p e e d  i s
increased t o  a n  acceptable
level.
The use of a swap ﬂag can
speed up the execution of a
bubble sort, particularly if the
array is already partly ordered.
(In practice, an array is seldom
completely disordered.) The
swap ﬂag is reset to zero at the
start of the outer loop and, if
any swap is necessary, the ﬂag
is set to 1. If a complete cycle
has occured a n d  t h e  ﬂag
remains clear, it indicates that a
swap was unnecessary and the
array mus t b e  completely
sorted. A s  s o o n  a s  t h is
condition exists, n o  further
loop cycles are required and
the program can be terminated.
Strictly speaking, the inclusion
of the swap ﬂag changes the
pure bubble sort into a hybrid
bubble/exchange sort.
A machine code
bubble sort
Program 9.1 is a listing of a
bubble sort using the swap
ﬂag.
It can be called from BASIC
providing, of course, that the
necessary parameters are sent.
Analysis of Program 9.1
The program uses many of the
techniques described in earlier
parts of the series. You may ﬁnd
it necessary to refer back to the
December is s ue o f  ' Your
Commodore' to remind your-
self of indirect addressing.
Once this has been entered
and assembled, i t  c an b e
thoroughly tes ted o u t  b y
means of Program 9.2 which is
written in BASIC.
Using Program 9.2
To test out the machine code,
the program ﬁrst asks how
many integers are to be sorted.
The integers are obtained by
coutesy of the random number
generator and placed i n  an
array named A%. The raw data,
in its unsorted form, is then
scrolled down the screen, in
order to satisfy the user of the
prevailing situation before the
machine code gets to work.
The parameters necessary for
calling the machine code are
the usual POKE statements
described ear lier . Befor e
calling the subroutine with SYS
49150, the time clock TIS is
reset. O n  return fr om t h e
machine code, the integers are
then displayed in correct order
followed by  a display of the
time taken to sort them. Note
that the time taken to set up
and display the random array
often exceeds the sorting time,
providing a good illustration of
machine c ode speed. T he
clock, of course, measures only
the sorting time. It is worth
spending some time trying out
the system w i t h  differ ent
numbers of integers. By doing
this, you will discover how the
number of integers is related to
the sorting time. You will ﬁnd
that the relation is far from
linear. In fact ills almost square
law in form and is the reason
why the bubble sort is  not
popular if very large arrays are
involved. However, sorting SOO
integers only  takes a  f e w
seconds.
Explanation of Program 9.1
Lines 30 to 70 Assign symbolic names to certain zero
page locations. (Zero page is essential
for indirect addressing.) The number of
integers in  the array, together with
certain other parameters, is picked up
when running Program 9.2 which is used
to test out the machine code. This is
described later. It is sufﬁcient in the
meantime to refer back to the few lines
given earlier. F or  example, POKE
251,LB% placed the low byte into the hex
address SFR and the high byte into the
next location VC. Line 30 assigns the
symbolic address NUMBER t o  LB%,
the high byte will be in NUMBER 4-1.
Line 80 E n s u r e s  the code is assembled starting at
the address &COW.
Lines 90 to 140 Decrement t h e  t w o  by te integer,
NUMBER.
Lines 150 to 210Store the address of the ﬁrst element in
the array in POINTER 2 (two bytes) by
picking u p  the starting address from
location $2F and $30 and adding the
offset 9. The addition of 9 ensures the
zeroth element of the array is not used.
Lines 210 to 250Initialise the CYCLE counter and the
swap FLAG.
Lines 260 to 290Copy POINTER2 ( tw o bytes) i n t o
POINTER1.
Lines 300 to 340 Add 2 to POINTER1 and stores the result
in POINTER2 (two bytes). The reason for
adding 2 is because the address of the
next integer in the array is two bytes
forward.
line 350 I n i t i a l i s e s  the Y index register to 1 for
indirect indexed addressing.
Lines 360 to 410Subtract t he ﬁrst integer fr om t he
second, lo w  by te then high by te,
keeping the most signiﬁcant byte of the
result in the accumulator (this holds the
all important sign bit). Indirect indexed
addressing is used to pick up the integer
bytes from memory. Remember that
integers are stored with the high byte
lowest in memory.
Line 420 C h e c k s  if the V ﬂag is set. If clear, it skips
line 430.
Line 430 A s s u m e s  that the V ﬂag is set so reverses
the sign bit.
Line 440 T e s t s  t h e  s ign o f  t h e  accumulator
contents and bypasses the swap loop if
positive (including zero). This ensures
that if both integers are the same, no
swapping occurs.
Line 450 P r e p a r e s  the Y register for swapping.
Line 460 S t o r e s  the Y register contents in FLAG. In
fact any non-zero number is sufﬁcient to
indicate a swap has taken place.
Lines 470 to 540 Handle the actual swapping of adjacent
integers, starting with the high bytes.
Time is saved if the higher bytes are
tested ﬁrst. The X register is used as a
temporary storage cell because TAX is
much faster than using a  memory
location. The stack could have used but
PHA takes 3 cycles.
Lines 550 to 570 Increment the CYCLE counter by 1.
Lines 580 to 630Compare the low byte of CYCLE and
NUMBER. If the result is non zero, a
branch is made to the label INNER-
LOOP. If the result is zero, the program
'falls through' to compare the high byte
in the same manner.
Lines 640 to 650Checks if FLAG is clear and, if so, a
branch down to FLAGCLEAR is made
ready for exit.
Lines 660 to 710 Decrements NUMBER (two bytes to be
taken into account).
Lines 700 to 730Check if NUMBER has reached zero.
The low byte is checked ﬁrst, branching
to OUTERLOOP if not zero. If the low
byte is zero, the high byte is similarly
checked.

The Commodore C128 is the
hottest Commodore news
from the States at the
moment and should be
available in the UK from mid-
summer. Barry Miles provides
a sneak preview from his
study of a prototype of the
machine.
1 r
THE BURNING QUESTION MUST BE
Has Commodore got it right this time?",
especially in the wake of the still-birth of
the 500 and 700 machines, and the
question-mark over the Plus/4, following
it's recent price cut.
The C128 possesses a n  enlarged
memory and can operate in a special
emulation m o d e ,  t h u s  mak ing i t
compatible with existing Commodore 64
software. It can also run under CP/M
which is a substantial advancement. This
machine has an integral disc drive option
and it should be possible to read CP/M
discs which have been formatted on other
makes of disc drives.
As far as looks go, the 128 is a very
elegant machine. The main box which
houses the CPU is pleasantly angular in
shape and has ample space to take the
integral dis c  drive. T he keyboard is
detached and on a cable which enables
the user to place it at a substantial distance
away from the main unit and monitor. The
key-strokes are identical t o  the 64's,
something whic h 6 4  users w ill ﬁnd
attractive.
The function keys are at the top right-
hand corner o f  the keyboard which
means that, using them shifted, requires
two hands. Ther e ar e f o u r  cursor
movement keys on the top row. On the
top left of the keyboard are the ESCAPE,
TAB„ ALTERNATE and CAPS LOCK keys.
Adjacent to these is another group of four
keys -  HELP, LINE FEED, 40/80 DISPLAY
and NO SCROLL.
The machine has been made more
transportable by incorporating a recess
underneath the main unit into which the
keyboard will clip.
The sockets to the rear of the machine
are the familiar 64 ones. The C128 uses
standard • D- ty pe' c onnec tors  f o r
joysticks, unlike the Plus/4 and C16. Also,
the cassette connector connects t o a
normal type of Commodore cassette unit
rather than the special one which is
marketed for the C16 and Plus/4.
The integral disc drive in the machine I
examined was a 5
Judging by the shape of the computer's
box, twin ﬂoppies should be possible but
there are no plans to include a hard disc
version at the moment.
When using the disc drive in 64 mode,
it operates at the cumbersome 1 541 speed
but it speeds up when in CP/M or C128
mode. One might have hoped that, when
the machine is operating as a 64, the spare
64K of RAM would be used as RAM-disc
to speed up operation of programs which
require considerable disc access. Unfor-
tunately, in pursuit of true 100% Commo-
dore 64 compatibility, this facility has not
been provided. Maybe it won't be long
before p6Cople will devise methods of
convincing the machine temporarily that
it is operating as a C128 while disc access is
operating as a C128 while disc access is
taking place, only to switch back to 64
emulation mode as soon as disc access is
ﬁnished!
In operation
On power-up y ou ar e automatically
placed in the C128 mode. The power-on
message says 122365 bytes free which is
quite impressive t o  o l d  Commodre
hands! If you have an integral disc drive
ﬁtted, then the machine immediately tries
to boot the ﬁrst program on the disc.
In C128 mode, the default is a 40-
column screen display. However, you can
4
•

- . 6 1 1 1

change to the SO-column display simply
by pressing the 40/80 key after turning the
computer on. Once you have entered the
C64 or CP/M modes, you must press the
RESET button or turn the machine off and
on again to return to C128 mode. To enter
C64 mode, you either insert a cartridge
containing 64 type code or enter GO 64
and RETURN. The CP/M mode cannot be
entered from the 64 mode but, from C128
mode, you type BOOT CP/M and press
RETURN. Alternatively, i f  you have a
CP/M utilities disc in the disc drive, on
power-up, CP/M will automatically be
booted.
In fact, one o f  the more exciting
aspects of the C128 mode is that you can
have 3 screens operating in 80 column
mode, only one of which is visible at a
time. Consequently, the computer can be
working on one screen whilst showing
another, and the user can switch between
them rapidly. The connectors on the
machine permit you to use two monitors
simultaneously, one showing 40 columns
and one 80 columns. I t  is  therefore
possible to have two different displays
controlled by a single program.
BASIC
The n e w  c omputer  continues t h e
improvement i n  Commodore BASIC
:

H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w
which was apparent in the Plus/4 and C16.
It uses BASIC 7.0, which contains
about 50 more commands than the 64's
BASIC 2_0. The enhancements include a
variety of 'toolkit' type commands, disc
handling commands which made BASIC
7.0 a true disc BASIC and substantial new
graphic and sound commands.
Users will also be delighted to know
that the C128 reinstates the sprites and
enhances them to a higher level than that
achieved within the 64.
A variety of structured programming
commands like DO UNTIL, DO WHILE,
LOOP UNTIL, LOOP WHILE, IF THEN ELSE
have been included. Hopefully, t h e
extremely structured programming
language, C O M M .  about t o  become
available on the 64, will appear on the
C1213.
Function keys
The function keys have useful defaults
attached to them. These are as follows:
Fl  E n t e r s  one of the graphics modes when the user supplies the
number of graphic's area.
F2  P e r f o r m s  a DLOAD so that it will load a program named by the user.
F3  L i s t s  a directory on the screen without disturbing the program in
memory.
F4  C l e a r s  the screen using the SCNCLR command.
F5  P r i n t s  DSAVE followed by inverted commas on the screen so that
the user only needs to enter the program name to save the current
program.
F6  E x e c u t e s  a RUN.
F7  L i s t s  the program automatically.
F8  
T
h
e
 HELP key which highlights errors in any BASIC program which
has been stopped by that error.
You can easily redeﬁne the function keys
to suit your own purposes.
Other commands
These include DIR, TRAC to trace BASIC
programs, a  WI N D O W c ommand,
DVERIFY with which you can check the
program o n  the speciﬁed disc drive
against the program in memory.
Since the 128K memory is held in 2
banks, there is a BANK command which
enables you to switch the bank with which
you are operating for PEEK, POKE and SYS
commands. An EXIT command allows you
to exit from a loop, if certain conditions
are satisﬁed, without disturbing the stack.
Graphics
The C128 does have excellent graphics
capabilities. It can display 16 colours in
eight levels of luminance, each in ﬁve
different graphic modes; it has 8 sprites.
Split screens ar e available i n  high
resolution a n d  multi-c olour mode.
Colour commands inc lude LOCATE,
CIRCLE, DRAW, MOVE SHAPE and a
whole string of others such as PAINT and
BOX.
Scaling can be used in plotting on the
•
screen, either in high resolution or multi-
colour mode. The scaling of bit maps in
the multicolour and high resolution
modes can be charged with a SCALE
command, Coordinates c an then b e
scaled up to as high as 1023 in X and Y
directions rather than the normal scale of
0 to 159 and 0 to 199 in multicolour, 0 to
319 and 0 to 199 in high resolution.
Sprite c ommands  h a v e  b e e n
s imp liﬁe d :  S S H A P E ,  G SH APE,
MOVESHAPE, SPRITE, MO VESPR,
SPRCOLOR a n d  CO LLISIO N a r e
provided_ Sprites can also be stored in a
simpliﬁed fashion - as text strings.
Sprites can be created in a number of
ways: as with the 64, using a Sprite Editor
or using the aforementioned commands
within a program.
You can draw a 24 by 21 pixels picture
on the screen and then convert it into a
sprite b y  us ing t h e  SSHAPE a n d
MOVESHAPE commands. Sprites can be
expanded vertically and horizontally and
can als o b e  joined together, thus
creating a seemingly larger sprite. The
sprites c an t h e n b e  mov ed either
individually o r  together. As  many as
three, four or even more sprites may be
moved together. Sprite collision has also
been r ec tiﬁed w i t h  t h e  C O U N T
command.
It is, also, now possible to move a sprite
at a pre-determined speed along a chosen
route. This has only  previously been
possible by using COMM or some other
Simon's BASIC extension. You can also
specify by how many degrees the sprite is
to move.
Sound commands
New s ound commands, previously
accessible only by POKEs on the M, in-
clude SOUND, ENVELOPE, VOL, TEMPO,
PLAY and FILTER. TEMPO changes the
duration of notes when playing music,
TUNE deﬁnes musical instruments env-
elopes and VOL deﬁnes the level of sound
volume,
1571 Disc drive
The new 1571 disc drive for use with the
C128 operates at  300 characters per
second when used in 64 mode and can go
up to 4,136 characters per second while it
is operating in C128 or CP/M mode.
Monitor
A monitor which has been devised for use
witth the 0 2 8 ,  offers RGBI mode, 80
characters by 25 rows on a 5x7 matrix and,
in composite mode, 40 characters by 25
rows on a 6x7 matrix. It should be noted
that a television set or a 1701 or 1702
Commodore monitor can only function
in 40 column mode with this computer.
Machine code programmers will be
pleased to know that a machine code
monitor of comparable quality to that in
the Plus/4 has been included in the C128.
Amusingly enough, the SAVE command
still requires you to add one to the ﬁnal
address!
Conclusion
Whilst this is only a preview of the C128, I
do think it is fair to say that Commodore
seem to have got it right this time. The
availability of a faster disc drive is not
and thousands o f  Commodore 6 4
programs to run on the new machine
guarantees that the new users will not be
starved of software when the machine
becomes available_ Additionally, the new
developments within the 128 mode are
attractive enough t o  ensure that this
machine has a lot to offer the user_ The
availability of a faster disc drive is not
to be sneezed at, and amends one of the
major criticisms of the 64. O f  course,
pricing will play a crucial role in the
success of this machine, and Commodore
are giving no hints as to what this might be.
My best advice to readers is to watch this
space.

Please can you tell me how to SAVE a
machine code program at an address
outside BASIC so that I can load it directly
later on.
Suppose I POKE in, either directly or
by a BASIC program from DATA lines, a
100-byte machine code program starting
at address 52000 (SCB20). If use a monitor
(e.g. CBM Macro Assembler Develop-
ment System), I can, of course, SAVE the
machine c o d e  p r o g r a m  b y  ''..S
"PROGRAM",08,C820,C884". I can then
load it later by "LOAD" PROGRAM",8,1",
without using the monitor.
Can I get the same result directly from
BASIC, i.e. without resorting t o  the
monitor to SAVE? If so, please could you
tell me how to do it.

Store the machine code in the area of
memory between addresses K M  and
K M  (i.e. 49152 and 53247 decimal). After
the machine code has been POKEd into
memory, calculate the hi and lo-bytes of
the start and end of your machine code
program in decimal.
Then, POKE locations 43 and 44 with
the hi and lo bytes of the start of the
routine, POKE location 45 with the lo byte
+1 at the end of the code and location 46
with the hi-byte. Then, to avoid an out of
memory erro, t h e area where t h e
variables start must be altered thus:
POKE 55 with the same value as location
45
POKE 56 with the same value as location
46
Finally, type in SAVE "program name",1,1
and either reset the values to what they
were before else switch the machine off
and on again.

MANY DIFFERENT SORTS OF PROG-

dimensional shapes. A computer-aided
design program must be able to do this, so
that its users can examine the shape of the
object that they are designing. Adventure
games with convincing graphics have a
considerable e d g e  ov er  text-based
games. For these, and other programs, it is
useful to have at hand a simple means of
generating the shapes.
One w ay  o f  generating thr ee-
dimensional shapes is to start with the
proﬁle of an object, such as the one
shown in Figure 1, and to rotate it through
a complete circle about a vertical axis.
Figure 2 shows how this simple procedure
generates a three-dimensional object. It
can be simpler, and rather more effective,
to create the object by rotating its proﬁle
to equally spaced positions around the
circle and to draw it in each of these
positions. Figure 3 shows the plan view
(with the axis of rotation at the centre) of
the situation when six equally spaced
positions around the circle are used, and
Figure 4 shows the resulting object with
six facets.
The project is to write a program that
will accept a number of facets, and
then draw the three-dimensional object
with the given number of facets that is
produced by rotating the proﬁle. Figure 5
shows the sort of results that the program
can give.
First steps
We shall begin by preparing the facilities
that the solution program will need to call
on. Obviously, the program will need to
display its results on the high-resolution
graphics screen, and so it will help to have
a subroutine to prepare the 64 to do this.
We have used a routine for this in an
earlier project. With a reminder that it
takes a fair time to do its job, a subroutine
for this, starting at line 500, is shown in
Subroutine 1.
The d r a w in g s  o f  t h e  t h r e e -
dimensional shapes will be composed of
straight lines, This means that it will be a
good idea t o  have a  subroutine for
drawing a straight line that we can call on.
It will work by drawing a dot at every
position along the path of the line from
one end to the other. We have used a

Writing the program
With these tools ready for when w e
need them, we can begin to write the
program. The ﬁrst things to do are to get
the number o f  facets for the three-
dimensional object and to get its proﬁle.
The program can get the number of facets
with the INPUT statement:
0 INPUT "NUMBER OF FACETS"; F
The proﬁle can be described by a
number of points which, when joined,
give the proﬁle. We could enter the
number of points on the proﬁle and the
points themselves with INPUT statements,
but it seems more convenient to READ
them from DATA statements. If we ﬁrst
read the number of points along the
proﬁle into N, we can then use this value
to dimension arrays X and Y to hold the x-
and y- coordinates of the points before
reading the coordinate values into them.
This is done with Subroutine 4.
There are gaps in the line numbers that
we shall ﬁll later when we declare more
arrays. For the moment, we have the data
that the program needs to carry out its
task, and we can prepare the computer to
display the result by:
110 GOSUB 500 REM SET UP HI-RES SCREEN
before going on to work out how to
compute that result.
With the data describing the proﬁle,
the numbers may not be at all convenient
for the 64's high-resolution screen: they
may make the proﬁle appear very small,
or they may make it too large for the
screen. We ought to scale the numbers so
that, no matter what they may be, they
give a display that ﬁts the screen.
Next, the program scales the data so
that the y-coordinates (or row numbers)
range from 40 to 160. The numbers of the
screen rows range from 0 to 199, so our
choice for the scaling ensures that the
displayed object will be of a good size and
centrally located on the screen. The x-
coordinates (or column numbers) are
scaled by the same factor as the y-values.
In the following lines, the greatest
value of a y-coordinate is found and
stored under YG while the smallest is
stored under YS. Then t he data is
multiplied b y 120/(YG-YS) so that it
occupies a range of 120 (that is, 160-40)
rather than from YS to YG, and 40 is added
to the y-values to make them range from
40 to 160 as required - see Subroutine 5.
At this point, we can draw the proﬁle
by interfacing the scaled data values to
our line-drawing subroutine. Since the
column numbers on the high-resolution
screen range from 0 to 319, we add 160 to
the x-coordinates of the proﬁle so that it
appears positioned with reference to the
centre of the screen rather than to the
left-hand side. The lines necessary to draw
the scaled proﬁle shown in Subroutine 6.
When you are entering the program,
this is a good place to pause to test it. But,
make sure that you have saved it ﬁrst for, if
there is a. mistake, particularly in the
routine for setting the high-resolution
screen, it can cause the program to be
lost.
Shape creation
Rotating the proﬁle to generate the three-
dimensional shape, requires a  little
geomoetry and the ability to visualise the
situation as it occurs in three dimensions.
There is nothing particularly difﬁcult
about it, and it can all be seen with the
help of a couple of diagrams.
First of all, imagine what happens to a
point on the proﬁle as it is rotated to a new
position. If there are to Ffacets, the points
will be rotated by 2*PI/F to get to its ﬁrst
new position. (Rotating it by twice this
amount will take it to the second position,
by three times to the third position, and
so.) The point is rotated about the vertical
axis, but kept at the same height.
We now need three coordinates to ﬁx,
the position o f  t h e point i n  three
dimensions. The position is shown in
Figure 7. The x- and y-coordinates of the
new point are measured in the same
directions as for the original proﬁle, and
the z-coordinate shows how far the point
is in front of the plane of the proﬁle. The
diagram shows that the coordinates NX,
NY and NZ of the new point are related to
the coordinates x, y of the point on the
proﬁle by:
NXx•cos(2*PI/F)
NY=y
NZ=xssin(2*PI/F)
This tells us where the point moves to.
Now we want to know how to draw it, for
we cannot actually create t h ree-
dimensional pictures, we can only draw
representations of them on a ﬂat (two-
dimensional) screen. The way that this is
done is illustrated in Figure 8. This shows
where w e  m u st  d raw  t h e  point
corresponding t o  our point in three
dimensions when we want it to be in the
same plane as the original proﬁle. As
before, a little observation of the right -
angle triangles in the diagram shows that
the coordinates X3 and Y3 of the point
that we should draw are given by:
X N X / 1 ( 1 - N Z / V )
Y N Y / 1 ( 1 - N Z / V )
( V is the distance of the observer from the
plane containing the proﬁle, as shown in
Figure 8. It is given the value 500 in the 5 3
program as this produces a satisfactory
display.)
The proﬁle can now be repeatedly
rotated and drawn in each of its positions.
Irm

P r o g r a m m i n g
The arrays NX, NY, X3 and Y3 are declared
in line 40. The proﬁle is drawn using the
same code as was used to draw the
original proﬁle but with reference to X
and Y replaced by X3 and Y3. Although it
would seem preferable t o  write a
subroutine for this, instead of repeating
the code, the contents of arrays would
have to be swapped around to interface
the subroutine to the program. As only a
few lines are involved, it is simpler to
repeat them. This gives us Subroutine 7.
Running the program as it stands now
will give a fairly convincing display, but it
is improved considerably if each of the
points that is used to describe the proﬁle
is joined to the corresponding point on
the next proﬁle. Adding these lines
considerably improves the apparent
solidity of the resulting image. To add the
lines, we must save the points on the
previous proﬁle so that they are available
when the new one is drawn. The x- and y-
coordinates, respectively, of the previous
proﬁle are saved in arrays named XP and
YR These arrays are declared at line 30,
initialised at line 200, used to draw the
required lines in lines 390 to 430, and
updated for the next time in lines 440 and
460 - see Subroutine B.
The entire program is listed in Figure 9.
Further developments
The ways in which you can extend and
enhance t h e program include t h e
following.
• T h e line-drawing subroutine can be
improved by drawing a dot in every
row, rather than in every column as at
present, if the slope of the line is
greater than one.
• The program can be amended so that it
does not draw the lines that would be
hidden from the viewer, showing only
the visible facets. This can be done by
changing the number of repetitions
required by line 280.
• The scaling system can be changed.
Different scalings can be used for the
x- and y-coordinates to produce a
distorted image o f  the object for
display.
• I I  you can till in some of the facets with
colour, it will enhance the display.
• The points need not be rotated round a
circular path, but can take positions on
an ellipse of some other curve. A
'crinkly' curve will give interesting
results.
• Different kinds of perspective to the
one of line 310 can be used.

Using the program
subroutines which
form the basis of a
ﬁling system into a 4
somplete program.
LAST MO NTH, W E  DEALT
with a  f e w  o f  t h e  major
subroutines which might form
the basis of a complete ﬁling
system. This article is devoted
entirely to one program which
ﬁts them together. Although
the program is  complete in
itself, it is hoped that you will
alter it to suit your own needs
and perhaps add additional
options. It is written for tape
ﬁles but it would be a simple
matter t o change the OPEN
statements to suit disc based
ﬁles. The complete listing is
shown as Program 9.1
On ﬁrst running the program,
the complete menu of options
is displayed although, at ﬁrst
there are only two possible
choices: create a ﬁle or load an
existing ﬁle, pr ov iding o f
course that one exists on tape.
If any other option is selected,
the "No ﬁle loaded" message is
displayed a n d  t h e  m e n u
regained by pressing any key.
Option 1: Create ﬁle
The ﬁrst screen message asks
for a n  es timate o f  t h e
maximum number of records
expected and the number of
ﬁelds in a record. If you have
just keyed in the program and
you are in the testing stage, you
should try out the program ﬁrst
with, say, ten records and three
ﬁelds to produce a test data
tape. It would be rather foolish
to start creating a long and
valuable data ﬁle before the
program has been fully tested
using all options with a short
dummy test ﬁle.
Next, you will be asked to
enter the ﬁle headings. We
suggest NAME. TELEPHONE
and OCCUPATION for the test
ﬁle. But, there is a little snag. In
order for the sort function to
operate correctly on numerical
columns, y o u  mus t enter ,
where necessary, sufﬁcient
leading zeros t o  mak e a ll
numbers c ontain t h e  total
number o f  digits . T his  is
because a l l  number s  a r e
converted t o  strings. These
preliminaries over, you will be
asked to enter the actual data
under each ﬁeld heading. The
current r ec or d number  i s
always displayed at the top of
the screen while data is being
entered. When t h e  current
keyboard session is ended, key
in EXIT t o regain the menu
page. Remember, you don't
have to complete the whole ﬁle
in one sitting. As soon as you
are tired, you can save the ﬁle
in its  unﬁnished state and
reload i t  later t o  carry o n
where_you left off. The only
difference is that you will then
be adding new records to an
existing ﬁle so you will need
Option 5, 'Add records' instead
of Option 1, 'Create records'.
Option 2: Load ﬁle
This can be a dangerous option
to choose because any ﬁle
already existing in RAM would
be destroyed by overwriting it
with the new ﬁle. To guard
against using this by mistake,
you are warned of the danger
and can get out of the mess
and r egain t h e  m e n u  b y
pressing any key other than the
space bar. Once you press the
space bar, the new ﬁle starts to
load over the existing ﬁle - so
think carefully!
T• H • E
F•A•C•ToS
Option 3: Save ﬁle
You supply t h e  ﬁle name,
which mus t n o t  exceed 16
characters. You must arrange
the controls of the cassette unit
and the winding position of the
tape used to receive the ﬁle.
Option 4: Display ﬁle
Before saving a  ﬁle, i t  i s
comforting t o  lo o k  a t  i t .
before actually committing it to
Option 4  w ill d o  this  f o r
you by  displaying a page of
records at a time. The key ﬁeld
is always present, but any one
of t he other ﬁelds can b e
rotated into view by using the
cursor k ey s .  ( T h is  w a s
explained in last month's issue
when we described most of the
subroutines in detail.
4 1 0 0
As mentioned above, this is
used to add further records to a
ﬁle already existing in RAM.
The record number displayed
at t h e  t o p  o f  t h e  screen
indicates the number of the
one you are about to add.
Option 6: Modify any ﬁeld
We all make mistakes so this
will be a popular option. You
will be asked for the keyﬁeld of
the offending record. The ﬁrst
one o r  t w o  characters ar e
sufﬁcient, a n d  t h e n  t h e
particular ﬁeld which requires
modiﬁcation. The ﬁeld data
must then be completely re-
entered. T o  ens ur e t h e
correction has gone in, have a
peep at the ﬁle using Option 4.
Option 7: Sort by any ﬁeld
Humans like things in order,
particularly alphabetical o r
numerical order. When y ou
enter data into a ﬁle, it is far too
much trouble to re-arrange the
data i n  or der  before i t  is
entered. Also, it would be qu ite
out of the question to re-entet
the entir e ﬁle  because a
newcomer, Thomas J, has to be
entered between Thatcher M
and Thrower P. Obviously, we
should mak e t h e  computer
earn its keep and make it do the
sorting afterwards -  hence,
Option 7.
To e n s u r e  m a x i m u m
versatility, the ﬁle can be sorted
under any ﬁeld heading. For
example, w e may, for  some
reason k n o w n  o n l y  t o
ourselves, like the ﬁle to be
arranged in alphabetical order
under OCCUPATION instead
of name or perhaps, numerical
order u n d e r  TELEPHONE.
Because of this, the question
"Operate o n  whic h ﬁeld?"
must be answered. If you want
to sort under TELEPHONE, it is
sufﬁcient to enter TE or even T.
The entire ﬁle will then be
sorted in numerical order of
telephone number, providing
of course the leading zeros
were correctly entered.
Option 8: Check bytes free
When the number of records
begins to grow a n d  they will -
you s h o u l d  o f t e n  t a k e
advantage of this option to see
how many bytes are left. We
could h a v e  m a d e  t his  a
permanent feature at the top of
the 'Add records' display but
this inv olv es  c ontinuous
housekeeping delays while the
=
=
=
 
=
=
 = =  k

BASIC interpreter cleans u p
the debris. By using a separate
option, the delay is more likely
to be tolerated.
Option 9: Delete record
The record to be deleted is
found on receipt of the ﬁrst
one or two characters of the
keyﬁeld, The 'hole' in the ﬁle is
automatically closed up so you
don't have t o  worry about
wasted RAM space.

inadvertent selection of certain
options when there is no ﬁle
present.
Suggestions for ﬁles
Having a ﬁling system is one
thing but knowing what to ﬁle
is another. A  ﬁle on names,
telephone and occupation was
quite suitable as  a  s imple
example but, in  practice, it
would b e  r ather  a  banal
exercise. T h e  f o l l o w i n g
suggestion may be useful as a
guide t o  t h e  k i n d  o f
information worth putting on a
computer.
The British have a lust for
magazines o f  a l l  t y p e s
including, of course, computer
monthlies. A pile of magazines
can grow to an alarming height
because most of us can't bear
to throw any of them away just
in case some particular article
has to b e looked up. The
trouble comes when you want
to ﬁnd the elusive article. To
avoid per iodic  b o u t s  o f
frustration it is worth spending
a few hours (or days) putting all
the article headings into some
kind of order. Program 9.1, plus
some dedicated k ey board
work, will do just that.

Want a holiday but can't bell
to be parted from your
"Commodore? Our prize
-
should solve such a dilemma.
ATTENTION ALL PLEASURE-SEEKING,
young Your Commodore readers! OK, so
you're not allowed to drink in pubs or
drive a car or do any of those legal things
which waste so much of us older folks
time. But, this month at least, you are the
privileged group of Your Commodore
readers. For, only if you are 16 years of age
or under will June's star prize be of any
value to you. Of course, mum or dad or an
older friend may enter - but, they can't
keep the prize.
Consider water s k iing, ﬁs hing,
swimming, tennis , s ailing a n d
computers! If you think this is an unlikely
mixture you've never heard of Ardmore
Adventure holiday camps.
Ardmore a r e  o u t  t o  prov e that
education can be fun. On one of their
special adventure holidays, you will spend
2-3 hours at the computer and the rest of
the day taking part in a whole host of
leisure activities such as  badminton,
basketball, BMX biking, dancing, drama,
fencing, judo, pottery, riﬂe shooting,
sailing, swimming, treasure hunts and
lots, lots more. There's something to suit
every taste.
The camps are small enough to ensure
that the campers receive personal care
and attention but large enough to offer a
wide range of activities and opportunities
to meet new people with similar interests.
Those who choose computing as A
specialist activity (and we're sure any Your
Commodore reader will) are taught to
program under expert supervision. There
is one computer (plus peripherals) per
child and a teacher for every 5 pupils.
There is no rigid syllabus; every child is
encouraged to proceed at their own pace.
The c amp ev en awards proﬁciency
certiﬁcates for  progress and skills in
specialist activities and courses.
There is a choice of residential or non-
residential camps. They are held at three
main sites Sherbourne School in Dorset,
Newland Park in Chalfont St. Giles and at
Ascot. There are three age groups - 4-6
years, 7-11 years and 12-16 years. What a
golden opportunity for parents to get rid
of their kids for a week (or, more to the
point, a chance for kids to escape from
their parents!).
Why are we telling you all this? Yes,
you've guessed, we're offering one lucky
E
of Ar dmor e's  ac tiv ity  camps. T h e
holiday will be at their Chalfont St. Giles
centre and should be taken at the end of
August. The second prize is an Ardmore
summer camp sweatshirt and the third
prize an Ardmore summer camp T-shirt.
David Walker, Camp Director

Be warned - there are
bugs in this game
from F.G. Tout.
Fortunately, they are
only ladybirds and
beetles.
LAVINIA THE LADYBIRD JUST
loves to eat grass. However, the
beetles ju s t  l o v e  t o  e a t
ladybirds. Your task is to guide
Lavinia through 1 2  gardens
eating the grass and avoiding
the beetles. I f  she eats too
much, y o u  c a n  c ur e h e r
indigestion by eating a ﬂower
and score an extra 100 points.
Unfortunately, this will speed
up the beetles. You score 10
points for each turf Lavinia eats.
To load press shift/run stop.
Move Lavinia b y  using the
joystick in Port 2. Lavinia has 5
lives.

Phil South has many strings to
his bow. This month he
ﬁddles about with music
programming in BASIC, note
values and duration and
musk software.
The duration and pitch of notes in a piece
of music are what makes it pleasing to the
ear. Catchy rhythmns and use of pleasant
notes and combinations are what makes
the difference between a  best selling
game (witness Ghostbusters) and an
annoying noise that the user can't wait to
toggle off!
In music, there are many different
lengths of note. You probably recall them
from your school days; they have weird
names like semibreve, minim, crotchet
and hemidemisemiquaver. Well, for the
sake of simplicity (and a certain pseudo-
American modern quality) we'll adopt the
usual American equivalents.
Semibreve whole note =4 beats
Minim = 1 / 2  note = 2  beats
Crotchet 1 / 4  note = 1  beat
Quaver = 1 / 8  note =  1/2 beat
Semiquaver-
We won't bother with the hemisemi - or
hemisemidemiquaver varieties, because
they not only occur too infrequently to
bother with, but this is complicated
enough without them!
The duration values are as follows:
whole note = 1000
1/2 note = 5 0 0
1/4 note = 2 5 0
1/8 note = 1 2 5
1 E
In musical notation, when a  note is
dotted, (a dot marked on the score just
after the note) its length is increased by
half. This i s  easy t o  d o  t o  o u r

computerlsed notes, by simply adding
half as much again:
1) 1 / 2  note duration = 500
2) Half  it = 250
3) Ad d  it to ﬁrst value making it dotted
note = 750
This means that we can add expression to
a piece by trial and error, adding and
subtracting duration values or sections to
achieve the rhythm of our choice.
Now you've struck z e right
note!
Now, the only thing missing from your
knowledge about the SID chip is note
values: which values to poke and where
to get which pitch.
PERED 64
Sound, as I mentioned last month, is a
series of waves, commonly regarded to
resemble those made by throwing a stone
into a pond, except that sound moves not
in concentric circles, but in concentric
spheres.
Different sounds can be measured in
terms of 'frequency': how many waves
per second passing a ﬁxed point in space
or how many 'cycles per second'. The
scientiﬁc word for cycles per second is
Hertz (Hz), named after German scientist
and father o f  wireless telegraphy,
Heinrich Hertz (1857-94). The distance
between the successive peaks of the
waves is measured against time: the
interval i t  takes between one wave
passing the spot and the next one. If this is
X seconds, then the frequency of the wave
is (1/X).

This is all well and good, and makes me
look like a physics whizz, but what do you
actually do?
Well, in order to make a noise from the
computer, you must POKE two numbers
into it: the High Frequency (HF) and the
Low Frequency (LF) values. In order to
ﬁnd HF and IF from the frequency of your
note, use the following equations. For
example, the pitch for the note of A over
middle C is 440Hz. To split this into the HF
and IF we must type in listing 1.
This program breaks the frequencies
down into units usable to the SID; for
instance, 440Hz gives a result of HF =17,
IF=38, w h i ch  according t o  t h e
Commodore 64 manual is spot on. Seethe

Soft options
There are a number of pieces of software
available that allow the user to beneﬁt
from the marvels of the SID chip, without
having to program it all in yourself. The
ﬁrst o f  t h ese i s  M u s i c  M a k e r
(Commodore); this is the one with a
plastic overlay keyboard, and it effectively
turns yo u r 6 4 into a  sophisticated
Casiotone. You have options to sequence
the keys, play mono or polyphonically,
and change the sounds of the synth with
single keystrokes. N o t  a  bad little
package, but a triﬂe limiting in the end.
Good for people who are used to a
musical keyboard!
Synth-64 (Abacus/Adamsoft) is less of
a performance synth or sequencer, but
more of a programmer's aid. It lets you
write music using merely the note letters:
ASS, C, D etc. This is all very nice, but it is a
bit complicated, and as such you'd be
better off programming in BASIC!
Music Composer (Electronic Arts) is
exactly that; a ﬁrst class music composer,
allowing you to compose music on a
stave. When you've done it though, you
can't print out the results and you can't
change the sound of the voices. A bit of an
enigma, this one.
Multisound Synthesiser (Romik) is a
super performance synth/sequencer,
featuring amongst other things, a real-
time play that you don't get with other
computer synthesisers.
But none o f  these are nearly as
comprehensive and user friendly as Music
Master (Supersoft) which is easy to use.
well laid out and well documented.
What's on next month
Interrupts are machine code routines
which give an impression of movement
and sound happening simultaneously. I'll
be explaining all about them, and giving
more detail about synthesis.

HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE
feeling that the program that
you so carefully produced and
then listed is  now unintelli-
gible? This is often due to the
fact that none of the loops are
indented a s  t h e y  a r e ,
automatically, in  some more
advanced BASICs, and that
there are a lot of GOTO and
GOSUB anony mous  l i n e
numbers and the like. If just a
little time and trouble are taken
with y our  longer programs
then it will really pay dividends
when you come to amend or
adapt them later on.
Indenting lines
One useful facility is the ability
to indent lines by a couple of
spaces to indicate the contents
of a FOR-NEXT loop. If you try
to put spaces in then normally
the interpreter w ill remove
them when listing the program
and your efforts will have been
in vain. However, try either of
these 'tips':
(1) Put a colon after each line
number. Now any spaces
that y ou p u t  after t he
colon will be retained so
you can indent as much as
you like, but the responsi-
bility for how much and
when you indent is yours.
This method also has the
advantage that y ou can
enter spare line numbers
(complete with colons) to
separate portions of code
which makes it all more
readable. Although this
consumes a  little mor e
space, y ou w ill ﬁnd i t
worthwhile.
(2) Try putting a  graphics
character immediately
after t h e  lin e  number.
Probably the easiest is the
diamond (  C.; )  which is
immediately next t o  the
SHIFT key and which is
generated by SHIED-Z. On
listing, you will ﬁnd the
graphics character does
not show but your inden-
tations remain. If you edit
the line you will have to
remember to re-insert the

graphics character immed-
iately a f t e r  t h e  l i n e
number as well.
Labelling line numbers
Another trick that some users
have not yet discovered is the
following. T h e  interpreter
within t h e  C o m m o d o r e
machines, when faced with a
line number following a GOTO
or a GOSUB, will evaluate it as
far as the ﬁrst non-numeric
character but does not then
generate a  syntax error if  it
meets text immediately after
the line number. Therefore a
statement such as:
10 GOSUB 1000 'ROUNDING
ROUTINE
is not illegal and will work
without generating an error.
Whether this makes it a 'legal'
construction is  a nice point!
Knowing this means that the
programmer can now label all
of thos e anonymous l i n e
numbers with a function. O f
course you can do this already
with a  c olon a n d  a  REM
statement b u t  this  has t he
disadvantage that you cannot
put another statement on the
same line as everything after
the REM token is disregarded
by the interpreter. If you follow
this approach then you can
label line numbers and still put
other statements on the same
line. Howev er, i t  i s  y our
responsibility t o  ensure that
the name you attach as a label
and the name that you append
to t h e  subroutine hav e t o
match up with each other.
Reverse REMS
Finally, here are some routines
that will go through your entire
program and will print out your
REM statements i n  reverse.
When you look at a program
which is properly REMmed you
can then immediately pick out
the important parts of the code
and follow the construction
process.
Lines 60000-60060 ar e a
BASIC version. Append these
lines to your program and then
RUN 60000. The program will
take about 10 seconds for every
1K o f  program resident i n
memory. When y ou list the
result you will see that every
statement following the REM
token appears in reverse. Then
delete t he subroutine fr om
lines 60000-60060.
Lines 61000-61260 ar e a
machine-code version of the
above complete with disas-
sembly. This is read into the
cassette b u f f e r  a n d  t h e n
activated w i t h  a  SYS 828
although a n y  ot her  (safe)
location will do. T o remove
REMS then replace the reverse
token (18 in line 61230) with a
space (32 decimal). This will
obviously alter the checksum
as w e ll b y  a n  appropriate
amount.
Conclusion
By combining these tips, it is
surprising how easy it is to turn
lines o f  'spaghetti-like' code
into something readable and
comprehensible. You probably
want your programs not only to
be efﬁcient but capable of easy
maintenance i f  y ou wish to
reconstruct the logic of  the
program and make improve-
ments. These programs work
equally well on a C64 or a VIC
and have been tested out on
both machines.

IF YOU BOUGHT A COMMODORE 16
last Christmas you were one of many,
and y ou may now b e feeling rather
disappointed at the small quantity of good
software that has so far appeared. If so,
cheer up! Large numbers of games are
beginning to hit the market and, although
many of them are rewritten from other
machines, they are none the worse for
that. I have taken a good look at a number
of t h e  ﬁr s t  offer ings  f r o m  t h e
independent software houses and,
although some are poor, several others
are well worth buying. For convenience, I
have grouped them in categories.

Every body wants to own at least one game
based on Space Invaders, and Xargon
Wars, fr om Gremlin Graphics, is  a n
excellent example of its type. Nothing
about the game is  original, yet i t  is
colourful, challenging and addictive.
You shoot from the ground at wave
after wave of aliens — sixteen types in all
— which are intent on bombing you out
of existence. The aliens move in a variety
of ﬂight patterns, so a different strategy is
needed for each screen, and they take
forms which range from meteorites to
giant birds. The chief difﬁculty lies in
avoiding their bombs, which rain down
fast and furious — lightning reactions are
necessary! Xargon Wars is  written in
machine code and shows just what can be
achieved within 16K of memory. It sets a
very high standard for other authors to
emulate.
Tynesoft's Z a p
similar, but now you are also able to move
vertically, up to about a third of the way
up the screen. For some peculiar reason
the aliens are attacking in helicopters,
though later waves change to cubes and
ﬂying saucers. Some of them drop bombs,
which look like letter Z's though the main
problem lies  i n  avoiding t h e  aliens
themselves, as they meander gently from
right to left, gradually getting lower as
they proceed. Rather sneakily, some of
them have been made invulnerable, so

solely on your ﬁrepower. The game is well
conceived, but suffers slightly from a lack
of variety. It is also infuriating that you can

nevertheless it is fast and quite addictive.

At f4.99, Microdeal's Arena 3000 is
quite a bit cheaper than most of the other
games r e v ie w e d .  Y o u r  t a s k  i s
unashamedly to slaughter everything in
sight, after which you start again on a new
screen. There are eight different types of
opponent, each whic h has, its  ow n
pattern of movement, so you must work
out which types must b e  killed ﬁrst
because they present the greatest danger.
Some home i n  o n  y ou with deadly
accuracy, some need more than one hit,
whilst others are really sneaky — they
don't die at once but mutate into different
creatures!
It is a difﬁcult game, but if it gets too
awkward you can employ an assistant to
do the ﬁring whilst you steer, using two
joysticks. There is not much variety in the
game, but it is well programmed, its fast
loader is excellent and it represents good
value for money.
First impressions o f  Anirog's Star
Commander are not favourable, but once
you get into the game you ﬁnd there is
much more to it than meets the eye. You
are in a  three dimensional shooting
gallery, with spaceship targets swooping
erratically towards you. They are difﬁcult
to hit because o f  their unpredictable
motion, but you must beware of wasting
ammunition as you have only eighteen
shots available. These are not replenished
until you reach screen three, so every shot
must count. After the ﬁrst screen, various
hazards appear , inc luding T ar get
Abductors, which limit your scoring, and
a particularly ev il beast c alled a n
Ammunition R aider ,  w h i c h ,  n o t
surprisingly, r aids  y o u r  s toc k  o f
ammunition.
The game certainly grows on you, and
is really not bad at all. It is a refreshing
change from the usual 'ﬁre as fast as you
can' games, and I found it very enjoyable.
By no means original is 3D Time Trek,
also from Anirog. All the usual features of
Star Trek games are here, although the
Klingons, the USS Enterprise and Captain
Kirk are not mentioned by name. It is a
mixture of a strategy game and arcade
game, where you have to search the
galaxy — in this case an 8 x 8 grid — and
destroy any aliens you ﬁnd. Your energy is
limited, so you need to ﬁnd a friendly
planet from time to time to recharge, and
to repair any battle damage. The ship is
fully equipped with navigational and
battle computers, and has long-range
sensors to detect any enemy presence.
The graphics are quite good, without
being 'superb', as  described i n  t h e
cassette insert, b u t  t he game has a
distressing habit of failing to respond
unless keys are pressed repeatedly, and
on several occasions the program 'hung'
completely, so that I had to switch off and
start again. These faults should really have
been put right before the game was
marketed. A shame, as it is otherwise very
good.
Anirog's Minipedes, o n  t he other
hand, is  beautifully programmed b u t
incredibly difﬁc ult! F o r  thos e n o t
acquainted with games of the 'Centipede'
type, let me tell you that you are in a
garden infested with insects, in which, not
surprisingly, nothing but mushrooms will
grow. You have got so fed up with the
situation that you have taken the rather
drastic step of going out to shoot all the
insects —  in particular a rather nasty
multi-segmented thing called a minipede.
Unfortunately, each segment has to be
shot separately if you are to kill the brute.
Meanwhile the other insects are attacking
in droves — or should it be swarms? —
and they are very hard to avoid.
The graphics and colour are good, and
the sound excellent. There are ﬁfteen
different screens, each more difﬁcult than
the last, and I confess I failed to get past
screen two! F or  those o f  y ou w ith
lightning reactions, this game would be
unbeatable. for me it was just too hard!
)odginc
In this section I  have included CRL's
Berks, although it involves a good deal of
shooting as well as dodging. This was my
favourite of all the games reviewed, but
what a silly title! Perhaps the author, Jon
Williams, lives in that county to the west of
London!?
It turns out that Berks are strange little
men, who wander aimlessly around the
screen whilst you, vicious brute that you
are, do your best to wipe them out. They
are protected, however, b y  Drones,
which are diamond-shaped and home in
on you unerringly. The drones cannot be
killed, but only  paralysed for  a  few
seconds. Each screen — of which there
are no fewer than 32 — contains a variety
of obstacles. If you bump into one of
these, or into the perimeter wall, you lose
control for a while, and then the drones
can get you. So your task is to shoot the
berks while dodging the drones and
avoiding the obstacles eas y , really! The
game is  fast, colourful, original and
completely compelling. You should buy it
as soon as possible.
In complete contrast is Lunar Docking
from Tynesoft. The aim of the game is to
collect six fuel pods from a  Planet's
surface and, dodging asteroids and
satellites, to take them to the six open
ports o f  a  large mother-ship orbiting
above. At this stage, the spaceship blasts
off and you start again on a faster level. At
least, that is what is supposed to happen,
but the program has a bug, which kills you
every time you successfully dock a fuel
pod! The game is written mainly in BASIC,
with some machine code routines, and by
altering the BASIC part I was able to get it
to run. It proved quite reasonable, but
should never have been released as it
stands. Quite unforgivable!
Microdeal have taken a similar idea in
their Cuthbert In Space, but they have
turned it into a marvellously entertaining
game, which is varied and calls for real
skill, yet is easy on the lower levels. Your
mother-ship lands on a  succession of
strangely named planets, where you have
to ﬁrst refuel, then collect as much loot as
possible, while avoiding or shooting the
=

nasties which cartwheel across the screen
in both directions. After the looting stage
you take off for another planet, but
further dangers lurk en route, because
your ship sometimes turns out to be
booby-trapped. If this happens you need
to go for  spares, then return t o  the
mother-ships's coordinates before the
time allowed expires. During this phase,
the joystick responds unpredictably,
adding to the challenge. 
•
It is an excellent game, with superb
graphics and sound, and it includes a
high-score table, unlike many of the other
games.
Anirog's Petch is another beautiful
little game, in which you play the title role
— a member of that endangered species,
the Pink Penguins! Your task is to protect
your hoard o f  diamonds by  crushing
wicked Arctic monsters between ic e
cubes. As with all the Anirog games, the
tape is a fast-loader, but this one contains
versions for the Commodore 64 and the
Vic 20 as well as the C16. The C16 game
lacks some of the facilities of the 64
version, but is really very similar and great
fun to play. Large bonuses are available
for killing the monsters quickly and for
lining up your diamonds in a row. The
sound and graphics are excellent, with
beautiful animat ion;  y o u  s hould
certainly add this one to your collection.
With the exception o f  'Zap-em', the
Tynesoft games I have seen are of poor
quality, and Olympiad is no better than
the rest. It is an attempt to cash in on the
success of games such as Decathlon, but it
completely fails to provide any interest or
excitement. There are four ﬁeld events
and four track events, in each of which
you must pound vigorously at the X and Z
keys to increase speed. In the ﬁeld events
you then press the space-bar to release
your shot, javelin o r  whatever. T he
graphics are poor, and the long-jump and
javelin events contain a bug which makes
it impos s ible t o  s uc c eed. M o s t
disappointing!
Flight Path 737 is Anirog's C16 version
of their successful ﬂight simulation game
for the 64 and the VIC, The aim is to take
off safely, clear a range of mountains and
land at a runway on the other side. You
control your speed with the function
keys, and other keys are used for ﬂaps,
undercarriage and ﬁre-extinguishers. The
direction, and the rate of climb or descent
are controlled by the cursor keys, which is
a pity as a joystick would have been
better. There are six difﬁculty levels.
The program is  written largely in
BASIC, which makes it rather slow to
respond t o  t h e  controls, b u t  i t  i s
challenging and fun to play, though more
as a game than a serious ﬂight simulation
exercise.
Classic adventure games o f  the Scot
Adams type are very popular with those
who pride themselves on their lateral
thinking. The large scale text-and-graphic
games, which have had such success on
other machines. are difﬁcult on the C16
because of its limited memory, but text-
only adventures are perfectly possible.
Many people, i n  fac t, think  them
superior. Microdeal have released two
such games, both in the classic style. By
entering t w o- w or d c ommands  —
generally a verb then a noun —  you
progress from room to room, meeting
hazards a n d  ﬁnding c lues  t o  t h e
whereabouts of some sort of treasure.
Mansion Adventure 1  is set in  a  -
haunted house, where you are trying to
ﬁnd the fabled Mansion Diamond and
escape alive, Once I had managed to get
into the house — no mean task — I played
happily  f o r  s o m e  t i m e  u n t i l
suddenly...Crash! Syntax Error in Line 51.
On investigation, line 51 turned out to be
gibberish, as indeed was line 50 as well!
The fault was easy to correct, but there is
no getting away from the fact that it
shouldn't be there at all. I hope Microdeal
will do something about it.
In Williamsburg Adventure 3 you have
been transported to America to do battle
against a mad butcher, evil spirits and the
cops i n  y our search for  the Golden
Horseshoe. This time the program did not
crash, and for less than £4 it is good value
for money . T h e  descriptions a r e
somewhat sparse, b u t  nevertheless I
found it an enjoyable game to play.
The ﬁnal game reviewed, again
published b y  Microdeal, is  Cuthbert
Enters The Tombs Of Doom. This is of the
type known as an arcade adventure,
where you still have to go from room to
room, collecting treasures and avoiding
hazards, but now you use a joystick as in
an arcade game. This particular one is a
real star — it amazes me that they have
managed to cram .

ﬁrst-rate. You need to watch your oxygen
level, keep your lamps ﬁlled and collect as
much booty as possible, while all the time
moving around at great speed. It is far
from easy, yet thoroughly compulsive!
The cassette comes in quite the grandest
packaging I have seen, complete with an
instruction booklet and, for some obscure
reason, a plastic key-ring. It really is good,
and deserves to succeed.
In terms of sales, the C16 has been
much m o r e  successful t h a n  many
software producers expected, and they
are being forced to latch onto this. I
predict that the coming months will see a
large amount of high-quality software,
bearing in mind that it is easily the most
inexpensive home computer o n  the
market. The starter pack is available now
for as little as E80! Remember, too, that
the Plus/4, which will run C16 games, has
also come down in price, increasing the
market further.
Things are looking up. lust watch this
space!

P1us4.nd C16 SOFTWARE ALSO

Mike Roberts' ﬁrst project
our D.I.Y. add-ons series is a
centronics interface for the
Commodore 64.
LAST MONTH'S INTRODUCTION T O
the subject of building your own add-ons
for the C64 told you about all the
preparations you need to make to start.
By now I assume you own a soldering
iron, a pair of pliers, some solder, and
some clippers or wire strippers - because
you need these to construct this month's
project, which is a centronics interface for
the Commodore 64. This interface is
needed because parallel printers are
cheaper, more easily available, and a lot
better than the equivalent Commodore
device. The centronics standard is the
only really standard interface in  the
computer industry. Even so-called
standards, such as the RS232 interface can
cause problems.
The way the interface works is simple -
eight (or even seven) bits of data transmit
the characters t o  t h e printer. Tw o
handshake lin es f o r  information
transmission between the two devices,
and everything grounded. Thus the
minimum conﬁguration is 10 or 11 lines.
However for our purposes we will be
using a 20 way cable for the 10 information
lines and 10 ground lines (one ground line
for each information line - it's safer that
way).
You may b e  wondering what a
handshake line is. Well, one line links the
computer to the printer, and the othpr
goes from the printer to the computer.
When the computer puts data onto the
data lines it pulses its line to the printer to
tell it that it's ready, and waits. When the
printer 'sees' this it reads the data off the
data lines and prints it; the printer then
pulses its handshake line t o tell the
computer to put more data onto the line,
and waits. And so the cycle continues.
The C64's two serial data lines and four
handshake lin es should n o w  b e
converted into the previously discussed
10 I/D lines? But, this is not the case. The
user port is used on the ﬂip side of the
little-used RS232 port on the left hand side
of the C64.
This port is already conﬁgured as a
centronics interface, but Commodore in
their inﬁnite wisdom, decided not to
provide any connection details or driver
software. I hope to remedy this.
The driver software provided is
initialised by the now familiar SYS49152.
E
form A=LISR(1)' or 'PRINT USR(1)% to
stop printing you use USR again, but with
an argument of 0 as in 'PRINT USR(0)' etc.
I chose this system because I wanted a
change from t h e complexities and
limitations of having to open a ﬁle to the
printer; I prefer in most cases the BBC
micro method of printing, and it was
easier for me to program!. One small
point is that the screen goes momentarily
'crazy'. I don't know why this happens,
but I think it is something to do with I/O
priority. If anybody does know about it -
please write to Your Commodore as it
would be a great help. Also anything
printed while print mode is in operation
will be echoed to the screen (although
you can't see it while information is being
transmitted to the printer?).
There are some limitations to this
system, most commercial software may
not run or may need some modiﬁcation.
Construction
Now to connect up. Type in either the
BASIC listing or the assembler listing and
save it somewhere safe: you must load
and run this every time you turn the
computer on.
You need a 36 way male Amphenol
(insulation displacement type) connector,
a 20 way ribbon cable (of any convenient
length -  about two metres is common),
and a 12 way single sided 01 inch edge
connector. Any reputable electronics
supplier should have those in stock but
Tandys, Watford Electronics, and Maplin
can supply them by mail order if you get
into difﬁculty.
Next you must place the cable ﬂat
across the 'teeth' i n  the Amphenol
connector making sure that the red strips
in the cable is going to be gripped by pin 1
(the front of the connector is numbered).
At this point you will notice that there are
16 spare connections on the Amphenol
connector. Do not fear, nobody is really
sure why they are there but they're
harmless. When the cable is ﬁrmly in
place, the back of the connector must be
pressed on. This is an irreversible action
and must be right ﬁrst time.
At the other end of the cable you must
separate out all the wires for about three
inches and strip the insulation. Now,
every alternate wire must be separated.
The odds (ie. the wires that start with the
red strips) are data lines and the others are
the ground lines. The ground lines must
all be soldered together in two bunches
onto pins A and N (all alpha designations
and positions on the user port are in the
back of  the manual). Next you must
connect the pins of the Amphenol and
the edge connector in the following
sequence:
B — 11
C — 2
D — 3
E —  4
F —  5
H — 6
I
K — 8
L —  9
M— 1
Now, all you have to do is plug everything
in and off you go.

Dave Crisp gets up-to-date
with the latest in diary
systems for the Commodore
64.
DIARY SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY IN
vogue and, thus, are now included in the
ﬁrmware of many PCs. The value to the
user of such a system depends largely
upon t h e  individual b u t  I  think  the
advantage of a computer-based diary is
lost if it is not kept continually on-line.
The two packages reviewed here are
very different. They are Desk Diary from
AZAD and CBM-64-Diary, from Handic of
Stockholm. Both systems compete quite
well with similar systems which I have
seen running on much larger machines
than the Commodore EA,
Desk Diary
This comes on two discs (program and
data) and is  accompanied by  a  truly
comprehensive and professionally
presented user guide (50 pages, including
a workable index).
Once the program is loaded, the user
is asked to enter a password followed by
the date and time. In fact, the time is of
little value since it never coincides with
your watch; it loses time as the system
initialises.
Apart from recording appointments,
names and addresses, personal memos,
etc., it can record quarterly expenditure,
income tax and bank details. It maintains
records on a quarterly basis since the data
disc is only able to accept one quarter at a
time. The software also interfaces with
Easy File, Easy Calc and Easy Script (2-way
compatible) w hic h s hould mak e i t
additionally attractive t o  Commodore
software users.
An 'appointments window', situated at
the t op right o f  the opening menu,
provides for a rolling display of 10 days
records, with display starting from the
Sunday prior to the date entered on load-
up. The pointer is easily manipulated by
the cursor control keys. Similarly, '+' and
'-' commands allow the window to jump
ahead or back in sets of 10 days.
Entries ar e easily maintained and
inserted. They are saved to disc or created
in Easy Script format by use of the F2 and
E
 F8 keys respectively.
Other data items are created and held
just a s  easily, although t her e a r e
restrictions on the amount that can be
held (e.g. only 4 pages are devoted to
telephone numbers and addresses). But

64-Diary
there should be sufﬁcient space available
for even the most devoted diarist.
The search and analysis facilities are
comprehensive, allowing for event recall
as well as date and text searches.
AZAD claim that entries can be made
as far  i n  advance as 1992, although
calendars are available as far ahead as
2057.
The system is written in 6502 assembly
language to keep up performance levels
and is completely menu drive. The screen
layouts are both clear and precise.
Overall, this is a sophisticated and
potentially useful addition to any small
computer conﬁguration.
CBM-64 Diary
This package is neatly marketed and, as
with t h e  majority o f  cartridge-based
systems, loads almost instantaneously.
The manual is very sparse but the software
is so easy to run and use that a detailed
manual is hardly necessary.
64-Diary is more a data storage and
retrieval system than a fully-ﬂedged diary.
Data is held in blocks (10 lines of 27
characters) and is entered and retrieved as
free-form strings The user can optionally
use block numbers (think of a block as a
screenful) or dates as keys to records. Text
searches are quick and responsive.
.1US I N ESS
LE
This system does not pretend to be as
all-encompassing as Desk Diary but, if you
merely need to store data and dates (on an
annual basis), it is simple to use and fairly
versatile.
Conclusion
On balance, Desk Diary offers greater
value for  money since it offers more
comprehensive services. But the system is
a little cumbersome and requires regular
maintenance t o  ensure that the best
possible results are achieved. Your choice
of system must depend on the use to
which you are to put the package.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all, for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it  will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — its a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the lea] thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products inclucle the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The \ROME cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands, or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publisil games
programs, and with classics like STK QUINX
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most envoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer—
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
