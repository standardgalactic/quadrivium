Dedication
For Frank, the brightest and most enduring star in my life.
Author’s Acknowledgments
When I was introduced to Visio nearly ten years ago, I was instantly
impressed with the product. Visio was a fresh and creative answer to the
drawing and diagramming challenges many business professionals faced. It
was unique; nothing like it existed in the marketplace. The fact that Visio has
survived the demands of a frenzied, fickle, and often unforgiving high-tech
software industry is a testament to its quality, innovation, and usefulness. 
Not only was I impressed with the product, I was bowled over by the quality
and dedication of the people at Visio Corporation (then the owner of Visio).
Throughout the process of writing three books on Visio, I found the people at
Visio Corporation an invaluable resource — some of the finest, dedicated,
top-notch professionals I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Stacy
Dellas, Charlie Zaragoza, and Lorrin Smith-Bates, all top Visio corporate train-
ers, were always available to teach, demonstrate, and answer questions.
Their contributions to my earlier Visio books still carry through to this edi-
tion of Visio 2003 For Dummies, my fourth book on this product. 
Today Visio is owned by Microsoft Corporation. I would first like to thank
Carla Hartwig, a Microsoft Product Manager for Visio, who provided much-
needed details about Visio 2003 before its release and who continues to keep
me updated on the product. At Wiley, I’d like to thank Terri Varveris, acquisi-
tions editor, for giving me the opportunity to update my earlier book, Visio
2000 For Dummies. I credit Terri for recognizing the need in the marketplace
for this update. My sincerest thanks go to Susan Pink, project and copy editor
extraordinaire! Not only does she have excellent editing skills, she has the
calm, in-control, unflappable personality that makes the editing process for
the author so much easier. Susan often went above and beyond the call of
duty; she is a real pro. Thanks, also, to Allen Wyatt, technical editor, whose
dedication to accuracy helped make this book technically reliable. And
finally, I offer my heartfelt thanks to my husband, Frank, who was not only
endlessly supportive throughout this process but spent countless hours cre-
ating Visio drawings, testing Visio functions, and capturing figures for this
edition of the book. I couldn’t have completed this book on time without his
help. My deepest thanks to all of you for your dedication to excellence!

Introduction
O
kay, relax! I know as well as you do that you’re not a dummy. But you
may feel like one when it comes to using Visio — or any other software
program you’re not familiar with. Let’s face it: No one is an expert with every
computer program. And no one wants to feel like a dummy. That’s what’s so
great about For Dummies books. They show you just what you need to know
so you don’t feel like a dummy anymore.
Visio can be a fun program to use, but it can also be intimidating at first. Why?
Because there are so darn many types of diagrams, and we don’t have a clue
what some of them mean! (We’d all like to think we know, but the truth is, we
don’t.) The good news is, you don’t need to. All you need to know is how to
create diagrams that make sense for you, for your specialty, for your industry.
I am thrilled to be updating Visio 2000 For Dummies, published in July of 2000.
Since then, Visio has been through big changes, not the least of which was
the purchase of Visio by Microsoft Corporation. With the release of Visio 2003,
Visio officially becomes part of the Microsoft Office suite of products, and
future releases will be launched in sync with other Office products. Visio 2003
has undergone some exciting changes and incorporated great new features.
This book brings you up-to-date on the latest advances for Visio and gives
you tips on using Visio with other programs.

Pay attention to the title of this book: If you are a programmer, this book is
probably not for you! If you’re “one of the rest of us” (and we’re definitely in the
majority!), this book is just what you need. You probably have a job to do —
and I’m betting it’s not to pore over the minute details of Visio’s inner work-
ings so you can impress your friends with your vast knowledge. You probably
just want to find out enough about Visio so you can make drawings that
enhance the job you do, not become it.
With this in mind, Visio 2003 For Dummies is designed to make you produc-
tive as quickly as possible. You find basic, useful information that helps you
accomplish your goals. You find real-world examples and figures that show
you how to do something rather than just tell you. You find concise step-by-
step instructions for accomplishing specific tasks rather than a lot of ram-
bling text that fills space and means nothing to you.

Visio 2003 For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
Here’s a summary of the conventions used in this book:
 When directions indicate that you type something, for example, “Enter 13
in the size box,” the characters you type appear in bold.
 When I write click, I mean to click your left mouse button. If you need to
right-click, I specify right-click.
 When I write drag, I mean to click and hold the left mouse button as
you move the mouse. Release the mouse button when you’re finished
dragging.
 The term shortcut menu refers to the pop-up menu that appears when
you right-click something on the screen. (Shortcut menus are not avail-
able for all elements in a drawing.)
 You can select commands using toolbar buttons, menu commands, or
the Alt key. Because toolbar buttons are by far the fastest method, I
always list them along with the menu command. (When toolbar buttons
aren’t available, I list only the menu command.) I specify a menu com-
mand by writing, for example, Choose File➪Save, which means click the
File menu to open it and then choose the Save option.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re new to Visio and just want to know enough to create simple draw-
ings or diagrams, you can safely skip Part IV. That section takes you deeper
into customizing Visio and using some of its advanced features. Clearly, not
every reader will become devoted to discovering advanced features. Browse
through Part III for any features that you might find useful and have the time
to work through. Also glance through Part V, which contains many interest-
ing tips, tricks, and trivia that you might find very useful.
On the other hand, if you’ve used Visio before, you can safely skip Parts I and
II, which offer basic getting-up-and-running information.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you have a reasonable working knowledge of Microsoft Windows.
For this reason, I don’t spend any of your valuable time in Chapter 1 describ-
ing how to find your way around Windows or how to work with dialog boxes.
If you need to review these concepts, see Windows XP For Dummies, by Andy
Rathbone (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
Visio 2003 For Dummies is organized into five distinct parts. Use the parts to
guide you to where you want to go on your Visio journey. The book is designed
so that you can skip around to suit your needs.
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics
Part I lays the groundwork for your success with Visio. Every software pro-
gram has its unique personality; Visio is no exception. Here you find concep-
tual information about Visio, get the Visio terminology down, discover how to
recognize and work with what’s on the screen, start Visio, save and open files,
and print drawings.
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings
Part II is for those in a hurry because it teaches you the basics of creating a
simple drawing. You find out about the basic elements of a Visio drawing and
how to implement those elements in your drawing. I show you how to add
and manipulate text, as well as how to work with margins and tabs, indenta-
tion, alignment, spacing, and more. You also see how to use and manipulate a
drawing’s connectors, the lines that connect one shape to another. (They’re
more than just simple lines, as you’ll soon discover.)
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to
the Next Level
In Part III you move into the intermediate features of Visio. Find out how to
place shapes precisely on a drawing, create your own shapes, enhance and
manipulate shapes, do more sophisticated stuff with connectors, and work
with pages and layers.
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge
of Visio
Certainly not every user needs to pursue Part IV! Here I show you how to
create custom templates and styles, how to store data in shapes and report
on that data, and how to protect your shapes and drawings from inadvertent
changes. You also see how to use Visio drawings with other programs and
save files for publishing on the Web.

Visio 2003 For Dummies 
Part V: The Part of Tens
One of the most useful sections of every For Dummies book, “The Part of Tens,”
is a collection of a variety of information. In Visio 2003 For Dummies, you find
answers to ten frequently asked questions, ten “can I?” questions, ten “How
to” pointers for useful tasks, ten tips for working successfully with Visio, and
ten pointers to online resources for Visio.
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are used in this text to call attention to specific types of
information.
The Tip icon indicates information that’s likely to save you time or informa-
tion that will make you say to yourself, “Wow, I never knew that!” Be sure to
read this stuff.
Wherever a Technical Stuff icon occurs, I explain in lay terms something that’s
bogged down in technical jargon. (Then again, sometimes the icon just points
out technical trivia.) You won’t find too many of these icons but when you do,
the text is usually worth reading.
Definitely pay attention to the Warning icons. They’re designed to warn you
of impending doom or, at the very least, a possible problem you’d just as
soon avoid.
Remember icons are designed as a gentle nudge rather than a blatant slam
to the head. In other words, “Remember this — it may be important to you
someday.”
I use this funky little icon to point out weird stuff that Visio does every now
and then.
This icon draws attention to the slick new improvements in Visio 2003.

Where to Go from Here
If you’ve never used Visio before, definitely start with Part I! Work your way
through Part II as well, but don’t feel that you must go beyond this point. If
you’ve used Visio before, you might get crazy and start with Part V, skim
Parts I and II and go directly to Parts III and IV to look for any features you
might not be familiar with. Whether you are a beginner or experienced Visio
user, be sure to look through Part V for answers, tips, and pointers to Visio-
related Web sites.

2003 Basics

In this part . . .
S
o your boss says you have to make a Visio drawing
and you barely even know what Visio is? Well, this is
the place to start.  
Maybe you’ve seen other drawing programs. Visio, how-
ever, is a different animal. It’s not really a drawing pro-
gram, and it’s certainly not a CAD program (thank
goodness!). In this part, you understand what Visio is and
what it does, you discover how to “speak” and “think”
Visio, you negotiate your way around the screen, and you
ﬁnd out how to get help when you need it. You also print a
drawing, something you’ll no doubt ﬁnd useful if you want
to be productive!

lose your eyes for a minute and picture the amount of visual information
that comes to you on any given day. Magazines, newspapers, reports, tele-
vision programs, and presentations illustrate a great deal of information in the
form of charts, tables, graphs, diagrams, and technical drawings. These graph-
ical elements often convey ideas far more quickly and clearly than long, boring
paragraphs. You don’t typically think of charts, diagrams, and graphs as art,
but they are graphical, and this is where Visio comes in.
Although Visio is easy to use, you can benefit from a bit of explanation before
you jump right in creating drawings. In this chapter, you become familiar with
what you see on the Visio screen and find out how Visio works conceptually.
Getting the Scoop on Visio
In simple terms, Visio is a diagramming tool for business professionals, many
of whom are self-confirmed non-artists. Although Visio is often referred to as
a drawing tool, it isn’t one, because it requires no artistic ability. It’s more accu-
rate to say that Visio is a diagramming tool. That’s reassuring because even in
highly analytical, non-art-related careers, you may be called upon to create a
chart, diagram, or — perish the thought — a drawing! If the suggestion of draw-
ing anything strikes terror in your heart, Visio can help.

Visio’s grab bag of icons — or shapes, as Visio calls them — represents all sorts
of things from computer network components, to office furniture, to boxes on
an organization chart or a flow chart, to electrical switches and relays. You
simply drag the shapes that you want into the drawing window and arrange
and connect them the way that you want. You can add text and other graphi-
cal elements wherever you like.
For those of you with a computer-aided design background, don’t think CAD
with Visio! Although the finished product — a drawing — may look similar,
Visio and CAD-based systems are different animals. If you’re a self-confirmed
CAD snob, that’s okay, but don’t underestimate or misunderstand Visio. Visio
and CAD-based systems have different purposes and work entirely differently.
Comparing Visio products
Over the years, Visio has been available in several different flavors — Standard,
Professional, Technical, and Enterprise — plus you could find advanced devel-
oper’s tools in Visual Studio .NET and advanced network diagramming tools
in Visio Enterprise Network Tools. Whew! All these versions became confus-
ing and overwhelming to the average user, so Microsoft decided to simplify
things and produce just two editions of Visio: Standard and Professional. The
same “engine” drives both, but the audience for each is slightly different and
the types of charts and diagrams you can create address different needs:
 Visio Standard: Designed for business professionals, this edition gives all
kinds of business people — from product managers to financial analysts
to sales and marketing professionals — the ability to create business-
related charts and diagrams that illustrate business processes, market-
ing trends, organizations, project schedules, and so on.
 Visio Professional: Designed for technical users, this edition includes
everything that Visio Standard includes and more. Network managers
and designers, electrical engineers, IT managers, facilities planners,
Internet specialists, Web designers and administrators, and software
developers can use Visio Professional to create charts and diagrams
that illustrate a wide variety of technical concepts and processes.
So how do you know which Visio is right for you? If you’re involved in net-
works, IT, Internet or Web design, electrical engineering, architecture facili-
ties planning and management, or software development, Visio Professional
is the edition to use because it provides all the shapes and symbols you need
to create simple or complex diagrams. If you’re not involved in any of these
fields but are a business professional involved in company sales, profits, mar-
keting, or managing projects, Visio Standard is right for you. It includes all
the shapes you need to create business-related charts, diagrams, and draw-
ings, without cluttering your screen with shapes you’ll never use (such as a
proximity limit switch or a guided light transmitter).
10
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

A quick peek at some Visio features
Visio is often a misunderstood product, especially by those who’ve never used
it. It’s amusing to hear people say “Oh, Visio. That’s that org chart software,
isn’t it?” That’s like saying, “Oh, a Ferrari. That’s a little Italian car, right?”
Well, that’s definitely an understatement!
Although Visio is a whiz at creating organization charts, that facility only
scratches the surface of its capabilities and sophistication. The following
list describes some of the things you can do with Visio:
 Report on data: Wouldn’t it be great if you could store data in a draw-
ing and then report on that data? With Visio, you can. Suppose you
draw an office layout plan that includes cubicle walls, fixtures, office
furniture, and telephone and computer equipment. You can store each
piece of furniture and office equipment with data such as its inventory
number, owner, and current location. Each computer equipment shape
can include data about the manufacturer, hardware configuration, and
Internet address assigned to it. From this drawing, you can generate
property, inventory, and location reports. (See Chapter 13 for more
information on storing and reporting on data in shapes.)
 Generate drawings from data: In contrast to the previous point, wouldn’t
it be great to be able to generate drawings from existing data? Again,
with Visio, you can. Suppose you have employee data (name, title, depart-
ment, reporting manager, and so on) stored in a text or spreadsheet file.
You can generate an organization chart automatically from this data using
Visio. Or suppose you manage projects and you have project tasks and
durations stored in a spreadsheet or Microsoft Project file. You can auto-
matically generate a Gantt chart from this data using Visio. If you use
Microsoft Outlook, you can also bring data stored in Outlook into Visio
and generate a calendar. (See Chapter 14 for more information on using
external data in Visio.)
 Use hyperlinks: Often, you can’t convey in a single drawing all the infor-
mation necessary to make your point. You might want to refer the reader
to a separate drawing, a Web site, or another document with related infor-
mation. With Visio, you can add hyperlinks to a drawing or shape. This
is an invaluable feature for pulling pieces of information together to pre-
sent a comprehensive picture. (I discuss this feature in more detail in
Chapter 14.)
 Use the drill-down feature: Jump quickly from an overview drawing to a
detailed drawing and back again. For example, you can draw an overview
map of a worldwide computer network and double-click the name of a
city to see a drawing of that city’s computer network. This drill-down
feature is possible because Visio lets you define a shape’s behavior
when you double-click it. (See Chapter 13 for more information.)
11
Chapter 1: Visio 101

Visio also provides impressive interoperability with other applications. You can
 Include clip art, figures, photos, sound, video, or objects from other pro-
grams in a Visio drawing.
 Create drawings, diagrams, and charts in Visio that you can later export
to programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
Word, and Microsoft Access.
 Save Visio drawings as HTML files and upload them to the Internet, or
incorporate Visio drawings into Web pages.
What’s new in Visio 2003?
Visio began as a straightforward business diagramming tool and steadily grew
into a more sophisticated tool for creating highly technical and complex dia-
grams. While retaining all this sophistication, Visio 2003 gets back to basics
by focusing on improving the fundamental capabilities of the product, expand-
ing the business diagramming features, and making the program as easy to
use as possible for new users.
Here are some of the new features in Visio 2003 Standard:
 A new brainstorming template that allows you to quickly and easily cap-
ture and organize random ideas
 A new drawing category for business process management, the emerg-
ing discipline that helps managers reduce costs by increasing efficiency
in business processes
 The capability to add employee pictures to organization charts, as well
as show dotted-line relationships between employees
 The capability to bring schedule information from Microsoft Outlook
into Visio and create a customized calendar — and add calendar art
In addition to the preceding features, Visio 2003 Professional includes
 New network templates (for detailed networks and rack diagrams) to
illustrate complex telecommunication and computer networks
 Updated and improved network shapes that reflect current market trends
 Updated and improved electrical engineering and building plan shapes
 A Microsoft Windows XP user interface template that lets developers
prototype new user interfaces
12
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

 Enhancements to the Web site template that let you create more com-
pact diagrams, edit shape text, and add new shapes, all much more
quickly than in Visio 2002
 A new startup wizard for creating space plans
It’s beyond the scope of this book to discuss all of Visio 2003’s new features.
Refer to Visio 2003 Bible (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.)
Familiarizing Yourself with Visio Lingo
Like all software programs, Visio uses a particular terminology. You need to
be familiar with the following terms before you begin creating diagrams and
drawings:
 Drag and drop: The method Visio uses to create drawings. What are you
dragging and where are you dropping it, you ask? You drag shapes and
you drop them onto a drawing page.
 Shape: Probably the most important element in Visio. A shape represents
an object of nearly any conceivable kind, such as a piece of office furni-
ture in an office-layout diagram, a road sign in a directional map, a server
in a network diagram, a box on an organization chart, or a bar on a com-
parison chart. Visio contains literally thousands of shapes. You can draw
and save your own shapes, too, as I show you in Chapter 8.
 Master shape: A shape that you see on a stencil. When you drag a shape
onto the drawing page, you’re copying a master shape onto your drawing
page, making it just one instance of that shape. Visio makes the distinction
between master shapes and instances of shapes. But my advice is, don’t
clutter your mind with a trivial detail like this.
 Stencil: A tool Visio uses to organize shapes so that you can find the one
you’re looking for. A stencil is nothing more than a collection of related
shapes. If you want to create a cubicle-layout diagram for your office, for
example, you use the cubicles stencil, which includes shapes such as
workstations, posts, panels, work surfaces, storage units, and file cabi-
nets. Stencils are displayed in the Shapes pane on the left side of the
screen so that the shapes are always available while you’re working.
 Template: A collection of stencils in addition to predefined document
settings. A template is essentially a model for creating a particular type
of drawing. A template defines certain characteristics of the drawing so
that the drawing is consistent. For example, when you use a Visio tem-
plate for a specific type of drawing, Visio automatically opens one or more
appropriate stencils, defines the page size and scale of your drawing, and
13
Chapter 1: Visio 101

defines appropriate styles for things such as text, fills, and lines. You can
change any of these elements, but the point of using a template is to main-
tain consistency throughout the drawing. After all, your drawing may
include several pages, and you want them to look as if they go together.
 Connector: A line that connects one shape to another. Perhaps the most
common example of a connector is in an organization chart. The lines
that connect the president to various groups in an organization and the
lines that run through an organization are connectors. I tell you more
about connectors in Chapter 6, but for now this definition is all you need
to remember.
Jumping Head First into Visio
The best way to get started with Visio is to open a new drawing page, so you
can cruise around the screen and get a feel for what’s there. Then in Chapter 2,
you create a drawing.
To start Visio, follow these steps:
1. From your Windows desktop, choose Start➪All Programs.
2. Choose Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Visio 2003.
Visio displays the screen shown in Figure 1-1.
Take a look at what’s shown on this screen:
 Category: The Category list shows sixteen items. These items represent
the broad areas of drawing types, such as block diagrams, flowcharts,
charts and graphs, and Web diagrams. When you select a category, the
list of templates changes.
 Template: Within each category are a variety of templates (anywhere
from two to two dozen) to choose from. Each one represents a different
type of drawing in the broader category. For instance, in the broad cate-
gory of Block Diagram, you can choose a template for creating a Basic
Diagram, a Block Diagram, or a Block Diagram with Perspective. Most
templates are available in metric or U.S. units of measure. When you
click a category name, the list of available templates changes.
 Getting Started: The pane on the right side of the screen is labeled
Getting Started, but the label changes depending on where you’re
working in Visio. For instance, when you select a template to create
a drawing, the title changes to Template Help. If you choose Help➪
Microsoft Office Visio Help after you’re working on a drawing, the title
changes to Visio Help. This can be confusing at first. I show you more
about using the Help pane later in this chapter.
14
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

Getting familiar with the Visio screen
A typical Visio screen looks like the one shown in Figure 1-2. This screen is
displayed when you select the Block Diagram category and the Basic Diagram
(US units) template. In this section, you look at what’s going on in this screen.
The screen is still divided into three primary areas:
 Shapes pane: On the left side of the screen, this pane contains three
open stencils: Backgrounds, Borders and Titles, and Basic Shapes. Visio
opens these automatically as part of the Block Diagram template.
 Drawing window: Resembling graph paper, this area is bounded by
rulers on the top and the left, and by scroll bars on the bottom and the
right. To the left of the bottom scroll bar is the navigation area, which
displays tabs for each page in the drawing.
 Template Help: This is the infamous changing pane, labeled Getting
Started in Figure 1-1. Now that a drawing category and template have
been selected, this pane offers help on block diagram templates.

Chapter 1: Visio 101

The Visio menu bar appears at the top of the window under the title bar. Below
the menu bar are two open toolbars: the Standard and Formatting toolbars.
The status bar, which provides information about your drawing, appears along
the bottom of the drawing window. When a shape in a drawing is selected, the
status bar displays the shape’s width, height, and angle.
Checking out the menus
Visio’s menu bar contains some typical menus found in almost every Windows
application (such as File, Edit, Format, and Help). Even so, I suggest you review
the contents of each menu for commands that you may not expect. The follow-
ing list describes commands unique to Visio (even though some of the menus
might look familiar):
 Tools: On this menu you find all kinds of tools for working with Visio
shapes, the Visio drawing page, and the drawing itself. There are tools
for setting Visio’s color palette, rulers, grids, and so on. You find also the
standard Microsoft options such as Spelling, Track Markup, Customize,
and Options.

Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

 Shape: The Shape menu contains commands for grouping, rotating, flip-
ping, and aligning as well as commands for choosing a drawing’s color
scheme. You also find commands for changing the stacking order of
shapes and doing some creative things such as fragmenting and inter-
secting shapes. (See Chapter 8 for details.)
The options on the Shape menu change depending on the type of draw-
ing you’re creating.
For certain types of drawings, Visio adds an additional menu to the menu
bar. For example, when you create a Gantt chart using a Project Schedule
template, Visio adds a Gantt Chart menu just after the Shape menu and
before the Window menu (see Figure 1-3). On the Gantt Chart menu, you
find commands specific to creating Gantt charts, such as adding and deleting
tasks, linking tasks, and setting working hours. Other types of drawings that
add a menu to the menu bar are Brainstorming, Database, Building Plan,
Organization Chart, and Process Engineering. The options on these menus
are specific to the type of drawing you create. As soon as you close the
drawing, the menu option disappears.

Chapter 1: Visio 101

Working with toolbars
Visio has a dozen or so toolbars, two of which are displayed automatically
when you start the program. The two default toolbars are Standard and
Formatting. You can hide either of these, and you can display additional
toolbars as well.
After you begin to recognize the toolbar buttons, it’s much faster to click a
button than select a menu command. I list a lot of these buttons on the Cheat
Sheet at the beginning of this book.
Throughout this book, I try to maximize the drawing window shown in each
figure by displaying only the necessary toolbars.
To hide or display toolbars, right-click anywhere in the toolbar area. On the
shortcut menu that appears, click a toolbar name. Toolbars that have a check
mark next to them are displayed; all others are hidden (see Figure 1-4).
All Visio toolbars can be docked at different locations on the screen. Just grab
the vertical bar at the left end of any toolbar and drag it to a new location on
the screen. A moved toolbar automatically becomes its own window, and you
can position it anywhere you like on the screen by dragging its title bar.

Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

If you’re a toolbar fanatic, you might want to customize the toolbars by adding
buttons you use most often and deleting buttons you never use. You can also
choose any buttons you want and create a new toolbar.
Creating a toolbar
To create a custom toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize.
Visio displays the Customize dialog box.
2. On the Toolbars tab, click the New button.
Visio displays the New Toolbar dialog box.
3. In the Toolbar Name field, type a name (see Figure 1-5), and then click
the OK button.
Visio adds the new name to the list of toolbars and displays a new, blank
toolbar on the screen. (It’s small, but it’s there!)
Figure 1-5:
You can add
and delete

buttons or

19
Chapter 1: Visio 101

4. If you want to add buttons to the new toolbar, drag and drop the new
blank toolbar into the toolbar area, and then follow the steps in the
next section “Modifying a toolbar.”
5. Click Close to close the Customize dialog box.
Modifying a toolbar
If you just want to add a button here or there, consider modifying an existing
toolbar rather than creating a new one. Either way, follow these steps to add
buttons to any toolbar:
1. Display the toolbar that you want to change.
To do so, right-click the toolbar area and select the toolbar.
2. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
Visio displays the Customize dialog box.
3. Click the Commands tab.
Categories are on the left and commands are on the right, as shown in
Figure 1-6.
4. Click a category on the left, and then scroll through the list of com-
mands (buttons) on the right.
5. Drag the button from the dialog box to the location on the toolbar
where you want the button to be added.
Yes, that’s right. Drag it right out of the Customize dialog box and onto
the toolbar! When you release the mouse button, the new button becomes
part of the existing toolbar at the point where you dropped it.
Figure 1-6:

toolbar on
the left and
buttons on

20
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

Deleting a button from a toolbar
To remove a button from a toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Display the toolbar that you want to change.
2. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
Visio displays the Customize dialog box.
3. Drag the button that you want to delete off the toolbar.
If you want to delete additional buttons, repeat this step.
4. Click the Close button to close the Customize dialog box.
Getting Help When You Need It
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by too many people offering advice and
assistance? Well, you might feel that way with Visio 2003: Help is so abun-
dant, you might not be sure where to turn first.
In this section I cover a lot of options for getting help. Don’t let all this infor-
mation overwhelm you! The best way to work with Visio Help is by exploring
it and trying new things. With practice, you’ll become quite adept!
Using the Help pane
In this section, you start with the concept of a Help pane, which Visio dis-
plays automatically on the right side of the screen. In Figure 1-1, for example,
the pane is labeled Getting Started. In Figure 1-7, the same pane is labeled
Visio Help. To display this pane, choose Help➪Microsoft Office Visio Help.
When you first start Visio, the Help pane progresses through these three steps:
 Getting Started: This is the help you get when you start Visio.
 Template Help: This help is available after you select a drawing
template.
 Visio Help: This help pane appears when you click Help➪
Microsoft Office Visio Help.
The Back, Forward and Home buttons help you navigate the Help screens
you’ve visited. These screens are like a filmstrip. The Back button moves
backward through the filmstrip, Forward moves forward, and Home button
takes you to the beginning: Getting Started.
21
Chapter 1: Visio 101

It’s a bit of a misnomer to use the name Help pane because the pane is used also
as a Reviewing pane, a Clip Art pane, and more. When used for something other
than Help, the Forward and Back buttons take you to whatever information you
displayed recently. To switch the pane from a Help pane to display something
other than help, click the down arrow at the right end of the pane’s title bar.
Let’s focus on the Visio Help pane, as shown in Figure 1-6, because this is the
one you will use most often. In the Assistance section, you can type any ques-
tion and Visio will display a list of possible solutions from its local Visio help
files. Click whatever interests you and the answer is displayed in a separate
window, including step-by-step instructions if they apply.
To broaden your search for answers on the Internet, click any of the icons in
the Microsoft Office Online section — Assistance, Training, Communities, or
Downloads — and connect directly to the appropriate Microsoft Web page.
(Of course, you must have live access to the Internet to use these Help
options.) Each one opens in a separate window. Here’s a brief description
of what you’ll find:

 Assistance: Takes you directly to Microsoft’s assistance page for any
Office product, including Visio. This page includes hints, tips, articles,
templates, clip art, and more. Whatever you’re looking for, you can prob-
ably find it here.
 Training: This is a slick new feature that actually talks to you for the
first few pages and then launches you on your own to learn how to use
various Visio functions.
 Communities: Click here to go to the Microsoft Office Newsgroups Web
page, where you can share information with other users worldwide
about Visio or any other Office product.
 Downloads: Click here to check for updates and other downloads for
any Microsoft Office product, including Visio.
When you’re finished with any of these Web pages, just click the X in the
upper-right corner to close the window.
When you find some great help online that you’d like to refer to at another
time, choose Favorites➪Add to Favorites on your Web browser, and then
select a folder where you want to save the Web page.
As if you don’t have enough options in the Help pane, remember that you can
always return to Visio’s menu bar and click the Help menu there. (I warned you
that Help was excessive!) The Help menu includes some options not found in
the Help pane:
 Getting Started Tutorial: Click here if you want a step-by-step guide that
walks you through Visio. (Technically, this is not truly a tutorial because
you don’t create a drawing. Instead, you find out about the process for
creating a drawing.)
 Diagram Gallery: This is a great place to look if you don’t know what
type of drawing to select. It gives you examples of many different types
of Visio diagrams so you can decide which one is best for conveying
your information.

Want to make your voice heard
without ever speaking a word?
If you want to help Microsoft continually
improve Visio, consider participating in the
Customer Experience Improvement Program.
This program offers a way for you to give anony-
mous feedback to Microsoft about how well
Visio is working for you and meeting your needs
as an individual user. To participate or to find
out more about this program, choose Help➪
Customer Feedback Options. (If you want to
speak your mind and prefer not to be anony-
mous, you can always drop Microsoft a line by
choosing Help➪Contact Us.)

Don’t forget tool tips
Like most Windows programs, Visio also uses tool tips. When you point to a
button on a toolbar and hover over it (pause without clicking), a tip pops up
to tell you the name of the button. This is especially helpful when you’re learn-
ing Visio.
Visio expanded the concept of tool tips to its stencils. When you hover over a
stencil shape, a tip pops up and gives the name of the shape and a description,
as shown in Figure 1-8.
If you don’t want to view tool tips or stencil tips, choose Tools➪Options,
and then click the View tab. Click to remove the check mark from Toolbar
ScreenTips and Other ScreenTips, and then click OK.
Closing Visio
When you’re ready to close Visio, choose File➪Exit. If you haven’t recently
saved all open files, Visio prompts you to do so for each file. Choose Yes to
save or Cancel to return to Visio without saving the drawing.

V
isio is a powerful program with many sophisticated features. It can
be intimidating at first, but it doesn’t have to be if you begin at the
beginning — with a simple drawing.
In this chapter, you find out the standard way to create a simple drawing,
bring shapes in, and move around on the screen. You also discover how to
create drawings using different methods and how to save a drawing and
reopen it later.
Creating a Drawing the Standard Way
Although you can create a drawing in several ways (which you learn about
later in this chapter), Visio makes the standard way as easy as possible by
guiding you through the choices.

To create a drawing, follow these steps:
1. If Visio is not already running, choose Start➪Programs➪
Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Visio 2003.
The opening screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
2. On the left side of the screen, click a category.
In the Template area, Visio displays a sample of the types of drawings,
diagrams, or charts available in that category. Use the scroll bar, if nec-
essary, to display all available templates.
3. Click a template.
Visio creates a new drawing page. One or more stencils are automati-
cally opened on the left side of the screen (see Figure 2-2, which displays
an Audit diagram).
Now you’re ready to create a drawing. Notice that the mouse pointer on the
screen is an arrow. Visio automatically selects the Pointer Tool button on the
Standard toolbar when you start a new drawing. You discover more about
using this tool later in the chapter.

Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing
Where’s the template?
You might think of a template as a visible form
with blanks or boxes to be filled in. In Visio, a
template can be confusing to a new user
because there isn’t anything to see. Instead, the
template sets up your drawing for the type of
drawing you want to create. For example, if you
choose Marketing Charts and Diagrams as your
template (from the Charts and Graphs cate-
gory), Visio automatically does the following:
 Opens five stencils (Marketing Diagrams,
Marketing Shapes, Charting Shapes, Back-
grounds, Borders & Titles) on the screen.
These can appear in any order.
 Sets the drawing page size to 8 1⁄2 x 11, the
page orientation to Portrait, and the draw-
ing scale to 1:1
 Chooses an appropriate font, point size, and
color
 Chooses a variety of other settings such
as line color and width, shadow position,
text alignment, and bullet or numbering
style

Working with Stencils
When you choose a drawing category and template, Visio automatically opens
the stencils you need to create your drawing. But you’re not limited to the
stencils that open automatically. You can close some and open others, as I
discuss later in this chapter. For now, you see how stencils work and what
you can do with them.
Moving and arranging stencils
Most templates automatically open more than one stencil. Figure 2-3 illustrates
the nine — yes, count them, nine — stencils that open automatically when
you select the Part and Assembly Template for Mechanical Engineering.
The default docking location for stencils is the Shapes pane, on the left side
of the screen. Stencils are stacked atop one another with just the title bar
showing. As you open additional stencils, they’re added to the stack. This
stacking arrangement saves space for the drawing area.
Open stencils

Figure 2-3:
Visio stacks

stencils on
the left side

screen.
28
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

You can change the docking location to the top, bottom, or right side of the
screen. A fourth option is to float a stencil so that it appears in a separate
window with its own Close and Minimize buttons. This option lets you place
the stencil anywhere you want on the screen, move it, resize it, and minimize it.
To reposition a stencil, click the title bar and drag the stencil to another loca-
tion on the screen. The stencil docks itself depending on where you release
the mouse button. For example, if you drag the stencil to the bottom of the
drawing area, the stencil docks itself there. If you drag it to the top of the draw-
ing area, it docks there. If you want a stencil on the right side of your screen,
first close the Help pane, and then drag the stencil there. If you drag a stencil
anywhere else on the screen, it floats in its own separate window.
In Figure 2-4, stencils appear in every possible location; left, right, top, bottom,
and floating. You can arrange stencils any way you like. Notice that the more
stencils you display at once, the smaller your view of the drawing area.

Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

Closing stencils
To close a stencil displayed in the stack in the Shapes pane, right-click its title
bar and choose Close. The title bar of a floating stencil or a stencil docked
somewhere other than in the Shapes pane contains an X. Click the X to close
the stencil.
Opening additional stencils
If you want to use a shape that’s not available in any of the open stencils, you
can open additional stencils. In fact, you can open as many stencils as you
have room for on your screen.
If you’re not sure which stencil you need to open, check out the “Finding the
Shapes You Want” section in Chapter 4, where you find out how to search for
shapes.
30
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 
A step-by-step method for creating drawings
You’ve seen it before. The okay-what-do-I-do-
now stare that creeps across someone’s face
when he or she starts a new program. As they
say, it always pays to have a plan. At least with
a plan, you can pretend you know what you’re
doing!
Use this checklist whenever you create a draw-
ing using a template:
 Know what kind of drawing you want to
create so you can choose an appropriate
drawing category.
 Start a new drawing by choosing a template
in that category.
 Open any additional stencils that you may
want to use (see the section “Opening addi-
tional stencils” in this chapter).
 If you want your drawing to have multiple
pages, add them now (see Chapter 9).
 Drag and drop shapes from the stencil onto
the drawing (see Chapter 4).
 Connect the shapes (see Chapter 6).
 Add text to the drawing (see Chapter 5).
 Apply a color scheme to the drawing (see
Chapter 7).
 Save the drawing.
 Print your drawing (see Chapter 3).
The process can be far more involved than
this. You can create background pages, add
layers, incorporate hyperlinks, insert objects
from other programs, and so on. But this is the
basic process you follow each time you create
a drawing. Refer to this list until you’re more
comfortable working with Visio.

To open a stencil, follow these steps:
1. With your drawing displayed on the screen, choose File➪Shapes.
A list of drawing categories appears. This list mirrors the category list that
appears when you start Visio. Each category has a right-pointing arrow.
2. Point to the category you want.
A list of all stencils in that category appears, as shown in Figure 2-5.
3. Click a stencil name.
The stencil opens and is displayed on the left side of the screen. For
information about arranging stencils, see the “Moving and arranging
stencils” section earlier in this chapter.
Selecting a Pointer Tool Button
Before you can place or select shapes in a drawing, you need to use the Pointer
Tool button. Fortunately, Visio selects the Pointer Tool button for you auto-
matically when you start Visio. The button itself is located on the Standard
toolbar (see Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-5:
The
submenu
lists the
same
categories
you see on
Visio’s
startup
screen.
31
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

In the drawing area, the pointer is a simple white arrow just like the one used
in many other software programs. Visio calls this standard Pointer Tool Area
Select. The Pointer Tool has two other variations:
 Lasso Select: This lets you select shapes by drawing a lasso around them.
You use this setting most often when your drawing is dense with shapes
and you want to select specific shapes in an area.
 Multiple Select: This setting causes the mouse to automatically add to
your selection each time you click a shape.
To choose the Lasso Select or Multiple Select button, click the down arrow
next to the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar, and then click the
variation of the tool that you want.
Unfortunately, the mouse pointer on your screen doesn’t change to reflect
the type of Pointer Tool you select. You can only tell which Pointer Tool is
selected by the behavior of the pointer after you start using it. Later in this
chapter, you use these pointers to select multiple shapes. For now, continue
using the standard Area Select tool.
Figure 2-6:
The Pointer
Tool button
has three
variations.
32
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

Working with Shapes
Shapes are the essence of all Visio drawings. The first thing you do to create
a drawing is to add shapes. Later you can add connectors, text, and other ele-
ments to the drawing.
Adding a shape to a drawing
So, how do you get shapes into a drawing? You drag them in. It’s almost too
simple. In the same way that you drag a window’s title bar or drag a stencil to
a new location on the screen, you drag a shape into a drawing. Point to a shape
in the stencil, click and hold down the left mouse button, and then drag the
shape into the drawing area. Release the mouse button when the shape is
where you want it. (As simple as it is, don’t be surprised if you click a shape,
click the drawing area, and then wonder why your shape isn’t there. This may
happen a few times before you remember to hold the mouse button and drag!)
You can drag a shape into a drawing as many times as you want — the master
shape stays on the stencil. As you drag a shape into your drawing area, you
see an outline of the shape on the screen. When you release the mouse button,
the actual shape appears in your drawing and remains selected (green han-
dles are displayed around the perimeter of the shape) until you click a blank
area of the drawing page.
You can also drag a whole bunch of shapes into a drawing at once. Suppose
you’re creating a directional map and you know you want to use these shapes
from the Landmark Shapes stencil: airport, townhouse, ferry, river, hospital,
and sports stadium. Hold down the Shift key as you click each shape. In the
stencil, each shape you click remains highlighted. When you select the last
shape, release the Shift key and drag the shapes into the drawing. Visio stacks
the shapes on top of each other (slightly staggered so that you can see each
one). Now you can arrange them however you like.
If the shape is not exactly the size that you want and you just can’t wait to
adjust it, see the “Sizing up your shapes” section in Chapter 4.
Selecting a shape
Selecting a shape in a drawing is even easier than dragging it onto a drawing —
just click the shape. When you select a shape, its green selection frame and
handles become visible (see Figure 2-7). You need to select a shape before
you can move it, copy it, delete it, or change it in any other way.
33
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

A shape displays different types of selection handles depending on the tool
you use to select the shape. You find out more about controlling, working
with, and manipulating shapes in Chapter 4.
Selecting more than one shape at a time
Sometimes you may want to perform the same task (such as moving, copy-
ing, rotating, or flipping) on several shapes at a time. You can use one of
three methods to select multiple shapes:
 Use the Area Select Pointer Tool button and hold down the Shift key
as you click each shape that you want to select. As you select shapes,
they’re enclosed in a selection box (a green dotted rectangle). Green
handles appear at the corners of the selection box (see Figure 2-8). All
selected shapes are outlined in magenta (the first one in a bolder outline).

Figure 2-7:
The bright

you the

34
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

 Use the Area Select Pointer Tool button and drag a selection box
around multiple shapes. This method is shown in Figure 2-8. Just drag
the mouse around the shapes that you want to select, and then release
the mouse button. You must fully enclose all the shapes that you want to
select; if you cut across a shape, it isn’t selected.
 Use the Lasso Select Pointer Tool button and click and drag the mouse
pointer around the shapes you want to select. This method is shown in
Figure 2-9. As you drag, a lasso on the screen follows your path. As soon
as you release the mouse button, the selected shapes are enclosed in a
rectangle just like the one shown in Figure 2-8.
 Use the Multiple Select Pointer Tool button and click each shape that
you want to add to the current selection. (You don’t need to hold the
Shift key or do any dragging with this option.) When you’re finished, you
need to remember to turn off this pointer by choosing a different one.
Otherwise, Visio continues selecting shapes every time you click one!

Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

If you select multiple shapes and then decide to exclude one of them, you can
deselect it without deselecting all the shapes. Hold down the Shift key and click
the shape you want to remove. You can tell that you successfully deselected
the shape because the selection box shrinks to exclude the shape. To dese-
lect all selected shapes, click any blank area of the drawing or press Esc.
To select all shapes in a drawing quickly, press Ctrl+A or choose Edit➪
Select All.
Navigating Through a Drawing
Often drawings contain multiple pages, and you need to be able to move
from one page to another quickly. The drawing shown in Figure 2-10 contains
four pages. The name of each page appears on a tab at the bottom of the
drawing window on the navigation bar. To move from one page to another,
just click the page tab. Visio highlights the tab for the page that’s currently
displayed.

Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

If the navigation bar isn’t wide enough to display all the page names, put
your mouse pointer over the right end of the navigation bar until the pointer
changes to a double-headed arrow. Now you can drag the navigation bar to
the right until it displays all the page tabs in your drawing. (This shortens
your scroll bar, but you can still scroll.)
Zeroing In on a Drawing
As you work on a drawing, it’s nice to be able to zoom in on a particular area.
Visio gives you several options for zooming in and out.
Using the Zoom button
The typical way to adjust your view of a drawing is to use the Zoom button
on the Standard toolbar. Next to the Zoom button (the one that displays a
percentage) is a drop-down arrow. When you click this arrow, a list of per-
centages (50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%, and 400%) is displayed, along with
three other options (see Figure 2-11).
Current page
Page tab
Figure 2-10:
Tabs appear
for every
page in the
drawing; the

highlighted.
37
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

Just click the percentage you want, type a percentage, or click one of the fol-
lowing options:
 Last: Returns to the last percentage used
 Width: Displays the width of the page
 Page: Displays the entire page
These options appear also in the View menu under Zoom, but using the Zoom
toolbar button is faster.
My favorite way to zoom — and by far, the fastest — is to hold down the Ctrl
key and use the scroll wheel on the mouse. Scrolling forward (away from you)
zooms in; scrolling backward (toward you) zooms out. Of course, this method
requires a scroll wheel on your mouse. If your mouse doesn’t have one, you
can zoom using Ctrl+Shift. When you press and hold these keys, the mouse

pointer changes to a magnifying glass with a plus sign. Click the left mouse
button to zoom in; click the right mouse button to zoom out. To zoom back
out again to display the entire drawing, press Ctrl+W.
When you’re zoomed in close, you can pan (move right, left, up, or down)
through a drawing by using the scroll bars.
Using the Pan and Zoom window
When you’re working on an enormous drawing, it’s easy to lose your bearings
when you zoom in on a specific area. Using the scroll bars to pan through a
drawing can get cumbersome. A great way to keep your perspective on a draw-
ing and navigate at the same time is to use the Pan and Zoom window, shown
in Figure 2-12. This tiny window gives you a full-page view of your drawing; a
zoom box marks the area you’re currently zoomed in on. You can use the
zoom box simply to keep an eye on the area you’re working in, or you can
move it to a different location in the drawing.

39
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

To experiment with the Pan and Zoom window, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Pan & Zoom Window.
Visio displays the Pan and Zoom window. The red rectangle outlines the
area of the drawing you’re currently viewing.
2. To zoom in on a different area of the drawing:
a. Place the mouse pointer over the red rectangle until the pointer
changes to a four-headed arrow.
b. Drag the red rectangle to a new location in the drawing.
3. To move to a different location in the drawing, point anywhere out-
side the red rectangle and drag the mouse.
A new rectangle is drawn automatically and Visio shifts your view of the
drawing.
4. To resize the red rectangle (which changes the size of the area you
view in the drawing):
a. Move the mouse pointer over the red rectangle until the mouse
pointer changes to a two-headed arrow.
b. Click and drag the mouse in any direction to resize the
rectangle.
Visio automatically shifts your view of the drawing to the boundaries
defined by the red rectangle.
Like other windows, you can make the Pan and Zoom window a floating
window by dragging it anywhere on the screen. Or you can dock it along
any edge of the drawing area just by dragging it.
Using Drawing Explorer
Drawing Explorer is like central database administration for your drawing. It
keeps track of a truckload of drawing data (some you might think trivial!),
such as
 Number and name of the foreground and background pages
 Order of the pages
 Shapes used on a specific drawing page
 Layers used on a specific drawing page
 Styles used throughout the drawing
 Master shapes used throughout the drawing
 Fill pattern, line pattern, and line ends used in the drawing
40
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

Why would you possibly care about this kind of information? For some draw-
ings, you may not care and won’t even bother to open Drawing Explorer. But
just knowing that the information is readily accessible can be helpful.
Drawing Explorer displays information about a drawing in a hierarchical
format. It’s modeled after Windows Explorer, which uses a tree structure, folder
and document icons, and the – and + symbols to indicate whether or not a
folder is empty. In Figure 2-13, the first line in the Drawing Explorer window
displays the path name for the drawing. Below the path name are various
folders, beginning with Foreground Pages. Page-1 contains the Shapes folder,
which is open. The highlighted shape name (Display) is selected automati-
cally in the drawing.
Notice the thumbtack icon in the title bar of the window in Figure 2-13. When
the window is docked, the thumbtack looks like it’s tacked to show that the
window is thumb tacked in place. If you hover over the button, the tool tip
says Turn On AutoHide. If you click the thumbtack and then move the mouse
away from the window, the window closes but the title bar remains on the
screen. When you want to use the window again, just move your mouse over
the title bar and the window reappears.

Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

To open Drawing Explorer, choose View➪Drawing Explorer. Use Drawing
Explorer the same way you use Windows Explorer; click the + symbol to the
left of a folder to see its contents. You can right-click any folder or folder
entry to display a shortcut menu. The options available on the menu are
unique to the item you click. For instance, if you right-click the Foreground
Pages folder, the shortcut menu lets you insert or reorder pages.
The best way to find out about Drawing Explorer is to play with it: open and
close folders and right-click everything. You’ll soon become familiar with the
type of information that’s available and your options for using it.
If you open an existing drawing while the Drawing Explorer window is open, it
remains open and reflects the data of the current drawing. To close Drawing
Explorer, click the Close button (the X) in the upper-right corner of the
window.
You can move, dock, or auto-hide the Drawing Explorer window by following
the same methods used for the Pan and Zoom window. Refer to the “Using
the Pan and Zoom window” section earlier in this chapter.
Saving Drawings
When you’ve spent a lot of time creating a drawing, the last thing you want to
do is lose it! You should save a drawing as soon as you create it and continue
saving it every few minutes (or at least every time you add anything significant
to it). This is a habit I’ve developed after too many bad experiences losing
work that I often slaved over for hours.
Saving a drawing the first time
The first time you save a drawing, Visio displays the Save As dialog box.
Follow these steps to save your drawing:
1. Choose File➪Save.
Visio displays the Save As dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-14.
2. Click the folder where you want to save your drawing.
If necessary, use the icons on the left or click the drop-down arrow on
the Save In box to navigate to the folder where you want to save your
drawing.
42
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

3. In the File Name box, type a name for your drawing.
4. In the Save As Type box, click Drawing if it’s not already selected.
For information on the different file types, see the “Saving a drawing in
another file format” section, later in the chapter.
5. Click the Save button.
Visio saves your file and keeps your drawing on the screen.
Setting up AutoSave
To train your brain to remember to save, set up Visio to save files automati-
cally for you. This is not a substitute for saving files yourself! However, in the
event of a power failure (or a clumsy coworker kicking out your power cord),
Autosave allows you to recover a file in the state in which it was last saved.
Here’s how to set up a time interval for saving files.
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Save tab.
The screen shown in Figure 2-15 appears.

4. Click OK.
Saving a drawing as a template
It’s also possible to save a Visio drawing as a template. Many corporations find
it useful to create and save custom templates because they can incorporate
their company logos and other company-specific information. See Chapter 12
for more information about creating and saving custom templates.
Saving a drawing in another file format
In Visio, you have many options for saving drawings in different file formats.
Don’t let the humongous list of file types intimidate you. Many of these you’ll
never use, but it’s nice to know that they’re available should you ever find the
need.

Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

Visio defaults to the Drawing file type; which is the type you’ll use most often.
You can also save a Visio drawing as a Visio 2002 file type, if necessary, but
you can’t save a drawing in an earlier version of Visio (such as Visio 5).

If you’ve used other Microsoft programs, you’re probably familiar with wiz-
ards. If not, a wizard is a tool that guides you through the steps you need to
perform a task quickly and easily. Wizards can be used for almost any type of
task. In Visio, they help you create specific kinds of drawings.
Visio 2003 isn’t consistent in the location or availability of wizards. And there
isn’t any way to search for a wizard. Some appear on the Template list when
you select a drawing category, such as the Organization Chart Wizard. Some,
such as the Space Plan Wizard, pop up automatically when you choose the
building plan drawing type and space plan template. Others are on special
menus, such as the Calendar menu that appears when you select the Project
Schedule drawing type and the Calendar template. Table 2-1 lists the known
wizards in Visio 2003 and where to find them.

Opening Drawings
After you’ve created and saved some Visio drawings, you need to know how
to reopen them. You can open drawings saved in the current version of Visio
or a previous version of Visio, and you can open and work on more than one
drawing at a time.
Opening a saved drawing
After you’ve saved a drawing, you can open it again in a few different ways. If
Visio isn’t running and you need to start it, use these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Visio 2003.
The opening screen appears (refer to Figure 2-1).
2. In the Getting Started pane on the right side of the screen, see
whether the file is listed in the Open section.
Recently opened files are listed in the Open section. You can also click
the File menu and check to see whether the file you want is listed at the
bottom of the menu.
47
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving a Simple Visio Drawing

3. If you find the file you want, click it to open it.
4. If the file isn’t listed, choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
5. Navigate to the folder where you stored the file, highlight the file
name, and then click the Open button.
Your drawing is displayed and all appropriate stencils are opened.
Opening a drawing saved in a previous
version of Visio
You can open a file saved in any previous version of Visio, including Visio
Standard, Professional, Technical, or Enterprise. Open the file just as you
would any file you saved in Visio 2003. If the file used stencils or templates
that are no longer available in Visio 2003, the Shapes pane is empty. You can
choose Files➪Shapes to open any stencil and apply it to the drawing. When
you’re finished working, you can resave the file in Visio 2000 format or in
Visio 2003.
Previous versions of Visio allowed you to save a workspace (with the .vsw
file extension). Visio 2003 doesn’t provide this option, but you can still open
a workspace file. If you want to save a workspace file in Visio 2003 (or
Visio 2002), Visio saves it as a drawing file (with the .vsd file extension).
Opening more than one drawing at a time
In Visio, you can work with more than one drawing at a time. The file you
open becomes the active drawing; any other drawings that are already open
remain open. All open drawings are listed at the bottom of the Window menu.
To open a drawing while working in Visio, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the folder where your file is located.
3. In the document list, click the file that you want to open.
4. Click the Open button.
48
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

If you want to view more than one drawing on the screen at the same time,
choose Window➪Tile or choose Window➪Cascade. The Tile option arranges
drawings side-by-side on the screen. The Cascade option stacks the windows
on top of one another and slightly staggered so you can read the title bars.
After the drawing windows are open, you can rearrange them by dragging the
title bars or resizing the windows. For more information on arranging windows
on your screen, see Windows XP For Dummies by Andy Rathbone (published

F
or the most part, printing in Visio is a breeze — not much different from
printing from any other Windows application. If your drawing doesn’t
vary from the template, without any major changes to the page size or orien-
tation, you can often just click Print and get exactly the results you expect.
However, sometimes your drawings won’t be this straightforward. What if
your drawing is larger than the paper? What if it’s small and you want it to fill
the page? What if your drawing is wider than it is tall, and it won’t fit on stan-
dard paper? In this chapter, you find the answers to these questions and dis-
cover what you need to know to print all kinds of drawings (or selected
portions of drawings) successfully.
Understanding How Visio Prints
The most important concept to keep in mind when printing with Visio is
that the printer paper size and the drawing page size are independent of

one another. The printer paper size refers to the paper you use in your
printer. The drawing page size refers to the paper you see represented in
white (usually shown with grid lines) in the drawing window on the screen.
Most of us use printers that handle 81⁄2-by-11-inch or 81⁄2-by-14-inch paper.
Sometimes the printer may handle tabloid size paper (11-by-17 inches). And if
you work in an architectural firm, an engineering lab, a graphics design firm,
or a large corporation with vast resources, you might have access to a plotter
as well, which prints on large rolls of paper up to 60 inches wide. The truth is,
it doesn’t matter what your printing resources are. Visio can print your draw-
ing no matter what size paper your printer handles.
When you use a Visio template to create a drawing, it sets up your drawing
page size and printer paper size so that they match. Depending on the type
of drawing you’re creating, it might set up the page in portrait mode (taller
than it is wide) or landscape mode (wider than it is tall). Visio matches the
drawing page size to the printer paper size and keeps the drawing page size
that way unless you do something to change it. It’s okay to change it! (Visio
wants to work the way you work, not force you to conform to inflexible
rules.) You just need to know how it will affect your printing if you do.
Preparing to Print
Before you print any drawing, you should do the following:
 Check to see whether the printer paper size and the drawing page size
are different 
 Center your drawing
 Use Print Preview to get a look at how your drawing will print
In this section, you find out more about the importance of each of these steps
and how to do each one. (You could try skipping these steps, but if you do
you’ll just be wasting paper!)
Checking the printer paper and
drawing page sizes
To compare the printer paper size and the drawing page size, choose
File➪Page Setup to display the Page Setup dialog box shown in Figure 3-1.
This dialog box lets you make any necessary changes to the printer paper
size and the drawing page size.
52
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

The Print Setup tab is where you make changes to the printer paper size. To
make changes to the drawing page size, you use the Page Size tab. (For now,
you can ignore the rest of the tabs in this dialog box.)
The terrific feature of this dialog box is the illustration on the right, which
appears in both the Print Setup tab and the Page Size tab. The illustration
shows you a picture of both the printer paper size and the drawing page size
on top of one another, so you can tell immediately how things are lining up.
Figure 3-1 shows a drawing in which the printer paper size and the drawing
page size line up perfectly in portrait mode. (In this example, I used a tem-
plate to create a drawing and didn’t change the drawing page size or the ori-
entation.) You don’t need to do anything special to print successfully except
preview your drawing, as you see later in this chapter.
But what if you go to print your drawing and the Page Setup illustration looks
like the one in Figure 3-2? The printer paper size and drawing page size don’t
line up. You know you need to do some adjusting before you print, but what
do you change?
The illustration shows you that your drawing paper is in landscape mode and
your printer is set to print in portrait mode. This means that if you have any
shapes in your drawing that fall outside the area shown by the printer paper,
they won’t print. (Even if you don’t have shapes outside the printer paper
area, your drawing won’t be centered neatly on the page.)
In this example, the problem is one of orientation and is easy to solve:
Change either the printer paper orientation to match your drawing (refer to
Figure 3-2) or change the drawing page orientation to match the paper (refer
Figure 3-1:
Here, you
see the
drawing
paper size
and printer
page size
together.
53
Chapter 3: Printing Visio Drawings

to Figure 3-3). Your choice depends on the content of your drawing and how
you want it displayed. Whichever you choose, the goal is to have the orienta-
tion and size of the paper match the orientation and size of the drawing page.
Previewing your drawing
You should always preview your drawing after checking the page and paper
setups. Why? Because the Print Setup and Page Size dialog boxes show you
how the printer paper size and drawing page size compare to one another;
they don’t show you anything about the drawing itself and where the shapes

are located. Print Preview gives you a preview of the actual drawing. You can
display the print preview screen by clicking the Print Preview button on the
Standard toolbar or by choosing File➪Print Preview.
Your goal in Print Preview is to see that all shapes fall inside the wide gray
border around the edge of the paper, which indicate the drawing’s margins.
These page margins are visible only in Print Preview — another good reason
to check here before printing! Any shape that falls across the margin lines
won’t print correctly. Everything is A-okay in the drawing shown in Figure 3-4.
You can see that the page is set to print in portrait mode and that all the
shapes fall within the page margins.
If your drawing’s shapes fall across page margins, you can try several options.
You can print on larger paper, adjust the placement of the shapes in the draw-
ing, tile the drawing, or reduce the size of the drawing to fit the paper. Tiling
and reducing the drawing are discussed later in this chapter in the “Printing
oversized drawings” section. Refer to Chapter 4 for information about moving
shapes in a drawing. To print on larger paper, refer to the preceding section.

A clear view in Print Preview
If you’ve never used Print Preview before, here are a few tips. Notice in
Figure 3-4 that Print Preview has its own toolbar. The first four buttons —
New Drawing, Open, Save, and Print Page — also appear on the Standard tool-
bar. The remaining buttons are described in Table 3-1. You can use these but-
tons to change your view of Print Preview. Click the Close button when you
want to return to your drawing in Visio.

Printing Your Drawing
When you’ve checked the settings for the printer paper size and the drawing
page size, and you’ve centered and previewed your drawing, you’re ready to
print. With your file open, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Choose the printer you want to use if more than one is available.
Figure 3-5:

57
Chapter 3: Printing Visio Drawings

3. If you want to check the settings for your printer:
a. Click the Properties button.
b. Adjust the printer settings as you normally do.
c. Return to the Print dialog box.
4. In the Page Range section, choose All, Current Page, Selection, or
specify a range of pages by typing page numbers.
You can specify a range of pages only if the drawing has more than one
page. Similarly, you can specify to print the Selection only if you made a
selection before displaying the Print dialog box.
5. Specify the number of copies you want to print.
6. Click OK.
Some Windows applications give you the option of printing a group of
selected pages, such as 2, 4, and 7. Visio doesn’t provide this option. To print
a group of selected pages, you need to print each page individually in the
Pages: from option. For example, to print pages 2 and 4, you would type 2 and
2 in the Pages: from option, click OK to print that page, type 4 and 4 in the
Pages: from option, and click OK.
Now that you know the basics of printing, let’s look at some special consider-
ations for printing, such as centering a drawing, including headers or footers
in a drawing, printing gridlines, and printing partial drawings. These are
common tasks, but they require a little extra effort to set up.
Adding Headers and Footers
to a Drawing
A header refers to text that appears at the top of each page of a drawing; a
footer is text that appears at the bottom of each page. Headers and footers
are optional. If you decide to add them to a drawing, you can include text
such as a title, a file name, a date, or automatic page numbers. You decide
where you want them to appear in the header or footer area: at the left
margin, centered, or at the right margin.
Headers and footers apply to every page in a drawing.
Often you want headers or footers to include the time, date, file name, or
page number. Visio adds these automatically when you select one of these
items. You can insert the following items:
58
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

 Current date (short)
 Current date (long)
 Current time
 File extension
 File name
 File name and extension
 Page name
 Page number
 Total printed pages
When you choose one of these items, Visio enters a formatting code in the
dialog box, such as &t for the current time. Don’t let this throw you; the cor-
rect information is automatically inserted when you print the drawing. Note
that you can use more than one of these items for each location in the header
or footer. For example, if you want a centered header to include the page
number, page name, and file name, click all three options in the Header
Center box. Just be sure to add spaces between each entry.
To add a header or footer to a drawing, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open to display your drawing.
2. Choose View➪Header and Footer.
The Header and Footer dialog box appears.
3. In the appropriate Header or Footer text box (Left, Center, Right), type
the information that you want to appear, such as “Company
Confidential.”
If you want Visio to automatically insert the date, time, file name, or other
information, click the right arrow at the end of the Left, Center, or Right
text box (see Figure 3-6) and then click the option you want. If you’re
inserting more than one option, add appropriate punctuation and spacing.
You can enter as many characters as will fill one line. (The exact number
depends on the font size you choose in Step 5.) If you enter more char-
acters than will fit across the page, the characters overtype at the right
margin.
4. In the Margin boxes, type a size for the header margin and footer
margin, if you want.
You shouldn’t need to adjust margins unless you want an extra-wide
margin.
59
Chapter 3: Printing Visio Drawings

The margin setting for a header is the distance from the top of the
header text to the top edge of the page. For a footer, it is the distance
from the bottom of the footer text to the bottom edge of the page. Unlike
in other programs, Visio headers and footers do not print inside the
page margin area; they print inside the drawing area.
5. To format the header and footer text:
a. Click the Choose Font button.
The Choose Font dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
b. Choose a font, size, style, special effects, and color for the
header and footer text.
Formatting applies to all header and footer text; you can’t format
each one individually.
c. Click OK to close the Font dialog box.

Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

6. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
Click the Print Preview button on the Standard toolbar or choose File➪Print
Preview to see how your header and footer text will look when you print your
drawing. (Header and footer text is only visible in Print Preview or on the
printed drawing.)
In a tiled drawing (one that’s printed across several sheets of paper), Visio
prints headers and footers on each sheet. You may want to put header and
footer information on a background page (a separate page that works as an
underlay) instead. For details about creating background pages, see Chapter 9.
For information about tiling a drawing, see the “Printing oversized drawings”
section later in this chapter.
Printing Gridlines
When measurements are important to your drawing, it’s useful to print the
gridlines that show up in the drawing page window. To print gridlines, follow
these steps:
1. Open your drawing file.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box appears.
3. Click the Print Setup tab if it isn’t already selected (see Figure 3-8).
4. In the Print area near the bottom of the dialog box, click the Gridlines
option.
5. Click OK.

Chapter 3: Printing Visio Drawings

Printing Part of a Drawing
It’s nice to know that you can always print a portion of a drawing if you need
to. Maybe you’re drawing includes a lot of shapes and you want to print only
a few of them. Or maybe a portion of your drawing is still in flux and you
want to print everything except that portion. You can choose the shapes you
want to print and prevent the others from printing by not selecting them. Use
these steps:
1. Open the drawing you want to print.
2. In the drawing, select only the shapes that you want to print.
3. Choose File➪Page Setup to check your drawing’s paper size and orien-
tation, and then click OK.
4. Choose File ➪Print Preview or click the Print Preview button on the
Standard toolbar.
5. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears
6. Choose the printer settings as you normally do.
7. In the Page range area, click Selection.
8. Click OK.
Visio prints only the shapes you select.
Reducing and Enlarging
Printed Drawings
When you create an oversized drawing (one that’s larger than the paper in
your printer), you can see right away in Print Preview that the drawing won’t
print on a single sheet of paper. It might make sense to tile the drawing (that
is, print it across several sheets of paper). But if you need the drawing to
print on one page, another option is to change the print scale. Changing the
print scale lets you print the drawing at a smaller percentage of its original
size. It’s like creating a reduced copy of a drawing on a copy machine.
Conversely, when a drawing is too small, you can enlarge the print scale and
make the drawing easier to read when you print it.
Note that print scale is different than from the drawing scale. Print scale is
simply a percentage of the original drawing size. Drawing scale expresses a rela-
tionship between the size of real-world objects and the size at which they’re
shown in a drawing. You find out how to change drawing scale in Chapter 7.
62
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

Altering the print scale of a drawing
To change the print scale of a drawing, use these steps:
1. Open your drawing file in Visio.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Print Setup tab of the Page Setup dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 3-9.
3. In the Print zoom area, click the Adjust to option.
Enter a number smaller than 100 percent to reduce the printed size of
the drawing. To instead enlarge the drawing, enter a number greater
than 100 percent.
4. Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box.
5. Choose Print➪Preview or click the Print Preview button on the
Standard toolbar.
Make sure your drawing fits on the drawing page.
6. Repeat Steps 2 to 5 if necessary to adjust the drawing.
You may expect your drawing to change on the screen, but it doesn’t. This is
because you’ve altered the print scale, not the drawing scale. Again, like
reducing or enlarging a page on a photocopier, the size of the original doesn’t
change. Only the copied result changes.
Adjust print scale
Figure 3-9:
You can

a drawing.
63
Chapter 3: Printing Visio Drawings

If you need to print the drawing at regular scale, follow the previous steps to
change the percentage back to 100 before you print again.
Printing oversized drawings
Suppose you create a very large drawing, say 21⁄2 feet wide by 3 feet high. If
you have a plotter, printing the drawing is a breeze. Just enter the page size
and drawing size in the Page Setup dialog box as described earlier in this
chapter, preview the drawing, and then print.
But what if you don’t have access to a plotter and you want to print the draw-
ing at actual size (because, for example, you want to use the drawing in a pre-
sentation for a large audience). Another option for printing an oversized
drawing is to print it on separate sheets of paper and tape or paste the sheets
together. This is called tiling a drawing. Using the following steps, you specify
exactly how many sheets of paper you want your drawing to fit on:
1. Choose File➪Open to display your drawing.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Print Setup tab of the Page Setup dialog box appears.
3. In the Print zoom area, click the Fit to option and then enter the
number of sheets across and the number of sheets down.
4. Click OK.
To view exactly how your drawing will be tiled when printed, click the Print
Preview button on the Standard toolbar, or choose File➪Preview. The gray lines
in the print preview screen represent the borders between pages. Another way
to view tiles while you’re working is to choose View➪Page Breaks. This option
displays the same page borders right on the drawing page so you can make
adjustments as you work without switching to Print Preview.
Fitting the drawing on the number of pages you specify affects the printed
copy but not the scale of the drawing. To “untile” a large drawing, return to
the Page Setup dialog box and reset the zoom percentage to 100%.
Setting Shapes Not to Print
Sometimes it’s just as important not to print a shape or shapes as it is to print
others. For example, if you’re printing an office layout plan, your employees
are interested in seeing the cubicle layout but don’t need to see the wiring
64
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

components. Or maybe you’ve named a new department head in your com-
pany but you don’t want your employees to see the name of the new boss on
the organization chart yet. Maybe you’re planning office space but aren’t sure
some of the office furniture you’ve ordered will be available. These are all
cases when you might want to set a specific shape or shapes to not print in
your drawing.
To set a shape not to print, follow these steps:
1. Open your drawing.
2. Right-click the shape you want to set for nonprinting and choose
Format➪Behavior.
The Behavior dialog box appears.
3. If the Behavior tab is not already selected, click it (see Figure 3-10).
4. In the Miscellaneous section, click the Non-Printing shape option.
5. Click OK.
To make sure that the shape is set to not print, click the Print Preview button
on the Standard toolbar or choose File➪Print Preview. The shape should not
appear on the print preview screen. When you print the drawing, the shape
will not print.
To make the shape print again, follow the previous set of steps and click to
unselect the Non-printing shape option in Step 4.

Chapter 3: Printing Visio Drawings

Printing Reviewers’ Comments
Visio 2003 incorporates some advanced reviewing and markup features. (See
Chapter 14 to find out about annotating and reviewing Visio drawings.) When
you’ve had one or more people take the time to review a drawing for you, it’s
nice to be able to print the drawing showing their comments. To do this,
follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing you want to print.
2. Choose View➪Markup to display reviewer’s marks on the drawing.
3. Choose View➪Reviewing Pane.
The pane to the right of the drawing window summarizes the reviewers’
comments. Or if the Help pane is already displayed, click the down
arrow in the title bar and choose Reviewing to switch to the Reviewing
task pane.
4. In the Show Markup Overlays section of the pane, click Show All.
5. Choose File ➪Print Preview to preview the drawing.
6. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears.
7. Choose print settings as you normally do, and then click Print.
Visio prints your drawing showing all reviewers’ comments. To return to
printing the drawing without reviewers’ comments, choose View➪Markup
again to unselect this option.
Printing a Background Separately
Visio lets you create backgrounds for the pages in your drawings. A back-
ground is assigned to and appears behind a page in the drawing. To find out
more about creating and using backgrounds, see Chapter 9.
If your drawing contains a background page, you might find it useful to print
the background separately from the rest of the drawing. This is an easy task
because the background is stored as a separate page in a drawing. Follow
these steps:
1. Open the drawing file that contains the background page.
2. Click the Background tab at the bottom of the drawing window to
make it the current page.
66
Part I: Starting with Visio 2003 Basics 

3. Choose File ➪Print Preview to preview the drawing.
4. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box appears.
5. Click the Current page option, and then click OK.
Only the background page prints.
Printing Layers Separately
Visio lets you place shapes on separate layers in a drawing. There are many
circumstances where it makes sense to print layers separately. For example,
in a drawing that depicts a building or a home plan, only the plumber cares
about seeing the pipe layout and only the electrical team cares about seeing
the wiring and telecom layout. If you place these components on individual
layers, you can print the layers separately. For details on creating layers and
printing them separately, see Chapter 10.

S
hapes are the most important elements of Visio; they’re the building
blocks you use to create diagrams, drawings, charts, and graphs.
Regardless of the type of drawing you create — a flowchart, a network dia-
gram, an architectural drawing, a project timeline — you create each drawing
by using shapes. Visio includes many types of shapes that not only look dif-
ferent but also behave differently. In this chapter, you discover many different
types of shapes, what makes them different, and how to work with them in
your drawings and diagrams.
I’m a firm believer in doing things as quickly and easily as possible. Often,
using menu commands isn’t the quickest way. I’m partial to keyboard short-
cuts, so in this chapter you’ll see me favoring them — though I do point out
other methods available for accomplishing a particular task.

Discovering What’s In a Shape
If you think you may not have enough shapes to choose from when you’re
building your drawings, think again. Visio includes thousands of shapes!
Shapes are stored in stencils, which are collections of related shapes dis-
played in their own window on your Visio screen. You’ll create most drawings
by using the shapes that Visio supplies, but you can create and store your
own shapes as well. Chapter 8 covers creating and storing shapes. 
A shape can be as simple as a single line or as complex as an industry-specific
network component for a computer system. Unlike clip art, shapes have cer-
tain “smart” characteristics. For instance, if you add text to a shape and then
resize the shape, the text reformats automatically to the new size. Shapes with
glued connectors (like the lines that connect boxes on an organization chart
or flowchart) stay connected when you move them. A pie chart isn’t just a pie
chart. You decide the number of slices it should have, and when you want to
adjust percentages, the shape adjusts automatically. A bar chart shape adjusts
the length of its bars automatically after you type a percentage for one of the
bars (see Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1:

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

You can control a particular aspect of a shape, such as the angle and direc-
tion of the vanishing point of a three-dimensional shape like a cube. (The van-
ishing point is the point at which parallel lines of a three-dimensional object
appear to converge.) You can store data (for example, inventory numbers,
service dates, or serial numbers), with a shape and generate reports from 
the stored data. (For more information about storing data in shapes, see
Chapter 12.) If you’re a software developer creating a custom Visio solution,
you can program specific behavior into shapes. You can see why Visio shapes
are called SmartShapes. Many have built-in brainy behavior.
Examining open and closed shapes
Shapes can be classified as either open or closed, as shown in Figure 4-2. An
open shape is one in which the endpoints aren’t connected, such as a line, an
arc, or an abstract shape. A closed shape is a fully connected object such as
a polygon.
Figure 4-2:
Check out
these
examples 
of open 
and closed
shapes.
73
Chapter 4: Discovering What Visio Shapes Are All About

What difference does it make whether a shape is open or closed? You can fill
a closed shape with a color or a pattern. You can’t fill an open shape, but you
can add endpoints such as arrowheads and other symbols.
Comparing one- and two-
dimensional shapes
All Visio shapes are either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. Two-
dimensional shapes have length and height. When you select a two-dimen-
sional shape with the Pointer Tool button, you can see its selection frame
and selection handles (see Figure 4-3).
The selection frame is a green dotted line that fully encloses a shape.
Selection handles are green squares that appear at the corners and sides of a
frame. (Later you see that handles can look different when you select a shape
using a different tool.) The handles enable you to change the shape’s length
and height. Even a nonrectangular shape (such as a pie chart) displays a rec-
tangular frame with side and corner handles when the shape is selected.

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

A line is an example of a one-dimensional shape. It has only two endpoints —
small green boxes — that are visible when you select the line (see Figure 4-4).
The beginning point — that is, the point from which you begin drawing —
contains an x; the endpoint contains a (+) symbol.
You can resize the length of a one-dimensional shape, but not its height; a
one-dimensional shape has no height. (A line has thickness, which you can
alter by using a formatting command. Thickness is not the same as height.)
An arc is considered a one-dimensional shape, although it may seem to be
two-dimensional. Notice in Figure 4-4 that an arc has only two endpoints; it
doesn’t have a frame with handles at each corner and side. The handle at the
top of the arc is called a control handle, which enables you to adjust the bend
of the arc. See the “Controlling Shapes” section later in this chapter to find
out more about working with control handles on other types of shapes.
You see a shape’s handles only when the shape is selected. The type of handle
you see depends on the tool that you use to select the shape. You see more
examples of shape handles throughout this chapter.

Chapter 4: Discovering What Visio Shapes Are All About

Working with Shapes
After you have shapes in your drawing, you’ll want to do all kinds of things to
them, such as moving, copying, pasting, deleting, and resizing. These are
some of the most common tasks you do with shapes that don’t involve alter-
ing the shape itself. Table 4-1 shows some toolbar buttons you use to work
with shapes.
Table 4-1
Standard Toolbar Buttons for Working with Shapes
Button
Name
What It Does
Cut
Removes the selected shape from the 
drawing and makes it available for pasting
Copy
Saves a copy of the selected shape and 
makes it available for pasting
Paste

Stamp

whenever you click it (rather than dragging a
shape repeatedly from the stencil)
To drag a shape, you have to click the shape with the left mouse button and
hold the button down as you move the shape.
Moving shapes
After you have shapes in your drawing, you’ll move them around a lot until
you get them exactly where you want them. Moving a shape is simple; just
76
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

drag the shape wherever you want it. As you drag a shape, watch the 
vertical and horizontal rulers. The shape’s top, middle, and bottom points
are indicated on the ruler by faint dotted lines. If you want to place a shape
three inches from the top border of your drawing and two inches from the
left border, for example, you can see exactly where the shape is aligned by
watching the indicators on the ruler. 
You can restrict the movement of a shape by holding down the Shift key as
you drag the shape. If you drag the shape horizontally, it moves only to the
right and left and keeps its vertical position. If you drag the shape vertically,
it moves up and down and keeps its horizontal position.
See Chapter 7 for additional information on how to snap shapes into align-
ment by using rulers, a grid, and alignment commands that can make the
placement of your shapes more exact.
Nudging shapes
Sometimes a mouse can be a clumsy instrument to use. What if you need
to move a shape exactly 1⁄32 of an inch? It’s just not going to happen with
a mouse! Visio lets you nudge shapes. Nudging is essentially bumping a
selected shape by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. When you nudge a
shape, the shape moves in tiny increments, usually to the nearest ruler subdi-
vision. Variables such as the ruler scale, grid, and zoom percentage can
determine how much the shape moves. 
Try this quick and easy way to reposition shapes:
1. Click the shape that you want to nudge.
2. Position the shape by pressing the up, down, right, or left arrow key
repeatedly.
3. When your shape is positioned where you want it, click anywhere on
the drawing page to deselect the shape.
If you want to nudge several shapes at the same time, hold down the Shift key
as you select the shapes you want and then use the arrow keys to nudge the
selected shapes as a unit.
Copying and pasting shapes
Copying and pasting shapes is something you do often when creating a draw-
ing. If you know you want to use a shape more than once, you could drag the
77
Chapter 4: Discovering What Visio Shapes Are All About

shape from the stencil into the drawing each time you want to use it. But
wouldn’t it be better to drag just one instance of the shape into your drawing,
make any necessary changes to it (such as changing its size, color, fill, or
text), and then copy it to other places in the drawing? Especially when you’re
modifying the shape, it’s easier to copy the shape from one place in the draw-
ing to another, rather than start all over again from the stencil. 
As I’ve said before, I prefer to do things as quickly and easily as possible, so
my favorite method for copying and pasting a shape is to do both tasks in
one step. Hold down the Ctrl key, drag the shape you want to copy, and then
release the mouse button in the new location. As soon as you press Ctrl, you
see a (+) symbol attached to the mouse pointer. This tells you Visio will add
(or copy) the shape rather than move it. Presto! You’ve copied and pasted all
in one simple step. 
If you’re using a lot of the same shape in your drawing, another quick way to
copy and paste all at once is to select the shape and then press Ctrl+D (short
for Edit➪Duplicate). The shape is pasted to the right and slightly below the
copied shape. Now you can move it wherever you want.
If you prefer the two-step method for copying and pasting, here are the differ-
ent ways to copy a shape after you select it:
 Press Ctrl+C
 Right-click the shape and choose Copy from the pop-up menu
 Click the Copy button on the Standard toolbar
 Choose Edit➪Copy
All these methods place a copy of the shape (or shapes) on the Windows
Clipboard.
To paste the shape in a new location, do one of the following:
 Press Ctrl+V
 Right-click a blank area of the drawing page and choose Paste from the
pop-up menu (the shape or text most recently copied is pasted)
 Click the Paste button on the Standard toolbar
 Choose Edit➪Paste
You can continue to paste multiple copies of the shape until you use a copy
command again to copy a different shape.
78
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

Stamping shapes
Here’s another nifty button if you need to use a shape over and over again in
your drawing. It’s the Stamp button, and it works just like a rubber stamp.
Wherever you stamp the button, the shape is pasted into your drawing. This
is the best method to use if you just want to use shapes as-is from the stencil
because it saves you the trouble of repeatedly dragging the shape from the
stencil.
Follow these steps to use the stamping button:
1. Click the Stamp button (refer to Table 4-1) on the Standard toolbar. 
If the button isn’t on your toolbar, click the down arrow at the right end
of the toolbar (Toolbar Options), choose Add or Remove Buttons➪
Standard, and then click the Stamp button to add it to your toolbar.
2. In the stencil, click the shape that you want to stamp.
3. Drag the mouse pointer into the drawing area.
Notice that your mouse pointer now looks like a stamp.
4. Click where you want to stamp the shape.
Keep clicking until you’ve added all the stamped shapes that you want
in your drawing.
5. Click the Pointer Tool button (it looks like an arrow) to switch back to
the regular mouse pointer.
Sizing up your shapes
In many cases, you’ll want to resize shapes for your drawings. Visio makes
resizing simple. Use the following steps to adjust the size of shapes.
1. Select the shape with the Pointer Tool button.
2. Do one of the following:
• Drag a side handle to change the shape’s width.
• Drag a top or bottom handle to change the shape’s height.
• Drag a corner handle to change the height and width at the same
time. Visio maintains the shape’s height-to-width proportions when
you drag at the corner.
3. Release the mouse button when the shape is the size that you want.
79
Chapter 4: Discovering What Visio Shapes Are All About

If your shape contains text, the text reformats automatically as you resize the
shape. (See Chapter 5 to find out how to enter text in shapes.) 
These steps may seem to imply that all shapes are parallelograms. They’re
not; but remember that every two-dimensional shape has a rectangular
frame, which is a parallelogram, so that the shape can be resized in width,
height, or both proportionally.
If you want a shape to be a specific size, for example, 2-by-11⁄2 inches, watch
the status bar at the bottom of the screen as you resize the shape. The status
bar displays the shape’s height and width as you move the mouse. 
You can also use Visio’s Size and Position window to specify the size and
location of a shape in a drawing. To display this window, choose View➪Size
and Position Window (see Figure 4-5). Type the height and width you want for
your shape and then press Enter. To close the window, click the Close button
in the window’s title bar.
Like other windows, you can make the Size and Position window a floating
window by dragging it anywhere on the screen. Or you can dock it along any
edge of the drawing area just by dragging it. 
Figure 4-5:

and Position

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

Deleting shapes
You can delete a shape in one of four ways. First select the shape and then do
one of the following:
 Press the Delete key on the keyboard
 Press Ctrl+X 
 Click the Cut button on the Standard toolbar
 Choose Edit➪Cut
Pressing the Delete key is the easiest way to delete a shape. But if you think
you may want to bring the shape back again, use Ctrl+X or Cut instead. That
way, the shape is stored on the Clipboard so that you can paste it in the
drawing again (as long as you paste it before you cut anything else).
You can use the same method to delete more than one shape at a time. Select
all the shapes you want to delete (either click them or draw a selection box
around them) and then choose one of the four delete options. (Refer to
Chapter 2 to find out how to select multiple shapes at once.)
If you delete something by mistake, you can choose Edit➪Undo (or press
Ctrl+Z) to bring it back. By default, Visio has 20 levels of Undo, so you can
undo up to the last 20 commands that you performed. (If you think you want
more, you can set up to 99 levels of Undo! Choose Tools➪Options, click the
General tab, and type a number in the Undo Levels box.)
Controlling Shapes
You already know that when you select a shape using the Pointer Tool
button, the shape displays selection handles, which are small green squares
on the shape’s rectangular frame. These usually appear at the four corners
and the sides of a shape’s frame. 
Selection handles allow you to resize a shape, but you might want to make
other changes. For example, you might want to change the width of bars in a
bar chart or the magnitude or a curve. Or you might want to change the van-
ishing point for a three-dimensional cube. You can’t use selection handles to
accomplish any of these tasks, but Visio provides different types of handles,
points, and vertices that allow you to make these kinds of changes to a shape,
as shown in Table 4-2. In this section, you find out how to use these handles,
points, and vertices to change different aspects of a shape.
81

for Controlling a Shape

you can glue a shape
Note: When a handle, point, or vertex appears in gray on the screen, it’s
locked and can’t be changed. 
Not all shapes contain all the handles and points shown in Table 4-2! For
example, control handles appear on some shapes and often apply to an
aspect of the entire shape, whereas control points appear only on part of a
shape, such as lines, line segments, arcs, and freeform curves. Some shapes
might not contain vertices and others won’t include eccentricity handles.
Don’t panic if you can’t find a handle or point when you’re expecting one. If
it’s not there, it’s probably not necessary.
When I start talking about the color of handles and points, you’ll have to use
your imagination or try to duplicate the examples on your own screen. The
black-and-white figures in the book put you at a disadvantage, but being able
to recognize the colors of these handles and points is important. 
Adjusting shapes using control handles
When you select a shape, the control handles — if the shape has any —
appear somewhere on or near the shape and enable you to control some
82
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

aspect of the shape. Every shape’s control handles have a purpose. The pur-
pose varies depending on the shape to which the control handles are attached.
To discover what a shape’s control handles are used for, select the shape,
and then hover the mouse over the control point to display the tip for the
control handle. 
An example of a bar chart is shown in Figure 4-6. The yellow diamonds are
control handles. The control handle near the bottom allows you to adjust the
width of the bars; the control handle near the top allows you to adjust the
overall height of the bars. 
The control handles for the shapes in Figure 4-7 have a different function. In
this 3-D block diagram, the Vanishing Point shape is used to define the van-
ishing point for all shapes in the drawing. But each 3-D shape in the drawing
has its own control handle that lets you change the shape’s individual vanish-
ing point.

Adjusting a shape’s control handle is simple. Just select the shape using
the Pointer Tool button, and then hover over the control handle until the tip
appears. The tip might say something like “adjust corner rounding” or “adjust
pie slice.” Drag the control handle until you get the result you want — that’s
all there is to it!
Adjusting shapes using control points
Control points (as opposed to control handles) appear on lines, line seg-
ments, arcs, and freeform curves. (These elements might be freestanding or
part of a more complex shape.) A control point lets you control the shape of
a line, an arc, or a curve. (When you hover over a control point, the tip says
“Bend Shape.”) Another way to describe the function of control points is to
say that they let you control the shape of a shape. So, if you want to make a
straight-sided rectangle look like a bulging rectangle, for example, you drag a
control point on the rectangle’s line segments. Think of a control point as a
rubber band point.

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

To work with a shape’s control points, you must select the shape using the
Line, Arc, Freeform, or Pencil Tool button on the Drawing toolbar. (If the
Drawing toolbar isn’t displayed, right-click in the toolbar area and select the
Drawing toolbar from the pop-up menu.) These drawing tools are shown in
Table 4-3. When you select a shape using one of these tools, Visio first dis-
plays the shape’s control points and vertices. Then a split-second later, Visio
displays the selection frame and handles. 
Let Visio display all these handles and points before you move the mouse! If you
move the mouse away too quickly, some handles and points might not be dis-
played.

you move the mouse
To adjust a control point, choose one of the drawing tools from Table 4-3, and
then select the shape. Control points are displayed as green circles with an X
inside. When you click a control point to select it, the point turns magenta
until you release the mouse button in its new position. Figure 4-8 shows how
a pentagon shape looks before and after its control points are moved.
Shaping corners
Just as control points enable you to bend line segments, vertices let you
reshape the angle at which line segments meet. You can display a shape’s ver-
tices (green diamond-shaped points) by selecting a shape with any of the
drawing tools shown in Table 4-3.
85
Chapter 4: Discovering What Visio Shapes Are All About

Hover over a vertex and the tip says “Adjust Corner.” When you click on a
vertex to select it, it turns magenta. Once selected, you can you can drag it in
any direction, changing the length and angle of the lines that form the vertex.
If you want to alter a leg of a star, for example, drag the vertex (see Figure 4-9).
To find out how to add or delete vertices, see Chapter 8.
Visio seldom displays vertices on shapes that you drag into a drawing from a
stencil. That’s because many Visio shapes are complex enough that moving a
vertex may destroy the shape. However, you can always display vertices on
shapes that you draw. See Chapter 8 for information about drawing your own
shapes.
Rotating shapes into place
Many Visio shapes can be rotated so that you can place them at the angle
you prefer. To display a shape’s rotation handle, you don’t need to select the

shape using a drawing tool; the Pointer Tool button works just fine. The
round, green rotation handle usually appears outside the perimeter of the
selection frame and selection handles. When you point to the rotation handle,
the mouse pointer changes to a single curved arrow. When you hover over
the rotation handle the handle tip says “Rotate Shape.” 
Every rotation handle has an accompanying center of rotation pin, marking
the point around which the shape rotates. The center of rotation pin is a
small green circle with a + symbol. 
To rotate a shape, drag a rotation handle using a circular motion. The mouse
pointer changes to a rotation pointer (four arrows in a circular shape), and
you see an outline of the frame as you rotate it around the center of rotation.
See Figure 4-10. A shape’s rotation pin is usually located in the center of the
shape, but you can move it. If you want to rotate a rectangle around its lower-
right corner, for example, drag the center of rotation pin to the lower-right
corner of the rectangle and then rotate the shape. (Check out Chapter 8 for
more details on rotating shapes.)

Modifying arcs using eccentricity handles
In simple, non-techie terms, an elliptical shape is an oval. In Visio, an ellipti-
cal shape can also be part of an oval, as in an oval-shaped arc. All elliptical
shapes in Visio have eccentricity handles, which are designed to let you adjust
its off-centeredness or eccentricity. For example, if you draw an arc, you use
the eccentricity handles to change the angle at which the arc sits relative to
its endpoints.
Eccentricity handles are visible only when you select a shape using the Pencil
Tool button. First you see the arc’s control point, a small green circle with an
x in it. As soon as you click the control point, it turns magenta and the shape’s
eccentricity handles are displayed on either side of it, joined by a green dotted
line. The eccentricity handles are also green circles with an x inside. The
dotted line represents the angle at which the curve sits relative to the curve’s
endpoints (see Figure 4-11).

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

To change the magnitude of an arc, click the control point at the top of the
arc and drag it in any direction. If you want the arc to angle differently, drag
either eccentricity handle up or down. To change an arc’s eccentricity (in
effect, its “bend” point), drag either eccentricity handle closer to or farther
from the control point. (The closer the eccentricity handles are to the control
point, the more circular the arc becomes.) The best way to figure out how to
work with eccentricity handles is to play with them!
Using connection points
Connection points are the places on a shape where the endpoints of other
one-dimensional shapes (such as lines) can connect to the shape. For exam-
ple, the boxes in an organization chart have connection points where the
lines connect to the boxes. (Note that not all shapes have connection points.)

You can display connection points by choosing View➪Connection Points.
These small, blue Xs can appear almost anywhere on a shape — but usually
appear at corners, midpoints of lines, or centers of shapes (see Figure 4-12).
You can clutter your screen by displaying connection points all the time! I
recommend that you display them only when you need them. To turn off con-
nection points, choose View➪Connection Points.
Finding the Shapes You Want
Visio offers so many different shapes on so many different stencils, keeping
them all straight is difficult. What if you recall seeing just the right shape for a
drawing but don’t remember which stencil it’s on? Or what if you’re looking for
just the right shape — one you’ve never used before — and you don’t want to
search through dozens of stencils looking for it? Well, now you don’t have to! 
Visio 2003 makes it easy to find shapes by using the Search box right in the
Shapes pane (see Figure 4-13). Just type a word such as flag or a combination
of words such as circuit breaker and Visio searches for shapes matching your
description. 
Figure 4-12:

90
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

To use the search feature, follow these steps:
1. In the Search for Shapes box (in the Shapes pane on the left side of
your screen), type a single word or a combination of words.
2. Click the green arrow next to the search box.
Visio searches for shapes that match your description. If shapes are
found, they’re displayed in a new window with the search word or
phrase you used as the title bar. If shapes are not found, Visio displays
“Could not find a match. Please search again.”
3. Use any found shapes the same way you use other shapes; just drag
them into your drawing.
If your search word or phrase is too broad, Visio finds too many shapes. If
the results found total more than 100 shapes, Visio displays a message asking
whether you want to review the results. Click Yes to view them all, or click No
to end the search and then type a more specific search word or phrase. 
When you use Search for Shapes, Visio searches for shapes stored on your
computer as well as on the Internet. This is the default setting for searching.
You can change this search setting, among others, using the following steps:

2. Choose the Shape Search tab (see Figure 4-14). 
In the Search locations area, note that the Everywhere box is checked,
as well as the My Computer and the Internet boxes. You can uncheck
any of these boxes to limit your search.
3. In the Search For area, choose All of the Words (AND) or Any of the
Words (OR).
4. In the Results area, choose to sort results Alphabetically or By Group.
5. If you want results for each search to appear in a new window, choose
Open Results in a New Window. 
This is a good option to choose if you want to save the shapes in a
custom stencil. When this option is not checked, results from a new
search replace old search results.
6. To change the Warn When Results Are Greater Than setting, use the
up or down arrow or type a new number.
7. Click OK.
Another way to find a shape is to search for a shape that’s similar to one
already in your drawing. For example, suppose your drawing contains a per-
sonal computer shape and you want to find a similar shape. Use the following
steps to search for similar shapes:

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

1. Right-click a shape in your drawing and choose Shape.
The menu shown in Figure 4-15 appears.
2. Choose Find Similar Shapes.
Visio searches for similar shapes and displays the results in a stencil in
the Shapes pane.
3. Drag the shape into your drawing just like from any other stencil.

Jazzing Up Your Drawings
Some drawings and charts are appropriate without any frills or fluff. But
sometimes, black shapes and text on a white background can be really
boring. This is especially true if you plan to use your drawings as part of a

Chapter 4: Discovering What Visio Shapes Are All About

presentation or add them to a publication. If you have the flexibility to add
interesting graphic elements and color, by all means, do so! Visio has some
slick features for jazzing up your drawings.
Using the Visio Extras stencil shapes
There are times when you want to include in a drawing some graphical ele-
ments that don’t qualify as clip art. They’re more functional than clip art.
Examples of this type of graphical element are borders, title blocks, legend
blocks, and measurement scales. Visio includes a huge collection of stencils
that contain these types of shapes. 
To see a sample of these shapes, choose File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras. On the
submenu, you find the following stencils:
 Annotations: A collection of shapes (callouts, text blocks, arrows, sym-
bols) you can use to describe or call attention to parts of your drawing. 
 Backgrounds: Designs you can add as a backdrop to your drawing.
 Borders and Titles: Predefined page border styles and title boxes from
elegant to technical.
 Callouts: A varied set of callout shapes used to grab attention and
describe areas of a drawing (more choices than those found in the
Annotations stencil).
 Connectors: A huge collection of every type connector imaginable.
 Custom Line Patterns: Options for custom line patterns for one-
dimensional shapes.
 Custom Patterns (scaled and unscaled): Options for custom fill patterns
for two-dimensional shapes.
 Dimensioning (architectural and engineering): Measurement specifica-
tions for scale drawings.
 Drawing Tool Shapes: A collection of circles, arcs, lines, measuring
tools, and polygon shapes.
 Embellishments: Cool and weird stuff like Egyptian corners, Greek bor-
ders, art deco frames, and wave sections.
 Symbols: Internationally-recognized signs and symbols.
 Title Blocks: A vast array of every conceivable title block, used in archi-
tectural drawings, maps, revisions, file names, drafts, and more.
Figure 4-16 illustrates some creative ways to use these stencil shapes.
94
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

Applying a color scheme
Another way to spice up your drawings is to apply a color scheme. A color
scheme is a predefined set of colors assigned to the foreground, background,
text, fills, and various shapes in a drawing. Figure 4-17 shows a plain black-
and-white drawing; Figure 4-18 shows the same drawing with a color scheme
applied. (Of course, you can’t see the color in the figure, but you get the idea!)
To apply a color scheme to a drawing, follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing and click a blank area to unselect all shapes.
2. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Color Schemes.
Or Choose Tools➪Add-ons➪Visio Extras➪Color Schemes.
The Color Scheme dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-19.
3. In the Choose a Color Scheme list, highlight a color scheme and then
click Apply.
Grab the title bar of the Color Scheme dialog box to move the box out of
the way. Then you can see how the color scheme looks in your drawing.
4. To try other color schemes, repeat Step 3.
5. When you’re satisfied with the color scheme, click OK.

If you prefer, you can create your own color scheme and choose your own
colors for the foreground, the background, shadows, the line color, and the
text. Use these steps to create a custom color scheme:
1. Open an existing drawing or create a new one.
2. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Color Schemes.
Or Choose Tools➪Add-ons➪Visio Extras➪Color Schemes.
3. Click the New button.
The New Color Scheme dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-20.

ven though they say one picture is worth a thousand words, a little bit of
explanation can often help! It’s highly unlikely that you’ll create all your
drawings without any text, so read on to find out how to add freestanding
text as well as text to shapes, and then format it the way you want.
Understanding Text Blocks
All text in a Visio drawing is contained in a text block. A text block is a special
frame for holding text. Most Visio shapes have a text block attached to them.
For example, every shape in a flowchart has an attached text box, where you
enter data to describe the process or decision represented by the flowchart
symbol.
A shape’s attached text block goes wherever the shape goes. But you won’t
see a text block unless you enter text in it — and even then you see only the
text itself. (Text blocks aren’t outlined by a visible frame.) 
In some cases, you may want to add text to a drawing that’s not attached to a
shape. This is called a text shape or freestanding text. A title for a drawing is a
good example of freestanding text. It’s obviously text, but it isn’t attached to
any of the shapes in the drawing; the text block itself is the shape.

Adding Text 
In this section, you add text to a shape in a drawing and then add freestand-
ing text. As you work with raw text (that is, the text itself before you format,
color, or otherwise jazz it up), you use the buttons on the Standard toolbar
shown in Table 5-1.

To add text to a shape in your drawing, follow these steps:
1. Double-click a shape to select it and display its text box.
The shape’s text box is a green dotted outline on a white background. It
isn’t always inside the shape; sometimes it’s outside but near the shape.
2. Begin typing text in the shape’s text block.
If your screen zoom is set to anything less than 100%, Visio immediately
zooms in on the shape’s text block when you begin typing.
Continue typing. Visio keeps up with you even if you enter a 400-line cap-
tion. (Well, that may be a bit of an exaggeration.) If you enter more than
one line of text, Visio automatically wraps the text to the next line. You
102
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

can press Enter any time to begin a new line of text. If you enter more
text than the text block can hold, Visio enlarges the text block as you
continue to type.
3. When you’ve finished typing, click anywhere outside the text block.
Voilà! You see the original shape again, along with your text.
Figure 5-1 shows how extensively you can use text in a drawing. Sometimes a
so-called drawing contains more text than graphics!
If you enter a lot of text, the text block may become larger than the shape
itself. To make the text fit inside the shape, you have a few options. Enlarge
the shape, and the text block (including the text in it) reformats automati-
cally as you resize the shape. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more about resizing
shapes.) If your drawing won’t allow you to enlarge the shape, you can
change the size of the text block or change the text’s font size. See the
“Working with Text and Text Blocks” section later in this chapter.
If a shape has an associated text block, you can’t tell where the text block is
going to show up until you type something in it. If you’re curious about the
text box’s location before you enter text, you can display it quickly by click-
ing the shape and then pressing F2.
Figure 5-1:
Some

103
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

The formatting of text in a text block is different depending on the shape you
work with. Some shapes left-align text, others right-align text, and still others
orient the text vertically. Templates control the way text is aligned and for-
matted. (This actually isn’t weirdness. A logical reason exists for these differ-
ences, but they can catch your attention if you’re not expecting them.) For
more information on changing text characteristics, see the “Changing the
Way Your Text Looks” section later in this chapter.
In many circumstances, you’ll want to include text that’s not part of a shape.
Titles, callouts, and fine print such as copyright notices are three examples
that come to mind. You can include freestanding text in a drawing easily by
following these steps:
1. Click the Text Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
Your mouse pointer changes to look like a sheet of paper with text.
2. Drag the pointer to draw a text box as large (or as small) as you want.
Or double-click to have Visio draw a text block for you.
Your text block is outlined by a green dotted line and an insertion point
appears in the center.
3. Type your text.
4. Click anywhere outside the text block or press Esc.
Note that in Step 2, the insertion point appears in the center of the text block
because the text is set to be center-aligned. For more information on chang-
ing this setting, see the “Changing alignment” section later in this chapter.
You can also type in a text block using the Pencil, Line, Freeform, Rectangle,
or Ellipse Tool buttons to create your own shapes. Just double-click the
shape and add text in the way just described. For more information about
creating shapes, see Chapter 8.
Technically, freestanding text isn’t really freestanding. It’s a shape in and of
itself. Visio calls it a text shape. Does that matter? Not really. You just need
to know that text is always enclosed in a block; it never just floats around
aimlessly!
Working with Text and Text Blocks
In any drawing, you invariably manipulate text in some way, whether you edit,
copy, paste, move, resize, change the alignment, alter the margins, shift the
tabs, and so on. This section helps you make these changes after you enter
text.
104
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

If you’re familiar with word-processing programs such as Microsoft Word, you
find that Visio handles text in nearly the same way. If you’re already a pro at
performing editing tasks, you can whiz right past these sections that discuss
copying, pasting, moving, and deleting.
Editing text
It’s inevitable. The moment you click outside a shape to save your text that
you thought was perfect, you realize you need to change it. Maybe you want
to add text, delete text, reword what you wrote, or just start all over again.
Changing text in Visio is easy. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Text Tool button, and then click a shape to display its text
(see Figure 5-2).

105
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

2. Click the mouse where you want to change the text.
You see the insertion point after you click.
3. Begin typing, selecting, deleting, or backspacing to make your changes.
• To delete characters to the right of the insertion point: Press the
Delete key.
• To delete characters to the left of the insertion point: Press the
Backspace key.
• To select the text and type over it: Highlight the text you want to
delete (use the mouse or hold down the Shift key and use the
arrow keys). Then begin typing new text. Whatever you type
replaces the text you selected.
4. After you make changes to your text, click anywhere outside the text
block.
Your original shape or text shape is visible again.
You can also open a text block by double-clicking the shape using the Pointer
Tool (on the Standard toolbar), but watch out! If you use this method, Visio
automatically selects all the text in the shape. If you don’t want to replace all
the text, be sure to click somewhere in the text block to position the insertion
point before you begin typing. If you begin typing without positioning the inser-
tion point, Visio replaces your text with whatever you type. If you replace text
accidentally, use Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z to bring back your old text.
Copying and pasting text
Sometimes you may want to copy text from one place to another — anything
to avoid retyping! Actually, copying text is a good idea for another reason:
consistency. If you want a chunk of text to be exactly the same somewhere
else in your drawing, the best way to ensure this is to copy the text.
It doesn’t matter whether the text you’re pasting is attached to a shape or is
freestanding text. You follow the same basic steps for copying and pasting.
First, select the text to copy. If you don’t select a text block to paste to, but
instead paste the text by clicking a blank area of the drawing, Visio pastes the
text into a new text block somewhere near the middle of the drawing page.
You can then move the text block where you want it.
You copy and paste text using the following steps:
1. Click the Text Tool button on the Standard toolbar, and then click a
shape.
The shape’s text block appears.
2. Select the portion of text that you want to copy.
106
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

3. Click the Copy button on the Standard toolbar, press Ctrl+C, or choose
Edit➪Copy.
4. Choose where you want to paste the text:
• To paste into a shape’s text block, double-click the shape.
• To paste a text-only shape, click any blank area of the drawing.
5. Click the Paste button on the Standard toolbar, choose Edit➪Paste, or
press Ctrl+V.
The text that you copy remains on the Windows Clipboard until you copy
something else. If you need to paste again and again, feel free!
After you select text, the quickest way to choose the Copy and Paste com-
mands is from the pop-up shortcut menu. Just right-click after selecting text
to display the shortcut menu.
Moving a text block
It isn’t always obvious where Visio places a shape’s text block until you enter
some text in it or select the shape and press F2. In either case, you might find
that you don’t like the position of a text block and want to move it. In Figure
5-3, the text block for the star on the left covers up part of the shape. You
could reduce the font size, but then your text might not be readable. A better
solution is to move the text out of the star, as I did with the star on the right.
To move a text block independently of its shape, you use the Text Block
button. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Block button on the Standard toolbar.
Your mouse pointer changes to look like a sheet of paper with lines of
text.
To access the Text Block button, you click the down arrow next to the
Text Tool button on the Standard toolbar. Refer to Table 5-1 to see what
both buttons look like.
2. Click the shape that has the text you want to move.
The green text block frame and handles become visible.
3. Move the mouse over the text block frame until the pointer changes to
a double rectangle.
Notice when you hover the mouse pointer over the frame, the tool tip
says “Move Text Block.”
4. Drag the text block to reposition it.
Visio repositions the shape’s text block to the position you choose.
107
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

5. Click the Pointer Tool button to bring back your normal mouse
pointer.
Even if you move a text block halfway across a drawing page, it’s still attached
to its shape. If you move the shape, the shape’s text block moves with it. If you
copy the shape, the text is copied with it. If you paste the shape, the text is
pasted with it. And if you rotate the shape . . . well, you get the idea.
Because freestanding text is its own shape, you can move it just like you
move any other shape in a drawing. You don’t need to use the Text Block
button. Instead, just use the Pointer Tool button. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button (refer to Table 5-1) on the Standard 
toolbar.
2. Click the text-only shape that you want to move.
The green selection handles and frame appear.
3. Drag the text to a new location and release the mouse button.
Resizing a text block
Most shapes come with a text block of a reasonable size; that is, the text
block usually fits the shape. If you don’t like the size of a text block, it’s 
Figure 5-3:
Sometimes
you need to
move a text
block to
make the
shape more
visible.
108
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

possible to resize it. But it’s questionable whether you should spend your
time doing that, because text blocks automatically resize themselves if you
enter too much text!
So, does that mean resizing a text block is irrelevant? Not necessarily. You
can still set the size of a text block as a guideline for when you enter text. As
soon as you begin overfilling the text block, you’ll see it resize right before
your eyes. That’s your cue to stop typing or change to a smaller font size if
you need to enter more text.
Use these steps to resize a text block:
1. Click the Text Block button on the Standard toolbar.
When you move the mouse pointer over the text in the text block, the
pointer changes to a double rectangle.
2. Click the shape.
The green text block frame and handles appear. See Figure 5-4.

109
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

3. Move the mouse pointer over a side handle to resize the shape’s width
or over a top or bottom handle to resize the shape’s height. Or choose
a corner handle to resize in both directions at once.
The mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow.
4. Drag the handle to resize the text block, and then release the mouse
button.
5. Click the Pointer Tool button to bring back the standard mouse pointer.
Changing alignment
Whenever you create text in a drawing, you need to pay attention to how the
text is aligned. Horizontal alignment refers to the way characters line up left
to right in the text block. Vertical alignment refers to the way text lines up top
to bottom in the text block.
In many shapes, the default horizontal alignment is left alignment. However,
center, right, and justified alignments have their place and are sometimes
more appropriate. Figure 5-5 shows an example of each style.

To change the alignment of text, you could use menu commands, but it’s
much faster to use the toolbar. Toolbar buttons for text alignment appear on
the Formatting and Format Text toolbars.

To change the horizontal alignment of text in a text block, follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Tool button (refer to Table 5-1) on the Standard toolbar.
2. Click the shape that contains the text you want to change.
Visio displays the text block.
3. Select the paragraph that you want to align.
If you want to align all the text in the text block, you don’t need to select
anything.
4. Click the Align Left, Align Center, Align Right, Justify, or Distribute
button (refer to Table 5-2) on the Formatting toolbar.
Visio reformats the selected text.
Note in Step 3 that because horizontal alignment applies to each paragraph
individually, you can align separate paragraphs differently in the same text
block. If you want to align all text the same way in the text block, you don’t
need to select anything; Visio formats all paragraphs the same way.
I recommend that you use the tools in the preceding steps because they’re
faster than choosing menu commands. If you prefer using menu commands,
however, you can find alignment settings by choosing Format➪Text, clicking
the Paragraph tab in the Text dialog box, and then selecting the check box of
the alignment option that you want.
Vertical alignment refers to the alignment from top to bottom in a text block.
When you work with a text document, you don’t usually think about vertical
alignment because your text typically starts at the top and fills the page to
the bottom. However, when your text is contained in a text block (which is
really nothing more than a box), you can choose to align the text with the top
or bottom of the box, or you can center the text in the box, as shown in
Figure 5-6.
112
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

To change vertical alignment, you use the Align Top, Align Middle, and Align
Bottom buttons on the Format Text toolbar.
To set vertical alignment of a text block, follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Tool button on the Format Text toolbar.
2. Click the shape that contains the text that you want to change.
Visio displays the text block.

113
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings
To justify or distribute — that is the question!
Most people are familiar with left, center, and
right alignment but are stumped by justify and
distribute. Justify fills the space between the
left and right borders of a text block (except for
“incomplete” lines, which often occur at the
end of a paragraph) by adding spaces between
words. Distribute fills the space between left
and right borders (including short lines at the
end of a paragraph) by adding spaces between
words and characters. (I think Distribute looks
awkward, but I suppose it has its place.)

3. Click the Align Top, Align Middle, or Align Bottom button (refer to
Table 5-2).
Visio adjusts your text.
To set alignment, I recommend that you use the alignment buttons provided
on the Format Text toolbar. If you prefer using menu commands, alignment
settings are available by choosing Format➪Text, clicking the Text Block tab in
the Text dialog box, and selecting an option on the Vertical Alignment drop-
down list.
Note that unlike horizontal alignment, vertical alignment applies to all the
text in a text block.
Adjusting margins
Text block margins define the white space that surrounds text in a text block.
Visio sets very narrow text block margins — about 1⁄18 inch. In most cases,
these narrow margins are fine, because the outline of the text block usually
isn’t visible. But if you decide to outline a text block with a frame, these mar-
gins can be so narrow that the text doesn’t look right. For example, Figure 5-7
shows two text blocks. The text block on the left uses standard margins. The
margins for the text block on the right were increased to 1⁄2 inch. Not only
does the text block on the right look better, the words are more readable.
And you don’t get that claustrophobic feeling looking at it!
Visio uses points as the default units of measurement for text blocks and text
block margins. Text block margins are set to 4 points. Because 1 inch is equiv-
alent to 72 points, 4 points is equal to about 1⁄18 inch.
If you prefer to have Visio measure text and margins in inches, you can change
the default setting. Just choose Tools➪Options, click the Units tab, and then
change the Text setting. The drop-down box lists all the choices for units.
To change a text block’s margins, follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Block button (refer to Table 5-1) on the Standard toolbar.
When you move the mouse pointer over the text in the text block, the
pointer changes to a double rectangle.
2. Click the shape that has the text block you want to change.
The green text block frame and handles appear.
3. Choose Format➪Text or right-click and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears.
114
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

4. Click the Text Block tab, as shown in Figure 5-8.
5. In the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right boxes, type a number.
Visio measures margins in points (72 points = 1 inch). If you prefer to
use inches, enter them as decimal numbers and type in after the number
(such as .5 in).

Using tabs in a text block
Some types of text call for a tabular format, even in a drawing. You may
want to include a simple table in a drawing, with items aligned in rows
and columns. To create this type of layout, you need to set tab stops (or just
tabs) — the points where you want your cursor to jump when you press the
Tab key.
You can set tabs to be left aligned, right aligned, centered, or decimal aligned.
You can see examples of each in Figure 5-9. When you use a decimal-aligned
tab, be sure to type the decimal point in your entry. If you don’t enter a deci-
mal point, the entry is left aligned.

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

The quickest and easiest way to set tabs is by clicking them onto the Text
Block ruler. Here’s how:
1. Click the Text Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Click the shape with the text that you want to alter.
Visio displays the shape’s text block.
3. Right-click the text block and choose Text Ruler.
Visio displays a special ruler just for the text block. At the far left end of
the ruler is a sample tab for a left-aligned tab as shown in Figure 5-10.
4. Choose the tab type (left, centered, right, or decimal aligned) by click-
ing the sample tab until the type you want is displayed.
A left tab looks like an L, a center tab looks like an upside-down T, a right
tab looks like a backwards L, and a decimal tab looks like an upside-
down T with a decimal point (.) in it.

Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

5. Click directly on the ruler at the point where you want to set a tab.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to choose additional tabs.
Now you can type text in the text block. Press the Tab key when you want the
cursor to jump to a tab position.
To remove tabs, just drag them right off the ruler.
If you prefer to use a dialog box to set tabs rather than setting them on the
text block ruler, use these steps:
1. Click the Text Block button on the Standard toolbar.
When you move the mouse pointer over the text in the text block, the
pointer changes to a double rectangle.
2. Click the shape that has the text that you want to alter.
The green text block frame and handles appear.
3. Choose Format➪Text, or right-click and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears.
4. Click the Tabs tab, which is shown in Figure 5-11.
5. In the Tab Stop Position box, type a number (or click the up or down
arrow) and then click the Add button.
6. In the Alignment box, choose an alignment style (Left, Center, Right,
or Decimal).
Figure 5-11:

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

7. To add more tabs, repeat Steps 5 and 6.
8. When you’re finished adding tabs, click OK.
The Text dialog box closes and you’re returned to your drawing.
To remove tabs using the same dialog box, highlight the tab to remove in the
Tab Stops area and then click the Remove button.
Creating bulleted lists
Bulleted lists are common in drawings and diagrams — probably because
they help summarize and separate material. Fortunately, creating bulleted
lists in Visio is easy because Visio does it for you automatically.
You can set up a bulleted format for text that you already typed or for a blank
text block. If you set up a bulleted list in a blank text block, Visio inserts and
formats the bullets as you type the text.
Use these steps to create a bulleted list:
1. In the text block, select the text that you want to format with bullets.
If the text block is empty, select the text block itself.
2. Choose Format➪Text or right-click and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears.
3. Click the Bullets tab to display the bullet options, as shown in
Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12:
Choose
from several
bullet styles
and formats.
119
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

4. Click a bullet style.
5. If you want to change the bullet character size, enter a percentage in
the Font size box:
• To make the bullet character larger than the font text, enter a per-
centage greater than 100.
• To make the bullet character smaller, enter a number smaller
than 100.
6. In the Text Position box, enter the amount of space you want separat-
ing the bullet from the text (such as .25 in.).
7. If you want to use special characters for the bullet:
a. In the Bullet Characters box, type the character or characters
you want to use for the bullet.
b. In the Font box, choose a font.
This is especially important when using a special font such as
Wingdings or another special character font.
8. When you have made all your choices, click OK.
Visio returns to your drawing. If you selected text in Step 1, it formats
the text instantly.
If the text block is empty, the bullets will appear automatically when you
begin typing. Press Enter at the end of a line to begin a new bullet point.
Creating numbered lists
The process for creating numbered lists is a bit more complicated than the
process for creating bulleted lists. Visio doesn’t add numbers automatically
the way it does with bullets, so you need to type numbers and your text. I
think it’s easier to format the text block for a numbered list before you enter
the text and numbers. (It isn’t required, however.) The following steps show
you how to set up the indentation for a numbered list; keep in mind that you
may want to alter the steps slightly for your particular text.
Follow these steps to set up an empty text block for a numbered list:
1. Select an empty text block.
2. Choose Format➪Text or right-click and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears.
3. Click the Paragraph tab, as shown in Figure 5-13.
120
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

4. In the Horizontal Alignment box, choose Left.
5. In the Indentation Before Text box, type a measurement such as .5.
This sets the indentation from the left margin.
6. In the Indentation First Line box, type a measurement such as –.5.
This sets the position where you type the number for the numbered list.
The .5 measurement is a standard measurement, but you aren’t required
to use that measurement. You can just as easily use, say, .2 or 1.2. Just
make sure you use the same number for the Before Text and First Line
options, with the Before Text number positive and the First Line number
negative.
7. If you want to indent the right side of the paragraph, enter a measure-
ment in the Indentation After Text box.
8. Click OK.
Visio returns to your drawing.
In case you’re wondering what you just did in these steps, you created a
hanging indent. (The first line where the numbers begin hangs out to the left
of the rest of the paragraph.) You set the wrap point (the point where text
wraps on the second, third, and following lines) to .5 inches.
1. Type the number for the first item (such as 1).
2. Press the Tab key.
This tab becomes the text wrap point if your text is longer than one line.
3. Type the text for the first item.
4. Press Enter. 
Figure 5-13:
Set up the
format for a
numbered
list.
121
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

5. Repeat Steps 1-4 for all the items in the list. 
You must follow this process for each numbered item to format the text
correctly.
If you want to reformat existing text to a numbered list, use the same steps
outlined previously to set up numbered list formatting for the text block. The
difference is that you need to insert the item numbers in the existing text and
then be sure to press Tab between the number and the text.
Setting the indentation and spacing of text
To set the indentation for a paragraph, you use the Paragraph tab in the Text
dialog box. Indenting is like widening the margins on the left side, right side, or
both sides of a paragraph. For example, you may want to indent a particular
paragraph half an inch on the right and left sides to give it emphasis. You can
also make the first line of a paragraph stand out by indenting only that line.
The Paragraph tab in the Text dialog box also lets you adjust line spacing. For
example, you can automatically add space before or after paragraphs. Or you
can increase (or decrease) the spacing between lines within a paragraph. Like
margins, line spacing is measured in points unless you change the unit of mea-
surement by using the Tools➪Options command. (See the “Adjusting margins”
section earlier in this chapter for more about margins.) For extra space before
or after a paragraph, type a number in the Before or After box (see Figure 5-13).
To set the indentation and line spacing for a paragraph, follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to look like a sheet of paper with text.
2. In the text block or text-only shape, select all or part of the paragraph
that you want to indent.
3. Choose Format➪Text or right-click and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears.
4. Click the Paragraph tab.
5. To set the indentation for the paragraph you selected, type a number
(measured in inches or decimal inches) in the Before Text, After Text,
and First Line boxes.
6. To set line spacing for the selected paragraph, type a number (mea-
sured in points) in the Before, After, and Line boxes.
The Before and After boxes set the number of spaces preceding and fol-
lowing the paragraph; the Line box sets the spacing between lines in the
paragraph.
7. Click OK to return to your drawing.
122
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

A quick way to indent a paragraph on the left side is to use the Increase
Indent button on the Formatting toolbar (refer to Table 5-2). Highlight your
paragraph, and then click this button. Visio automatically indents the entire
paragraph 1⁄4 inch each time you click the button. To take away the indenta-
tion, click the Decrease Indent button (also shown in Table 5-2).
Changing the Way Your Text Looks
When you draw a text block and enter text, Visio automatically displays the
text as 8-point Arial black characters on a transparent background. Simple.
Sedate. Readable. Nothing dramatic. Are Visio shapes set up to display any-
thing more dramatic? Not typically. You might find some variation — maybe
12-point Arial instead of 8-point — but nothing to get excited about.
If you want more pizzazz in your text, it’s up to you to create it. You have the
option of changing the font, size, color, and style of text. You can also desig-
nate a case, position, and language. (No, Visio won’t translate English into
Portuguese for you!)
Changing the font, size, color, and
style of text
The quickest way to make changes to the look of text is by using toolbar but-
tons. Select the text that you want to change and click one of the toolbar but-
tons on the Format or Format Text toolbars (see Table 5-3). Some tools
change the selected text immediately; others display a drop-down box where
you can choose an option for changing the attributes.

The buttons you use to format text appear on two toolbars. Some are on the
Formatting toolbar, some are on the Format Text toolbar, and some are on
both toolbars. What’s the reasoning behind this? Your guess is as good as
mine! Just learn to look for the icon that represents the button you want. And
when you’re going to be formatting a lot of text, display the Format Text tool-
bar on your screen right away so you don’t have to hunt for the buttons.
If you want, you can use the Text dialog box to change the text attributes
listed in Table 5-3. To use the Text dialog box, follow these steps:
124
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

1. Select the text that you want to change.
2. Choose Format➪Text or right-click and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-14.
3. Click the drop-down box of the attribute that you want to change:
• To change the font: Click the Font drop-down list and choose a font
style. Unfortunately, the Font tab of the Text dialog box doesn’t
show you a preview of the font, so you can’t see how a font looks
before you choose it. The next best thing is to move the dialog box
out of the way so that you can see your selected text. This way,
when you click the Apply button, you can see how the text looks
without closing the dialog box and starting all over again.
• To change the text style: Click the Style drop-down list and choose
Regular, Italic, Bold, or Bold Italic.
• To change the text size: Click the Size drop-down list and choose a
point size for the selected text.
• To change the case: Click the Case drop-down list and choose
Normal (the default setting), All Caps, Initial Caps, or Small Caps.
• To change the position of the text: Click the Position drop-down
list and choose Subscript or Superscript.
• To underline: Click the Underline drop-down list and choose Single
or Double.
• To add strikethrough: Click the Strikethrough drop-down list and
choose Single or Double.
• To change the text color: Click the Color drop-down list and
choose a color for the selected text.

• To change the language used by the Spell Checker: Click the
Language drop-down list and choose a language other than English.
• To change the transparency of the text: Drag the slider arrow
along the bar until you find the transparency you want.
4. Click Apply.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 if you want to try other settings.
6. Click OK.
Visio returns to your drawing and reformats the selected text.
Choosing a background color for
a text block
If you aren’t satisfied with colorful characters alone, you can change the
background color of a text block as well. Just think of all the wonderful color
combinations you can come up with! Remember, though, your text needs to
be readable. The more contrast between the text and background colors, the
better. (Text blocks are transparent by default.)
To change the background color of a text block, follow these steps:
1. Click the Text Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Select the text block that you want to change.
3. Choose Format➪Text, or right-click the text block and choose Text.
The Text dialog box appears.
4. Click the Text Block tab.
5. In the Text Background area, choose a color from the Solid Color
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 5-15.
To make an opaque background on an unfilled shape, choose white.
6. Click OK.
Note: The preceding steps change the background color of a text block. This
is not the same thing as filling a shape with a color. The text block and the
shape can fill independently of one another. See Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion about filling shapes.
Painting the formatting to other text
When you use your precious time and energy to set up text with a magenta
background, chartreuse text, Elephant font, 38-point font size, underline,

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

bold, italic, and small caps, you don’t want to have to do it all over again
manually to make a matching text block! This task is much simpler if you just
paint the format to another shape. Painting the formatting not only saves you
time — it ensures consistency. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Click the text block that has the formatting you want to copy.
3. Click the Format Painter button on the Standard toolbar.
Your mouse pointer now includes a paintbrush.
4. Click the text block that you want to copy the format to.
Visio applies the format instantly.
These steps copy all aspects of the text formatting (font, size, color, bold,
italic, underline, and so on). Vertical and horizontal alignment, margin set-
tings, indentation, and tabs are characteristics that belong to the text block.
These characteristics are copied as well.
Rotating text
One of Visio’s most versatile features is its capability to rotate text. For most
Visio shapes, the text is oriented horizontally, but sometimes you may need
to rotate the text at an angle. Figure 5-16 shows a triangle on the left with a
horizontal text block. In the triangle on the right, the text block is rotated and
moved so that the text runs parallel to the triangle’s side.
To change the rotation of a shape’s text block, follow these steps:
Figure 5-15:
You can

127
Chapter 5: Adding Text to Your Drawings

1. Click the Text Block button on the Standard toolbar.
When you move the mouse pointer over the text in the text block, the
pointer changes to a double rectangle.
2. Click the text block.
Green selection handles appear, along with round rotation handles at
each corner of the frame.
3. Move the mouse pointer over one of the rotation handles.
The mouse pointer changes to two curved arrows in the shape of a circle.
4. Drag the text in the direction that you want to rotate the text.
If you want to rotate the text to a specific angle, such as 45 degrees, watch
the status bar as you rotate the text. Moving in a counterclockwise direction
produces a positive angle up to 180 degrees; moving clockwise displays nega-
tive angles up to –180 degrees.
If you want the text to align with a particular part of the shape (such as a
border or an outline), it may be necessary to move the text block after you
rotate it.

I
n this chapter, I unravel the mysteries of two of Visio’s most powerful fea-
tures: glue and connectors. The relationship between glue, connectors,
and shapes is a close one. After you understand how each one works, you’re
on your way to becoming a powerful Visio user.
Discovering Connectors
Connector is a term that is unique to Visio. The simple, nontechie explanation
is that connectors are lines between boxes. In the techie world, a connector is
a special, one-dimensional shape that you use to connect two-dimensional
shapes to one another. This technical definition allows for the fact that con-
nectors are not always lines; they can also be one-dimensional (1-D) shapes
such as arrows, arcs, hubs, and other specialized shapes (for example, an
Ethernet cable) that connect two-dimensional (2-D) shapes to each other.
Where and why do you use connectors? You use connectors to show the
following:
 The relationship between two shapes
 Hierarchy
 The path in a process
 Two connected shapes (this one seems obvious!)

130
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 
Some drawings don’t make any sense without connectors. Imagine an organi-
zation chart without connectors — you might have the president reporting to
the copy room clerk! (That doesn’t sound like a bad idea, does it?) You find
connectors in all sorts of drawings from network diagrams to process flow-
charts to Web page diagrams.
In Figure 6-1, the 2-D Executive shape in the organization chart is connected
to the 2-D Manager shapes. Manager shapes are connected to 2-D Position
shapes. All the connectors are 1-D shapes.
You can always distinguish a 1-D shape from a 2-D shape by the handles the
shape displays when you select it. 1-D shapes always have two endpoints —
small green squares with an x in the beginning point and a + in the ending
point. 2-D shapes always display a dotted green rectangle (the selection
frame) with green selection handles at corners and sides. (To review shape
characteristics, refer to Chapter 4.)

131
Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes
You can create a connector in one of three ways:
 Use the Connector Tool button on the Standard toolbar (to connect
shapes automatically as you add them to the drawing)
 Drag a connector shape from a stencil onto a drawing
 Use the Connect Shapes button on the Action toolbar to connect exist-
ing 2-D shapes
Visio connectors are more sophisticated than just simple lines or shapes. Some
connectors are dynamic, meaning they can reconnect to a different point on a
shape (if necessary) when you move the shape. Other connectors are smart,
meaning they can change their form or path around shapes depending on the
shapes they’re connected to. These features may seem vague and meaning-
less now, but you’ll soon discover how powerful they are.
In this chapter, you work with various tools on the Standard, Action, and View
toolbars. These tools are listed in Table 6-1. You might want to display the
Action and View toolbar on your screen while working with connectors in a
drawing. Just right-click in the toolbar area and select the toolbars you want
to display.

You can access the Connection Point Tool button by clicking the down arrow
to the right of the Connector Tool button. Or consider adding the Connection
Point Tool button to your Standard toolbar (so it’s visible all the time) by
clicking Toolbar Options (the arrow at the right end of the toolbar) and
choosing Add or Remove Buttons➪Customize.
It’s easy to get completely confused between Visio’s four different uses of the
root word connect — that is, Connect Shapes button, Connector Tool button,
Connection Point Tool button, and Connection Points button. As you work
through this chapter, try to memorize the icon associated with each button.
(The last one, Connection Points, controls only hiding or displaying connec-
tion points in a drawing, so I don’t mention it again in this chapter.) I can
almost guarantee you’ll be frustrated at first by trying to keep these four
tools straight, but I promise it will become clear with a little practice!
Working with Connection Points
The blue Xs that appear on the sides of each shape are called connection
points (refer to Figure 6-1). Connection points are the locations on a shape
where you can attach a connector. Connection points appear only on your
screen; they don’t appear on a printout of your drawing.
Adding connection points to a shape
Visio is pretty good about providing ample connection points on its shapes.
Sometimes, however, you might run across a shape that doesn’t have a con-
nection point where you want it. In that case, add one! Use these steps:
1. Select a shape.
2. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Connector Tool button on the
Standard toolbar and choose Connection Point.
(Table 6-1 lists these tools.) The mouse pointer changes to an arrow
with an X.
3. Hold down the Ctrl key and click the location on the shape where you
want to add a connection point. Then release the Ctrl key.
You can add as many connection points as you like (but don’t get carried
away!). You can place them on, inside, or outside a shape.
132
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

If you have trouble with Visio tugging your connection points away from
where you want to place them, try turning off the Snap function. (Visio turns
it on by default.) Snap “pulls” shapes and connectors to the nearest gridline,
ruler subdivision, line on a shape, vertex, and so on. Choose Tools➪Snap &
Glue. On the General tab, uncheck the Snap option and then click OK. (To
find out more about the Snap function, see Chapter 7.)
Deleting a connection point
Some shapes may have connection points that you don’t want to use.
Perhaps you added connection points that you no longer need. You can leave
them there and just ignore them, or you can delete them.
To delete a connection point from a shape:
1. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Connector Tool button on the
Standard toolbar.
2. Click the Connection Point Tool button, which looks like a blue X.
3. Click the connection point that you want to remove.
The connection point turns magenta.
4. Press the Delete key.
Voilà! The connection point is gone.
Applying Glue (Without the Mess)
Put your sticky white glue away — you don’t need it when you use Visio. Glue,
a feature built into Visio connectors, lets you stick connectors to shapes and
keep them there. This may not seem like an important function now, but it’s
important when you start moving connected shapes all over the place.
Imagine for a minute creating a glueless drawing. Without glue, you have to
move a connector each time you move a shape. If the distance between
shapes changes, you have to adjust the length of the connector. Then you
have to reattach the connector to the shape after you move it. If the path
between two shapes changes, you have to reroute the connector. Now multi-
ply those changes about 15 times, because you probably move shapes at
least that many times in a drawing before it’s finished. See? Glue sounds
pretty good now, doesn’t it? Without glue, creating and editing a drawing is
more work than you ever imagined.
133
Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

Choosing static or dynamic glue
Glue is such a great idea that Visio has two kinds: point-to-point (also known
as static glue) and shape-to-shape (also called dynamic glue). As you see in
this section, each one has a different purpose.
Point-to-point glue
Point-to-point glue forms a static connection between shapes. This means that
if you connect two boxes from points on the top of each box, those connec-
tors don’t budge, no matter where you move the boxes! The connectors stay
stuck to the top of each box, even if the drawing makes no sense or looks
goofy. Point-to-point glue is static, permanent, unchanging.
In Figure 6-2, the boxes at the bottom of the figure originally were arranged
like the ones at the top — with connectors attached to the tops of the boxes.
Each connector uses point-to-point glue. In the bottom of the figure, as you
rearrange the boxes, the connectors are still attached to the top of each box.
And yes, it looks goofy. That’s how point-to-point glue behaves. Think of
point-to-point glue as stubborn and unyielding.
Figure 6-2:
Point-to-
point glue

point, even

134
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

When the way in which shapes are connected is important, or when you want
connectors that stay exactly where you put them, use point-to-point glue.
Point-to-point glue is also good for drawings you create quickly and for draw-
ings that you aren’t likely to change a great deal.
Shape-to-shape glue
Unlike point-to-point glue, shape-to-shape glue is looking for adventure; it
loves to travel and find new places to rest! Yet, it’s a sensible traveler. When
you move a shape that has a connector attached with shape-to-shape glue,
the connector attaches itself to a different connection point if necessary —
one that makes sense in the drawing. (You can always change the connection
point if you don’t like it.)
Because shape-to-shape glue can attach to any connection point on a shape, it
forms what are called dynamic connections. Figure 6-3 shows the same boxes
pictured in Figure 6-2, but the connectors in Figure 6-3 use shape-to-shape
glue. If you move shapes connected with shape-to-shape glue, the connectors
move to more logical connection points (usually the nearest point) on each
box instead of sticking to a specific connection point. Notice in Figure 6-3 that
some boxes are now connected at the sides and bottom instead of the top.
Figure 6-3:
Shape-to-
shape glue
enables
connectors
to shift to

points when

shapes.
135
Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

You want to use shape-to-shape glue when you anticipate moving shapes
around a lot, or when it’s not important to you that shapes connect at spe-
cific points.
Sometimes identical terminology in Visio can be confusing. You already know
the popularity of the word connect in Visio. Well, they did it again! The term
dynamic describes glue as well as connectors. Dynamic simply means change-
able. Dynamic glue attaches a connector to a different point on a shape; a
dynamic connector changes its shape and path, if necessary.
Identifying glue types
With two types of glue, you need to be able to see in your drawing whether a
connector uses shape-to-shape glue or point-to-point glue. After you select a
connector (one that’s connected at both ends to a shape), look at its end-
points. You see one of two things:
 When a connector uses point-to-point glue, the connector’s endpoints
are dark red squares and are the size of other endpoints and selection
handles. The beginning point has an X in it; the ending point has a + in it.
 When a connector uses shape-to-shape glue, the endpoints are bright
red squares and are larger than other endpoints and selection handles.
The endpoint contains no + or X symbols.
Switching from one glue to the other
Before I leave this topic, I want to tell you how to switch a connection from
one type of glue to the other. Knowing how to change glue types can be
important depending on the type of drawing you create, how much you want
to control connections, and how much you may want to change the drawing
as you work on it. You might create a connection with shape-to-shape glue
and then decide that you want the connector to always stay attached to a
shape’s lower-left corner no matter where you move the shape.
The trick to switching glue types lies in where you point your mouse as you
move the connector’s endpoint. When you point somewhere inside a shape,
you get shape-to-shape glue; when you point directly to a connection point,
you get point-to-point glue.
1. Click the Pointer Tool button (refer to Table 6-1) on the Standard
toolbar.
2. Select the connector that you want to change.
136
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

3. Drag either endpoint away from the shape, and then drag the end-
point back toward the shape until a red border appears around the
entire shape.
You must point somewhere inside the shape, not to a connection point.
4. Release the mouse button when the red border appears around the
entire shape.
When you release the mouse button, the endpoint attaches. The end-
point is bright red and slightly larger than other endpoints. This tells
you that the connection is now shape-to-shape.
5. Repeat Steps 2-4 for the other endpoint of the connector so that both
endpoints now use shape-to-shape glue.
When you use shape-to-shape glue, you don’t get to choose the connection
point; Visio chooses the nearest logical point to connect to. If you move the
shape that the connector is attached to, the connector might attach to a
different point.
Shape-to-shape glue is available only to dynamic connectors. Why? Because
dynamic connectors have elbow joints: points on the connector at which it
can bend. Without them, the connector wouldn’t be able to change its path
when you move the shape that’s attached to it. (This rule makes sense if you
think about it.) If you don’t see elbow joints, the connector is a straight con-
nector, and you can use only point-to-point glue. See the “Drawing connectors
using the Connector Tool” section later in this chapter for more information
about dynamic connectors and elbow joints.
To change a dynamic (shape-to-shape) connection to a static (point-to-point)
one, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Select the connector that you want to change.
3. Drag either endpoint away from the shape, and then drag the end-
point toward the connection point where you want to attach the
connector.
A bright red border appears around the connection point only.
4. Release the mouse button.
The endpoint is attached to the connection point. The connection point
is a small dark red square, which tells you that the connector is now
using point-to-point (static) glue.
5. Repeat Steps 2-4 with the other endpoint of the connector so that both
ends now use point-to-point glue.
137
Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

Setting glue options
You might think that connection points are the only areas on a shape where
you can attach connectors. In fact, you can attach connectors to guides,
shape handles, and shape vertices as well. You also can glue to a shape’s
geometry (anywhere along the lines or curves that define the shape) even
without a connection point. You can choose from five options in the Glue To
box located in the Snap and Glue dialog box (see Figure 6-4).
Follow these steps to select glue options:
1. Choose Tools➪Snap & Glue.
The Snap and Glue dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
2. In the Glue To list, click the check boxes of the points to which you
want to glue connectors.
The Guides and Connection Points options are selected for you automat-
ically. (Guides are lines that you can add to a drawing to help you posi-
tion shapes accurately. See Chapter 7 for more on guides.)
If you want to glue connectors to shape geometry, shape handles, or
shape vertices, click these check boxes as well. Or you can deselect any
of the five options.
3. Click OK.
When you choose the Shape Geometry option, you can glue a connector to any
point that defines the shape. A circle is a perfect example. A circle typically
has five connection points: top, bottom, right, left, and center. When Shape
Geometry is not selected as a glue option, you can glue a connector to only
one of these five points. When Shape Geometry is selected, you can attach a
connector to any point along the circumference of the circle. The best part is
that you can drag the connector clockwise or counterclockwise, and it stays
attached to any point you choose along the circumference of the circle.

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

Gluing Connectors to Shapes
Visio offers several methods for connecting shapes in a drawing. Some let
you connect shapes as you drag them into your drawing, and others let you
add connectors later. This section discusses each of the methods for con-
necting shapes. The method you use pretty much comes down to the type of
glue you want to use and personal preference.
Connecting shapes as you drag them
Connecting shapes as you drag them into your drawing is by far the quickest,
easiest, no-brainer way to connect shapes. This method is fast because it
combines two steps into one.
To connect shapes as you drag them, you use the Connector Tool button on
the Standard toolbar. This method uses shape-to-shape glue and dynamic
connectors, so if you move shapes later, the connectors reconnect to the
closest logical points. Follow these steps to connect and drag shapes into
your drawing all in one step:
1. If necessary, choose File➪Shapes to open the stencils that you want
to use.
2. Click the Connector Tool button (refer to Table 6-1) on the Standard
toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to the connector tool, which looks like an
elbow-shaped arrow.
3. Drag a shape that you want to use onto the drawing page.
4. Drag another shape into the drawing.
Visio uses shape-to-shape glue to connect the two shapes automatically
with a dynamic (elbow-jointed) connector.
5. Repeat Step 4 until all the shapes that you want are in the drawing.
Visio continues to connect each additional shape to the previous one
using shape-to-shape glue.
6. Click the Pointer Tool button to display the regular mouse pointer.
As you work through these steps, you may notice that the most recent shape
you dragged into the drawing is the one that’s selected. After you drag
another shape into the drawing, that shape becomes the one that’s selected.
To turn off this automatic connection feature, click the Pointer Tool button
on the Standard toolbar again.
Figure 6-5 shows two boxes that were connected as they were dragged into the
drawing. The Connector Tool button is highlighted on the toolbar, the mouse
pointer is an elbow-shaped arrow, and the connector glues dynamically.
139
Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

If the automatic connection feature isn’t working for you, you may be trying
to connect 1-D shapes. This feature automatically connects only 2-D shapes.
(If you need to connect 1-D shapes — which is a rarity — you can draw con-
nectors. See the next section to find out more about drawing connectors.)
Drawing connectors using the
Connector Tool
If your drawing already contains 2-D shapes, you can use the Connector Tool
button to go back later and make connections using either point-to-point or
shape-to-shape glue. The Connector Tool button creates dynamic connectors —
that is, incredible, bendable, flexible, elbow-jointed connectors (see Figure 6-6).

Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

To draw a dynamic connector using point-to-point glue, follow these steps:
1. Click the Connector Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to an elbow-shaped arrow.
2. Move the mouse pointer over a connection point on a shape.
You see a bold red border around the connection point.
3. Click the connection point and then drag the mouse pointer to a con-
nection point on another shape.
You see a bold red border around the connection point on the second
shape.
4. Release the mouse button.
The connector is selected and you can see that the endpoints are small
dark red squares, indicating a static (point-to-point) glue.

Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

If you want to use shape-to-shape glue instead with a dynamic connector, the
method is similar but not quite the same as in the preceding steps. Instead of
pointing to a connection point, you must point somewhere inside the shape
itself. This ensures that the connector uses shape-to-shape glue. Follow these
steps:
1. Click the Connector Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to an elbow-shaped arrow.
2. Move the mouse pointer over the first shape you want to connect. (Be
sure to point inside the shape, not at a connector.)
You see a bold red border around the entire shape.
3. Click and then drag the mouse pointer to point to another shape. (Be
sure to point inside the shape, not at a connector.)
When you point to a second shape, you see a bold red border around it.
The connector attaches to the most logical point on the second shape
automatically using dynamic glue.
Saving time with the Connect
Shapes button
The Connect Shapes button is a powerful timesaver. It connects two or more
2-D shapes automatically in the order that you want them connected. This is
another good method to use when you have existing shapes that you need to
connect.
To use the Connect Shapes button, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button (which looks like an arrow) on the
Standard toolbar.
2. Hold down the Shift key and click all the shapes (one by one) in the
order that you want to connect them.
3. Click the Connect Shapes button (refer to Table 6-1) on the Action
toolbar, or Choose Tools➪Connect Shapes.
Visio connects all the shapes automatically using dynamic glue and
dynamic connectors (see Figure 6-7).
Choosing a custom connector
to connect shapes
A cool variation of the Connect Shapes button lets you connect shapes with
the type of connector you choose (something other than a plain line). Suppose,
142
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

for example, that you want to connect four boxes with block-style arrows or
arrow-tipped lines. These are just two examples of 1-D shapes that you can
choose from the File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras➪Connectors stencil. If you
choose one of these connectors and follow the next set of steps, Visio auto-
matically uses that shape as a connector:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Choose File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras➪Connectors.
The Connectors stencil appears.
3. Click the connector that you want to use.
4. In the drawing, hold down the Shift key and click all the shapes in the
order that you want to connect them.
5. Click the Connect Shapes button (refer to Figure 6-7) on the Action
toolbar.
Visio automatically creates dynamic glue connections between all the
shapes that you selected using the connector you chose.

Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

All connectors are 1-D shapes. Some stencils contain 1-D shapes that Visio
calls connectors.
Figure 6-8 shows the 1-D Double shape from the Connectors stencil, which
serves as the connector between flowchart shapes.
If you try these steps and the “connector” you chose doesn’t work, it’s proba-
bly because it’s not a 1-D shape. To act as a connector, a shape must be one-
dimensional. A 1-D shape has two endpoints (visible when selected); a 2-D
shape has a selection frame and handles. (To review shapes, refer to Chapter 4.)
Dragging connector shapes
into your drawing
You can also connect shapes by dragging 1-D connector shapes from stencils
into your drawing. The shape you use must be one-dimensional, and you can
connect only at connection points.
To find 1-D connector shapes, choose File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras➪Connectors.
Occasionally other stencils (for instance, the File➪Shapes➪Block Diagram➪
Blocks stencil) might contain a connector or two. When you find one, you can
drag it into a drawing and use it as a connector. Here’s how:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Choose File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras➪Connectors, or choose another
stencil that contains 1-D connectors.
3. Drag the connector that you want to use into the drawing.
4. Do one of the following:
• To make a connection using point-to-point (static) glue, drag one
endpoint of the connector, point to a connection point on the
shape, and then release the mouse button.
First you see a bold red border around the connection point. Then
when you release the mouse button, you see the small dark red
endpoint (indicating a point-to-point connection).
• To make a connection using shape-to-shape (dynamic) glue, drag
one endpoint of the connector, point to an empty area inside the
shape, and then release the mouse button.
First you see a bold red border around the entire shape. Then
when you release the mouse button, you see a large red square
endpoint (indicating a shape-to-shape connection).
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to connect more shapes.
144
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

Moving connectors
When you want absolute control over where your connectors attach to a
shape, you choose point-to-point (static) glue. But if you change your mind
about where you attached a connector, you can always move it. Suppose you
originally attached a connector to the bottom of a shape, now you want to
attach it to the top. You can move the point at which a connector attaches
using these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar (see Table 6-1).
2. In the drawing, click the connector you want to move.
The connector is highlighted.
3. Drag the endpoint away from the shape, and then drag it to the con-
nection point on the shape where you want to reconnect.
Visio breaks the original connection then outlines the new connection
point in red when you point to it.

4. Release the mouse button.
Visio displays the small dark red square at the new connection point,
indicating a static glue connection.
Managing Connectors
Some drawings can become quite complex, with connectors running every-
where! You need to have a strategy for making your drawings clearly under-
stood. This section discusses what to do when connectors cross paths and
how to route connectors in the direction you want them to go.
Handling connectors that cross paths
In some drawings, such as flowcharts or network diagrams, you might run
into problems when connectors cross each other. In a simple drawing, this
might not be an issue. But when a drawing is complex, it can be difficult to
follow connectors that cross paths.
To solve this problem, Visio adds a jump — sort of a wrinkle in a line — to all
horizontal connectors in a drawing that cross vertical connectors. The jump
makes it easier to see which shapes are connected, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Line jumps are controlled by the settings you choose on the Layout and
Routing tab of the Page Setup dialog box (see Figure 6-10). By default, Visio
adds an arc-shaped jump to horizontal lines, but you can change the default
settings. If you do, the changes apply to all new lines you draw in the current
drawing. To make these choices, use the following steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup.
2. Click the Layout and Routing tab (see Figure 6-10).
3. In the Add Line Jumps To box, choose the type of lines for which you
want to display line jumps.
4. In the Line Jump Style box, choose a style.
5. To alter the width of jumps, drag the Horizontal Size bar.
6. To alter the height of jumps, drag the Vertical Size bar.
7. Click Apply to preview the settings in your drawing.
8. When all settings are correct, click OK.
146
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

If you just want to alter jumps on a case-by-case basis rather than changing
the default settings, use the buttons shown in Table 6-2.

Laying Out Shapes Automatically
Visio provides an automatic layout feature for drawings that typically include
connected shapes, such as organization charts, network diagrams, flowcharts,
and tree diagrams. This feature saves you the trouble of rearranging shapes
manually when you need to make a change in a large drawing. For instance,
suppose your company is reorganizing and adding two departments. You need
148
Part II: Creating Visio Drawings 

to update the organization chart by inserting new boxes for managers and
workers. Inserting is the easy part, but rearranging and realigning is the killer!
Visio’s Lay Out Shapes feature makes this all a piece of cake.
You can also use Lay Out Shapes when you’re in a hurry to create a con-
nected drawing. You can quickly drag new shapes into a drawing without
paying too much attention to position or alignment, then let Visio do that
part for you. An example of a messy, hastily drawn organization chart is
shown in Figure 6-11. Lay Out Shapes can arrange and align all the shapes the
way they should be.
Using Lay Out Shapes
To use Lay Out Shapes, you must establish connections between the shapes
in the drawing. If you’re creating a drawing, the easiest way to do this is by
clicking the Connector Tool button before you start dragging shapes into
your drawing. (Visio automatically connects one shape to the next when you
click the Connector Tool button.) After all the shapes are in the drawing and
connected, you’re ready to use Lay Out Shapes.
Figure 6-11:
Use Lay Out
Shapes to

149
Chapter 6: Connecting Shapes

To use the Lay Out Shapes feature, follow these steps:
1. Drag all the shapes and connectors into the drawing.
2. Choose one of the following:
• To arrange all shapes, click a blank area of the drawing.
• To arrange only certain shapes, drag a selection box around the
shapes you want Visio to arrange.
3. Choose Shape➪Lay Out Shapes.
The Lay Out Shapes dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-12.
4. In the Placement area, do the following:
a. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Style box and highlight
your choice.
Visio displays a preview of each style on the right side of the 
dialog box.
Note: As you work your way through this dialog box, some of the
drop-down boxes listed in these steps may become unavailable
based on previous choices you make.
b. In the Direction box, make a selection.
Check out the preview on the right.
c. In the Depth box, make a selection.
In an organization chart, for example, choose Deep if the chart con-
tains more vertical shapes than horizontal ones — that is, more
positions and fewer managers. If the chart contains more horizon-
tal than vertical shapes (more managers than positions) choose
Shallow. If the drawing is pretty evenly weighted, choose Medium.

o one likes a messy drawing. This chapter shows you how to use Visio’s
tools to measure, place, and line up elements in a drawing. These tools
make “perfecting” tasks easy and save you time. Don’t feel that you must use
all these ideas. Choose the ones that make the most sense for your particular
drawing.
All about Measurements and 
Placement Tools
This section gives you a preview of the terms used in this chapter. That way,
you won’t be scratching your head and wondering what the heck I’m talking
about:
 Alignment and distribution: Alignment refers to shapes lining up evenly.
Distribution refers to objects being spaced evenly across a given area.
When shapes aren’t aligned and distributed evenly in a drawing, your
eyes sense that something is wrong. Visio helps you automatically align
and distribute shapes.

 Grid lines: These prominent vertical and horizontal lines make the
drawing area look like graph paper. The grid is a useful tool for measur-
ing and placing shapes. (In many of the figures in this book, I turned the
grid off so that you could focus on the topic at hand.)
 Guides: You can add guide lines and guide points to a drawing to help
position and place shapes accurately. If you were to draw a furniture
layout on paper, you might lightly sketch lines that represent the bound-
aries of the room so you could place the furniture precisely. Guides
serve the same purpose in Visio.
 Rulers: These are the objects on the top and left side of the drawing area
that look curiously like — well, rulers! Rulers, as you may expect, act as
measuring devices.
 Scale: Scale is the ratio of real-life objects to the shapes in your drawing.
Remember the last time you looked at a map? The scale was probably 10
miles per 1 inch or something close to that. Unless you can print on life-
size paper, you have to scale a drawing when it includes life-size objects!
 Snap: This feature pulls, or attracts, shapes to any object that you specify
such as another shape, a grid line, a guide, or a connection point. This is a
terrific feature that helps you place shapes accurately.
As you work through this chapter, it’s helpful to have Rulers, Grid, Guides,
and Connection Points checkmarked on your View menu. (Just click them.) If
they aren’t checkmarked, they won’t show up on your screen, and you might
think I’m just making ’em up (or seeing things)!
You might also find it useful to display the View toolbar (choose View➪
Toolbars➪View). The View toolbar buttons are listed in Table 7-1. Each
button is a toggle that turns the named feature on or off.

Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

Using the Drawing Grid
Whenever you create a new drawing, Visio automatically displays a drawing
grid — horizontal and vertical lines that make the drawing area look like graph
paper. The grid helps you place shapes where you want them in a drawing.
Just as you can buy graph paper in different grid sizes, you can set the grid den-
sity (fine, normal, or coarse) for your drawing. Why would you care about
density? If you create a drawing with very small shapes that you want to place
precisely, you probably want a finer density — say, lines every 1⁄8 inch or so. On
the other hand, if you use very large shapes in your drawing, a 1⁄2-inch grid is
more than adequate. See Figure 7-1 for an example of a density set to normal.
Keep in mind that what you see on your screen depends on your monitor and
the resolution you use. To figure out what fine, normal, and coarse mean on
your monitor, experiment with them by changing the grid density. (The steps
to do so appear later in this section.)
The grid in Visio is variable. When you zoom in on a drawing, grid lines
become more dense; when you zoom out, the grid lines are less dense. This 
is a great feature when you want to place shapes right on the money.
Figure 7-1:
A 1⁄2-inch

158
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

If your mouse is equipped with a wheel, the coolest and quickest way to
zoom in and out is by holding the Ctrl key as you roll the mouse wheel for-
ward or backward.
Like most settings in Visio, you can turn off the variable grid and instead use
a fixed grid (see the steps that follow). If you use a fixed grid, the density
stays the same, regardless of the zoom percentage you use. Typically, a grid
is evenly spaced horizontally and vertically; when horizontal lines occur
every 1⁄2 inch, vertical lines do, too. However, you can set an uneven grid if
you like, with 1⁄2-inch horizontal grid lines and 1⁄4-inch vertical grid lines, for
example.
To change grid settings or set a fixed grid, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Ruler & Grid.
The Ruler and Grid dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-2. Notice
that the dialog box includes separate areas for horizontal and vertical
grid lines so that you can set the grid scales independently.
2. Click the drop-down lists for Grid Spacing Horizontal and Grid
Spacing Vertical and then click Fine, Normal, Coarse, or Fixed.
3. If you want to get picky about the minimum spacing to use (for Fine,
Normal, or Coarse), type a number (in inches) in the Minimum
Spacing boxes.
4. Click OK.
Note: The grid doesn’t appear when you print the drawing. It’s only an on-
screen visual aid.

Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

If you ever want to turn off the drawing grid, click the Grid button on the
View toolbar or choose View➪Grid. Turning off the grid helps you see how
the drawing will look when you print it.
Using Dynamic Grid
If you create flowcharts or block diagrams, you should check out the dynamic
grid feature. The dynamic grid helps you position new shapes vertically and
horizontally relative to shapes you’ve already placed in the drawing. How
does it work? As you drag a flowchart or block diagram shape into your draw-
ing, horizontal and vertical reference lines appear along with the shape. As
you move the shape around the drawing, the reference lines “jump” to show
you when the shape is in alignment with another shape close by. When the
shape is aligned where you want it, release the mouse button; the reference
lines disappear.
Dynamic grid is automatically active when you create a flowchart. To activate
dynamic grid for block diagrams or other drawings, click the Dynamic Grid
button on the Snap and Glue toolbar (refer to Table 7-2) or choose Tools➪
Snap & Glue and then check the Dynamic Grid option in the Currently Active
list and click OK. Each time you click the Dynamic Grid button, the dynamic
grid feature toggles on or off.
Setting Drawing Scale
When you create a drawing that doesn’t represent a real-life object, such as a
flowchart, you don’t need to worry about scale. Who cares if your decision
shape is 11⁄8 -inch wide and your process shape is 13⁄4-inch wide? When you
use a template to create a flowchart (or any other type of drawing with
abstract shapes), Visio automatically sets the drawing scale to 1:1 (drawing
size:actual size).
However, when you create a drawing with shapes that represent any real-life
objects larger than a page, the drawing must be scaled so that all the objects fit
on the page in proper relation to one another. For example, suppose you want
to create an office layout. If you choose the Building Plan category and the
Office Layout template, Visio automatically sets the drawing scale to 1⁄2 inch:1
foot. That is, every 1⁄2 inch shown on the printed page represents 1 foot of office
space. Terrific — Visio does all the work for you! An example of a 1⁄4 inch:1 foot
office layout is shown in Figure 7-3.
160
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

If you’re not using a template or if you want to adjust the scale set by a tem-
plate, you can set a drawing scale yourself. Here’s the terminology you need
to understand first:
 Page units represent the measurements on the printed page. For example,
in a room layout drawing that uses 1⁄4 inch to represent 1 foot of real-life
objects, inches are the page units. An 8-foot couch measures 2 inches in
page units.
 Measurement units represent the real-life measurement of objects in a
drawing. For example, in the same room layout drawing that uses 1⁄4 inch
to represent 1 foot, feet are the measurement units. Therefore, 2 inches
on the drawing represents 8 feet of a real-life object.
 Drawing scale is the ratio between page units and measurement units.
The larger the spread between page units and measurements units, the larger
the area you can illustrate in a drawing. For example, you can represent a
much larger area with a drawing scale of 1⁄8 inch:1 yard than you can with a
drawing scale of 1⁄4 inch:1 foot.
Figure 7-3:
The 1⁄4 inch
per 1 foot
scale works

layout.
161
Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

You can set a different drawing scale for individual pages in a drawing.
To set the drawing scale for the current page of a drawing, follow these steps:
1. Display the drawing page for which you want to set a new drawing
scale.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
3. Click the Drawing Scale tab, which is shown in Figure 7-4.
4. Choose a predefined scale or set your own scale:
• To choose an architectural or engineering predefined scale, click the
Pre-defined Scale option and select a scale from the drop-down list.
• To set your own scale, click Custom Scale and then type a number
and units in the first box for page units and a number and units in
the second box for measurement units. For fractional units, enter
the decimal equivalent, such as .125 in. for 1⁄8 inch.
5. Note the page size, displayed near the bottom of the dialog box.
These numbers tell you how large an area you can represent in your
drawing. If the area isn’t large enough, increase your page units. If the
area is too large, decrease your page units. For example, if you need to
draw an office plan that’s 50 feet x 40 feet and the page size shows only
40 feet x 30 feet, you need to increase page units.
6. Before leaving this dialog box, click the Page Properties tab.
Notice that Visio automatically sets the measurement units for the cur-
rent page to match the setting you chose in Step 4.
7. Click OK.

Visio automatically adjusts the scale in your drawing (as well as the ruler
scale) to the new settings you chose.
Snapping Shapes into Place
Snap is a terrific Visio feature. You can’t imagine how much time you waste
trying to precisely place shapes without using snap.
The snap feature in Visio works like a magnet. When snap is turned on, a
shape jumps to certain points as you drag it around the drawing area. You
can attach a shape to any of the following elements:
 Ruler subdivisions: Tick marks that appear on the ruler (1 inch, 1⁄2 inch,
1⁄4 inch, and so on).
 Grid: Horizontal and vertical graph lines in the drawing area.
 Alignment box: A shape’s frame (displayed only when a shape is
selected).
 Shape extensions: Dotted lines that extend out from a shape (such as
the horizontal or vertical line of the edges of a rectangle). 
 Shape geometry: The visible edges of a shape.
 Guides: Special lines or points that you add to a drawing to help you
align shapes.
 Shape intersections: The points at which shapes intersect.
 Shape handles: The square green handles on a selected shape that you
use to resize the shape.
 Shape vertices: The green diamond-shaped points on a shape where
lines come together.
 Connection points: Blue Xs that appear on shapes when View➪
Connection Points is checked.
When using snap features, it’s helpful to display the Snap and Glue toolbar,
which includes the buttons shown in Table 7-2. Note that many of these but-
tons mirror the Snap and Glue dialog box settings in the preceding list.
Visio turns on snap automatically for ruler, grid lines, connection points, and
guides. This means that whenever you drag a shape around the drawing area,
the shape jumps (whether you notice it or not!) to align itself to ruler subdivi-
sions, grid lines, guides, or connection points on other shapes. For example,
suppose you want to space three rectangles 1⁄2 inch apart. As you drag the
163
Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

shapes, they jump to the nearest grid line or ruler subdivision, placing the
rectangles exactly 1⁄2 inch apart (see Figure 7-5). You could line up these
shapes using the rulers and the grid as a visual guide, but why spend more
time than you need to when Visio’s snap feature helps you do it automatically?
You can choose to have objects snap to any combination of the elements
from the list, or you can have them snap to none. Turning on all snap options
at the same time can be distracting because your shapes jump every time
they get near anything! I recommend that you turn on only the snap options
that you really want to use. For instance, you may not want to choose grid
and ruler at the same time. Because grid lines rarely correspond to ruler
markings, it’s not clear where your shape is jumping when both options are
selected at the same time.
Along with choosing snap elements, you get to set the strength of snap. It’s
sort of like choosing between a tiny refrigerator magnet and a 10-pound
horseshoe magnet. The bigger the magnet, the harder snap pulls. (I doubt
you need to set strength; in all the years I’ve used Visio, I’ve never noticed
snap not pulling hard enough.)

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

To change snap settings, use these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Snap & Glue.
The Snap and Glue dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
2. In the Snap To area, click the elements for which you want to activate
snap.
3. Click OK.
If you want to turn snap off altogether, click the Toggle Snap button on the
Snap and Glue toolbar, or choose Tools➪Snap & Glue and uncheck the Snap
box in the Currently Active area of the dialog box. When you turn snap off,
shapes move freely as you drag them around the drawing area. (No more
Mexican jumping beans!)
Measuring Up with Rulers
Some drawings don’t require rulers. For instance, if your drawing is com-
pletely abstract (that is, completely unrelated to real-world shapes), such as
a flowchart or an audit diagram, rulers are meaningless. You don’t care
whether your shapes are 1 inch wide or 11⁄4 inches wide; it doesn’t change the
meaning of the information your drawing conveys. The only thing you really
care about is whether your drawing fits on the page. When you work with a
scaled drawing, however, accurate measurements are essential. By displaying
vertical and horizontal rulers in a drawing, you can instantly see the size of a
shape and how much space you have on the drawing page.
Figure 7-6:
Choose the
elements

shapes to
snap to.
165
Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

In unscaled Visio drawings, rulers typically display either inches or centime-
ters, depending on the template of the drawing type you chose. (Recall that
almost all drawing types are available in U.S. units or metric units.) Scaled
drawings typically display either feet or meters, but you have many other
choices. For example, you might want to use yards for drawings that repre-
sent real-life objects, such as landscape plans. If you use the metric system,
you might want to switch ruler units to centimeters or millimeters.
Changing the units that the ruler displays does nothing to change the draw-
ing scale. Scale is a ratio of units displayed on the page (or screen) to real-life
measurements. The ruler changes only the units displayed in a drawing, not
their scale.
To change the unit of measure displayed on a drawing page, follow these steps:
1. Open your drawing and display the page for which you want to
change ruler units.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box appears.
3. Click the Page Properties tab.
4. Click the drop-down arrow for Measurement Units (see Figure 7-7) and
select the unit you want to use for the current page.
5. Click OK.
Visio changes the ruler’s measurement units for only the current page. If your
drawing contains multiple pages, you can display different ruler units on
other pages. Just display the correct drawing page before using the preced-
ing steps, or choose the correct page in the Name drop-down list in the Page
Setup dialog box.
Figure 7-7:
Select the
measure-
ment units

166
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

The zero point for the rulers (the point where 0 appears on a ruler) is gener-
ally in the lower-left corner of the drawing page, but you can change this
position. If you want a symmetrical drawing, you might move the ruler’s zero
points to the middle of the page, draw half of a drawing, and then mirror it.
Or suppose you’re drawing an office layout. You might find the drawing
easier to work with if you move the zero points to align with the left and
upper walls so you can measure distances from that point (see Figure 7-8).
To change the zero point of both rulers at the same time, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer to the gray square where the vertical ruler
and horizontal ruler intersect (in the upper-left corner of the drawing
area).
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
2. Hold down the Ctrl key and drag the mouse to the new location for
the zero point of both rulers.
As you move your mouse, watch the faint dotted line that appears on
each ruler, marking the position of the mouse.

167
Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

3. Release the mouse button when the zero point is positioned where
you want it.
If you want to change the zero point of just one ruler, use the same basic pro-
cedure, but drag from one ruler only. For example, if you want to place the
zero point on the horizontal ruler 2 inches in from the left edge of the paper,
follow these steps:
1. Point to the vertical ruler until you see the double-headed arrow
mouse pointer.
That’s right. To change the zero point on the horizontal ruler, you point
to the vertical ruler.
2. Hold the Ctrl key and drag the mouse until the vertical line is posi-
tioned where you want the zero point on the horizontal ruler.
If you prefer not to do all this dragging, you can choose Tools➪Ruler & Grid.
When the Ruler and Grid dialog box appears (refer to Figure 7-2), enter zero
points (measured in inches) in the Ruler Zero boxes for Horizontal, or
Vertical, or both.
To reset the zero points of both rulers to their default position, just double-
click the intersection of the rulers (in the upper-left corner of the drawing
area).
This is a good time to use the snap feature, discussed previously in the chap-
ter. Before you adjust the zero point for your rulers, turn on Snap for Rulers if
it isn’t on already. (The steps are detailed in the “Snapping Shapes into Place”
section.) With ruler snap turned on, your mouse jumps to ruler subdivisions
so that you can easily place the zero point.
Using Guide Lines and Guide Points
As if you don’t already have enough options for positioning shapes in a draw-
ing, Visio gives you two more! Guide lines and guide points work in combination
with snap. Use guide lines when you want a bunch of shapes to line up with
each other. Use guide points when you want to pinpoint a shape in an exact
location.
To make guide lines and guide points work, you have to turn on snap for
guides; otherwise, your guides don’t do anything except clutter up your
drawing. (See the “Snapping Shapes into Place” section earlier in this chapter
to set snap elements.) In Figure 7-9, all the shapes are snapped to the guide
line because snap is set to work on guides and shape handles.
168
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

To snap shapes to a guide, drag the shape near the guide. The shape snaps
automatically to the guide. When you select the shape, the shape’s red selec-
tion handles clearly indicate that the shape is glued to the guide. (Visio uses
dynamic glue, or shape-to-shape glue, to glue shapes to guides. See Chapter 6
for more information about dynamic glue.)
The useful thing about guide lines and guide points is that you can move
them. When you do, all the shapes attached to the guides move right along
with them.
Creating guide lines
To create a guide line, use these steps:
1. Move your mouse pointer over the vertical ruler (to create a vertical
guide) or over the horizontal ruler (to create a horizontal guide) until
the mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow.
Guide line
Figure 7-9:
Guide lines

Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

2. Drag the mouse pointer.
As you drag, the guide appears as a blue line that runs up and down (or
across) the drawing page.
3. When the guide is positioned where you want it, release the mouse
button.
The line turns green because it’s selected.
Want to create a diagonal guide line? Here’s a slick trick. Just create a hori-
zontal or vertical guide and then rotate it. Follow these steps:
1. Select the guide line that you want to rotate.
2. Choose View➪Size & Position Window.
The Size and Position window appears near the bottom of your screen.
3. In the Angle box, type the degree angle of rotation.
For a diagonal guide, type 45. Visio rotates the selected guide to the
angle that you specify.
Creating guide points
When you want to pinpoint a shape in an exact location, create a guide point.
On the screen, a guide point looks like a circle with cross through it. To
create a guide point, use these steps:
1. Move your mouse pointer over the intersection of the vertical and
horizontal rulers.
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
2. Drag the mouse.
Two blue lines — one vertical and one horizontal — follow the move-
ment of the mouse pointer on the drawing page.
3. When the intersection of the guides is positioned where you want it,
release the mouse button.
The blue lines disappear, and the guide point (a circle with a cross
through it) is displayed on the screen.
Guide points work with snap. If snap isn’t activated, guide points won’t do
you any good. When snap is activated, only the activated snap elements will
snap to a guide point. (For more information on snap, refer to “Snapping
Shapes into Place,” earlier in this chapter.) For instance, if you activate snap
for shape handles, you can attach a shape’s handle to a guide point. If you
activate snap for connection points, you can attach a shape’s connection
points to a guide point. Both of these examples are illustrated in Figure 7-10.
170
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

When snap is activated only for shape handles, the square and star on the
left side of the drawing can attach to the guide point only at their shape han-
dles. On the other hand, when snap is activated also for connection points,
you can snap the tip of the star to the guide point, because the star has con-
nection points at each tip (see the square and star on the right side of the
drawing). 
If you want to use multiple guides spaced evenly across your drawing, here is
a great way to create them:
1. Create the first guide.
2. Hold down the Ctrl key as you drag a copy of the guide to the next
increment you want — say, 1 inch.
3. Press the F4 key.
Another guide, 1 inch from the last guide, is created automatically.
4. Press the F4 key as many times as you want to keep creating guides
spaced at the same increment.

Chapter 7: Perfecting Your Drawings

Aligning and Distributing Shapes
Besides using guides, Visio gives you another way to automatically align
shapes. Suppose that you create a diagram like the one on the left in Figure
7-11. The shapes aren’t lined up, the connectors look goofy, and the whole
thing looks like you threw it together in a few seconds. It’s okay to create a
messy drawing like this because Visio can clean it up for you!
The diagram on the right was aligned with Visio’s automatic alignment fea-
ture. With the click of a toolbar button (or through a menu command), you
can horizontally align the top, bottom, or middle of selected shapes, or you
can vertically align the left edge, right edge, or middle of selected shapes.
You first select the shape you want other shapes to align to and then select
all the other shapes. The first shape you select becomes the reference point
for the alignment of other shapes.
To use the alignment tools, display the Action toolbar. The Align Shapes button
has a drop-down box, which displays a miniversion of the alignment options
available. These options are also available in the Align Shapes dialog box when
you choose Tools➪Align Shapes, as shown in Figure 7-12. (To make this menu
command active, you must first select at least two shapes in the drawing.)

172
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

To align several shapes horizontally, vertically, or both, use these steps:
1. Select the shape to which you want the other shapes to align.
2. Hold the Shift key and at the same time select all other shapes that
you want aligned to the first shape.
3. Choose Shape➪Align Shapes or click the drop-down arrow next to the
Align Shapes button on the Shapes toolbar.
The Align Shapes dialog box appears (refer to Figure 7-12).
4. Click the alignment style that you want.
If you think you’ll be adding more shapes that you’ll want aligned with
these, consider clicking the Create Guide and Glue Shapes to It option,
which is at the bottom of the dialog box.
5. Click OK.
Visio aligns all shapes to the first shape that you selected.
Ever try to space several shapes evenly — say, 1⁄2 inch apart — across an
area? Doing it manually can be frustrating. Visio refers to the process of spac-
ing shapes evenly as distributing shapes. You can distribute shapes using the
Distribute Shapes toolbar button (or a menu command, if you prefer). Like
the Align Shapes toolbar button, the Distribute Shapes button also has a
drop-down box, which displays a miniversion of the Distribute Shapes dialog
box shown in Figure 7-13.
Use these steps to distribute shapes across an area:
1. Select all the shapes that you want to distribute.
2. Choose Shape➪Distribute Shapes or click the drop-down arrow on the
Distribute Shapes button on the Action toolbar.
The Distribute Shapes dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-13.
Figure 7-12:

3. Click the distribution style that you want to use.
If you think that you may add more shapes that you’ll want to distribute,
consider clicking the Create Guides and Glue Shapes to Them option at
the bottom of the dialog box.
4. Click OK.
Visio automatically distributes the shapes.
Visio has many time-saving features. Take advantage of the flexibility you
have to focus on the content of a drawing, and then use Visio’s features to

ecause Visio provides so many shapes in its stencils, you can use the
program successfully without ever needing to customize shapes. But if
you’re adventurous, you might want to use Visio to make shapes your way. In
this chapter, you discover how to get creative with Visio by changing existing
shapes and drawing your own shapes.
Creating Unique Shapes the Fun Way
Near the middle of the Visio Shape menu is a command called Operations.
Sounds pretty serious! Well, it’s not serious at all. In fact, this command
should be called Fun Stuff. After you select the Operations command, Visio
gives you a submenu with a list of tools that you can use to create shapes.
The following list explains each tool:
 Union: Creates a shape from overlapping shapes by using the perimeter
of all the shapes as the new outline.
 Combine: Creates a shape from overlapping shapes by cutting out the
areas that overlap.
 Fragment: Breaks shapes into separate shapes along the lines where
they overlap.
 Intersect: Creates a shape from only the area where two or more shapes
overlap (all other areas are deleted).
 Subtract: Cuts away the areas that overlap the first shape you select.

It might take you awhile to remember exactly what each command does.
That’s okay, just experiment with them! If you don’t like the result, choose
Edit➪Undo and try another one. The following sections illustrate how each 
of these commands work — they’re easier to see than read about.
I show you how to use a lot of Visio’s drawing, formatting, and manipulation
tools throughout this chapter, so you might want to open some of the toolbars
listed in Table 8-1 now. Unless stated otherwise, use the Pointer Tool button in
the instructional steps for selecting shapes.

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Uniting shapes
The Union command does as its name suggests — it unites two or more over-
lapping shapes. The Union command combines these shapes by maintaining
the perimeters of all the shapes and erasing their inside boundaries to form
one new shape (see Figure 8-1).
To unite two or more shapes using the Union command, follow these steps:
1. Drag the shapes that you want to unite into the drawing area.
If you want to draw shapes, draw them now.
2. Move the shapes where you want them, making sure each one over-
laps at least one other shape.
3. Using the Pointer Tool button, select all the shapes that you want to
unite.
4. Choose Shape➪Operations➪Union.
Visio unites all the shapes.
Figure 8-1:
Individual
shapes (left)
unite to
become a
single shape
(right).
177
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

If some of the shapes you select don’t overlap, the Union command still
unites them anyway, even though they don’t appear to be any different. Try
selecting one by itself and you’ll see that Visio now treats them as one shape.
If the first shape you select has any special attributes (such as line color, fill
color, or shadow), the second and following shapes take on the same attrib-
utes as the first shape.
Union is different from Group in that the borders where shapes overlap are
eliminated when you unite them. Grouping simply treats selected shapes as a
single shape. 
You can click the Undo button on the Standard toolbar to undo a Union
command immediately. If you perform other tasks first, however, you can still
undo the Union command by selecting the combined shape and then choosing
Shape➪Operations➪Fragment. This restores your original shapes individually,
but it won’t return the original formatting to all the shapes.
Combining shapes
The name of the Combine command is a bit misleading. It might be more
accurate to call it the Cutout, or Doughnut, command. Notice that on the left
side of Figure 8-2, two shapes are placed on top of one another. In the shape
on the right, the Combine command uses the outline of the star to cut out the
center of the other shape. (You know this is a cutout because you can see the
grid through the star.)
Follow these steps to combine shapes:
1. Draw all the shapes that you want to combine.
2. Arrange the shapes so that they overlap.
3. Using the Pointer Tool button, to select all the shapes that you want to
combine.
4. Choose Shape➪Operations➪Combine.
Visio creates cutouts where the smaller, fully-enclosed shapes overlap
the larger ones.
When you combine shapes that don’t overlap, there isn’t anything for Visio to
cut out, but Visio still combines the shapes by treating them as a single shape,
just like the Union command does. Also as with the Union command, the
second and following shapes take on all attributes of the first shape you select.
178
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

You can click the Undo button on the Standard toolbar to undo a Combine
command immediately. If you perform other tasks first, however, you can 
still undo the Combine command by selecting the combined shape and then
choosing Shape➪Operations➪Fragment. This restores your original shapes
individually, but it won’t return the original formatting to all the shapes.
In Figure 8-3, you see a more complex array of combined shapes. On the left,
each shape is a different shade of gray. After you combine them into a single
shape, all the hues convert to that of the triangle — the shape that was created
first.
Fragmenting shapes
Fragmenting is fun and a great way to create new shapes from overlapped
shapes. The left side of Figure 8-4 shows several overlapped shapes that take
on new dimensions when you separate them at their overlap points (right).
It’s sort of like cutting apart all the pieces where they overlap and making
jigsaw puzzle pieces out of them.

2. Arrange the shapes so that they overlap.
3. Using the Pointer Tool button, select all the overlapping shapes.
4. Choose Shape➪Operations➪Fragment.
Visio breaks all the shapes into separate shapes along their overlapping
lines. You can’t control the distance Visio uses to separate the shapes,
but you can move the shapes individually after they’re fragmented.
Intersecting shapes
The Intersecting shapes command makes a radical change in your shapes! 
Visio keeps only the parts where all the shapes overlap and cuts away the 
rest. Figure 8-5 shows three overlapping circles on the left. (I drew a dotted line 
to show the outline of where the shapes overlap.) After you intersect these
shapes, the only thing that’s left is the triangular portion from the center where
all the circles overlap. As with other Operations commands, the resulting shape
takes on the attributes (color, line style, and so on) of the first shape you select.
Figure 8-5:
Intersecting
keeps only
the area
where all
shapes

181
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

To intersect shapes, follow these steps:
1. Drag all the shapes that you want into the drawing area or draw them.
2. Arrange the shapes so that they all overlap every other shape at some
point.
3. Using the Pointer Tool button, select all the shapes that you want to
intersect.
4. Choose Shape➪Operations➪Intersect.
Visio leaves only the portion where all shapes overlap, removing the
extraneous parts. The resulting shape takes on the attributes of the first
shape you select.
Subtracting shapes
Subtract is a feature that works just like it sounds: When two shapes overlap,
the overlapping part is subtracted, or removed, from the first shape that you
select. This command subtracts the second shape you select from the first
shape you select. So the first shape you select is the shape that remains — 
in part — after using the Subtract command.
Figure 8-6 shows the original shapes — the circle and star — on the left. The
partial star in the center is what’s left if you select the star first. The partial
circle on the right is what’s left if you select the circle first.
Follow these steps to use the subtract command:
1. Drag the shapes that you want to work with into the drawing area or
draw new shapes.
2. Position the shapes so that they overlap.
3. Using the Pointer tool, select the shape that you want to keep.
4. Select the shape that you want to subtract.
5. Choose Shape➪Operations➪Subtract.
Visio removes the shape that you selected in Step 4 and leaves what
remains of the shape that you selected in Step 3.
Restacking shapes
Each time you draw or drag a new shape into the drawing area, Visio places it
on top of other, existing shapes. (If you don’t overlap the shapes, you never
notice this.) To understand how Visio keeps track of the order of shapes, pre-
tend that you are drawing each shape on a separate piece of paper. Each time
182
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

you draw a shape, you drop the paper on your desk. The first one to fall is at
the bottom of the stack. Those that fall on top of others clearly overlap one
another. Those that don’t overlap still fall in a stacking order, whether you
pay attention to it or not. The last one you drop is at the top of the stack.
Visio has two commands — Bring to Front and Send to Back — to help you
rearrange the stacking order of shapes. You can find both buttons on the
Action toolbar. You also can go to the Shape menu and find two other com-
mands for restacking: Bring Forward and Send Backward. (You can display
the Action toolbar by right-clicking the toolbar area and choosing Action.)
What’s the difference between all these?
 Bring to Front: Brings a shape to the top of the stack.
 Bring Forward: Brings a shape up one level in the stack.
 Send to Back: Sends a shape to the bottom of the stack.
 Send Backward: Sends a shape down one level in the stack.
Bring Forward and Send Backward are found only on the Shape menu, but
you can add buttons for these commands to the Action toolbar by customiz-
ing your toolbar. To find out more about customizing toolbars, refer to
Chapter 1.
Figure 8-6:
The result of
the Subtract
command
depends on
which
shape you
select first.
183
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

In Figure 8-7, the triangle was drawn first, so it’s at the bottom of the stack.
Suppose that you want to move the triangle above the rectangle but below the
ellipse. If you try to move the triangle without changing its order in the stack,
it’s almost completely hidden by the rectangle. You need to use the Bring
Forward command several times to raise the triangle’s position in the stack.
To rearrange the stacking order of shapes, follow these steps:
1. Select the shape that you want to move.
2. Determine which command or button you need to use: Bring Forward,
Bring to Front, Send Backward, or Send to Back.
3. Click the Bring to Front button or the Send to Back button on the
Shape toolbar, or choose Shape➪Order➪Bring Forward or
Shape➪Send Backward.
4. Repeat Step 3 if necessary.
If you prefer using shortcut keys, press Ctrl+Shift+F for Bring to Front or
Ctrl+Shift+B for Send to Back.

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Drawing Your Own Shapes
As if there weren’t enough shapes for you to choose from in Visio, you can
make your own, too. You might find that you often make your own shapes,
particularly if you work in a specialized field. Visio gives you many buttons
on the Drawing toolbar for drawing shapes (refer to Table 8-1).
Drawing with the Line Tool button
You can use the Line Tool button on the Standard toolbar to draw lines or
shapes that are made up of straight lines. The points at which you start and
stop drawing a line are called endpoints (see Figure 8-8). Between the two
endpoints is a control point, which you use to control the shape of a shape, as
discussed later in this chapter. (For more information about working with
control points, refer also to Chapter 4.)
Endpoint
Control point
Endpoint
Figure 8-8:
Every line
has a
control point
and two
endpoints.
185
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

It’s a bit of a misnomer to call both ends of a line endpoints when one of them
is a beginning. The beginning endpoint is marked by a small green square
with an X inside; the ending endpoint is marked by a small green square with
a + symbol.
To draw a simple line, follow these steps:
1. Click the Line Tool button (refer to Table 8-1) on the Drawing toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to a line and a plus symbol.
2. Place the mouse pointer where you want to begin the line; then drag
the mouse to the point where you want the line to end.
As you drag the mouse, you see a guide line that extends from the start-
ing point to the location of your pointer. The guide line shows you where
the line will be drawn if you release the mouse button. Move the mouse
around in a circle and you see that the guide line follows your move-
ment. At every 45-degree interval, the guide line shoots out into a ray.
This is to help you draw lines at perfect 45-, 90-, 135-, and 180-degree
angles from your starting point.
3. Release the mouse button.
The line is selected, and the endpoints appear. (Switch to the Pencil Tool
button on the Drawing toolbar if you want to display the control point.)
4. Click any blank area of the drawing to deselect the line.
It’s not often that you draw a single line by itself. More than likely, you’ll want
to draw a shape by connecting a series of line segments. The trick here is
that you must draw all segments consecutively if you want to create a closed
shape. If you don’t draw them consecutively, the shape won’t be closed, even
if the segments appear to be connected.
To connect segments as you draw, follow these steps:
1. Click the Line Tool button on the Drawing toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to a line and a plus symbol.
2. Draw your first segment by dragging the mouse and releasing.
3. Point to the endpoint of the first segment; then drag the mouse to
draw the second segment of your shape.
(If you just release the mouse button in Step 2 and don’t move the
pointer, you’ll already be pointing at the endpoint when you’re ready to
draw the next segment.)
186
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

4. Repeat Step 3 as many times as you want.
5. To close the shape, draw another segment from the endpoint of the
last segment to the beginning point of the first segment that you drew,
and then release the mouse button.
The shape becomes a closed shape. You see the shape fill with white (or
another color, depending on the template you choose). See Figure 8-9.
If your background color is white and your grid is turned off, you can’t see
the white fill.
Whenever you draw shapes by connecting segments, turn on Snap (Tools➪
Snap & Glue), the feature that pulls shapes into place. Snap helps you con-
nect segments automatically. To find out more about how snap works, see
Chapter 7.

Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Drawing with the Pencil Tool button
The Pencil Tool button works almost exactly like the Line Tool button. If you
select the Pencil Tool button and move the mouse in a straight line, you draw
a straight line. If you move the mouse in a curved direction, you draw a por-
tion of a circle. The size and circumference of the circle depend on how far
you move the mouse. Use the Pencil Tool button when you want to draw a
shape that includes both curves and lines (see Figure 8-10).
Again, if you want to create a closed shape, you must draw all segments
(lines and arcs) consecutively. To draw a shape using the Pencil Tool button,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Pencil Tool button (refer to Table 8-1) on the Standard toolbar.
2. Draw the first segment by dragging the mouse and then releasing the
mouse button.
Drag in a straight line to create a line; drag in a circular direction to
create a curve.
3. Draw the second segment by pointing to the endpoint of the previous
segment, dragging the mouse and then releasing the mouse button.
Figure 8-10:
With the
Pencil Tool
button, you
can draw
shapes that
contain both
straight and
curved
lines.
188
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

4. Repeat the motion in Step 3 as many times as you like.
5. Finish the shape by connecting the endpoint of the last segment to the
beginning point of the first segment.
Drawing with the Arc Tool button
It might seem obvious that you draw an arc by using the Arc Tool button, but
you might be wondering how the Arc Tool button differs from the Pencil Tool
button, which also lets you draw arcs. The Arc Tool button lets you draw one
quarter of an ellipse, whereas the Pencil Tool button enables you to draw a
portion of a circle (not an ellipse and not limited to one quarter). Use the Arc
Tool button when you want a less-than-circular curve (such as an oval). Use
the Pencil Tool button when you want to draw true circular curves. (See the
“Creating shapes with the Ellipse and Rectangle Tool buttons” section later in
this chapter to find out how to use the Ellipse Tool button to draw complete
circles and ellipses.)
To draw an arc by using the Arc Tool button, follow these steps:
1. Click the Arc Tool button (refer to Table 8-1) on the Standard toolbar.
2. Place the mouse where you want the arc to begin.
3. Drag the mouse in the direction that you want the arc to go.
4. Release the mouse button where you want the arc to end.
Creating irregular shapes with 
the Freeform Tool button
I call the Freeform Tool button the doodling tool. You use it the same way 
you use a pencil when you’re doodling. The Freeform Tool button (it looks
like a squiggly line) obediently displays every curve and scribble you make.
Just draw with the Freeform Tool button to create, well, freeform shapes. To
create a closed shape like the one shown in Figure 8-11, end your doodling at
the point where you began. (The shape in Figure 8-11 is actually a lake drawn
for a map!)
If you have a tablet PC or a tablet attached to your computer, the Freeform
Tool button is great because it’s easier to draw with a pen than with a mouse.
189
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Creating shapes with the Ellipse 
and Rectangle Tool buttons
You can use the Arc and Pencil Tool buttons to draw curves (elliptical or circu-
lar), and you can use either of these buttons to draw four connected segments
that form a complete circle or ellipse. But why would you want to do that when
Visio gives you a simpler way? Just use the Ellipse Tool button to draw perfect
circles or ellipses.
The following steps tell you how to use the Ellipse Tool button:
1. Click the Ellipse Tool button (refer to Table 8-1) on the Standard toolbar.
2. Put the mouse pointer where you want to place the ellipse.
3. Drag the mouse in any direction.
To draw a perfect circle, hold down the Shift key as you drag the mouse.
4. Release the mouse button when the ellipse is the size and shape that
you want.
Figure 8-11:
Use the
Freeform
Tool button
to create

shapes.
190
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

If you want the ellipse to be a particular size, watch the status bar as you drag
the mouse. The status bar tells you the exact width and height of your ellipse
as you draw. You can also choose Shape➪Size and Position after you draw the
shape and then enter exact dimensions in the Height and Width boxes.
The Rectangle Tool button works in the same way as the Ellipse Tool button.
You could use the Line Tool button to create a rectangle by drawing and con-
necting four segments, but it’s easier to draw a rectangle by using the
Rectangle Tool button. Follow these four steps to draw a rectangle:
1. Click the Rectangle Tool button (refer to Table 8-1) on the Standard
toolbar.
2. Put the mouse pointer where you want to place the rectangle.
3. Drag the mouse in any direction.
To draw a perfect square, hold down the Shift key as you drag the
mouse. To create a rectangle of a specific size, watch the status bar for
height and width measurements as you draw.
4. Release the mouse button when the rectangle is the size and shape
that you want.
Manipulating Shapes
Suppose, for example, that you find a shape in Visio that’s almost, but not
quite, what you want. You can modify a shape in many ways by tweaking it
until it’s just what you want.
Moving and adding vertices
With Visio, it’s easy to change the form of a shape by dragging part of the
shape to a new position. In Figure 8-12, I changed an isosceles triangle by
dragging the upper-right vertex to a new place. Remember that a vertex
appears at the end of every line and at points where lines intersect, which
means that you see a vertex at each point of the triangle. Green diamond
shapes mark the vertices, but you can see them only when you select the
shape by using one of the following buttons on the Standard toolbar (just
click the button and then select the shape):
 Arc Tool
 Freeform Tool
 Line Tool
 Pencil Tool
191
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

To move a vertex, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pencil, Freeform, Line, or Arc Tool button (refer to Table 8-1).
2. Point to the vertex that you want to move.
When you’re within selection range of the vertex, the mouse pointer
changes to a four-headed arrow.
3. Click the vertex.
The color changes from green to magenta.
4. Drag the vertex where you want it, and then release the mouse button.
You also can add a vertex to any shape by following these steps:
1. Select the Pencil Tool button.
2. Select the shape.
You see the vertices and control points of the shape.

192
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

3. Hold down the Ctrl key, and click a point where you want to add a
vertex.
Visio adds the vertex (diamond shape) and a control point (round
shape) between the new vertex and the previous one.
4. Repeat Step 3 for as many vertices as you want to add.
When you add a vertex to a shape, you’re actually adding a segment. That’s
because Visio automatically adds a control point between the new vertex and
the previous one. You can use the control point to change the shape of the
segment, as I show you in the “Moving control points” section, later in this
chapter.
Why would you want to add a vertex to a shape? Check out the five-pointed
star in Figure 8-13. It’s not bad, but perhaps you want it to look a little snazz-
ier — maybe with five smaller points between the five existing points. To
accomplish this task, you need to add some vertices and move others.
Currently, vertices appear at the tip of each point on the star and at each
inverted angle of the star. (I know they’re small and difficult to see in the
figure, but you’ll see them clearly on your screen!)
Control point
Vertices
Figure 8-13:
The five-

stencil.
193
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

To create the ten-pointed star (partially shown in Figure 8-14), you pull the
inverted angle vertex — let’s call it A — out to a point. Before you can do
that, though, you need to add new vertices on both sides of A — let’s call
them B and C. If you pull A without adding B and C, you just make a fatter
star with shallower inverted angles. Adding the vertices B and C gives the
new tip two new points from which to begin.
Moving control points
Suppose that instead of adding five new points to the star in Figure 8-14, you
just want to round out the lines of the star and make it look like one of the
stars in Figure 8-15. To do that, you use the control points, the round shapes
that appear between two vertices.

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

To move a control point, use these steps:
1. Select the shape by using the Pointer Tool button on the Standard
toolbar.
You see the selection handles of the shape.
2. Switch to the Pencil Tool button.
You see the shape’s vertices and control points.
3. Point to the control point that you want to move.
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
4. Click the control point.
The selected control point switches from green to magenta.
5. Drag the control point, and then release the mouse button.
You can make your changes more precise by zooming in on your shape and
using the rulers to track the movement of a control point.

Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Rotating shapes
Rotating shapes is something you might need to do frequently. A shape might
not be facing the correct angle when you drag it into the drawing. Or it might
be easier to draw a shape at one angle and rotate it later.
You can rotate nearly all Visio shapes. If the shape has large, round handles
that appear at the corners of its frame, you can rotate the shape. You also see a
rotation pin (a round handle with a plus (+) symbol) at the center of the shape.
This is the point around which the shape rotates. (If a Visio shape can’t rotate,
it’s for good reason — probably because it doesn’t make sense to rotate it.)
Visio provides three ways to rotate a shape:
 Rotation handles on a shape let you drag the shape to rotate it. Use this
method when you want to change a shape’s angle quickly but not neces-
sarily precisely.
 Rotate Right and Rotate Left buttons on the Action toolbar let you
rotate a shape 90 degrees at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise). Use
this method when you know you want to rotate a shape in 90-degree
increments.
 The menu command (View➪Windows➪Size & Position) opens the Size
and Position window, which enables you to specify a rotation angle. This
is the best method to use when the precise angle of rotation is a priority.
Rotation handles
To rotate a shape by using the rotation handles, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Click the shape that you want to rotate.
The rotation handle, a large green circle, is visible usually somewhere
near the top of the shape.
3. Move the mouse pointer over the rotation handle.
The pointer changes to the rotation pointer, which looks like a circular,
single-point arrow.
4. Drag the mouse pointer clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on
the direction that you want to rotate the shape.
As you drag the mouse, the mouse pointer changes to four arrows in a
circular shape. Watch the status bar to see how far (in degrees) the
shape is rotating.
5. Release the mouse button when the shape is in the position that you
want it.
196
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

The closer you place the mouse to the rotation pin as you’re rotating a shape,
the more the rotation angle jumps, sometimes skipping degrees. The farther
away you place the mouse pointer from the rotation pin, the more precise the
angle of rotation.
Rotation buttons
Figure 8-16 shows how you rotate shapes using the Rotation buttons. You can
see the rotation symbol in the figure.
Follow these two steps when you want to rotate a shape 90 degrees at a time:
1. Click the shape that you want to rotate.
2. Click the Rotate Right or Rotate Left button on the Action toolbar.
You can click the Rotate Right or Rotate Left button repeatedly to continue
rotating the same shape in 90-degree increments. This method saves you the
trouble of rotating a shape manually or using a menu command.

197
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Size and Position window
When precision is important to you, use the menu command to rotate
shapes. You can rotate a shape at a precise angle, as little as .01 degree. Use
these steps to rotate a shape at a precise angle:
1. Select the shape that you want to rotate.
2. Choose View➪Size & Position.
The Size and Position window appears, as shown in Figure 8-17.
3. In the Angle box, type a number for the angle of rotation.
Type a positive number for a counterclockwise angle of rotation or a
negative number for a clockwise angle of rotation.
4. Click OK.
Visio rotates the shape to the angle you specify. Notice that the angle
you entered is now reflected on the status bar.
Rotation pin
On most Visio shapes, the rotation pin is right in the center of the shape. If
you want a shape to rotate around a different point, you can move the rota-
tion pin. You might need to do this if you want to keep a particular point on 
Figure 8-17:
Type a
positive
number for
clockwise
rotation;
negative for

clockwise.
198
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

the shape anchored. For example, in Figure 8-18, I moved the center of rota-
tion for the triangle from its original position in the center to the upper-right
of the triangle. Now the shape will rotate around this point.
You can use also use the Size and Position window to change the location of
the rotation pin. After Step 4, choose Top-Left, Top-Center, Top-Right, Center-
Left, Center-Center, Center-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Center, or Bottom-
Right in the Pin Position box. Or, you can move the pin position manually
using these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button (on the Standard toolbar).
2. Select the shape.
3. If you don’t see the rotation pin, move the mouse pointer over the
shape’s rotation handle.
The shape’s rotation pin is displayed in a direct line from the rotation
handle.
3. Point to the rotation pin and drag it to a new position.
4. Release the mouse button.

199
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

When you move the rotation pin, it helps to zoom in on the shape. Zooming
in enables you to place the pin more precisely, and it also displays a finer
grid. If you don’t want the rotation pin to snap to the grid, turn snap off by
choosing Tools➪Snap & Glue and then clicking the Snap check box to remove
the check mark.
To easily return a rotation pin to the center of a shape, choose View➪
Windows➪Size & Position. In the Size and Position window, click Pin
Pos(ition) and then choose Center-Center.
Flipping shapes
Sometimes you find just the right shape, but it’s facing the wrong direction. In
that case, you can flip the shape so that it faces the opposite direction. Your
choices are Flip Horizontal (which flips a shape right-to-left) or Flip Vertical
(which flips the shape top-to-bottom). In Figure 8-19, the first arrow was
flipped horizontally, then vertically.

Adding Style to Your Shapes
Although many of the Visio shapes are pretty cool, some are basic — just an
outline of something. Not very imaginative. Well, you can jazz up the more
basic shapes by adding things such as line color and weight, fill color and
pattern, and shadowing. These features are typically referred to as formatting.
You usually select a shape first and then apply some special type of format-
ting to it. If you’re formatting one shape, why not format a bunch of them at
the same time? This saves you a lot of time when you decide that all 382
whatchamacallits in your drawing should be blue and green checkerboards
with a purple outline and a magenta shadow. Select all your shapes (no, don’t
click each one individually, use the Pointer Tool button to draw a selection
box around them or use the Lasso button) and then apply the formatting.
Changing line style
Every shape has an outline, usually a thin black line. Not only can you change
the color of the line, you can change the weight (thickness) of it as well as the
pattern and transparency. You can make it fat and green and dash-dot-
dashed, or dainty and pink and dot-dash-dotted. If you decide you don’t like
square corners, you can round them.
When you work with a 1-D shape like a simple line, you can also add line ends
(such as arrows) to the beginning or end of the shape, and determine the size
of the line ends. The Line dialog box (shown in Figure 8-20) has a preview
window so you can see the changes you make.
201
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Follow these steps to make changes to a shape’s line characteristics:
1. Select the shape or shapes that you want to change.
2. Choose Format➪Line, or right-click and choose Format➪Line.
Visio displays the Line dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-20.
3. In the Pattern box, click the down arrow and choose a line pattern.
4. In the Weight box, choose a line thickness.
5. In the Color box, choose a line color.
6. In the Cap box, choose blunt lines (Square) or soft lines (Round).
7. To change the transparency of the line, slide the Transparency bar.
8. To round the corners of your shape, click one of the rounding styles
in the Round Corners area.
If you want the rounding to be a specific size (such as beginning  1⁄8 inch
from the corner), type a decimal number in the Rounding box.
9. If your shape is 1-D, choose line ends and their size in the Begin, End,
Begin Size, and End Size boxes.
10. View your choices in the Preview area.
11. When the shape appears as you want it, click OK.
In the next section you learn that you can also set the transparency of the fill
in a 2-D shape. If you change the shape’s fill transparency, it also affects the
transparency of the shape’s line (whether you change it using the previous
steps or not).
Visio provides five buttons, shown in Table 8-3, to apply line style changes
without opening a menu. These buttons appear on the Formatting and
Figure 8-20:

Adding fill color, pattern, and shadow
White, white, white can become monotonous after awhile. Why not add some
excitement to your shapes by making them patterned and colorful with shad-
ows? Color and shadows aren’t just aesthetic qualities; they also attract
attention, hold interest, and help the reader interpret data more easily.
Filling a shape with a solid color is straightforward. Just choose the color and
that’s that. If you fill a shape with a pattern, however, you have to choose two
colors — one for the foreground and one for the background. The foreground
color comprises the pattern, such as dots, hash marks, stripes, or crisscrosses.
The background color is the one that shows through the pattern. Often, pat-
terns show up in black and white, so you don’t even think about the possibility
of choosing colors for the foreground and background. You can use black and
white in Visio as well, but it’s good to know what foreground and background
colors are so that you get the results you expect.
A shape’s shadow doesn’t have to be a solid color. You can choose a shadow
style, pattern, foreground color, background color, and transparency for the
shadow as well.
203
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Follow these steps to add any of these colorful features to a shape:
1. Select the shape or shapes that you want to change.
2. Choose Format➪Fill, or right-click and choose Format➪Fill.
The Fill dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-21.
3. In the Fill area, choose the color, pattern, pattern color, and 
transparency.
4. In the Shadow area, choose style, color, pattern, pattern color, and
transparency. 
The Preview area shows a sample of the choices that you selected.
5. Click OK.
Visio returns to your drawing and reformats the selected shape.
To make further refinements to the shadow (beyond what’s available in the
Fill dialog box), choose Format➪Shadow, which displays the Shadow dialog
box. Here you can also change the size, position, offset, direction, and magni-
fication of a shadow. To change these settings, select the shape you want to
change, and then choose Format➪Shadow.
Visio also provides timesaving toolbar buttons for fill color, transparency, fill
pattern, and shadow color, as shown in Table 8-4. Select a shape or shapes
you want to change, and then click the down arrow next to the button to dis-
play a list of choices.

Copying formats
Suppose that you painstakingly format a shape with a purple and red patterned
fill, a burgundy and chartreuse shadow, and a 4-point, canary, dotted outline.
(No one ever accused you of having an eye for color!) Now you want to apply
those lovely colors and styles to another shape. Do you have to set all these
features by hand again? Nope. Visio makes it easy for you. Ever notice that
paint brush button on your Standard toolbar? It’s called the Format Painter
button, and it lets you paint a format from one shape to another. This truly is a
timesaving feature. Use it often!
Follow these steps to copy a format from one shape to another:
1. Click the shape that has the format you want to copy.
2. Click the Format Painter button (refer to Table 8-1) on the Standard
toolbar.
Your mouse pointer changes to a paint brush.
3. Click the shape that you want to apply the format to.
Presto! All that beautiful color and style is instantly copied to your shape.
Reformatting a shape
So, you decide that you don’t like violet polka dots on an orange background
with a green frame and a green and purple crisscross shadow pattern. How
do you get rid of it? Unfortunately, you can’t click a button that magically
removes all the formatting that you add to a shape. 
205
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

You have to reset line, fill, pattern, and shadow features the same way that
you added them: using Format➪Line, Format➪Fill, and Format➪Shadow com-
mands, or using the toolbar buttons. But you can reformat one shape and
then use the Format Painter button again to paint a plain style onto other
shapes. That’s the quickest way to undo what you did.
Managing Shapes by Grouping
Nothing is more frustrating than spending a good deal of time creating a
shape out of many shapes, getting everything perfectly aligned, and then
messing it all up when you try to move it or resize it. One way to avoid this is
to group shapes so that they behave as a unit.
In Figure 8-22, the computer on the left is a grouped shape (it’s selected as a
unit). The computer in the center is not grouped because you can select all
the parts individually. On the right side of the figure, the computer’s individ-
ual parts are spread out so that you can see how complex the shape is.

206
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

This figure shows the importance of grouping. Ungrouped, it’s easy to acci-
dentally drag the screen off without the monitor. Grouped, there’s no chance
of that happening. Grouping also enables you to size, rotate, flip, and other-
wise treat the whole shape as a unit.
Creating groups
You can group any set of shapes that you select; their proximity to one
another makes no difference! (The group you create has to make sense only
to you!) The steps that follow specify menu commands as well as toolbar but-
tons, which are shown in Table 8-5.

To create a group, use these steps:
1. Select all the shapes that you want to group.
2. Choose Shape➪Grouping➪Group or click the Group button on the
Action toolbar.
Visio reframes the shapes with a single frame and handles.
To ungroup a shape, follow these steps:
1. Select the grouped shape.
2. Choose Shape➪Grouping➪Ungroup or click the Ungroup button on
the Shape toolbar.
Visio separates the grouped shape into its original shapes and selects
each one individually.
If you prefer to use shortcut keys, you can press Ctrl+Shift+G for Group and
Ctrl+Shift+U for Ungroup.
207
Chapter 8: Creating and Customizing Shapes

Editing a group
When you click a group, Visio selects the entire group. Clicking a component
shape in that group lets you subselect just that component. When you click a
group once, you see green selection handles around the entire group. Click
again on a member of the group to subselect it. You see green selection han-
dles for only that shape, and the handles that defined the boundaries of the
entire group change to a faint line of gray dashes. 
This feature of subselecting allows you to easily edit a shape in a group (You
don’t have to ungroup shapes to edit an individual shape.) After you subse-
lect a shape, you can move it, resize it, reshape it, change its line color, fill 
it, or make any other changes without affecting other shapes in the group.
When you finish making changes, click anywhere outside the group or press
Esc to deselect the shape.
If you prefer to have Visio select members of a group with the first mouse
click and then select the entire group with a second mouse click, you can set
Visio to behave this way. Or maybe you prefer to have Visio select only the
group and never subselect shapes. This is another option you can set.
To change the way Visio selects groups, use these steps:
1. Click a grouped shape.
2. Choose Format➪Behavior.
The Behavior tab in the Behavior dialog box appears. Look in the Group
Behavior area of the dialog box.
3. Indicate your preference in the Selection drop-down list:
• To disable subselecting, choose Group Only.
• To change back to Visio’s default setting, in which you select a
group with a single click and individual shapes with a second
mouse click, choose Group First.
• To select members of a group with a single click and the entire
group with a second mouse click, choose Members First.
4. Click OK.
Adding a shape to a group
Sometimes when you create a group, you’ll want to add another shape to the
group. Visio has a special command for adding shapes to an existing group.
Use these steps:
208
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

1. Select the shape to which you want to add a shape.
Visio displays the shape’s selection frame and handles.
2. Select the shape you want to add.
Visio adds the shape to the selection frame.
3. Choose Shape➪Grouping➪Add to Group.
Visio adds the shape to the group selection frame.
Never create a group, add shapes to it, and then group it again. Adding
shapes to an already-grouped group creates what Visio calls a nested group.
Each time you group a group, the file size increases unnecessarily and perfor-
mance (load time and save time) declines.
Removing a shape from a group
You can remove a shape from an existing group just as easily as you can add
one. Just click the group to select it, and then click the component of the
group that you want to remove. Visio displays the selection frame and han-
dles for just that component shape. Choose Shape➪Grouping➪Remove from
Group. Visio removes the component from the group. The shape remains in
the drawing but is now ungrouped from the original group.
Adding text to grouped shapes
Normally if you double-click a shape, Visio displays the shape’s text block so
you can add or edit text. But you can’t double-click a shape in a group to dis-
play its text box. To add text to a shape that’s part of a group, you need to
use a separate window.
Follow these steps:
1. Select the group.
2. Choose Edit➪Open Group.
Visio opens a separate window and zooms in on the group.
3. In this window, double-click the shape that you want to add text to.
Visio zooms in on the shape’s text block.
4. Type the text you want to add to the shape, and then press Esc or click
somewhere outside the text block.
5. Click the window’s Close button.
Visio returns to your drawing window, and the text you added appears
in the shape.

 Getting around, viewing, and reordering pages
 Renaming your pages
 Viewing your pages
 Using background pages
 Rotating pages
Just about now you may be thinking, “A page is a page; what’s to know?
Pretty boring stuff.” There’s a lot to know about pages in Visio! Visio files
aren’t like documents, where text flows smoothly from one page to the next
with a few interesting figures thrown in here and there. Some drawings have
only one page; others may have multiple pages. And in Visio, pages are inde-
pendent animals. You can set a different page size, orientation, drawing scale,
background, shadow, and even header and footer for each page in a single
Visio file. You can also rotate a page to make drawing angled lines and shapes
easier — and then rotate it back again when you’ve finished drawing. This
makes Visio flexible, but it also makes it more complex than your average
text editor.
The Role of the Template
A template is designed to make creating a drawing easier because it sets up a
drawing scale (such as a typical architectural scale of 1⁄4 inch:1 foot), and it
automatically opens the stencils that you need to create a particular type of
drawing (such as the Office Layout stencil for creating a space plan). See
Chapter 2 if you need a refresher on using templates to create a Visio file.

A template also sets up the size of the drawing page and the printer paper
(both usually 81⁄2 by 11 inches) and the orientation of the page (portrait or
landscape). You need to be aware of these settings when you work with
pages in a drawing. Using a template is a definite advantage because it auto-
matically matches the size and orientation of the drawing page to the size
and orientation of the printed page, which ensures that your drawing prints
correctly.
Drawing page size refers to the drawing area that you see on the screen,
printer paper refers to the paper you print on, and printed drawing refers to
the drawing as printed on paper. (See Chapter 3 for more details on these
printing terms.)
Reorienting a Page
Suppose that you’re creating a network diagram in portrait orientation, and
you realize that the drawing is too wide to fit on 81⁄2-inch-wide paper. You can
change the paper orientation to landscape rather than adjust the layout of
your drawing. Switching to landscape orientation turns your drawing page 90
degrees so that its width is greater than its length.
When you change the orientation of your drawing page, however, you need to
make sure that the printer settings match. Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box appears.
2. If the Print Setup tab isn’t selected, select it now (see Figure 9-1).
3. In the Printer Paper area, click either Portrait or Landscape.
4. Click the Page Size tab (shown in Figure 9-2).
Note that Visio changes the Page Size to the orientation you chose in
Step 2. The preview looks identical to the one shown on the Print Setup
tab. The printer paper and drawing page orientations match because the
Same as Printer Paper Size option is selected by default.
5. Click OK.
When you switch page orientation, the shapes in your drawing don’t mysteri-
ously disappear or get erased, but it’s possible that some of them are either
straddling the page borders or are completely off the page (see Figure 9-3).
212
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

You just moved the boundaries of the page, but the shapes are placed where
they always were (within the old page boundaries — sort of like the
Incredible Hulk bursting out of his shirt). Now that you have new boundaries,
you need to move your shapes to get them back onto the drawing page.
Choosing Tools➪Center Drawing helps you begin rearranging shapes by plac-
ing the drawing in the center of the new page boundaries. You may still need
to move some shapes around to fit them on the page, but the Center Drawing
option gives you a head start.

Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Setting a Page Size
Page size refers to the size of your drawing; it has nothing to do with the
paper size in your printer. For most documents, we match our page size
(drawing size) to our paper size, whether the paper is standard size (81⁄2 x 11
inches) or legal size (81⁄2 x 14 inches). Drawings, however, are often a different
animal from standard text documents. Drawings can come in all shapes and
sizes, especially in engineering and architectural fields. Some drawings won’t
fit on standard-size paper and must be printed across several sheets (unless
you’re fortunate enough to have a plotter).
Visio lets you determine your drawing page size in the following ways:
 Using predefined sizes
 Entering custom measurements
 Using the drawing content as size boundaries 
Shapes off the page

214
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Letting Visio determine the size based on the drawing content is a good one
to choose when you want your drawing to fill the entire page.
Some of the predefined sizes you can choose from include Metric (such as
148 x 210 millimeters), ANSI Engineering (such as 22 x 34 inches), and ANSI
Architectural (such as 24 x 36 inches).
Drawing pages are independent, even when they belong to the same Visio file.
This means you can make different pages in a file different sizes.
For all three methods of sizing your drawing, you use the Page Size tab in the
Page Setup dialog box, as follows:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup.
2. Click the Page Size tab (see Figure 9-4).
3. Click one of the following options for the page size:
• Same as Printer Paper Size: Sets your drawing size to the same
size as your printer paper.
• Pre-Defined Size: Uses a predefined size in one of the following
categories: Standard, Metric, ANSI Engineering, or ANSI Architec-
tural. For this option, you select a category in the top box and then
select a size in the category you chose.
• Custom Size: Enables you to set a custom size. Type the width in
the first box, followed by the length in the second box. (Type in for
inches or mm for millimeters following the number.)
• Size to Fit Drawing Contents: Sizes the drawing based on its 
contents.
4. Click OK.

215
Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Setting a custom size can be useful if you’re printing on nonstandard-sized
paper. You can also use this option to position or isolate a drawing on standard-
sized paper. For example, suppose that you want to print a 3-x-5-inch Visio
drawing in the upper-left corner of an 81⁄2-x-11-inch piece of paper and leave the
remaining white space for reviewers to write comments. When you set a
unique page size that’s smaller than your paper, the drawing prints in the
upper-left corner of the page.
Keep in mind that if you reduce the page size of an existing drawing, the
shapes in that drawing don’t move or change size. If some of the shapes are
outside the new page dimensions, you need to move them inside.
You can also change the size of your drawing page dynamically by dragging
the page edges with your mouse. (This method saves you the trouble of
opening the Page Setup dialog box.) Here’s how it works:
1. Display the drawing page that you want to change.
2. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
3. Press and hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse pointer over
the edge of the drawing page that you want to drag.
The mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow (horizontal or
vertical, depending on the page edge you chose). 
4. Drag the mouse in the direction you want to expand (or contract) the
borders. 
A dotted outline shows the location of the new page dimensions, as
shown in Figure 9-5.
To resize the page’s height and width at the same time, move the mouse
pointer near (but not directly on) one of the page’s corners. The double-
headed mouse pointer now points diagonally.
5. Still holding the Ctrl key, drag the mouse until the page is the size that
you want, noting the page dimensions on the status bar.
To see how your drawing page size differs from the current paper size set-
tings, choose File➪Page Setup. To change the paper size, click the Print Setup
tab in the Page Setup dialog box. Refer to Chapter 3 for more information
about printing.
216
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Adding and Deleting Pages in a Drawing
When you create a new Visio drawing, it includes only one page. You can add
pages to a drawing. Following are some good reasons for doing so:
 Keep a set of related drawings, such as a collection of maps with driving
directions for your city, on separate pages in one Visio file.
 Use pages to create overview drawings and detail drawings of your
corporate, regional, and branch organization charts, for example. You
can even add jumps, similar to links between Web sites, from one page to
another. (See Chapter 14 for more on adding jumps.)

217
Chapter 9: Working with Pages

 Use pages to keep track of the history and revisions of a drawing,
which can work something like this: Page 1 is the original draft, Page 2 is
the second draft, Page 3 is the review drawing, Page 4 is the revised draw-
ing, Page 5 is the second review drawing, and Page 6 is the final drawing.
 Create a mini-slideshow with a series of drawings on separate pages
and present them in full-screen view.
 Include your company name and logo on background pages so that
the logo shows through on every page without being part of your draw-
ing. The icing on the cake is that each page in your drawing can have its
own background page, so you can vary the background content from
page to page. (Background pages are discussed in detail in the “What’s
in a Background?” section, later in this chapter.)
You can add as many pages to a drawing as you like. Pages are always added
at the end of the drawing, so technically speaking, you can’t insert pages
between other pages (even though Visio uses that terminology). You can, how-
ever, reorder pages, as I show you later in the “Reordering pages” section. The
new page that you add takes on all the attributes of the page that’s currently
displayed. If you want to change some of these attributes, you can do so when
you create the page or later, using the File➪Page Setup command.
Use these steps to add a page to a drawing:
1. In your drawing, display the page with the attributes that you want
the new page to have.
(Of course, that would be the only page in your drawing if you haven’t
added a second page yet!)
2. Right-click the page tab at the bottom of the drawing window, or
choose Insert➪New Page.
The Page Properties tab of the Page Setup dialog box appears, as shown
in Figure 9-6. Visio suggests a temporary name in the Name box.
3. For the Type, select Foreground to create a “regular” Visio drawing
page. 
I explain all about background pages later in the “What’s in a
Background?” section.
4. In the Name field, type a new name or use the suggested name.
At this point, you’re free to click the Page Size or Drawing Scale tab to
change settings for the new page. However, this isn’t necessary if you
want the new page to take on the attributes of the page that you dis-
played in Step 1.
218
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

5. Click OK.
The new page appears after all the other pages in the drawing, and a tab
is added at the bottom of the drawing window. 
The precise term for a drawing page is foreground page. The foreground page
gets its name because it appears in front of the background page. See the
“What’s in a Background?” section, later in this chapter, for more information
about creating and using background pages.
Sometimes after you add a page to a drawing you decide later that you want
to delete it. You can delete one page at a time quickly just by right-clicking
the page tab and choosing Delete Page. If you have several pages that you
want to delete and would rather use a dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Delete Pages.
The Delete Pages dialog box appears and lists all the pages in the draw-
ing by name, as shown in Figure 9-7.
2. Click the page or pages that you want to delete. 
To select a contiguous range of pages, click the first page, and then hold
the Shift key and select the last page. To select a noncontiguous range of
pages, hold the Ctrl key as you click each page name. 
3. Click OK.
Visio removes the page or pages from the drawing and closes the dialog
box.

Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Working with Multiple Pages
A drawing with multiple pages is more complex than a single-page drawing.
You need to know how to get from one page to another and how to rearrange
pages, if necessary. You also might find it useful to display more than one
page at a time so you can compare pages. Read on to find out how to work
with multiple pages in a drawing. 
Getting from one page to another
When you add pages to a drawing, Visio creates a tab at the bottom of the
drawing area identifying the page. Clicking a page tab is by far the fastest way
to switch from one page to another. If your file contains just a few pages, all
tabs are usually visible at one time. If your file contains many pages, all the
tabs can’t be displayed at once at the bottom of the window. In that case, use
the scroll buttons to the left of the page tabs to go to the first page, previous
page, next page, or last page.
Displaying multiple pages at once
When your drawing contains multiple pages, viewing more than one page at a
time lets you compare one page to another quickly and easily. It also lets you
edit each page without repeatedly closing one and opening another. Visio
opens another page in a separate window. Use these steps to open additional
page windows:
Figure 9-7:
Select the
page you
want to
delete.
220
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

1. Choose Edit➪Go To➪Page option.
(The Page option is at the bottom of the submenu.) The Page dialog box
appears, and lists all the pages in the drawing.
2. Click the page that you want to view.
3. Click the Open Page in New Window option, as shown in Figure 9-8.
4. Click OK.
Visio opens the page in a new window.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 to open additional pages in a new window.
Each time you open a new page, it becomes the current page on your
screen, so you still aren’t viewing multiple windows yet. You won’t see
them until you change the way they are displayed. 
Choose Window➪Tile or Window➪Cascade to arrange the open windows on
your screen. The Tile option displays all open page windows next to each
other on the screen like tiles on the floor. 
The Cascade option staggers the windows so that the title bar of each
window is visible. The title bar looks similar to this: MeetingRoom:1, where
MeetingRoom is the file name for the drawing and 1 is the number of the page
window you opened. The second page window you opened would be called
MeetingRoom:2. (Note that the number in the title bar does not correspond to
the page number in the drawing; it refers only to the order in which you
opened additional pages.) 
Figure 9-8:

Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Reordering pages
When you add pages to a drawing, Visio automatically adds them to the end 
of the drawing (although the menu name is Insert — go figure). Because Visio
doesn’t let you insert pages in a drawing (such as between Pages 3 and 4), the
only way to put new pages in the order that you want them is to reorder them.
Reordering pages in Visio couldn’t be easier! Just drag the page tab (at the
bottom of the drawing window) and drop it in the spot you want. As you drag
the page tab, the mouse pointer displays a small page and a small arrowhead
appears just above the tabs to indicate where the page will be inserted when
you release the mouse button (see Figure 9-9).

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Renaming Pages
If you named a page with your own title when you created it (or even if you
didn’t), you might decide to change the title later. You can change the title of
a page at any time using one of two methods. 
The first and easiest is to simply right-click the page tab at the bottom of the
drawing window and choose Rename Page. Visio highlights the page name on
the tab. Type the new page name right on the tab and press Enter. This
method works for both foreground and background pages.
If the page has a background assigned to it, the name change doesn’t affect
the association between the background and foreground pages. For more
information about background pages, see the “What’s in a Background?” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
If you prefer to use a dialog box to rename a page, use these steps:
1. Display the page you want to change in the drawing window.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup to display the Page Setup dialog box.
3. Click the Page Properties tab.
4. In the Name box, type the page’s new title.
5. Click OK.
Visio changes the displayed name on the page tab.
Viewing on the Big Screen
If you want to see how your drawing will look on the printed page, you can
always use the Print Preview button on the Standard toolbar (refer to
Chapter 3 for information about using Print Preview). But Print Preview is
more for checking final details before you print. What if you want to view
your drawing pages like a miniature slide show? You can display your draw-
ing using the entire screen, without title bars, menu bars, status bars, scroll
bars, or any other windows. You can even control the drawing like a slide
show, moving forward or backward through the pages. 
223
Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Using the entire screen is a great way to create a mini presentation for a small
group of viewers. Because you don’t need a slide projector, you avoid the
hassle of setting up special equipment.
Use these steps to view pages in full-screen mode:
1. Display the first page of your drawing.
2. Choose View➪Full Screen, or press F5.
Visio switches to full-screen mode and displays the first page of your
drawing.
3. To move to another page:
• To move to the next page, press N, the Page Down key, the right-
arrow key, or the left mouse button
• To move to the previous page, press P, the Page Up key, or the left-
arrow key
4. Press Esc or F5 to return to the Visio screen.
You can navigate pages also using the pop-up menu shown in Figure 9-10. To
display this menu, click the right mouse button. Using the pop-up menu is
important if you’re on Page 3, say, and want to move quickly to Page 42.

Hyperlinks — shapes that you click to go to another page — are a cool feature
of Visio. If your drawing contains hyperlinks, you can click the hyperlink
shape to leap to the link. For details about adding hyperlinks to a drawing,
see Chapter 14.
What’s in a Background?
As if foreground pages weren’t enough, you can also add background pages to
a drawing. Why would you want to do that? The best answer is that they offer
consistency. If you want to show a file name, a date, a company name, a logo, a
page number, or any other information about a drawing — but you don’t want
it on your drawing page — you can put all that information on a background
page. Using a background page is sort of like printing your drawing on a trans-
parency and slipping the background page underneath. The information on the
background page shows through the transparency — visible and printable —
but the drawing itself isn’t mucked up with all sorts of extraneous information.
The technical term for a drawing page is foreground page. The foreground
page gets its name because it appears in the forefront, or in front of a back-
ground page.
You can create as many background pages as you want in a drawing file.
What can you do with a background? You assign it to a foreground page.
Assigning makes the association between the two. You can assign
 A single background page to one or more foreground pages
 A different background page to each foreground page
 A background page to another background page
The most important rule to remember is that you can’t assign more than one
background page to any one foreground page. So what can you do if you want
a foreground page to have more than one background? You can piggyback
background pages on a foreground page by assigning a background to a back-
ground and then assigning that background to a foreground. Clear as mud?
Figure 9-11 illustrates how pages can be assigned to one another.
Creating and assigning a background page
Background pages aren’t useful by themselves. To use a background page,
you must create it and then assign it to another page. Unassigned, you can
still print a background page, but it prints by itself, without any foreground
information.
225
Chapter 9: Working with Pages

To create a background page, follow these steps:
1. Display any page in your drawing.
2. Choose Insert➪New Page.
Visio displays the Page Properties tab in the Page Setup dialog box.
(Refer to Figure 9-6.)
3. For Type, click the Background option.
4. In the Name box, use the default name (Background-1, Background-2,
and so on) or type a new name.
5. In the Background box, choose None.
6. In the Measurement Units box, choose the units you want to use for
the background page.
7. Click OK.
That’s all there is to creating a background page. Next, you add the informa-
tion you want the background page to contain. For details on that, see the
upcoming “Editing a background page” section.
Figure 9-11:
You can

or

226
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

The last step — and it’s an important one — is to assign the background page
to another page (foreground or background) in the drawing. Until you assign
it, it just sits there in the drawing doing nothing.
To assign the background page, follow these steps:
1. Display the page that you want to assign the background page to. 
Think of this as the parent page.
2. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box is displayed.
3. Click the Page Properties tab.
The Name field displays the name of the current page.
4. Click the Background drop-down arrow.
All background pages that you created are listed here. Click the one that
you want to assign to the page you displayed in Step 1.
5. Click OK.
Visio creates the association between the two pages, closes the dialog
box, and returns to your drawing.
Unassigning a background page
At some point you might change your mind about which foreground page a
background page is assigned to. You can always unassign a background page.
Unassigning breaks the association between two pages. Unassigning doesn’t
delete the background page; it just leaves it sitting unassigned until you
choose to assign it again. 
To unassign a background page, display the background page in the drawing
area, and then return to the Page Properties tab in the Page Setup dialog box.
Choose None in the Background box, and then click OK. In the drawing, the
Background page (and page tab) still exist, but unassigned to any other page. 
Displaying a background page
When you assign a background page to another page, the content of the back-
ground page is displayed on the screen whenever you display its foreground
page. This can sometimes be distracting if you’re still working on or creating
your foreground page. If you don’t want the background page content to be
displayed while you’re working on the foreground page, you must unassign
the background from the foreground. See the preceding section to unassign
a background page. 
227
Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Editing a background page
Because a background page is just a drawing page, you edit it just as you do a
foreground page. Display the background page by clicking the page tab at the
bottom of the drawing window. You can add, delete, move, or format shapes
or text on the background page just like on any other page.
Are you driving yourself crazy trying to select a shape that refuses to be
selected? That’s probably because the shape is on the background page
assigned to your foreground page. It just appears to be on the foreground
page. It’s hard to tell which is which because Visio makes no distinction
between foreground and background pages on the screen.
Using a background shape
Visio provides some special shapes designed just for background pages. 
They are provided to add interest and style to your drawings. Most of the
backgrounds are abstract designs, although some represent real-world objects
or scenes such as world maps, city scenes, or mountains. Background shapes
are usually set to high transparency so that the shapes in your drawing show
through easily.
Background shapes reside on their own stencil called Backgrounds. To display
them, choose File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras➪Backgrounds. To use a background
shape, just open the Backgrounds stencil and drag a shape onto your drawing.
An example is shown in Figure 9-12.
Background shapes can’t be placed on foreground pages. If you have a simple
one-page drawing (without a background page) and drag a background shape
into the drawing, Visio automatically creates a background page, places the
shape there, and assigns that background to the foreground page. 
Background shapes fill the entire page, regardless of the size of your drawing
page. So if you start with a page size for your background page of 81⁄2 x 11,
and then change it to 3 x 5, the background shape automatically resizes to fill
the page.
228
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Rotating Pages
The best computer software programs are designed to work the way you
worked before you had the program. Think about the following example. If
you were to use a pencil and paper to draw a map of a city in which streets
fall at odd angles, you would probably draw all the streets that run parallel to
the edges of your paper (or the grid, if you use graph paper) and then turn the
paper at an angle and draw the angular streets, right? You can work exactly
the same way in Visio by rotating a drawing page. The program lets you work
the way you work when you’re drawing on paper. Pretty cool, huh?
When you rotate a page, the shapes stay in position, just like they do when
you rotate a piece of paper. Guides, those vertical and horizontal lines you
drag into your drawing from the rulers to help you place shapes, also stay in
position when you rotate a page. (To review creating and using guides, see
Chapter 7.) When you know that you’re going to rotate a page, you can use
guides as a custom grid.
Figure 9-12:
The
cityscape 
is a
background
shape.
229
Chapter 9: Working with Pages

Unlike on your drawing paper, rulers and the drawing page grid do not rotate
when you turn a page. This is a good thing — you can always maintain a hori-
zontal and vertical baseline from which to work, regardless of the angle of the
paper.
Figure 9-13 shows a city map. I drew the angled streets after rotating the page
60 degrees, then rotated the page back again.
Figure 9-14 shows the same city map rotated 60 degrees. (The angle is noted
in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.) Notice that the grid remains
parallel to the rulers bordering the drawing area. I didn’t need guides to draw
the streets because I was able to use the grid as my guide.
Rotating a page doesn’t affect the page orientation settings (that is, portrait
or landscape) or the way the page prints. Page rotation is simply an on-
screen tool to aid you in drawing.
Use these steps to rotate a page:
1. Click the Pointer Tool button on the Standard toolbar.
2. Display the drawing page you want to rotate by clicking its page tab.

to draw

of page

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

3. Press and hold down the Ctrl key and then move the mouse pointer
over any corner of the page.
The pointer changes to a circular rotation pointer.
4. Drag the mouse either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on
the direction that you want to rotate the page.
To rotate to a specific angle, watch the status bar as you drag the page;
it tells you the exact angle (in degrees) of the page as you rotate it.
The farther you move the mouse pointer away from the page corner, the
more precise the angle you can choose.
5. Release the mouse button and the Ctrl key when the page is rotated to
the angle that you want.
After you try rotating a drawing page, you’ll realize how useful this feature is,
whether you’re drawing street maps or any other type of drawing requiring
angled lines.

V
isio defines a layer as a named category of shapes. Huh? How about a
more vivid description? When you were a kid, did you ever have one of
those cool anatomy books with the transparent sheets? The bottom sheet had
the skeletal structure, the next sheet had internal organs, and then you added
the nervous system, the muscular structure, and finally the skin? Well, the
layer system in Visio works in much the same way. You can create layers in a
Visio drawing for the same purpose as your old anatomy book: to show groups
or categories of shapes independently of others or as part of the whole.
How can you use layers? In a landscape drawing, you may want to include
structural walls and pathways on one layer; grass, ground cover, and small
shrubs on another; trees on a separate layer; and ornamental flowers on
another layer. Another example is a layout for a building or home in which
the walls, doors, and windows appear on one layer, and the wiring, electrical
system, plumbing, and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)
system appear on individual layers. You can display just one layer to view the
shapes in a particular group or display all layers to view the complete plan.

Getting the Essential Facts on 
Layers and Layering
You need to know the essential facts about layers so that you can make deci-
sions about how and when to use them. Don’t let all of these facts scare you off!
As you read the following list, try to form a mental picture of what’s going on:
 A Visio drawing can have more than one page.
 Each page can have its own set of layers.
 Visio automatically assigns some shapes to predefined layers (based on
the template that you choose).
 A shape can be assigned to (and therefore, appear on) one or more
layers. (This is the only point for which our anatomy book example
doesn’t hold true: A liver or spleen, for example, appears only on the
internal organs sheet; you don’t find it duplicated on the skeletal struc-
ture sheet or the nervous system sheet.)
 A Visio page (with or without layers) can have one or more background
pages.
 Although similar in behavior, a background page is not the same as a
layer! A background page can have its own layers.
Confused yet? It becomes clearer if you keep in mind an image of one transpar-
ent sheet as a layer, a stack of transparent sheets as a page, and multiple stacks
as separate pages in a drawing. (See Figure 10-1.) Although a Visio background
page is also transparent, its purpose is to display repetitive information (such
as a company logo or the document’s title and date) rather than a category of
shapes, as a layer does. If the bottom transparent sheet of the anatomy book
had only a title, such as “The Human Body,” it would be analogous to a Visio
background page. (For information on creating multiple pages and background
pages in a Visio drawing, check out Chapter 9.)
When you want to group and display categories of shapes in a drawing, use
layers. When you want repetitive information to appear on each page of a
drawing, use a background page.
In general, you assign shapes to a specific layer or to more than one layer.
However, some Visio templates include predefined layers. In these cases, the
shapes in the template’s stencils are preassigned to a particular layer. (The
layers aren’t added to your drawing until you use the shapes in your draw-
ing.) When you drag a shape onto the drawing page, Visio automatically cre-
ates the layer or layers to which that shape is preassigned. When you drag
another shape that’s preassigned to a different layer or layers, Visio adds
those layers to the drawing.
234
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

The Building Plan/Office Layout template is a good example of a template
with predefined layers. Some of the layers in this template are
 The building envelope (exterior walls, doors, windows)
 Computer (all computer-related equipment)
 Equipment (fax, copy machines)
 Furniture (desks, chairs, tables)
 Movable furnishings (plants, lamps, coat racks)
 Nonmovable furnishings (corner work surfaces, panels)
 Wall (shapes that delineate floor space)
The Building Plan/Office Layout template contains a reasonable number of
layers — less than a dozen. Other templates, such as the Building Plan/Space
Plan template, contain several dozen layers. The number and type of shapes
you include in a drawing determine the exact number of layers that the draw-
ing has.
If you add a page to your drawing, it doesn’t contain any layers until you drag
into the drawing a shape that’s preassigned to a layer or you create a layer, as I
describe in the “Adding a layer and removing one” section later in this chapter.

Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings

Working with Layers
As you might suspect, there are many different operations for working with
layers; adding, naming, deleting, renaming, hiding, activating, assigning shapes,
and so on. In this section, you learn the significance and the steps for doing all
these tasks. But don’t feel you need to do all these at once to work with layers!
Just use whatever tasks seem appropriate for your particular drawing.
When you use a Visio template to create a drawing, Visio adds layers auto-
matically as you drag shapes in. You’re never required to create layers or do
anything with existing ones. But they’re there if you want to.
Toolbars for working with layers
Two toolbars are helpful when working with layers. The first is the View tool-
bar. It has a lone button for working with layers, the Layer Properties button,
which is shown in Table 10-1.
Table 10-1

The second toolbar, Format Shape, contains a box called Layers. When you
select a shape in a drawing, the layer to which that shape is assigned appears
in this box. If the shape is assigned to multiple layers, this box tells you so. If
the selected shape is unassigned, this box simply says “No Layer.”
To display the View toolbar and the Format Shape toolbar, right-click the
toolbar area and choose the toolbar name from the pop-up menu, or choose
View➪Toolbars and select their names from the list. 
Adding a layer and removing one
When the template you’re using doesn’t include the layers you want or if
you’re not using a template at all, you can create layers of your own. Why
would you want to? The simple answer is to help you organize shapes.
236
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Suppose your drawing contains a layer called Computer Equipment. You might
want to refine that further by creating a layer called Rented Computer
Equipment. That way, you could easily distinguish rented equipment from
owned equipment.
Follow these steps to add a layer:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
Visio displays the Layer Properties dialog box, showing a list of layers
for the current page, as shown in Figure 10-2.
If your Layer Properties dialog box is empty, it doesn’t necessarily mean
that the template you’re using doesn’t include predefined layers. The
layers appear in the dialog box only after you’ve dragged preassigned
shapes onto your drawing page.
2. Click the New button.
The New Layer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-3.
3. In the Layer Name box, type the name that you want for the new layer
and then click OK.
Your new layer is added to the list in the Layer Properties dialog box.
4. If you want to add more layers, click the Apply button and then
repeat Steps 2 and 3.
5. Click OK to close the Layer Properties dialog box.
Figure 10-2:
All layers on
the current
page of the
drawing are

237
Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings

When you add or remove layers, Visio adds or removes them from only the
current page. If you want to add or remove layers from multiple pages, you
need to do so for each page.
To remove a layer, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
Visio displays the Layer Properties dialog box, which shows a list of
layers for the current page.
2. Choose the layer name that you want to remove and then click
Remove.
3. If your layer contains shapes, reply to the warning, asking whether
you really want to remove the layer.
If you’re willing to sacrifice the shapes on the layer, go ahead and click
Yes. If not, click No, then reassign the shapes to a different layer before
you remove the layer. (See the “Assigning Shapes to Layers” section
later in this chapter.)
4. Click OK.
If you respond No to the warning message and then immediately try to
remove another layer, beware, Visio will not display the warning message
again! If you click Yes for the second layer, Visio deletes it, whether or not it
contains shapes. You can restore the layer by clicking the Cancel button
before the Layer Properties dialog box closes. If you close the dialog box, you
can restore the layer by immediately clicking Undo or choosing Edit➪Undo.
Figure 10-3:
Name your
new layer.
238
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Renaming a layer
You may want to change the name of a layer to something that better
describes the shapes that you use or just because you feel like it. It’s best to
use this option when you’re working with layers that you create.
I don’t recommend renaming a predefined Visio layer. Here’s why: Let’s say 
that Visio adds the Furniture layer to your drawing, and you rename it Leased
Furniture. As soon as you drag into a drawing another shape that’s preassigned
to the Furniture layer, Visio adds the Furniture layer. Now you have both a
Furniture layer and a Leased Furniture layer, which can be confusing if you
want all your shapes to appear on a single layer.
To rename a layer, follow these easy steps:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
Visio displays the Layer Properties dialog box.
2. Select the layer that you want to rename and then click Rename.
Visio displays the Rename Layer dialog box.
3. In the Layer Name box, type the new name and then click OK.
Visio adds the new layer name to the list in the Layer Properties dialog
box.
4. Click OK.
Hiding a layer
One of the big advantages of using layers in a drawing is that you can turn
them off when you don’t want to display their shapes. Consider the office
layout example I mentioned earlier in the chapter. Suppose that you want to
work on the placement of nonmovable furniture in the building. You’ll want to
display the layers that contain the building walls (that is, Building Envelope
and Walls), but you don’t need furniture and other items (Computer,
Equipment, Moveable Furnishings, Furniture) cluttering your view.
To hide a layer, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
The Layer Properties dialog box appears.
2. Find the name of the layer that you want to hide. Click the check mark
that appears in the Visible column for that layer.
239
Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings

The check mark is removed, making the layer invisible.
To display or hide all layers at the same time, click the word Visible at
the top of the column. (The column header is also a button.) This tog-
gles every item in the column on or off.
3. If you want to hide another layer, click Apply and then repeat Step 2.
4. When you’ve finished hiding layers, click OK.
To redisplay a hidden layer, follow the same steps but this time click to add a
check mark to the Visible column.
Assigning Shapes to Layers
When you drag into a drawing a shape that isn’t preassigned to a layer, the
shape goes unassigned. The same is true when you create a shape using the
drawing tools or insert a shape from another file, clip art, or a picture. (You can
test this by selecting the shape and then choosing Format➪Layer. The Layer
dialog box will show no layers selected for the unassigned shape.) There’s cer-
tainly nothing wrong with having unassigned shapes, but in many cases you
want to assign the shapes to Visio’s preassigned layers or to layers you create.
Follow these steps to assign a shape to a layer:
1. Select the shape to assign.
If the shape is part of a group, click the group and then click the shape
to select it by itself (it displays its own round green handles with an x
inside).
2. Choose Format➪Layer.
The Layer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-4, displaying a list
of all layers in the drawing.
Figure 10-4:
Use the
Layer dialog
box to
assign a
shape to
one or more
layers.
240
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

3. Click the check box for the layer (or layers) to which you want to
assign the shape.
Yes, you can select more than one layer. If the layer you want doesn’t
exist, click the New button, type a layer name, and then click OK. Visio
adds the new layer to the list shown in Figure 10-4.
4. If the shape you selected is a grouped shape and its member shapes
are assigned to other layers, click the Preserve Group Member Layers
box to retain those layer assignments.
5. Click OK.
Visio provides several ways to create a layer, one of which is by clicking the
New button in the Layer dialog box shown in Figure 10-4. Refer also to Figure
10-3 for instructions on adding a layer. Either method works.
Technically, you can’t move a shape from one layer to another. Instead, you
unassign it from one layer and assign it to another. Use the following steps:
1. Select the shape you want to reassign.
2. Choose Format➪Layer.
The Layer dialog box appears.
3. Click to remove the check mark from the box next to the layer you
want to unassign.
4. Click to add a check mark in the box for the layer you want to assign
the shape to.
5. Click OK.
Determining which layer a shape is
assigned to
After you start using layers, your first question will be, how do I tell which
layer a shape is assigned to? If it’s a preassigned shape, it’s not always clear
which layer or layers Visio chooses. If you have the Format Shape toolbar dis-
played (refer to Table 10-1), the layer name appears in the Layer box.
The other way to determine where the shape is assigned is by choosing
Format➪Layer. The Layer dialog box appears, with a check mark next to the
layer that the shape is assigned to. If the shape is assigned to more than one
layer, check marks appear next to multiple layers.
241
Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings

Activating layers
Activating a layer causes all unassigned shapes to be assigned to the active
layer. You can activate a single layer, or you can activate multiple layers.
When you activate multiple layers, the unassigned shapes you use in your
drawing are automatically assigned to all active layers.
To activate a layer or layers, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
The Layer Properties dialog box is displayed.
2. In the Active column, click the layer or layers that you want to make
active (see Figure 10-6).
3. Click OK.

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

Using Layers on Background Pages
A background page appears behind another page. Its contents show through
the page to which it is assigned. Background pages are designed to contain
repetitive information — text or graphics that you want to appear on one or
more pages in a drawing. A company name, logo, or document name are
examples of information that you may want to put on a background page.
Individual pages in a drawing can have their own or the same background
page; you determine to which page (or pages) a background is assigned. (See
Chapter 9 for information on assigning and creating background pages.)
Click here to activate a layer

243
Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings
Using shapes on many layers
Why would you want a shape to appear on more
than one layer? One reason is that a shape might
belong to more than one category. Suppose that
your drawing is a landscape plan and has many
layers, among them, Flowering Plants and
Shrubs. A plant you assign to the Shrub layer
might also be a flowering plant, in which case
you would assign it to both layers. What’s the
advantage? You might want to check your plan
for consistency of color among the flowering
plants, so you would turn off the Shrubs layer and
display only the Flowering Plants layer.
Another reason is that you can track a group of
shapes on one layer and component shapes on
individual layers. For example, suppose that
you’re diagramming a computer network that
contains components from multiple manufac-
turers. You might have an IBM layer, an HP
layer, a Dell layer, a Compaq layer, and so on.
But you would also have a layer called Network
Components, which would include shapes from
all the manufacturer layers. This gives you an
easy way to track components in the network or
by manufacturer.

Just as foreground pages can have layers, so too can background pages. To
create layers on a background page, you first need to create the background
page (refer to Chapter 9). Then follow these steps:
1. Display your background page by clicking the correct tab at the
bottom of the drawing area (such as Background-1 or a specific name).
2. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
3. Click New to display the New Layer dialog box.
4. In the Layer Name box, type a new name and then click OK.
Visio adds the name to the Layer Properties list.
5. If you want to add other layers, click Apply and repeat Steps 3 and 4.
6. When you’re finished adding layers, click OK.
Protecting Layers from Changes
After you go to all the trouble of defining layers and adding shapes to them,
nothing is worse than another user (or yourself) accidentally deleting or chang-
ing them. How can you avoid this? You can protect a layer from changes by
locking it. When a layer is locked, you can’t move, change, or delete shapes —
you can’t even select them! You also can’t add shapes to a locked layer.
To lock a layer, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
Visio displays the Layer Properties dialog box.
2. Locate the layer that you want to lock and then click the Lock column
across from the layer name (see Figure 10-7).
A check mark appears in the column. This shows that the layer as locked.
If you want to lock all layers at once, click the word Lock at the top of
the column. (The column header is also a button.) To unlock all layers at
the same time, click the Lock button again.
3. If you want to lock another layer, click Apply and repeat Step 2.
4. When you’ve finished locking layers, click OK.
244
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

If you doubt that this method really works, you can test it easily. Just try to
move, delete, or copy a shape on the locked layer. You can’t do any of these
things because Visio doesn’t even let you select the shape. Also, when you
select a different shape in the drawing (one that’s not on a locked layer) and
choose Format➪Layer, the Layer dialog box (this is the box shown in Figure
10-4) no longer displays the locked layer.
When you’re ready to work on the layer again, you can unlock it easily by
removing the check mark from the Lock column. The layer will appear again
in the Layer dialog box.
For obvious reasons, you can’t lock a layer that’s marked as an active layer.
Not so obvious? Remember that all unassigned shapes are automatically
assigned to the active layer or layers. If you could lock the active layers, your
shapes wouldn’t be assigned to any layer. When you try to lock an active
layer, Visio automatically makes the layer inactive.
Locking a layer isn’t foolproof protection from changes. After all, you can
unlock a layer just as easily as you can lock one. Think of a locked layer as an
alert or a reminder — to yourself or other users — that shapes on a locked
layer shouldn’t be changed. If you want a file to be fully protected from
changes, open it or distribute it to other users as a read-only file. For more
information on creating read-only files, see Chapter 13.

Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings

Assigning a Color to a Layer
Why would you want to assign a color to a layer, you ask? Suppose your
drawing has a half dozen layers and you’re beginning to get confused about
which shapes belong to what layer. Assigning a color to each layer lets you
determine quickly which shapes belong to a particular layer. You can also
assign a color to all locked layers. This reminds you immediately which
shapes you can’t alter. Or, if you’re distributing the drawing to other users for
review and comment, you may want to assign a color to the layer that each
user may change. Get the idea?
To assign a color to a layer, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
Visio displays the Layer Properties dialog box.
2. Find the layer to which you want to assign a color, and then click the
Color column across from the layer name.
A check mark appears in the column.
3. Make your selection in the Layer Color drop-down list (see Figure 10-8).
Visio offers several dozen colors and shades of gray. If these aren’t
enough options, you can create a custom color using the next set of
steps.
4. Click OK.
In your drawing, all shapes on the layer take on the color you chose.

Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

When you assign a color to a layer, it affects the printed copy, if you have a
color printer. All layers with a color assigned to them print all shapes in that
color, regardless of any other custom color formatting applied to the shape.
To restore original colors to shapes on that layer, you must remove the color
assignment from the layer.
To remove a color from a layer, display the Layer Properties dialog box again
and remove the check mark from the Color column.
Removing a color from a layer doesn’t remove any custom colors that you
created. They are still available in the Color dialog box.
To create a custom color, follow Steps 1 through 3 in the preceding list, and
then:
1. In the Layer Properties dialog box, find the layer to which you want
to assign a color, and then click the Color column across from the
layer name.
A check mark appears in the column.
2. In the Layer Color box, scroll to the bottom of the list and click More
Colors.
The Colors dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-9.
3. If you want to choose a color on the Standard tab, click the color.
4. If you instead want to create a color:
a. Click the Custom tab.
Figure 10-9:

247
Chapter 10: Layering Your Drawings

b. Click a shade closest to the color you want to create.
c. To change the intensity of the color, move the small, black arrow
up and down the vertical slide bar at the right of the dialog box.
d. To adjust the amount of red, green, or blue in a color, enter a
number between 0 and 255 in the appropriate box.
5. Click OK.
Visio returns to the Layer Properties dialog box and shows the custom
color you applied to the selected layer. If you click the Layer Color box,
you’ll see the custom color you created listed just below color number 23.
Selecting Layers to Print
What good are layers if you can’t print them selectively? In a building layout,
for example, you probably want to print only the Building Envelope (walls)
for the building contractor. Employees don’t want or need to see the wiring
or HVAC layouts but will probably want to see the layers for the walls, cubicle
walls, non-moveable furniture, and possibly the electrical outlets.
Visio automatically assumes that you want to print all layers, but you can
change this easily as follows:
1. Choose View➪Layer Properties or click the Layer Properties button
on the View toolbar.
2. For the layers that you don’t want to print, click to remove the check
mark in the Print column.
3. Click OK.
Don’t be deceived by the Visible column in the Layer Properties dialog box!
You can’t keep a layer from printing by making it invisible. The Print column
is the only setting that affects printing; the Visible column affects only what
you see on the screen. If a layer isn’t visible, but a check mark appears in the
Print column, it still prints!
Snap and Glue Options for Layers
If you’ve followed some of the steps in this chapter, you’ve seen the Layer
Properties dialog box (refer to Figure 10-2), and you’re probably wondering
about the Snap and Glue columns.
248
Part III: Taking Your Drawings to the Next Level 

What are snap and glue, you ask? Snap is a feature that works like a magnet
to let you align and position shapes accurately in a drawing. You can specify
that shapes automatically snap to other shapes, grid lines, guide lines, ruler
divisions, and more. Glue is a feature that keeps shapes connected even when
you move them. Connection lines between shapes either stay connected at
the same point on the shape or move to a more convenient connection point,
depending on the glue options that you specify. See Chapter 6 for more infor-
mation about the Snap and Glue features.
The following rules apply to the Snap and Glue options in the Layer
Properties dialog box:
 Snap: When Snap is checked for a particular layer, shapes on that layer
can snap to shapes on other layers and vice versa. (In other words, Snap
is enabled in both directions.) When Snap is not checked for a particular
layer, shapes on that layer can still snap to shapes on other layers, but
not vice versa.
 Glue: When Glue is checked for a particular layer, shapes on that layer
can glue to shapes on other layers and vice versa. (In other words, Glue
is enabled in both directions.) When Glue is not checked for a particular
layer, shapes on that layer can still glue to shapes on other layers, but
not vice versa.
By default, Snap and Glue are enabled on all layers in a drawing. If you want
shapes on other layers to steer clear of shapes on a particular layer, click to
uncheck both options (Snap and Glue) for that layer.

In this part . . .
I
f you’ve worked your way through Parts I, II, and III,
you should be feeling conﬁdent about your Visio skills.
You’re probably more than a casual user — but there’s
still more you can do to become the resident expert. In
this part, you uncover the real power of Visio: its pro-
grammability. You don’t have to be a techie programmer-
type to beneﬁt from this feature. But you do have to be
ready to create your own stencils, master shapes, and
templates.
You ﬁnd out how to store data in shapes, and discover
how storing data lets you generate all types of reports. If
you work in a group that shares Visio drawings, you’ll ﬁnd
Visio 2003’s new annotating and reviewing features
extremely useful. Then, take advantage of the capability to
share Visio drawings with other programs.

Chapter 11
Creating Stencils, Master Shapes,
Templates, and Styles
In This Chapter
 Creating and editing stencils
 Working with master shapes
 Creating and saving custom templates
 Applying styles to shapes
You can use almost any software program as-is successfully without ever
taking the time to customize it. But if you use the program a lot, customiz-
ing can save you valuable time and keystrokes. Like most software programs,
Visio has many features you can customize, or personalize, such as stencils,
master shapes, templates, and styles. Perhaps it’s more accurate to call these
extensions because you can actually add things to Visio that make it more
useful — for you. 
Working with Stencils
Chapters 1 and 2 cover the basics of opening and using stencils. This chapter
goes beyond the basics and tells you about document stencils, how to cus-
tomize existing stencils, and how to create your own.
If the template you’re using doesn’t contain all the shapes you need, choose
File➪Shapes to open additional stencils.

Using the Stencil toolbar
As you work with stencils, I recommend that you use the buttons on the Stencil
toolbar, which are listed in Table 11-1. To display the Stencil toolbar, right-click
the toolbar area and choose Stencil, or choose View➪Toolbars➪Stencil.
Table 11-1

As you work with and create drawings, Visio displays the stencil shape icons
and names in the Shapes window. (Note that the Icons and Names button on
the toolbar is highlighted.) If you don’t care about seeing the names of shapes,
or if you want to view more shapes in the Shapes window at one time, click the
Icons Only button. (Some stencils contain so many shapes that you need to
scroll through them.) If you want names without the pictures (icons), choose
Names Only. You can also display the shape tip (the one Visio pops up when
you hover over a shape in a stencil) along with the icon and shape name by
choosing the Icons and Details button. 
An example of each of these stencil options is shown in Figure 11-1. Note that
if you have several stencils open, they must all be displayed using the same
style.
254
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Using a document stencil
When you create a drawing, Visio automatically creates a document stencil.
You were probably unaware of it until now, unless you discovered it on your
own at the bottom of the File➪Shapes menu. 
When you’re working on an existing drawing, choose File➪Shapes➪Show
Document Stencil and see what happens. Visio opens a stencil with the 
title Document Stencil. (See the lower-left corner of Figure 11-2.) It includes
all the shapes that you’ve used so far in the current drawing. Each time you
add a shape from a stencil to your drawing, it’s automatically added to the
document stencil.
So what’s the point of a document stencil? It acts as a log for the shapes in your
drawing. Suppose you had to open fifteen stencils to find all the shapes you
needed for your drawing. You then closed some of those stencils when you
didn’t need them anymore. If you want to reuse any of those shapes, you don’t
have to hunt down the original stencil and reopen it. Instead, you can drag the
shapes you need from the document stencil into your drawing.
To close the document stencil, click the stencil’s icon and choose Close. Note
that a document stencil is always created with a drawing, whether or not you
display the document stencil.

Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

Creating a custom stencil
Do you find yourself using the same shapes from several different stencils
over and over? If so, save time and create a custom stencil to store your most
frequently used shapes. That way, you won’t have to open multiple stencils
every time you create a drawing.
The quickest way to create a custom stencil is to base it on an existing stencil
or drawing. Follow these steps to create a custom stencil:
1. Do one or both of the following:
a. Open a drawing that already contains most of the shapes you
want to include. 
If you don’t have one, open the next closest thing, or just create a
sample drawing and drag all the shapes you want on your custom
stencil onto the drawing. (If you make a sample drawing, the order
and arrangement of the shapes doesn’t matter. You don’t really care
about the drawing; it’s the stencil you want to save.)
Figure 11-2:
Every shape
used in the
drawing is
listed in the
document
stencil.
256
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

b. Open a Visio stencil that you want to copy shapes from or open the
document stencil (choose File➪Shapes➪Show Document Stencil).
Arrange the stencils on the screen so you can see all of them.
2. Choose File➪Shapes➪New Stencil or click the New Stencil button on
the Stencil toolbar.
A new stencil named Stencilx, where x is a number, appears on the left
side of your screen,. If you create more new stencils, the number is
incremented each time. (Don’t worry, you’ll rename it soon enough.)
3. Drag a shape onto the custom stencil (see Figure 11-3) using one of
these methods:
• From the drawing page, hold down the Ctrl key (so the shape is
copied, not moved) and drag the shape onto the new stencil. (When
you hold down the Ctrl key as you drag the shape, you see a plus
symbol next to your mouse pointer.) Visio names the shape Master.0
and names subsequent shapes Master.1, Master.2, Master.3, and so
on. (You can rename these, as you see later in the “Naming master
shapes on a custom stencil” section.)
• From the document stencil or from a Visio stencil, drag the shape
onto the new stencil. (You don’t need to hold the Ctrl key because
Visio automatically copies the shape instead of moving it.) The
shape retains its Visio name (such as Rectangle, or Terminal Server,
or External Interactor).
4. When all the shapes you want are on the custom stencil, right-click
the icon on the stencil’s title bar (at the far left) to display the pop-up
menu, and then click Save.
Visio displays the Save As dialog box and selects the My Shapes folder,
where stencils are stored. This folder already contains a stencil called
Favorites, which Visio automatically creates.
5. In the File Name box, type a name for the stencil.
In the Save As Type box, Visio automatically chooses Stencil for the file
type (*.vss).
6. Click the Save button.
Visio returns to the drawing screen and the stencil name is now dis-
played in the title bar.
Now when you choose File➪Shapes, your custom stencil is listed in the My
Shapes category (see Figure 11-4).
257
Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

I assume that most users have shapes (usually in an existing drawing) that
they want to include in a custom stencil, so the preceding steps include
adding shapes to the stencil. Adding shapes at this time isn’t required, how-
ever. You can simply choose File➪Shapes➪New Stencil to create a new sten-
cil, and then save it immediately without adding any shapes. You can always
come back later and add shapes.
Naming master shapes on a custom stencil
Earlier in this chapter you saw how Visio names shapes on custom stencils
Master.0, Master.1, Master.3, and so on as you add them to the stencil. These
are intended to be temporary names as you create a custom stencil; your
shapes really should have more descriptive, permanent names.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

When you name a shape, you can also type a tool tip (a description that pops
up when you hover over the shape). In addition, you can store keywords with
the shape. Keywords enable Visio to find the shape if you do a search. In the
dialog box, type each keyword on a new line in the Keywords box. (Refer to
Chapter 4 for help on searching for shapes.)
To rename shapes on a custom stencil, do the following:
1. Display the stencil that contains the shapes you want to rename.
2. Right-click the stencil title bar and choose Edit Stencil.
Visio adds a red asterisk to the title bar to indicate that the stencil is in
edit mode.
3. Right-click a shape in the stencil and choose Edit Master➪Master
Properties.
The Master Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-5.
4. In the Name field, type a name for the shape.
Custom stencils
Figure 11-4:

259
Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

5. If you want a tip to appear when you hover the mouse over the shape
in the stencil, type the description or instruction in the Prompt field.
6. If you want an icon size other than Normal, choose Tall, Wide, or
Double in the Icon Size box.
7. If you don’t want to use Center as the alignment for the shape name,
choose Left or Right.
8. In the Keywords box, type all the words by which you want to be able
to search for this shape.
9. Click OK.
Visio updates the name of the shape on the stencil.
These steps are the long version for renaming. Use them when you want to
edit the prompt and keywords, in addition to changing a shape’s name.
If you want to simply rename a shape, do this:
1. Display the stencil that contains the shape you want to rename.
2. Right-click the stencil title bar and choose Edit Stencil.
3. Right-click a shape in the stencil and choose Rename Master.
Figure 11-5:
Type a 
new name,
prompt, 
and key-

260
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Visio highlights the current name below the shape in the stencil.
4. Type a new name for the shape, and then press the Enter key or click
a blank area of the stencil.
Adding master shapes to a custom stencil
You can easily add more shapes to a custom stencil after you create and save
it. Just drag shapes from a drawing (remember to use the Ctrl key so you’re
copying rather than moving) or from another stencil (no Ctrl key needed) onto
the custom stencil. Be sure to save your stencil again by right-clicking the title
bar and choosing Save.
If you try to add a shape to a Visio stencil, Visio informs you promptly that this
is not allowed. I suspect that Visio’s intent with this rule is to protect us from
ourselves! After all, if you could add a shape to a Visio stencil, you might just
as easily delete a shape. 
You can add shapes to a custom stencil without having the custom stencil
open. This is a good method to use if you’re in the middle of creating a draw-
ing and run across a shape that you know you’ll want to use in the future but
don’t need now.
Follow these steps to save a shape without opening the custom stencil:
1. Display the stencil that contains the shape you want to save.
2. Right-click the shape you want to save and choose Add to My Shapes.
A menu listing all custom stencils appears.
3. Click the stencil name where you want to save the shape.
Visio saves the shape to your custom stencil.
If the custom stencil is open when you add a shape, Visio adds the shape but
doesn’t save it right away. Visio asks you later (when you close the drawing
or close Visio) if you want to save changes.
Deleting master shapes from a 
custom stencil
Visio protects its stencils so that you don’t accidentally wipe out its shapes.
However, you can delete master shapes from a custom stencil anytime you
like because you created the stencil yourself. You may find yourself adding
and deleting shapes often as your needs change for the types of drawings 
you create. 
261
Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

Follow these steps to delete a shape:
1. Open the custom stencil.
2. Right-click the stencil title bar and choose Edit Stencil.
Visio adds a red asterisk to the title bar to indicate that the stencil is in
edit mode.
3. Right-click the shape you want to delete and choose Delete.
It’s as simple as that. If you change your mind right away, you’re in luck
because you can choose Edit➪Undo after you delete a shape to bring it back. 
Creating a Custom Template
A template is like a model for a drawing; it sets up the page size, orientation,
drawing scale, grid, text and font styles for your drawing area. A template
also automatically opens up appropriate stencils for the type of drawing that
you’re creating.
The biggest advantages that templates offer are consistency and efficiency.
Companies that rely on Visio often create custom templates that include their
name, logo, corporate colors, contact information, and so on. This ensures that
every drawing created using Visio has the same look and feel. Even if you’re
not using corporate information, you might want a custom template for a series
of related drawings so that they are consistent from first to last.
It’s possible that none of the Visio templates meet your needs exactly, but you
can create a custom template that does. You can base your custom template
on an existing Visio template or drawing and then change it, or you can create
a custom template from scratch.
To create a custom template from a Visio template or an existing drawing,
follow these steps:
1. Select the drawing type that you want to use.
Choose File➪New➪Choose Drawing Type. If you want to base your new
template on an existing drawing, choose File➪Open to open your file.
2. Choose File➪Shapes to open any stencils that you want to include in
your new template.
3. Choose File➪Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box appears.
262
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

4. Click the Print Setup, Page Size, or Drawing Scale tab, as appropriate,
to make changes to the template.
Refer to Chapter 3 for help with the settings on these tabs.
5. If you want your template to include a background page, create it now.
See Chapter 9 for details.
6. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
7. In the Save In box, choose the folder in which you want to save your
new template.
Choose the Visio Solutions folder if you want the template to appear in
the Choose Drawing Type dialog box when you start Visio or when you
choose File➪New➪Choose Drawing Type.
8. In the File Name box, type a name for your new template.
9. In the Save As Type box, choose Template.
10. Click the Save button.
If you want to create a custom template from scratch, the best way to start is
to set up a drawing with all the settings you want the template to have. Choose
File➪Page Setup to set the page size, drawing scale, and page property settings
that you want for the new template. And don’t forget about background pages
(see Chapter 9) and layers (see Chapter 10). When the drawing is the way you
want it, follow Steps 6 through 10 in the preceding procedure.
Working with Styles
A style is a collection of attributes that apply to a shape, such as a green-and-
yellow striped fill, a purple outline, a brown shadow, and bold orange text in
the Haettenschweiler font. The style has a name — such as Tasteless — and
is saved along with a template or a drawing file. (Chapters 4 and 8 talk about
working with these elements of a style.)
What’s the point of having a style? A style saves you the time of applying all
the attributes of Tasteless individually to a shape. You simply apply the style
to as many shapes as you want, and — voilà! — you have multiple Tasteless
shapes! Using styles not only saves you time but also ensures consistency
when you want shapes to be formatted alike.
A style can contain just one attribute or dozens of attributes. It can contain text
attributes, line attributes, or fill attributes, or any combination of the three.
Most Visio templates contain at least a few predefined styles (with one, two,
or all three attributes).
263
Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

When you work with styles, I recommend that you display the Format Text
and Format Shape toolbars on your screen so you don’t have to remember
the menu commands. (Right-click anywhere in the toolbar area to select
these toolbars.)
The Format Text toolbar contains a Text style box; the Format Shape toolbar
contains Line style and Fill style boxes. To see how different styles are applied
in the drawing, click a shape and look at the style boxes on the toolbar. Now
click several other shapes and watch the style boxes each time you click
another shape. You see that some shapes have a style assigned to them, but
others don’t.
In Figure 11-6, you can see that the selected shape (chair) uses the Facilities
line style, Facilities text style, and Facilities fill style, all of which are predefined
by the Office Layout template.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Creating and saving a style
You can base a new style on an existing one or create it from scratch. If the
style that you want to create is similar to another style, begin with the existing
style, make the changes that you want, and then save the new style under a
different name.
Use these steps to create a style:
1. Choose Format➪Define Styles.
The Define Styles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-7.
2. In the Name box, type a name for the new style.
3. If you’re basing the new style on an existing one, select that existing
style in the Based On box.
4. In the Includes area, check the characteristics that your new style
includes: 
• Text: For font, size, style, and so on
• Line: For things such as line weight, pattern, and color
• Fill: For color, pattern, shadow, and so on
Figure 11-7:

the text,
line, and fill

dialog box.
265
Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

I recommend that you check all options here even if you don’t use them
all right now. You might define them in the future. 
5. For each option that you chose in Step 3, click the appropriate button
in the Change box (Text, Line, or Fill).
In the dialog box that appears (an example of the Line dialog box is shown
in Figure 11-8), choose the attributes that you want and then click OK to
close the box. Visio returns you to the Define Styles dialog box.
6. In the Define Styles dialog box, click the Apply button.
Visio creates the new style, making it available for use in the current
drawing. If you want to see your new style listed, click the down arrow
next to the Text Style box on the Format Text toolbar, and the Fill Style
and Line Style boxes on the Format Shape toolbar.
You can also use the Define Styles dialog box to rename existing styles or
delete styles that you don’t want to use anymore. To rename or delete a style,
select a shape in the drawing that uses the style, and then choose Format➪
Styles to display the Define Styles dialog box shown in Figure 11-7. Check to see
that the style listed in the Name box is the style you want to rename or delete,
and then click the Rename or Delete button, respectively. If you’re renaming,
Visio displays a dialog box so that you type the new name. If you’re deleting,
Visio deletes the style without asking you to confirm your choice, so be sure
you have the correct style. Click OK to return to the drawing.
Typically when you define a style, that style is available only to the current
drawing. However, if you save the style with your template, the style is avail-
able to all drawings you create using that template. For more information, see
“Creating a Custom Template” earlier in this chapter.

266
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Applying a style to a shape
After you create a style, you simply apply it to a shape to assign all the style’s
attributes to the shape. You can also apply the style to several shapes at once.
Follow these steps:
1. Select the shape or shapes that you want to apply a style to.
To select more than one shape, press and hold down the Shift key as you
click the shapes.
2. Apply text, line, and fill styles:
• Using the Format Style and Format Text toolbars: Click the down
arrow for the style box on the appropriate toolbar (for example,
the Fill style box on the Format Shape toolbar). Repeat as needed
with the other style boxes.
• Using the Style dialog box: Choose Format➪Style. In the Style dialog
box that appears, choose the appropriate styles from the drop-down
boxes and then click OK.
The styles are applied to the selected shapes.
Copying a style from one drawing 
to another
Suppose you spend a lot of time creating and applying styles to different
shapes in a drawing, and now you want to use those styles in a different draw-
ing. How do you do that when the custom style applies only to the current
drawing? Simple — you copy it!
To copy styles to another drawing, follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing that contains the styles you created.
2. Create a drawing and arrange the two drawings side-by-side (or use
the Window menu to switch back and forth).
3. In the original drawing, select a shape whose style you want to use, and
choose Edit➪Copy (or click the Copy button on the Standard toolbar).
4. Go to the new drawing page and choose Edit➪Paste (or click the Paste
button on the Standard toolbar).
Visio pastes the shape into the new drawing and the new style appears
in the appropriate boxes in the Format Text and Format Shape toolbars.
267
Chapter 11: Creating Stencils, Master Shapes, Templates, and Styles

It doesn’t matter whether you really want to use the shape itself in the new
drawing. If you don’t; just delete it! The style that you copied remains available
in the new drawing.
Remember that if you want a style to be available to new drawings, you can
define it as part of a template. See the “Creating Custom Templates” section
earlier in this chapter.

isio is far more sophisticated than it might appear at a quick glance. You
might never guess that a Visio diagram or drawing could have all sorts of
data stored with it. It might be an even further leap to assume that you could
run custom, sorted reports (simple or complex) on that stored data — but you
can. Or how about the idea that you can program Visio shapes to behave or
appear in a particular way or to adjust themselves to changes that you make
in a drawing? These are not trivial features. They are part of the sophistication
built into Visio that greatly enhances your ability to use the program in many
creative ways, as you see throughout this chapter.
Storing Data in Visio Shapes
In Visio, shapes are more than what they appear to be. Some are smart — their
behavior changes depending on the circumstances in which they’re used.
Others have sophisticated geometry. Whatever their particular characteristics,
all shapes can store data.
Why would you want to store data in a shape? Well, you might not if your draw-
ing illustrates a simple workflow process such as Get bills➪Enter payables➪
Pay bills➪Record in register➪File paperwork. But what if the process is more
complex, and costs are associated with each task? You might want to store
cost data, the resources required to complete the task, and the duration of
time involved in each task.

Now, pretend you’re a property manager in charge of distributing and tracking
computer equipment for your company. (It may not sound as exciting as whale
watching, but it pays!) In an office layout plan, you can store inventory num-
bers and owner information for each computer component shape shown in a
drawing. You might want to store additional information, such as serial num-
bers, acquisition dates, manufacturer names, or model numbers.
Visio calls any type of custom data that you store in a shape custom properties
data. You enter the data in a shape’s custom property fields. Many Visio shapes
have built-in fields for entering custom property data. For example, all office
layout shapes include inventory number and owner fields. Flowchart shapes
contain fields for recording cost, duration, and resources.
Surprise! Some Visio shapes don’t have custom properties fields. (Some shapes
are too ordinary for you to care about storing data in them.) To find out if a
shape has custom properties, first select or right-click the shape, and then
choose Shape➪Custom Properties. If the shape contains custom properties,
Visio displays a Custom Properties dialog box like the one shown in Figure 12-1.
If the shape doesn’t have custom properties, a message tells you that no
custom properties exist and asks whether you would like to define them 
now. You can just click No to this message.
Figure 12-1:
When a
shape has
custom
properties,
the data
appears in
the Custom
Properties
dialog box.
270
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Another way to display custom properties is with the Custom Properties
window, which is shown in Figure 12-2. The nice thing about this window is
that it stays on the screen, so you can check custom properties data as you
click different shapes in a drawing. Each time you click a shape, that shape’s
custom properties data is shown. If a selected shape doesn’t contain data,
the box simply says “No Custom Properties.” 
You can float the Custom Properties window by dragging it anywhere on the
screen, or you can dock it along any edge of the drawing area. When docked,
the Custom Properties window, like the Pan and Zoom window, can be rolled
up like a window shade — just click the thumbtack icon and then move the
mouse away from the window. To make the window reappear, move the
mouse over the title bar. For more details, see Chapter 2.
Entering custom properties data
When a Visio shape already contains custom properties fields, it’s a cinch to
enter the data. Follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing that contains the shape in which you want to 
store data.
2. Click or right-click the shape, and choose Shape➪Custom Properties.
A Custom Properties dialog box similar to the one in Figure 12-1 appears.
All custom properties for the shape are listed in the Properties area at
the bottom of the dialog box. In Figure 12-1, for example, some of the
properties for the selected shape are Diameter, ID, Name, and Department
(among others). A different shape in the drawing might have different
properties such as Height, Length, Owner, and Service Date. 
3. In each field, type the data that you want to store.
4. Click OK.
An even quicker way to enter data is by using the Custom Properties window
(see Figure 12-2). It isn’t just a display box; you can use it to enter data as well.
To enter or change data, click the field you want to change and start typing.
Press Tab to move between data fields.
Visio stores the data you enter with the shape. Had someone else entered the
data, you probably wouldn’t even be aware of it because it doesn’t make itself
visible — unless you ask for it, or want to run a report on it, as you learn later
in this chapter.
271
Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

Editing custom properties fields
Suppose you have an office layout drawing that contains office equipment,
among other items. You want to store data that tells which employee the
equipment is assigned to, the equipment manufacturer’s name, and the loca-
tion of the equipment, in addition to the fields that already exist. Can you add
new custom properties? Can you change the name of a custom property? 
Well, yes, you can — and you can’t. Let me explain:
 If you want to change or add a custom property for an instance of a shape
in a drawing, you can.
 If you want to change or add a custom property for a master shape on a
custom stencil, you can.
 If you want to change or add a custom property for a shape on the docu-
ment stencil, you can.
 But if you want to change or add a custom property for a master shape
on a Visio stencil, you definitely can’t.
Figure 12-2:

272
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

I suspect that the reasoning for this rule follows the same line as the one about
not adding to or deleting shapes from Visio stencils: Visio wants to protect 
its shapes and protect you from yourself! If you feel that you must change a
custom property for a master shape, add the shape to a custom stencil and
change it there.
The document stencil applies only to the current drawing. Custom stencils
are those you create with whatever shapes you want and are available to use
with any drawing. Refer to Chapter 11 for more information on working with
stencils.
To add custom properties to a shape in a drawing, use the following steps:
1. Open the drawing that contains the shape for which you want to add
properties.
2. Click the shape and choose Shape➪Custom Properties. 
If the shape already has custom properties, Visio displays a Custom
Properties dialog box. If the shape has no custom properties, Visio dis-
plays the message shown in Figure 12-3.
3. Click the Yes button (if the shape has no custom properties) or click
the Define button at the bottom of the dialog box (if custom properties
are already defined for the shape).
The Define Custom Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-4.
If the shape already has custom properties defined, the first custom prop-
erty (such as Height or Depth) appears in the Label box. Other custom
properties are listed in the Properties area of the dialog box. 
4. Click New.
The name in the Label box changes to Propertyx, where x is a number. 
If the shape already has eight properties, for example, the label will be
Property9. If the shape doesn’t have custom properties defined yet, the
name that appears in the Label box is a placeholder called Property1
(because it’s the first property you’re defining).
Figure 12-3:
If a shape
doesn’t
have custom
properties,
this box
appears.
273
Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

5. Now define your custom property:
a. In the Label box, type a new, descriptive name.
As you type, the new label is listed in the Properties area at the
bottom of the dialog box.
b. In the Type box, choose the type of data that the field will hold
(String for text, Number for numeric entries, Currency for money,
and so on).
c. In the Format box, choose a format style (such as General, Whole
Number, or Fraction).
d. If you want a phrase to indicate the type of input required for
this field, type a short phrase in the Prompt box. 
When using the Custom Properties window, the prompt will appear
when you hover the mouse over a custom property label.
e. If you want to enter a value for the custom property you just 
created, type your entry in the Value box. 
If you prefer to enter data later, refer to the section “Entering custom
properties data,” earlier in this chapter.
6. If you want to create another custom property, click the New button
and repeat Steps 4 and 5.
7. Click OK.
Visio returns to the Custom Properties dialog box. 
You just added custom properties for a shape in a drawing, but you can also
add custom properties to a shape on a custom stencil. When you do, the
custom properties apply to every instance of the shape that you drag into 
a drawing.
Figure 12-4:
You can
edit, delete,
or create
properties.
274
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

To add custom properties to a shape on a stencil, you use similar steps to the
preceding ones, but you start from a different point. Here’s how:
1. Open the custom stencil or the document stencil that contains the shape
for which you want to edit properties.
2. Right-click the stencil’s title bar and choose Edit Stencil.
A small red asterisk appears on the stencil title bar to indicate the stencil
is in edit mode.
3. In the stencil, right-click the shape you want to edit and choose Edit
Master➪Edit Master Shape.
The enlarged shape appears in a separate window.
4. Right-click the shape and choose Shape➪Custom Properties.
The Custom Properties dialog box appears.
5. Click the Define button.
The Define Custom Properties dialog box appears. In the Label box,
Visio displays a property label (such as Height) or a placeholder called
Property1.
6. If the label is for an actual (named) property, click the New button at
the bottom of the box. 
Now the Label box displays Property1.
7. Define your custom property. 
(The steps to define your custom property are the same as the ones in
the preceding group of steps.)
a. In the Label box, type a new name.
As you type, the new label is listed in the Properties area at the
bottom of the dialog box.
b. In the Type box, choose the type of data that the field will hold
(String for text, Number for numeric entries, Currency for money,
and so on).
c. In the Format box, choose a format style (such as General, Whole
Number, or Fraction).
d. If you want a phrase to indicate the type of input required for
this field, type a short phrase in the Prompt box. 
When using the Custom Properties window, the prompt will appear
when you hover the mouse over a custom property label.
e. If you want to enter a value for the custom property you just
created, type your entry in the Value box. 
If you prefer to enter data later, refer to the section “Entering custom
properties data,” earlier in this chapter.
275
Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

8. If you want to create another new custom property, click the New
button and repeat Step 7 (and 8, if desired).
9. When you’re finished, click OK.
The Custom Properties dialog box appears.
10. Click the Cancel button.
Visio returns to the window displaying the master shape.
11. Click the black X at the far right end of the menu bar to close just this
window.
Don’t click the red X button — that closes Visio!
Whew! That seems like a lot of steps, but every time you use this shape, the
custom properties are there for you to fill in — if you want to. (You’re never
required to add data to custom property fields.)
Do you want to test whether your custom property fields have really changed?
Drag a shape onto your drawing from the stencil you edited. Right-click the
shape and choose Shape➪Custom Properties. The Custom Properties dialog
box appears, and the new custom properties you added are shown.
The previous two sets of steps show you how to add custom properties to
shapes. But what if you have a custom property called, say, Source and you
want to change it to Supplier? If you want to edit, or change, the name of a
custom property, or change any of its attributes (such as Type or Format),
you use basically the same process — at least, you use the same dialog
boxes. Follow these abbreviated steps: 
1. Open the drawing that contains the shape for which you want to edit
properties.
2. Click the shape and choose Shape➪Custom Properties, or right-click
the shape and choose Shape➪Custom Properties.
The Custom Properties dialog box appears.
3. Click the Define button.
The Define Custom Properties dialog box appears.
4. In the Properties area of the dialog box, click the property you want
to edit.
The property you select appears in the Label box.
5. In the Label box, type a new name for the property.
6. If you want to change any other attributes (for instance, the Type,
Format, or Prompt) click the appropriate box, make your change, and
then click OK.
276
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Visio returns to the Custom Properties dialog box.
7. Click OK.
Visio returns to your drawing.
Reporting on Data Stored in Visio Shapes
Data sitting in a shape is of limited use as reference information; it’s far more
useful when you can report on it. Visio provides the tools you need to generate
all kinds of reports on your own, or you can choose from a variety — 22, in
fact — of predefined reports.
To generate a report, Visio needs a report definition. The report definition is
just a simple set of instructions, specifying the following:
 Which objects you want to report on
 Which custom properties you want to display as columns in your report
 Report title
 Subtotals (if applicable)
 Sorting guidelines
When you use one of Visio’s predefined reports, you don’t need to concern
yourself with creating report definitions because they’re already created for
you. Visio allows you to modify them, though, if you want.
Using a predefined report
The type and number of predefined reports available to you depends on the
type of drawing you create. Some drawings might have just two and others
might have eight or more.
Some predefined reports fall into specific categories. For example:
 Count and inventory reports typically count items in a drawing
 Flowchart reports include information on resources, cost, and duration
 Asset reports displays information about asset type, owner, name, and
manufacturer
 Numeric reports typically run calculations (totals, averages, maximums,
minimums, and the like)
277
Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

Predefined reports come gratis with the drawing template you choose. Every
time you create a drawing using the basic flowchart template, for example,
flowchart and inventory reports are predefined for you — whether you use
them or not.
To use a predefined report, choose Tools➪Reports to display the Reports
dialog box. This dialog box displays whatever report types are applicable to
the current drawing type. 
To use a predefined report for your drawing, follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing for which you want to create a report.
2. Choose Tools➪Reports. 
The Reports dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-5. Predefined
reports are listed in the Report area. The first report is highlighted and a
description of it appears in the Description area of the dialog box. You
can click different reports to display their description, if you want.
3. Click to select the report you want.
4. Click the Run button. 
The Run Report dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
5. Choose a report format for the results: 
• Excel generates results in a Microsoft Excel file
• HTML saves results in your My Documents folder with the name
Report_1.html
• Visio shape inserts results in the current drawing as a shape
Figure 12-5:

types for

278

• XML saves results in your My Documents folder with the name
Report_1.xml
6. Click OK.
If you chose the Visio shape report format, the results are placed in the current
drawing as a shape. Figure 12-7 shows an example of an inventory report shape
in a space plan drawing.

Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

Creating a custom report
Maybe you don’t see a predefined report that suits your needs. In that case,
you can branch out on your own and create a report from scratch or modify
an existing predefined report. Don’t let the idea of creating your own scare
you off; the process is simple and will give you exactly the results you want.
Suppose that in an office layout drawing, you want a report that lists only the
printers in the drawing, not an entire inventory report. That’s straightforward;
you’re asking for only one simple thing: printers. So your report definition has
only one requirement:
Product Description = printer
Or suppose you want something more specific and a little more involved.
Maybe there’s a recall on a plotter part and you need a count of all the color
plotters in the Sales and Marketing departments that were manufactured by
ABC Company and have a purchase date of 1999. Generating a report like this
requires some simple database-like queries, which you can easily define when
you create a custom report. For a report like this, you specify the following:
 Department = Marketing
 Product Description = color plotter
 Manufacturer = ABC Company
 Purchase Date = 1999
The simple rule is that whenever you create a custom report, you do three
things:
 Specify which shapes you want to report on
 Choose the custom properties to include in the report
 Choose how you want the report sorted and organized
Visio makes creating a report easy for you by displaying the Report Definition
Wizard, which guides you through these choices step by step. Here’s how to
define a report:
1. Open the drawing for which you want to create a report.
2. Choose Tools➪Reports. 
The Reports dialog box appears.
3. Click the New button.
The first screen of the Report Definition Wizard dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 12-8.
280
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

4. Choose Shapes on all pages or Shapes on the current page. 
5. To define specific criteria (such as the Marketing Department and a
purchase date of 1999):
a. Click the Advanced button. 
The Advanced dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-9.
b. In the Property box, select a custom property (such as
Department).
c. In the Condition box, choose a condition (such as =, <, > <>, <=,
>=, or Exists for each custom property you chose.  
For example, if a custom property is Height, you might choose >=
as your condition. 
d. In the Value box, type a value for the Property and Condition
you selected in Steps 6a and 6b. 
Figure 12-9:
Use the

dialog 
box to set
special

281
Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

For example, enter 6 if you want to find a shape for which the Height
property is >=6. 
e. Click the Add button. 
The condition appears in the Defined Criteria box.
f. To create additional criteria, repeat Steps b-e.
g. Click OK.
6. Click the Next button.
7. Click to add a check mark next to each custom property you want dis-
played in the report (each custom property represents a column in the
report), and then click Next.
8. In the Report Title box, type a title.
9. If you want to include subtotals in your report, click the Subtotals
button, choose the options you want, and then click OK.
10. To sort by certain criteria and choose the column order, click the Sort
button, choose the options you want, and then click OK.
11. Click Next.
12. In the Description box, type a description for your custom report and
then click Finish.
Visio returns to the Reports dialog box shown in Figure 12-6. Your custom
report is now added to the list of predefined reports.
Run a custom report just like you do a predefined one: Click the Run button
in the Reports dialog box and then choose the format for your results. If 
you find errors in your report definition, simply repeat the preceding steps,
choosing different options.
Updating reports
Often after you spend the time creating a report for a drawing, the first thing
you do is go back and update your drawing with more shapes! Now your report
information is no longer valid. Do you want to re-create a report every time
you change your drawing? You probably want to do that about as much as you
want a root canal! Fortunately, Visio understands this, so it lets you update
existing reports when you change your drawings.
To update a report, use these steps:
1. In your drawing, right-click the report shape and choose Update
Report.
282
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

The Update Report dialog box is displayed and the report type for the
current report is highlighted. (This box is nearly identical to the Reports
dialog box shown in Figure 12-6 except for the title.)
2. Click the Run button.
Visio reruns the report generator and automatically updates the data in
the original report shape.
Now wasn’t that easy? That’s all there is to it — unless you want to modify
the report definition itself. If so, repeat the steps shown earlier in the
“Creating a custom report” section.
Customizing Shape Behavior
Most Visio shapes are programmed to behave in certain ways, depending on
the drawing type and the actions you take in a drawing. For example, the 
100-square-foot Space shape (on the Wall, Shell, and Structure stencil used in
space plan drawings) adjusts and recalculates its square footage automatically
if you resize the shape. Or how about the desk shapes on the Office Furniture
stencil that won’t let you resize them because they’re built to standard indus-
try sizes? These are just two examples of smart behavior in Visio shapes. The
average user probably doesn’t want to casually mess around with these sophis-
ticated features. (We leave that to the techno-geeks to ponder.)
But what about some simple changes? For instance, what if you want to con-
vert a 2-D shape to a 1-D shape so that it behaves like a connector? That seems
like a reasonable task that you might find useful. Or how about customizing
the way groups are selected when you click them? If that doesn’t interest you,
what about determining what a shape will do when you double-click it? These
are examples of simple changes that you can make to a single shape in a draw-
ing or to custom shapes on the document stencil or a custom stencil.
Changing a shape from 2-D to 1-D
If you were to take the time to hand-draw an arrow like the one shown in
Figure 12-10, you’d probably want it to behave as a connector. Instead, it
behaves as a 2-D shape because it is a 2-D shape! That is, it has selection han-
dles that allow you to resize the shape’s height and width.
In contrast, connectors are 1-D shapes with endpoints that allow you to con-
nect to other shapes, as shown in Figure 12-11. To use your hand-drawn shape
as a connector, you need to convert it from a 2-D shape to a 1-D shape so that
it has endpoints.
283
Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

Use the following steps to convert a 2-D shape to a 1-D shape:
1. Create your shape using Visio’s drawing tools, or save an existing 2-D
shape on a custom stencil.
2. Right-click the shape and choose Format➪Behavior.
The Behavior dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-12. In the
Interaction Style area, the Box (2-Dimensional) option is selected.
3. In the Interaction Style area, click Line (1-Dimensional).
4. Click OK.
Now return to your drawing and select your shape. You see that its selection
handles (that allowed you to resize for height and width) are replaced with
endpoints. These endpoints can be connected to shapes at connection points.
For more information about connecting shapes, refer to Chapter 6.

Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

Setting a shape’s group behavior
A group is a set of shapes that behave together as a single unit. Ordinarily
when you click a shape that’s grouped, the group is selected first. If you click
a second time, an individual shape in the group is subselected. But you can
choose to swap this selection order and have individual shapes subselected
on the first click, or you can choose to have only the group selected (that is,
individual shapes are never subselected). 
To change the way a group responds when you click it, use these steps:
1. Open the drawing that contains the grouped shape.
2. Right-click the grouped shape and choose Format➪Behavior.
The Behavior dialog box appears.
3. In the Selection drop-down box (in the lower-right corner) choose one
of the following options:
• Group Only: Prevents the selection of individual shapes in the
group.
• Group First: Selects the group with one mouse click and a group
component with a second mouse click. This is the default setting.
• Members First: Selects a group component with the first mouse
click and the entire group with a second mouse click.
4. Click OK.
Setting a shape’s double-click behavior
Another cool feature is the capability to set how a shape behaves when you
double-click it. By default, a shape’s text box opens when you double-click,
but a bunch of other choices are available. You can set a shape’s double-click
behavior to open a grouped shape, display a help screen, run a macro, jump
to another page in the drawing, or do nothing at all (like your kids when you
announce that it’s time for chores!).
Jumping to another page is a way to create a drill-down drawing. Suppose that
you’re diagramming a worldwide communications network. One page of the
drawing, called Corporate, shows a worldwide view of the network set on a
background of a world map. Network symbols appear on each continent.
Understandably, a diagram of this scope shows very little detail. But another
page of the drawing, called Europe, shows specific locations where network
hubs exist, specifically, London, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, and Paris (refer to
Figure 12-13).
286
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

The Europe page, however, still doesn’t show enough detail. So you create
individual pages for each city. In Figure 12-14, you use a city map of Paris as
your background (just to add interest) and lay out the network components
on top. (You do this on the page you create for each city.)
Now, the question is, how do you get from the high-level Europe map to the
detail? You could search through all the page tabs at the bottom of the screen,
but a better solution is to set a shape’s double-click behavior to link to a spe-
cific page. On the Europe page, the network shape for each city is set as the
link. (Refer to Chapter 9 for more information about working with pages in a
drawing.)
Use these steps to set a shape’s double-click behavior:
1. Open the drawing that contains the shape you want to change.
2. Right-click the shape and choose Format➪Behavior.
3. Click the Double-Click tab, as shown in Figure 12-15.
4. Choose one of the options listed:
• If you choose Run Macro, click the down-arrow and select a macro
from the list. (The topic of macros is beyond the scope of this book.)

Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

• If you choose Go to Page, click the down-arrow and select a draw-
ing page.
5. If you want, check the Open in New Window option.
6. Click OK.
To restore a shape to its default double-click behavior (editing text), use the
same steps and choose Edit Shape’s Text in Step 3, and then click OK.

Protecting Your Work
When you create drawings that you’re going to share with others, you want to
protect your work from unwitting destroyers. (Or maybe you need to protect
your shapes from yourself!) You can protect entire drawings, grouped shapes,
individual shapes, or selected aspects of a shape from being changed. The
following sections discuss the several methods available for helping you pro-
tect your work.
Preventing shapes from being changed
You use the Format➪Protection command to protect a shape from changes.
This command displays the Protection dialog box, which is shown in 
Figure 12-16. 
As you can see in Figure 12-16, you can lock several aspects of a shape to pre-
vent it from being changed:
 Width: Prevents anyone from changing the width of a shape or a grouped
shape.
 Height: Prevents anyone from changing the height of a shape or a
grouped shape.
 Aspect ratio: Prevents anyone from changing the ratio between a shape’s
width and height, such as 1:1.
 X position: Prevents anyone from moving the shape from its position on
the x-axis (horizontal). The shape can be moved up or down but not right
or left.
 Y position: Prevents anyone from moving the shape from its position on
the y-axis (vertical). The shape can be moved right or left but not up or
down.
 Rotation: Blocks anyone from rotating the shape or changing its center
of rotation.

 Begin point: Prevents anyone from changing the beginning point of a 1-D
shape.
 End point: Prevents anyone from changing the endpoint of a 1-D shape.
 Text: Prevents any changes to a shape’s or a grouped shape’s text box.
 Format: Blocks changes to any format characteristics.
 From selection: Makes a shape not selectable (To be effective, this selec-
tion requires an additional setting, described in the “Keeping drawings
secure” section later in this chapter.)
 From deletion: Protects the shape from being deleted.
To lock selected aspects of a shape using the Format➪Protection command,
follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing that contains the shape that you want to protect.
2. Select the shape or shapes that you want to protect.
You can apply protection to more than one shape at a time. To select
more than one shape, hold down the Shift key as you click each shape.
3. Choose Format➪Protection.
The Protection dialog box appears (refer to Figure 12-16).
4. Click each shape characteristic that you want to lock.
5. Click OK.
If you want the protection to apply to the shape every time you use it, add
the shape to a custom stencil and set the protection there. (See Chapter 11
for more information about creating custom stencils.)
If you use the preceding steps to protect a shape from selection, be aware that
the shape can still be selected unless you also protect all shapes using the
Drawing Explorer window. (It doesn’t make sense, but that’s how it works.)
This feature is described in a later section, “Protecting an entire drawing.”
Keeping drawings secure
You have several options for protecting drawings from change. The method
you choose depends on the results you want to achieve. All the methods
make a drawing readable by others but not changeable (to whatever degree
you define).

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Locking layers
Locking layers protects parts. If you want other users to be able to edit some
layers but not others, locking layers is a perfect solution. When a layer is
locked, shapes on that layer can’t be selected or changed. 
If a user knows how to unlock the layer, shapes on that layer can be changed.
For more secure protection, see “Saving files as read-only,” the next section in
this chapter.
To lock one or more layers of a drawing, do this:
1. Open the drawing whose layers you want to protect.
2. Right-click the toolbar area and choose View toolbar.
3. Click the Layer Properties button (it looks like a stack of pages) on the
View toolbar.
The Layer Properties dialog box appears.
4. In the dialog box, put a check mark in the Lock column for each layer
you want to lock. 
In Figure 12-17, for example, the Computer layer is locked.
5. Click OK.
When you go back to the drawing and try to select a shape that’s on a locked
layer, nothing happens. No, really. Nothing happens! (It can be quite maddening
if you don’t remember that you’ve locked the layer!)

Chapter 12: Managing Shape Information, Behavior, and Protection

Saving files as read-only
The highest level of protection for a drawing is to save it as a read-only file.
This protects every aspect of the file (except viewing, of course!) regardless
of any other protections that are set. Setting a file as read-only sends a clear
message to your viewers that you don’t want them making any changes!
To save a file as read-only, follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing that you want to save as a read-only file.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
3. Highlight the folder where you want to save your drawing.
4. In the File Name box, type a name for your drawing.
5. Click the down arrow next to the Save button (see Figure 12-18) and
choose the Read Only option.
If users do want to change the file, they can choose File➪Save As, save a
writable version of the file under a different name, and then work in that file.
Your original read-only file is still protected.
Protecting an entire drawing
If you don’t want to save a file as read-only, you have one more option. You
can set protection for certain aspects of the entire drawing using the Drawing
Explorer window. Use these steps:
Figure 12-18:
You can

3. Choose any or all of the options shown:
• Style: Prevents users from changing, creating, or deleting styles but
users can still apply styles.
• Shapes: Prevents the selection of shapes when shape protection is
set on individual shapes. (See the warning in the “Preventing
shapes from being changed” section, earlier in this chapter.)
• Preview: Prevents changes to a drawing’s preview image.
• Backgrounds: Prevents changes or deletion to background pages.

 Adding, viewing, incorporating, and deleting markup
 Marking a drawing with digital ink
 Changing digital ink to text or a shape
O
ccasionally you might create simple drawings that are perfect the first
time, but chances are this doesn’t happen very often! Other drawings
you might work on fifteen different times, filing them away while you ponder
them, and then coming back to them with fresh ideas or new information.
You might even print a copy, scribble some notes to yourself, circle some
areas, cross out others, and highlight changes.
Often you want input and opinions from others before your drawing is com-
plete. You might pass out rough drafts to several colleagues and ask them 
to mark up your drawing, and then incorporate those changes into the final
version.
This is the traditional way we edit documents. Word processors such as
Microsoft Word have long had the capability of letting you review and edit
online rather than the old-fashioned way. Now Visio provides that same capa-
bility for your drawings.
Editing, or annotating, online has several advantages. First, comments are
saved with the file without changing the original. Second, if your colleagues
are spread out across the country — or the world — making drawings available
electronically saves time and money. Third, electronic editing is orderly and
controlled. And fourth, incorporating changes is easy.

In this chapter you discover the techniques for marking up drawings for two
audiences: yourself and others. The markup tools you use are the same regard-
less of the audience.
Discovering Markup Tools
Markup is just another word for proposed changes to a drawing. The process
of suggesting changes is called marking up; the comments themselves are
markup. Visio provides two distinct tools for marking up a drawing:
 Comments
 Digital ink
Comments are exactly what you think they are: notes that you add to a drawing
that serve as a reminder, ask a question, suggest changes, or add information.
Comments appear in a drawing as distinct Visio shapes.
Digital ink is a tool used to mimic handwriting and hand drawing; maybe you
want to circle a shape or draw a new one; maybe you want to highlight a title
or a text label. If you use a drawing tablet on your computer or have a tablet
PC, you can use digital ink to scribble a handwritten note.
Comments and digital ink are bona fide markup tools A third element, track
markup, is technically not a tool but rather a feature that allows you to use
and review proposed changes that others make to a drawing.
Markup tracking is not required for any drawing. But when you choose to
track markup, comments and digital ink are displayed differently on the
screen. You see this in the examples provided throughout this chapter.
Adding Comments to a Drawing
You can add a comment anywhere in a drawing using one simple command.
The comment is saved in a tiny shape that you can place anywhere you like
in the drawing, and open and close when needed. That way, you don’t have to
worry about the comment cluttering your drawing.
Use these steps to add a comment:
1. Open the drawing to which you want to add a comment.
296
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

2. Choose Insert➪Comment.
A comment box appears on the screen, with your name and the current
date, as shown in Figure 13-1. At the upper-left corner of the comment
box is a small box with your initials and a comment number, such as
DKW1. The number is incremented with each comment you add.
3. Type the text for your comment, and then click anywhere outside the
comment box.
Visio closes the large comment box and leaves the small shape with your
initials in it on the screen.
4. Click and drag the comment box to move it to the location in the
drawing where it makes most sense; perhaps near a shape that the
comment refers to.
To read a comment, click the small comment shape and the box opens to dis-
play the text of the comment. To edit a comment, double-click the shape. A
slightly larger box opens to display the comment so you can edit it.

297
Chapter 13: Marking Up Drawings for Review

What isn’t visible in Figure 13-1 is the color in which the comment appears 
on the screen. When you type the comments for your own use (as opposed 
to tracking other people’s proposed changes to a drawing), the comment 
box is outlined in an olive-green color. When you are tracking other review-
ers’ changes, a specific color is assigned to each reviewer, and the comment
box appears in that color. The next section explains markup tracking in more
detail.
How Markup Tracking Works
If you anticipate having one or more people reviewing a drawing, you’ll want
to use the track markup feature in Visio. Using tracking, reviewers can add
comments or suggest changes, and each reviewer’s comments are distinct
from one another. Here’s how it works.
To use the track markup feature, the reviewer must first turn on this feature
before they begin reviewing. With tracking on, the reviewer can add comments;
add new shapes; change the formatting of new shapes; and draw figures or
handwritten notes using digital ink.
The reviewer’s proposed changes appear on an overlay on the original 
drawing — nothing in the original drawing is changed. (An overlay is similar
to a Visio layer, but overlays are not placed on separate layers in a drawing.
Think of overlays as on-screen layers only.) If several people review the same
drawing file, each reviewer’s input appears on a separate overlay.
Overlays are identified by colored tabs on the upper-right side of the drawing
window. In Figure 13-2 you can see the tabs (although the distinct colors are
impossible to see in grayscale). The Original tab appears in the lower right.
You can have each reviewer review a separate copy of the drawing or the orig-
inal. If reviewers review separate copies, each file will contain your original
drawing and one set of reviewer’s comments on an overlay. If all reviewers
review the same file (the original), each reviewer’s comments are assigned a
different color and appear as multiple overlays in the drawing file. You can
control whether you view all reviewers’ comments at once or only those of
selected reviewers, as you see later in this chapter.
Even if you, the creator of a drawing, are the only reviewer, you might still
want to track markup. Sometimes you’re not sure of the changes you want to
make right away; you might try out some changes and think about them for a
while without altering your original drawing. Markup keeps your original
drawing separate from your suggested changes until you incorporate them.
298
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

All changes that a reviewer proposes appear on the screen in the reviewer’s
assigned color, such as red. Even if the proposed changes include adding text,
a shape, or a background in a specific color, all changes appear in the assigned
color until you incorporate them into the drawing as permanent changes.

Chapter 13: Marking Up Drawings for Review
Tracking markup in a networked environment
If you work in a corporate environment, you are
almost certainly part of a network, whether you
access it from your office computer on site or
your computer at home. A corporate network
often includes file servers, where a single draw-
ing file can be stored and shared by many col-
leagues. In this environment, anyone who has
the proper network permissions can access and
review a drawing on the server. Ask your system
administrator if file directories are available for
you to use to share drawings with colleagues.
This is a great way to take advantage of Visio’s
tracking tools.

Working with Markup
Working with markup encompasses several activities, starting with displaying
the proper on-screen tools. From there you can expand your skills to include
adding, viewing, and deleting markup, as well as incorporating markup changes
into a drawing. I show you how to do all these things in this section.
Using the Reviewing toolbar 
and the task pane
When you use Visio’s tracking feature, I recommend that you display the
Reviewing toolbar so that all the tracking tools are close at hand. See Table
13-1. Some of the tools on the Reviewing toolbar appear in the Reviewing
pane as well, which you also need to display when tracking and reviewing
markup.

Adding markup to a drawing
It’s easy to add markup to a drawing; the hard part is remembering to turn
tracking on! If you forget, your changes are incorporated into the original
drawing (assuming you have permission to change the file).
You know immediately when tracking is turned on because you see a colored
border around the drawing area instead of the overlay tabs, which aren’t dis-
played when tracking is turned on. The Reviewing pane is automatically 
displayed on the right side of the screen and lists the current reviewer’s
name. In Figure 13-3, you can see the border around the drawing area and 
the Reviewing pane to the right of the drawing area. In the drawing, I added
shapes, I highlighted an area, and I added handwritten text.
Use these steps to add markup to a drawing:
1. Open the drawing you want to mark up.
2. Click the Track Markup button on the Reviewing toolbar or choose
Tools➪Track Markup.
The drawing window is lined in a color border. In the Reviewing pane
that appears on the right side of the screen, your name is listed as the
current reviewer (refer to Figure 13-3).
3. Make any of these editing changes:
• Use the Text tool on the Standard toolbar to add new text.
• Drag new shapes into the drawing area and format them as 
you want.
301
Chapter 13: Marking Up Drawings for Review

• Add a comment by clicking the Insert Comment tool on the
Reviewing toolbar or in the Reviewing pane, or choose Insert➪
Comment. Type your text in the comment box that pops up (see
“Adding Comments to a Drawing”).
• Track Markup doesn’t allow you to change or delete shapes in the
drawing, so if changing or deleting is your suggestion, add a com-
ment stating that.
4. Make any of the following suggestions using digital ink (refer to the
section “Using Digital Ink” later in this chapter):
• Circle or mark areas using ink pens
• Highlight areas using highlighters
• Hand-write notes or draw stick figures using digital ink.
5. When you’ve finished editing, save the file.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

If you are the creator of an original drawing and distribute it for review, but
then decide later to make changes to it yourself, you should also use track
markup. This makes your proposed changes to the original drawing, your
comments, and your questions visible to reviewers. If you don’t turn on Track
Markup, your changes alter the original drawing.
Viewing markup in a drawing
If you’re the originator of a drawing, it’s important to be able to view markup
from reviewers. But it’s important to reviewers as well, especially if multiple
reviewers are reviewing the same drawing. If you’re a reviewer, your markup
is viewable on the screen as you work because Visio creates your personal
overlay when you turn on tracking. If others have already reviewed the drawing
before you, their markup appears on overlays separate from yours.
Whether you are a reviewer or the originator of the drawing, you have the
choice of viewing or not viewing markup.
Tracking markup and viewing markup are two separate things. Tracking turns
on the feature of creating an overlay for a reviewer; viewing simply displays
overlays.
Use these steps to view markup:
1. Open the drawing file that you want to review.
2. Choose View➪Task Pane or click the Reviewing Pane tool on the
Reviewing toolbar to open the Reviewing task pane if it isn’t 
already open.
Reviewers comments appear in the Reviewing pane.
3. If you don’t see any markup listed in the Reviewing pane, click the
Show/Hide Markup button on the Reviewing toolbar.
Markup entries appear in the Reviewing pane and are identified by
reviewers’ initials and the specific color assigned to them.
4. Make sure tracking is off.
When tracking is off, the first line of text in the Reviewing pane is “Markup
Tracking is off” and you see overlay tabs with reviewers’ initials along
the right edge of the drawing page. The Original tab appears at the lower
right.
303
Chapter 13: Marking Up Drawings for Review

When tracking is on, the individual reviewers’ tabs disappear and a col-
ored border outlines the drawing area. To turn tracking off, click the Track
Markup button at the bottom of the Reviewing pane or in the Reviewing
toolbar. (The Track Markup button toggles tracking on or off each time
you click it.)
5. To choose the overlays that you want to display, go to the Show Markup
Overlays area of the Reviewing pane and do one of the following:
• To display all reviewers’ overlays (see Figure 13-4), click the Show
All button.
• To turn off the display of all overlays, click Hide All.
• To display reviewers comments selectively, click the check box next
to the names of reviewers’ whose overlays you want to display.
6. In the Markup: Page-# area of the Reviewing task pane, click an entry
to highlight the suggested change on the overlay.
All markup entries are grouped by reviewer (color-coded and preceded
by initials).

304
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

7. To move to the reviewer’s next suggestion, click the Next Markup
button in the Markup: Page-# area of the Reviewing task pane or on
the Reviewing toolbar.
After reviewing all markup, you might want to display only one reviewer’s
comments at a time when you get ready to incorporate changes.
Incorporating markup changes 
in a drawing
You might receive many types of suggested changes from reviewers: new or
changed text, new or changed shapes; comments; format changes; and more.
As the creator of the original drawing, you have control of which proposed
changes you incorporate into the drawing.
Many other programs, such as word processors, allow you to accept proposed
changes automatically, but Visio doesn’t, strangely enough. Even weirder, Visio
recommends that you not copy changes from an overlay into the drawing
because, in some cases, the results can be unexpected (I guess they leave it
to your imagination to figure out what that means!) I’ve tested copying changes
from an overlay and haven’t experienced any unexpected results, but then
again, I haven’t created every conceivable type of drawing, so . . .
Rather than copying changes, Visio suggests that you re-create the proposed
changes. This means drag in new shapes, if necessary, edit text or create text
boxes for new text, move or alter shapes as suggested, and apply new format-
ting as suggested.
To incorporate changes in a reviewed drawing, follow these steps:
1. Open the drawing file that you want to change.
2. Open the Reviewing task pane, if it isn’t open already.
Choose View➪Task Pane or click the Reviewing Pane tool on the
Reviewing toolbar.
3. If you don’t see any markup in the Reviewing pane, click the Show/Hide
Markup button on the Reviewing toolbar.
4. In the Show Markup Overlays area of the Reviewing pane, click to add
a check mark for each reviewers’ markup that you want to view.
You might choose to view only one at a time.
305
Chapter 13: Marking Up Drawings for Review

5. Make sure tracking is off.
If you don’t see “Markup Tracking is off” in the Reviewing pane, click the
Track Markup button on the Reviewing toolbar or at the bottom of the
Reviewing pane.
When Tracking is off, the Original tab is selected automatically. This 
is where you want to make changes to the drawing. If any other tab is
selected, click the Original tab before you begin making changes.
6. Use the following strategy for making proposed changes:
• For a new shape placed correctly by the reviewer, drag the new
shape into the drawing and drop it right on top of the reviewer’s
shape (or place it wherever you like).
• For minor changes to the text, edit the existing text boxes.
• For major changes to the text, create text boxes and format them
appropriately.
• For shapes that have special color or formatting suggested by the
reviewer, copy and paste the shape to the original so you can see
the formatting, and then create your own shape with the same for-
matting. (Or if you trust Visio to copy and paste the shape without
“unexpected results,” just use the pasted version.)
7. As you complete each change, delete the reviewer’s entry.
This step is optional but recommended. For details on how to delete an
entry, see the next section, “Deleting markup.”
8. When you’ve finished making changes, save your file.
Deleting markup
Eventually you’ll want to delete markup that’s been added to a drawing. One
strategy, as outlined in the preceding section, is to delete markup entries one-
by-one as you incorporate them into your drawing. However, if you prefer,
you can delete all markup entries for a specific reviewer.
To delete individual entries as you work, highlight the entry that you want to
delete in the list in the Reviewing pane. Then click the Delete Markup button
in the Reviewing pane or on the Reviewing toolbar, as shown in Figure 13-5.
306
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

You can also delete all markup for a specific reviewer or all markup for the
entire page. Use these steps:
1. In the Show Markup Overlays area of the Reviewing pane, click the
Show All button.
All reviewers are listed.
2. Click the down arrow next to the Delete Markup button on the
Reviewing toolbar, as shown in Figure 13-6.
Note: The down arrow does not appear on the Delete Markup button in
the Reviewing pane.

3. From the drop-down list, choose one of the following:
• Delete Markup: Deletes the currently selected markup entry
• Delete Markup Overlays on Current Page: Deletes all markups on
the current page or choose a reviewer’s name from the drop-down
menu and delete all of his or her markups on the current page
• Delete All Markup Overlays in Document: Deletes all markups on
every page of the drawing
Visio deletes the markup you selected.
Using Digital Ink
Another great markup tool — and a new feature in Visio 2003 — is called digital
ink. With the popularity of graphic tablets and tablet PCs, digital ink makes a
lot of sense. It lets you annotate a drawing the same way you would on paper.
You can circle items, scribble handwritten notes, draw stick figures, and more.
And the good news is, if you don’t have a graphics tablet or a tablet PC, you
can use digital ink with your mouse.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Selecting an ink tool
Visio provides several ink tools on the Ink toolbar (see Table 13-2). Two ball-
point pens, a felt-tip pen, and two highlighters should provide plenty of choices
for you to mark up a drawing. You also have an Eraser tool close at hand and
buttons for adjusting the ink color and line thickness.
To select an ink tool, just click it. The mouse pointer changes to a pen-shaped
pointer. The only difference between ballpoint and felt-tip is the point thick-
ness: 1 point for the two ballpoint pens and13⁄4 points for the felt-tipped 
pen. Highlighters draw at a thickness of 10 points, but they behave a little 
differently — like a real highlighter! They draw transparently, so whatever
shape or text you highlight shows through.
1 point is approximately 1⁄72 inch.
You can use any of the pen or highlighter tools as-is, or you can click the Ink
Color or Ink Thickness button to change these characteristics. Click the drop-
down arrow on the Ink Color button to display a color palette. The arrow next
to the Thickness button drops down a list of thicknesses.

Using ink tools
You can use the pens and highlighters from the Ink toolbar to mark up or point
out areas in a drawing, or you can use them to design a shape. If you just want
to circle something in a drawing, sketch an arrow to draw attention to an item,
highlight an area of the drawing, or hand-write a text message, you can use 
a pen or highlighter the same way you would if you were drawing on paper.
Figure 13-7 shows a drawing that has been marked up with handwritten com-
ments, added shapes, and highlighted areas.
Use these steps to add digital ink markings to a drawing:
1. Open the drawing that you want to annotate.
2. Right-click the toolbar area and choose Ink.
The Ink toolbar appears (refer to Figure 13-7).

3. Click one of the Ballpoint Pen buttons or the Felt-Tip Pen button on
the Ink toolbar.
4. Begin drawing or writing a comment.
The mouse pointer changes to a pen-shaped pointer.
Note: If you’re using a mouse rather than a pen on a tablet, hold the left
mouse button down as you draw or write. You can lift your pen as you
draw or write a comment, but you must do it very quickly!
If you want to fill a shape that you drew using digital ink, you must draw
it using only one line segment and be sure to close it by joining the end
to the beginning. (Zoom in on the drawing area so that you can see the
endpoints clearly.) If you use multiple line segments, Visio doesn’t recog-
nize it as a closed shape and therefore can’t fill it.
5. When you finish, lift your pen (or release the mouse button) and pause.
After a second or two, Visio draws a dotted blue outline with solid corners
around the text or shape that you drew. Everything within this border is
now considered a shape. (Even if you “drew” text, it’s considered a shape
right now.)
6. To stop using digital ink, click the Pointer Tool (or another tool).
To erase a text or a shape you drew, click the Eraser tool on the Ink toolbar.
The mouse pointer changes to an eraser shape. Move the eraser near the text
or shape that you want to delete, and it becomes highlighted. Click the mouse
button or, if you’re using a pen, tap the shape to delete it. The Eraser tool can
delete only the entire text or shape, not parts of it.
Changing digital ink shapes 
to geometry or text
You can convert any shape that you draw using digital ink to geometry. This
means it becomes an actual Visio shape, just as if you had drawn it using a
drawing tool. For example, the rug shape shown in Figure 13-8 was drawn
using a digital ink pen. (I suppose I could have drawn it using the freeform
drawing tool, but the freeform tool doesn’t behave the way the ink pen does.)
Why would you want to convert a digital ink shape to geometry? Because
unless you convert it, you can’t alter the shape itself or change its formatting,
such as line color and style, fill color, transparency, and shadow. (If you don’t
care about doing these things, converting a digital ink shape isn’t necessary.)
311
Chapter 13: Marking Up Drawings for Review

To convert a digital ink shape to geometry, use these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool on the Standard toolbar.
2. Right-click the digital ink shape you want to convert and choose
Convert Ink to Geometry.
Visio displays the shape’s selection handles, as shown in Figure 13-9.
Now you’re free to change the characteristics of the shape, such as its
line width, line color, fill color, and fill pattern.
Sometimes when you draw a closed shape and then convert it to geometry,
you end up with a 1-D shape instead of a 2-D shape. (This can occur if your
beginning point and endpoint don’t meet.) If you want the shape to be 2-D,
right-click it and choose Format➪Behavior. On the Behavior tab of the
Behavior dialog box, choose the Box (2-Dimensional) option and then click
OK. Visio converts the shape to a 2-D shape.
A very cool new feature of Visio 2003 is the ability to convert ink to text. If your
drawing contains hand-written comments that you created using a tablet PC,
you can convert them to text. (Tablet PCs allow you to draw and hand-write
text using a stylus.)

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

The convert ink to text feature works only for tablet PCs. (If the comment
wasn’t written on a tablet PC, the menu Convert Ink to Text option appears
dimmed, indicating that it’s unavailable.) If your drawing contains comments
that were created using an attached drawing tablet or the mouse, those com-
ments can’t be converted.
To convert comments created on a tablet PC to text, use these steps:
1. Click the Pointer Tool on the Standard toolbar.
2. Right-click the digital ink words that you want to convert to text and
choose Convert Ink to Text.
See Figure 13-10. (This command is available only on a tablet PC.) Visio
converts the handwritten words to text, as shown in Figure 13-11.
The conversion of handwriting to text is accurate, for the most part, but be
sure to check the spelling and punctuation of the converted text for errors. The
closer the handwriting looks to printing, the more accurate the conversion.

 Generating drawings from data stored in other files
 Incorporating Visio drawings or shapes into non-Visio files
 Linking, embedding, and exporting Visio drawings in other documents
 E-mailing drawings
 Saving drawings to use on the Internet
S
ometimes we can get away with using just one computer program to
create a document that stands alone. That’s okay for some projects, but
others — especially large, mostly text documents — are far more involved.
You know if you splash some color, charts, graphs, photos, or tables through-
out the document, you’re much more likely to keep the reader awake and
make your point more effectively.
Sharing data and objects is common with most programs, and Visio is no
exception. As a member of the Microsoft Office suite of products, Visio lets you
share diagrams and information; and that sharing works in both directions:
think of it as inbound and outbound. For instance, you can use Visio diagrams
in other documents (outbound), and you can insert data or images (inbound)
into Visio drawings. A sophisticated inbound feature of Visio is the capability
to use data from other programs to generate Visio diagrams. And, of course,
you also have the option of e-mailing Visio drawings to colleagues, or saving
drawings in a format that lets you use them as Web pages.
The moral of this story? No document is an island unto itself! Read on to find
out how to use these features.

Using Files from Other Programs in Visio
The most common way to share information from other programs in Visio is
to paste the information, insert the information, or open a file of another type.
You can paste objects from various sources, as you see later in this chapter
in the “Exporting and importing shapes and drawings” section.
Using commands on the Insert menu, Visio lets you insert the following:
 Picture (from a file, clip art, or a scanner, or a camera)
 Chart (a simple bar chart you create by entering data)
 Equation symbol
 WordArt
 CAD drawing
 Object
Most of these choices are obvious, except perhaps inserting an object. When
you choose the Insert➪Object command, a dialog box appears, displaying a
few dozen different objects (such as a media or video clip, a PowerPoint slide,
a Microsoft Address Book View, and an Excel worksheet). Simply select the
type of object you want, and insert an existing file, create one, or display an
icon for the object rather than the object itself.
If you prefer, you can open a file in Visio. Following are the file types you’re
allowed to open: 
 Drawing, Stencil, Template, Workspace (all Visio file types)
 Scalable Vector Graphics
 AutoCAD Drawing
 Compressed Enhanced Metafile
 Enhanced Metafile
 Graphics Interchange Format (.gif)
 JPEG File Interchange Format (.jpg)
 Portable Network Graphics
 Tagged Image File Format (.tif)
 Windows Bitmap (.bmp)
 Windows Metafile (.wmf)
These file types appear in the Files of Type box in the Open dialog box. When
you choose File➪Open and select a file of one of these listed types, the file is
pasted in the current Visio drawing.
316
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

The file opened by the File➪Open command replaces any existing shapes in
the drawing.
Generating Drawings from Data 
Stored in Non-Visio Files
Want to save yourself some work? If you have data stored in files you created
with other programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, a database, or
a simple text file, you can create drawings from your stored data. Why would
you want to do that? Check out these three good reasons:
 You can avoid re-entering data. Maybe you have a lot of data that exists
in another program, such as Excel. Do you want to take the time to re-
enter the entire database in Visio — just so you can create a drawing? If
the data already exists, you can save yourself a lot of time by saving the
file in a format that Visio can use to create a drawing for you.
 You can enter the data in the program in which you use it most. If your
data doesn’t already exist, sometimes it can be faster to enter the raw data
in another program — the program where you really need the data —
and have Visio do the work of creating a drawing for you.
 You can share drawings with other Visio users who may not have the
same applications that you use to store and compile data. Suppose that
you’re a project manager and rely on Microsoft Project to schedule and
track large projects. Your site managers, however, don’t have Project but
do have Visio. You can use Project to generate a daily or weekly Gantt
chart (which maps project tasks on a timeline) in Visio and then e-mail
them to your site managers. The managers don’t need to have Project or
know how to use it. All they need to do is open a Visio drawing.
Creating an organization chart from 
existing data
In a company of any significant size, the information in organization charts —
employee names, titles, and reporting managers — is almost surely stored
already in a Human Resources database. You don’t need to re-key this infor-
mation just to create an organization chart in Visio; you can use the data you
already have.
Obviously, maintaining employee privacy is an issue, but your company’s
Human Resources department might be willing to provide a subset of non-
confidential employee information for you to use.
317
Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs

Visio’s Organization Chart Wizard is a fantastic tool that makes all this possi-
ble. (A wizard is a set of scripted questions that you answer so Visio can do
the behind-the-scenes work for you.) The wizard looks for employee data in
one of several possible file formats:
 Microsoft Excel (.xls) format.
 Microsoft Outlook format.
 Tab-delimited file (.txt file extension). A tab-delimited file includes a tab
character between variables, such as first name, last name, and title.
 Comma-delimited text file (.csv file extension). A comma-delimited file
contains a comma character as the separator between variables. 
Figure 14-1 shows a text file that uses commas to separate variables.
 Org-Plus text file (.txt).
 ODBC-compliant database such as Microsoft Access.
Regardless of the file type, the data must be set up in a format that Visio can
work with. For example, the employee data file at a minimum must include
the following pieces of information (referred to as variables, or fields).
 A unique identifier for each employee, whether a name or an employee
number. An employee name can meet the requirement as a unique iden-
tifier if each name is unique.
 The unique ID of the person to whom the employee reports.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Notice in Figure 14-1 that the first row of data serves as the column headings
for the data fields: Unique_ID, Last_Name, First_Initial, Position, Reports_To,
and Department. The fields don’t have to appear in any particular order; the
wizard finds the data it needs based on the column headings. You also can
include more data fields in the organization chart, such as the employee’s
phone number or physical location.
To leave a field blank, enter a comma (with no spaces) between the two
commas used to separate entries. (In an Excel file, leave the cell blank.)
To create an organization chart from an existing data file, use these steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪Organization Chart➪Organization Chart Wizard.
Visio displays the first screen of the wizard. The option to create the
organization chart from information already stored in a file or database
is already selected for you.
2. Click the Next button to go to the second screen of the wizard (see
Figure 14-2).
3. Choose one of the following sources, and then click Next:
• A Microsoft Exchange Server directory
• A text, Org Plus (*.txt), or Microsoft Excel (.xls) file: This could be
any text file formatted like the one shown in Figure 14-1 and con-
taining a unique identifier for each employee and for the person to
whom the employee reports.
• An ODBC-compliant data source: An example is Microsoft Access.
Again, the file must contain a unique identifier for each employee
and for the person to whom the employee reports.
Figure 14-2:

tion chart.
319
Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs

4. Locate and select the file that contains the data (click the Browse button
if necessary), and then click Next.
5. Choose the fields from your data file that correspond to Name, Reports
to, and First name, and then click Next.
6. Choose the fields you want to include in the organization chart, and
then click Next.
7. Choose any fields that you want to add to the organization chart shapes
as custom property fields, and then click Next.
Custom properties contain data stored with a shape (for instance, an
employee’s telephone number, location, and hire date). For more infor-
mation about using custom properties, refer to Chapter 13.
8. On the last page of the wizard, choose how you want to fit information
onto the page, and then click Finish.
If your organization chart is likely to be larger than one page, you might
want to click the option that lets you specify how much data to display
on each page. Otherwise, let the wizard decide how to break the chart
across pages.
Visio creates the organization chart based on your data file, the fields that you
choose to include, and the format you specify. If the chart has some unex-
pected results, go back, check the format and content of your input file, and
then run the wizard again. Each time you run the wizard, it places the new
organization chart output on a new page in the same Visio drawing.
The Info button on most wizard screens is very helpful! If you ever need an
explanation of the information that the wizard is looking for, click this button
to get help.
A sample of an organization chart generated from data in a text (.txt) file is
shown in Figure 14-3. The raw data is there. Now you can add to, format, and
spice up the chart as you want. (Refer to Chapter 8 for more information.)
Sometimes when you use a wizard to create an organization chart, the boxes
are too small to hold all the text. You don’t want to reduce the font size and
make it unreadable, but you don’t want to resize each box manually, either!
Choose View➪Size & Position to display the Size and Position window. Then
select all the boxes you want to resize. (Make sure that you select only the
boxes that you want to be the same size.) In the Size and Position window, type
new dimensions for Width and Height, and then click anywhere outside the
selected shapes. Visio resizes all the selected boxes to the same dimensions.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Creating a Gantt chart by importing data
A Gantt chart is a specific type of diagram used for managing a project. A 
typical Gantt chart lists the tasks that you need to complete to accomplish 
a specific goal, the duration of each task, their dependent tasks, and the
resources (people and materials) required to complete each task. It can also
show scheduled dates for beginning and completion, as well as the progress
made to-date on each task.
If the project data that you want to use exists in a text (.txt) file, the fields must
be separated by a tab or a comma (see Figure 14-4). You can also use data from
Microsoft Excel (.xls format) or data from Microsoft Project (.mpp or .mpx
format), as described later in this chapter. Whatever the file type, the file that
contains the data is called the source file.
Figure 14-3:
Visio gen-
erates an

chart based

your text
(.txt) file.
321
Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs

For all file types, the data must include at least the following fields for each
project task:
 Unique task number or identifier: Any number or name that you give 
to a task to identify it uniquely.
 Task name: The name that you give to a task that’s part of a project.
 Duration: The time allowed to complete a task (for example, days,
days/hours, hours, weeks).
 Start date: The date when you want a task to begin.
 Finish date: The date when you want a task to be completed.
 Dependency (dependent task): The task that must be completed before
the current task can begin.
 Resource: The human resources or materials needed to complete a task.
 Outline level: Highest-level tasks are at outline level 1; subordinate tasks
(not dependent tasks) are at outline level 2, and so on.
Importing data from a text file
If you have a text file that contains the data outlined in the preceding section,
you can use it to create a Gantt chart using the Gantt Chart Wizard. The wizard
guides you through a series of steps and asks you questions about which file
to use (your text file is your source file), what information you want to include,
and how you want the information formatted.

Use these steps to start the wizard:
1. Choose File➪New➪Project Schedule➪Gantt Chart.
Visio creates a Gantt chart drawing and displays the Gantt Chart Options
dialog box. Notice also that the Gantt chart toolbar is displayed and that
the menu bar now contains a Gantt Chart menu (see Figure 14-5).
2. Select the options you want (that is, the number of tasks, the units, the
duration format, and the start and finish dates), and then click OK.
The options you choose here are not set in stone! You can change them
at any time. Pay attention to the format for task durations (for example:
Days/Hours). It must match the format used in your source file.
3. Choose Tools➪Import.
Visio displays the first screen of the Gantt Chart Wizard.
4. Click the Information That’s Already Stored in a File option, and then
click Next.
5. Choose Text File, and then click Next.
6. Continue following the steps throughout the wizard. When you get to

If by chance an error exists in your file, you get an error message like the one
shown in Figure 14-7. The error message tells you exactly which line in your
text file the wizard didn’t understand. Go back to your text file and check for
errors on the suggested line.
Importing data from Microsoft Excel
Maybe your project data is stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet rather
than in a text file. In that case, each task appears on a separate spreadsheet
row, but each piece of information, or field, appears in a separate column

is identical to the text data shown in Figure 14-4.
The same rules apply for Excel that apply to text files! Check that the content

6. Continue following the steps throughout the wizard. When you get to
the last screen, click Finish.
Visio creates the Gantt chart based on the data in your Excel spreadsheet.
If you get unexpected results, go back to your Excel file and check all
data and formats.
Importing data from Microsoft Project
You can also import data from a Microsoft Project file to create a Gantt chart
in Visio.
Wait a minute! Is there something wrong with this picture? Why would you
want to create a Gantt chart in Visio using data you import from Microsoft
Project when Project itself creates Gantt charts? 
The answer is simple. A colleague might send you (or you might have access
to) a Microsoft Project file, but you might not have the program to view the
file. In this case, use the same steps outlined previously for importing data
from a text or Excel file, but specify your Project file as the source file.
Creating data rather than importing
If your data doesn’t exist yet and you don’t have access to other project 
management software, you can enter the raw data right into the Gantt Chart
Wizard. The wizard creates a text (.txt) file or Excel (.xls) file template for you,
opens it, and includes sample data for all the required fields. A sample of an
Excel template created by the wizard is shown in Figure 14-9. Just replace the
sample data with your data.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪Project Schedule➪Gantt Chart.
Visio creates a Gantt Chart drawing and displays the Gantt Chart
Options dialog box. The Gantt chart toolbar is displayed and the menu
bar now contains a Gantt Chart menu.
2. Select the options you want (that is, the number of tasks, the units, the
duration format, and the start and finish dates), and then click OK.
3. Choose Tools➪Import.
Visio displays the first screen of the Gantt Chart Wizard.
4. Click the Information that I Enter Using the Wizard option, and then
click Next.
5. Enter the tasks options, duration options, time units, and timescale
range that apply to your project, and then click OK.

Creating a calendar by importing 
Outlook appointments
Since you can print a calendar from Microsoft Outlook directly, why would
you want to import Outlook data to a Visio calendar? Here are a few reasons:
 In Visio, you can reformat the calendar, changing its size, shape, coloring,
and special effects such as highlights, shadows, and imported clip art.
(You can’t do all this in Outlook.)
 You can print and distribute the reformatted calendar
 You can publish the calendar on the Web

Incorporating Visio Shapes and Drawings
in Non-Visio Documents
The object linking and embedding (OLE) feature of Microsoft Windows makes
it possible to share many types of data and graphic images between Windows-
compatible applications. A Visio drawing or selected Visio shapes can be
linked to a document or embedded in a document, as long as the program that
produces the document supports OLE. (Most Windows programs support
OLE.) Linking and embedding produce the same results visually, but they’re
different behind the scenes, as you find out in this section.
When a program doesn’t support OLE, you can export Visio drawings or shapes
to non-Visio documents. This section describes these three methods for shar-
ing data and images between programs. Table 14-1 summarizes the differences
between the linking, embedding, and exporting methods.
Linking shapes and drawings
Linking creates a special connection between two files: the source file (where
the data is created and displayed) and the destination file (where the data is
displayed only). When you link data to a destination file, the original data stays
in the source file where you created it. When you open the destination file,
you see a representation of the data, like a snapshot, but it isn’t really part of
the file.
Scratching your head? Think of it like this: Suppose you link a Visio drawing
(the source file) to an Excel spreadsheet (the destination file). When you open
your Excel spreadsheet, you see the Visio drawing displayed right before your
eyes — like magic! But like the magician’s sawed-in-half assistant, it isn’t really
there. It’s as if Excel opens up a door in the spreadsheet and moves your draw-
ing right into the doorway. You see the drawing, but it isn’t part of your Excel
file. You still have only one drawing, and it’s located in Visio.
329
Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs
Sending drawings to Outlook
Microsoft Outlook uses the Microsoft Exchange
Server format for storing files. If you want to
store a drawing in an Outlook folder, you can.
Open the Visio drawing and choose File➪Send
To➪Exchange Folder. Choose the folder that
you want and then click OK. Your drawing is
stored as an embedded object in the Outlook
folder you chose (such as Drafts). You can open
the drawing in Outlook, and then send it to
someone using File➪Send To.

Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

Why would you care about the behind-the-scenes workings of linking? The fact
that the Visio drawing isn’t part of your non-Visio file keeps the file size down.
One more thing — and this is a biggie: If you update the drawing in Visio, the
drawing is automatically updated in the non-Visio document too. The next time
you open your non-Visio file, the Visio drawing or shapes are automatically
updated as soon as you open the file. You don’t have to worry about keeping
track of which version is where or which version is most current.
You might not care whether the original Visio drawing is identical to the Visio
object in the non-Visio file. But you can still edit the drawing in the non-Visio
file if you need to using in-place editing. With this slick feature, you double-click
the drawing in the non-Visio program. Visio opens a mini-Visio window and
displays Visio menus and toolbars so you can edit the drawing or shape right
where you are. When you finish updating the drawing, save it and then click
anywhere outside the image. The non-Visio application’s toolbars and menus
are redisplayed and you can keep working without ever having to start Visio.
(Remember that the original drawing is untouched.)
All of these reasons make linking a good option to choose when you want to
use a drawing in several different non-Visio files and keep it updated in all its
locations. To link data from a Visio drawing to another file, follow these steps:
1. In Visio, open the drawing that you want to link to another file.
Note that the file must be saved before it can be linked.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy Drawing.
3. Open the document in the non-Visio program where you want to link
the Visio drawing.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste Special.
Some programs may use a different command for linking files. If this
command is not on your menu, check the online help or user documen-
tation for the program that you’re using.
5. In the Paste Special dialog box, select Microsoft Visio Drawing Object
from the list box (see Figure 14-11).
6. On the left side of the box, click the Paste Link button, and then 
click OK.
The drawing or shapes that you linked are now displayed in the non-Visio
program’s document.
331
Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs

Embedding shapes in drawings
You’ve probably been embedding objects for years without even knowing it —
every time you cut and paste (or copy and paste) from one program to
another, you’re embedding objects.
Embedding is different from linking because the data you embed becomes
part of the destination file (which automatically increases the size of the des-
tination file). Once embedded, if you change, or update, the data in the destina-
tion file, the data in the source file is not automatically updated. Likewise, if
you change the data in the source file, the data in the destination file remains
unchanged. Embedding keeps the two files separate.
Just like with linking, when you embed a Visio drawing or shape into a non-
Visio file, you have in-place editing capability. Double-click the Visio object in
the non-Visio file. The Visio object appears inside a mini Visio window, and the
Visio menus and toolbars are displayed. Edit the object, and then click any-
where outside the object to return to your non-Visio file. The original Visio
file remains unchanged. To save the embedded Visio object, save the non-
Visio file.
Embedding is a good option when you want the data to be part of your desti-
nation file, when you’re pretty sure the data won’t be updated (or, if it is, you
don’t care whether the original is updated), when there’s a possibility that you
won’t be storing the source file on your computer, and when increased file size
is not an issue.

To embed a Visio shape or an entire drawing in a non-Visio file, use these steps:
1. Open the document in the program where you want to link the Visio
shape or drawing.
2. Open the Visio drawing that you want to use.
3. In your Visio drawing, select the shape or shapes that you want to
paste in the non-Visio document.
To use the entire drawing, choose Edit➪Select All.
4. To copy the shape(s) from Visio, choose Edit➪Copy or click the Copy
button on the Standard toolbar.
5. Switch to the other program and click in the document where you
want to paste the shape or shapes.
6. Choose Edit➪Paste, or click the Paste button on the Standard toolbar.
The shape or shapes are pasted into the non-Visio document.
As mentioned, this method makes no connection between the two files. These
steps are similar to dropping a clip art image into a document. No association
or connection between the two files or the data in each file is formed. If you
need a connection between the two, use linking, described in the preceding
section.
Exporting and importing shapes 
and drawings
Some computer programs are not OLE compatible; in other words, they don’t
support Edit➪Copy and Edit➪Paste or Edit➪Paste Special. When you want to
use a Visio shape or drawing in a program that doesn’t support OLE, you can
export the file. Exporting converts the data in a Visio file to a non-Visio file
format — one that you choose. In the non-Visio program, you then import the
file as a picture.
Table 14-2 lists all the file types that you can use to export a Visio drawing. The
file type that you choose for exporting depends on two things: the program
that you want to use the drawing in and how you’re going to use the drawing.
For example, if you just want to insert the drawing in another file as a picture,
use a common graphics format, such as *.bmp, .tif, or .gif. If you want to use
the drawing in an AutoCAD file, choose the AutoCAD drawing or AutoCAD
Interchange format.

To export a Visio drawing (or selected shapes from a drawing), follow these
steps:
1. Start Visio and open the drawing that you want to export.
If you want to export a few shapes rather than the entire drawing, hold
down the Shift key as you click the shapes that you want to export.
2. Choose File➪Save As to display the Save As dialog box.
3. In the Save In drop-down menu, select the folder where you want to
save the drawing.
4. In the File Name box, type a name for the file.
5. In the Save As Type drop-down menu, choose a file format.
Refer to Table 14-2 and Figure 14-12.
6. Click the Save button.
334
Part IV: Advancing Your Knowledge of Visio 

In the non-Visio program, use the program’s Import command to bring the
Visio drawing into the document.
Sending drawings through e-mail
If you use electronic mail and want to e-mail drawings to other Visio users, you
can do so as long as your e-mail program supports the Messaging Application
Program Interface (MAPI) protocol. (Check with your network administrator
to see whether your program supports the MAPI protocol.) To view the Visio
drawing, the message recipient must have Visio or the Visio Viewer running
on his or her computer, as mentioned later in this chapter.
To e-mail a drawing to another Visio user, use these steps:
1. Start Visio and open the drawing that you want to send through e-mail.
2. Choose File➪Send To➪Mail Recipient (as Attachment).
Visio displays an e-mail message window for you. The file name is inserted
in the Subject line and appears in the Attach box.
3. Enter the recipient’s e-mail address in the To box.
4. If you want to include a message, type it in the message area.
5. Click the Send button.

Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs

If you’re running Microsoft Office 2000 or later, you can use the Office features
that let you route an e-mail message to more than one user (for instance, so
that all users in your group can review a Visio drawing). To add a routing slip
to an e-mail message, follow these steps:
1. Open Visio and the drawing that you want to send.
2. Choose File➪Send To➪Routing Recipient.
The Routing Slip dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-13.
3. Click the Address button.
The Address Book dialog box appears.
4. Select the recipients in the Address Book, and then click OK.
Visio returns to the Routing Recipient dialog box.
5. To route the drawing in a specific order, click a name in the list and
then click the Move arrow (either up or down) to reorder the names.
Do this for all names until they are in the order that you want.
6. If you reordered the routing (in Step 5), click the One After Another
option in the Route to Recipients box. Otherwise, click the All at Once
option.
7. Choose Return When Done to have the drawing sent back to you after
everyone views it, or choose Track Status to receive an update after
each person on the list views the drawing.
8. To add a message to the e-mail, type the text in the Message Text box.
9. Click OK.
10. Choose File➪Send To➪Next Routing Recipient to send the message.

Using Visio Viewer to Share 
Visio Drawings
Even if some of your colleagues don’t have Visio, you can still send them a
Visio drawing. To view the drawing, they must download and install Visio
Viewer from the Microsoft Download Center:
http://office.microsoft.com/downloads
When you open a drawing using Visio Viewer, the drawing is displayed in a
Microsoft Internet Explorer (Version 5.0 or later) window. Note that you can
view a drawing created in Visio 2003 only with Visio Viewer 2003. However,
you can view drawings created in earlier versions of Visio (Version 5.0, 2000,
and 2002) using Visio Viewer 2002, also downloadable from Microsoft’s down-
load center. 
At the time of this writing, Visio Viewer 2003 isn’t yet available. Please continue
to check the Microsoft Web site periodically for updates.
Saving Visio Drawings for the Web
The Internet contains so much information — and graphics are a huge part of
that. Gone are the days of waiting ten minutes for a picture to download. High-
speed access makes your Visio drawings download almost as fast as a puny
text file!
Many software companies are making it easier than ever to save files specifi-
cally for publishing to the Web, and Microsoft is no exception. The File menu
in Visio now contains a Save As Web Page command, which automatically
saves your drawing in .html (Hypertext Markup Language) format. You can
save new Visio drawings directly to this format, or save existing Visio draw-
ings in Visio format as well as .html. Your drawings will look as cool on your
Web page as they do in Visio.
Use these steps to save a drawing as a Web page:
1. Start Visio and create or open the file that you want to save.
2. Choose File➪Save As Web Page.
You might need to click the down arrow at the bottom of the file menu to
display this command. The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 14-14.
337
Chapter 14: Using Visio with Other Programs

3. In the Save In box, choose the folder in which you want to save the file.
4. In the File Name box, type a name for the file.
5. If you want to change the name that appears in the title bar in the
Web browser when the page is displayed:
a. Click the Change Title button.
b. Type a name in the Set Page Title dialog box.
c. Click OK.
Visio returns to the Save As dialog box.
6. In the Save As Type box, choose Web Page, if it’s not already chosen
for you.
7. Click the Save button. (To save the file as Read Only, click the down
arrow next to the Save button and select Read Only.)
Visio saves the file and displays it in a Microsoft Internet Explorer
window.
8. To close the file, click the X in the upper-right corner, or choose
File➪Close.
The file is now ready to be published to a Web site. Use whatever procedures
you normally do to upload the file.

t doesn’t matter how long you’ve used a program, questions always pop
up about doing some of the most common or practical tasks. Often our
questions may seem trivial, but the answers might save you a great deal of
time and make you more productive. I hope this chapter answers some of
your questions about Visio.
Can I work with other file types in Visio?
Yes, you can work with other file types in Visio. You can paste, insert, or open
files, shapes, charts, text, spreadsheets, data, pictures, images, or other
objects from a few dozen file types and programs. In general, the objects
become shapes in Visio. The extent to which you can alter them varies
depending on the type of object. Refer to Chapter 14 for more information.

Can I save a Visio drawing in a
non-Visio file format?
Yes, you can save a Visio drawing in a non-Visio file format. Choose File➪
Save As to display the Save As dialog box. In the Save As Type box, you’ll find
nearly two dozen file formats. Refer to Chapter 14 for a list of file types and
specific steps for saving Visio drawings in different formats.
Can I copy a shape from one stencil 
to another?
Yes, you can copy a shape from one stencil to another, as long as the stencil
you’re copying to is a custom stencil, that is, one that you create. Custom
stencils that you create are editable. They are the only stencils to which you
can add (or delete) shapes. (You can’t edit Visio master stencils.)
Want another bonus? You can change Visio shapes and save your changes on
a custom stencil. Refer to Chapter 11 for specific steps on creating and editing
custom stencils.
How do I change the number of recently
opened files listed on the File menu?
To change the number of recently opened files listed on the File menu, choose
Tools➪Options. Click the General tab on the Options dialog box. In the General
Options area, click the arrow for the Recently Used Files List. (The default
setting is 4.) Note that changing this number also changes the number of files
listed in the Open area of the task pane.
How do I get a summary of all the shapes,
pages, and layers in a drawing?
To get a summary of all the shapes, pages, and layers in a drawing, choose
View➪Drawing Explorer Window. Visio displays all elements of the current
drawing — pages, shapes, layers, styles, masters, fill and line patterns — in a
hierarchical tree structure. The drawing name appears at the top. If a folder
shape is preceded by a plus symbol (+), the folder contains more information.
Just click the + to display that information.
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Can I customize my drawing environment?
Yes, you can customize many aspects of your drawing environment. For exam-
ple, you can hide rulers and grid lines by removing the check mark from these
options on the View menu. You can set the page size, orientation, and drawing
scale by choosing File➪Page Setup. You can maximize the drawing space by
closing the task pane on the right side of the screen (just click the X in the
upper-right corner). And you can change the display style for stencils to con-
serve screen space by right-clicking the stencil title bar and choosing View.
How do I print gridlines in a drawing?
To print gridlines in a drawing, choose File➪Page Setup, then go to the Print
Setup tab. In the Print area, check the Gridlines box, and then click OK. This
setting applies to the current drawing only but remains in effect until you
change it. To prevent gridlines from printing, go back to File➪Page Setup and
remove the check mark from the Gridlines box on the Print Setup tab.
Can I use Undo more than once?
Yes, you can use Undo more than once. The default Undo Level is set to 20, so
you can undo up to the last twenty actions you took. To set the Undo Level 
to a number other than 20, choose Tools➪Options and go to the General tab.
Change the number in the Undo Levels box and then click OK. (Hey, you can
go wild here; set up to 99 if you want!)
To undo multiple past actions at once, click the down arrow next to the Undo
button on the Standard toolbar and then scroll to the last action you want to
undo. Visio reverses the action you select and all other actions taken since.
You can’t undo past actions selectively.
How do I find out how many shapes 
are on a layer?
To find out how many shapes are on a layer, first make sure that the drawing
is open. Then click the Layer Properties button on the View toolbar, or choose
View➪Layer Properties. In the Layer Properties dialog box, click the # column
heading. Visio displays the number of shapes on each layer. (Note that this
doesn’t provide an accurate count of the entire number of shapes in a drawing
because some shapes may be assigned to multiple layers.)
343
Chapter 15: Answers to Ten Frequently Asked Questions about Visio

If your drawing doesn’t use layers and you still want a shape count, choose
View➪Drawing Explorer Window. Click the folder for the page you want, and
then click the Shapes folder. Drawing Explorer lists all the shapes on the cur-
rent page. (Here’s a little bonus: If you click a shape name in the list, Visio
selects the shape in the drawing window.)
How do I not print a layer?
To not print a particular layer, first make sure that the drawing is open. Then
click the Layer Properties button on the View toolbar, or choose View➪Layer
Properties. In the Layer Properties dialog box, find the layer you don’t want
to print, and click to clear the check mark in the Print column. The next time
you print the drawing, this layer is not printed. To restore printing of this layer,
click to add the check mark back to the Print column.

Ten Common Tasks in Visio
In This Chapter
 Rotating shapes to a specific angle
 Centering a drawing before printing
 Resizing a page to fit the content of a drawing
 Creating a drawing that spans several pages
 Saving a company logo as a stencil shape

 Unlocking a shape
 Copying formatting from one shape to another
L
et’s face it, as you work with any software program, you need to perform
plenty of mundane tasks that just don’t seem to fit easily in the table 
of contents or index of the user’s manual or don’t pop up automatically in
online help files when you search. You know that the answer has to be there
somewhere — if you could just find it! This chapter covers ten of those tasks
that you might find yourself wondering about as you work with Visio.
Rotating shapes to a specific angle
Sometimes you want to rotate a shape to a specific angle, such as 45 degrees.
The quickest way to do this is to select the shape, grab the shape’s rotation
handle, and start rotating the shape right or left. Watch the status bar, which
displays the exact angle as you rotate the shape. Rotating counterclockwise
produces a positive number; rotating clockwise produces a negative number.

If you prefer to type a specific angle, you can choose View➪Size & Position
Window. Select the object you want to rotate. In the Angle box of the Size and
Position window, enter the angle. To rotate the shape in a counterclockwise
direction, use a positive number. To rotate the shape clockwise, enter a nega-
tive number.
Centering a drawing before printing
Centering a drawing before you print it is a simple option that you might miss
if you don’t happen to be looking at the Shape menu. Whether shapes in the
drawing are selected or not, choose Shapes➪Center Drawing. Visio repositions
all the shapes on the page so that they are centered in relation to the page
borders. 
However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that all the shapes are on the page. If
your drawing is too large for the page, you can rearrange or resize shapes,
change your page size or orientation (choose File➪Page Setup and then click
the Page Setup tab), or scale the drawing (choose File➪Page Setup and then
click the Drawing Scale tab). For information about working with page size,
orientation, and scale, refer to Chapter 3.
Resizing a page to fit the content 
of a drawing
If you can’t or don’t want to move, adjust, rearrange, or resize shapes in a
drawing to fit on standard-size paper, you can always adjust the page size to
fit the content of the drawing. (You can print an odd-sized drawing on multi-
ple pages or by using a large-scale printer or plotter. See the next section.)
With the drawing displayed, choose File➪Page Setup. On the Page Size tab,
click the Size to Fit Drawing Contents button, and then click OK. Visio auto-
matically resizes your drawing page.
If you prefer to adjust the drawing page manually, just point your mouse to
any edge of the paper near a corner, and then press and hold the Ctrl key. The
mouse pointer changes to a double-headed diagonal arrow, which you can
drag to resize. (Don’t point directly at the corner. If you do, you get a rotation
handle, which lets you rotate rather than resize the page.) Release the Ctrl
key and mouse button when the page is the size you want it.
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Creating a drawing that spans 
several pages
This tip and the preceding one are related. If you want to create a large drawing
to print on oversized paper or tiled across several pages, you can set up the
drawing in two ways. If you know the paper size, define it up front: choose
File➪Page Setup, select the Print Setup tab, and set the paper size. 
If you’re not sure how large the drawing will be, just start creating the drawing
and let it evolve. When you think you have the drawing the way you want it,
use one of the methods in the preceding tip to size the page to fit the drawing
contents. Then choose File➪Page Setup and click the Print Setup tab. Check
the preview; it shows you how your drawing size compares to your paper size.
Adjust the paper size as necessary
Saving a company logo as a stencil shape
To save a company logo as a stencil shape, bring your company logo into the
current Visio drawing. To do so, you can choose Insert➪Picture➪From File, or
you can choose File➪Open, or you can copy the logo in a different program
and then choose Edit➪Paste in Visio.
Create a stencil by choosing File➪Shapes➪New Stencil, or open an existing
custom stencil. Drag the logo that you placed in the drawing onto the stencil.
Right-click the shape in the stencil, choose Rename Master, and then type a
new name. To make the logo available in any drawing, open the custom stencil
whenever you open or create a new drawing. For more information on creating
custom stencils, refer to Chapter 11.
Creating and adding a background 
design to a drawing
You can create a custom background from clipart, photos, or other types of
drawings. Paste or insert the object, size it to fit the page, drag it onto a custom
stencil to save it, and then give it a name that indicates it is a background
shape. (See Chapter 11 for help creating custom stencils.) Backgrounds are
usually set to be semitransparent so that they don’t overpower your drawing.
See the next tip to find out how to adjust transparency.
347
Chapter 16: Ten Common Tasks in Visio

Adding a Visio-created background to a drawing is a simple matter of dragging
a shape into the drawing. Choose File➪Shapes➪Visio Extras➪Backgrounds to
open the Backgrounds stencil. Drag a shape onto the drawing. Don’t worry
about the shape fitting the page; Visio fits the background shape to the page
size automatically. 
Look at the page tabs at the bottom of the drawing window, and you’ll see that
the background shape is automatically placed on a new background page. If
your drawing had only one page, Visio automatically assigns the background
to the only foreground page. Check out Chapter 9 to find out more about using
background pages.
Adjusting the transparency of shapes 
and text in a drawing
The absolute quickest way to adjust transparency is to select the shape or text,
and then click the Transparency button on the Format Shape toolbar. Select 
a percentage setting from the drop-down list, or click More Transparency
Levels to display a dialog box where you can use a slider to select a specific
percentage.
An alternative to this method is to right-click the shape or text and choose
Format➪Fill or Format➪Text to display a dialog box where you can adjust
transparency.
Adding the same shape or image to 
all pages in a drawing
When you want to add a shape or an image to all the pages in a drawing, please
don’t try pasting the shape onto every page! Add the shape to a background
page instead. Then choose File➪Page Setup, click the Page Properties tab, and
assign the background to each foreground page individually.
Note: If you’re creating a drawing, create your background page first and com-
plete it, and then start inserting foreground pages. In the Page Setup/Page
Properties dialog box, the name for the background page pops up automati-
cally as the suggested background, saving you the step of having to assign
the background individually to each foreground page. Refer to Chapter 9 for
more information about working with pages and backgrounds.
348
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Unlocking a shape
A shape that displays gray handles when you select it is locked. Some Visio
grouped shapes are made up of many components and are purposely locked
so that you don’t tamper with them! The entire group or just a component of
the group might be locked.
To unlock a shape or a component of a grouped shape, right-click it and choose
Format➪Protection. The Protection dialog box that appears indicates by a
check mark all aspects of the shape that are locked. You can unlock aspects
individually (such as Width or Rotation) by clicking them to remove the
check mark. To unlock all aspects (that is, to protect no aspects), click the
None button.
Note that some shapes that appear to be locked (because their selection han-
dles are gray) are not locked in every aspect. For instance, you might be able
to add text but not be able to rotate the shape. Only the Protection dialog box
tells you for sure which aspects are locked.
Copying formatting from one shape 
to another
If you missed the description of how to copy formatting from one shape to
another in Chapter 8, pay close attention now, because this is a terrific time-
saving tool! Select the shape or text whose formatting you want to copy, and
then click the Format Painter button on the Standard toolbar. Your mouse
pointer changes to a paint brush. Point to the shape you want to apply the
format to and click. Visio copies the format to the shape instantly.
Format Painter works for shape formatting (such as color, shadow, and trans-
parency) as well as text formatting (font, size, style, text color, and so on.)
But be aware that it works only once for each shape you apply it to. (It’s not
like the Paste button, which you can use to paste something again and again
and again.) If you want to “paint” formatting to another shape, you have to
click the Format Painter button again to pick up the formatting, and then click
the shape you’re applying it to.

I
t’s always nice to have a few tips for working successfully with a program.
Some of the tips in this chapter come from Visio’s top trainers. Others are
just practical ideas that make you more productive once you make them a
habit. 
Use keyboard shortcuts
You can significantly speed up your work if you take the time to memorize
some of the Visio keyboard shortcuts for menu commands. If a command has
a shortcut, it’s listed to the right of the command name in the menu. Other
keyboard shortcuts aren’t listed anywhere; you just pick them up as you go.
See the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book for a list of valuable keyboard
shortcuts.

Work from existing drawings 
when you can
You can usually save yourself a lot of work by working from an existing drawing
rather than starting a new one from scratch. If the drawing you need to create
is similar to another one, load the similar drawing, and then choose File➪
Save As to save a copy of the existing drawing under a different file name. Now
you can edit the new copy, changing shapes and text where necessary. Think
of the time you’ll save, now that you don’t have to fool around with templates,
opening additional stencils, reformatting, and more.
Fool around with snap and glue
Snap and glue are two of Visio’s most powerful features. They make creating
drawings a lot easier, but they can be confusing at first because you have so
many choices. Dynamic or static? Snap and glue to what? Connection points?
Handles? Grid? Guides? All or none? Set snap and glue strength? Enough,
already!
The best way to figure out snap and glue is to play with them. Create a drawing
you don’t care anything about and go wild! Try every combination of snap and
glue options that you can think of. Drag in some shapes. Move them around.
Reset the snap and glue strength. Turn off some of the snap and glue options.
Move the shapes around again. Turn off all the options. Now move the shapes
around again. Play around with snap and glue to see what happens. The more
you experiment, the more comfortable you’ll feel.
Group your shapes
The more adept you become at creating shapes, the more you realize that a
good shape is often a combination of many shapes. When you spend a lot of
time creating various components, you don’t want to lose any of the pieces
when you start dragging and copying them. The best way to avoid losing
pieces is to group them.
Remember that you can group groups, too. Suppose you’re drawing a personal
computer. You might want to group the keyboard shapes, the system unit
shapes, and the monitor shapes separately, but then select all three and group
them together as the final shape. That way, you can select one component,
such as the keyboard, and move it without ungrouping the entire shape. Refer
to Chapter 8 for details on grouping shapes.
352
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Use guides to position and move shapes
A guide is sort of like a Visio clothesline — or maybe shapeline is more appro-
priate! Use a guide when you want to hang shapes from the same line — 
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. In addition to positioning and aligning shapes,
you can use a guide to move shapes. Just drag the guide, and all the attached
shapes move along with it. To review guide use, see Chapter 7.
Work with drawing layers
Drawing layers are one of the most useful features in Visio because they help
you organize your work, particularly complex, detailed drawings. For certain
drawing types, Visio gives you a head start here by placing shapes on layers
automatically. 
You have many options when working with layers. You can place a shape on
more than one layer (often a shape might apply to more than one category of
shapes). You can display and print layers selectively. And you can lock entire
layers to protect shapes from change. See Chapter 10 for details on creating
and using layers.
Quickly edit the text in a drawing
When you work with a text document, you probably run spell-check automat-
ically before you print or distribute the document. When you work with a
drawing, it’s just as important to do the same! Choose Edit➪Select All to
select all shapes on the current page, and then press F7 or choose Tools➪
Spelling to quickly run the spell checker. This checks the spelling of all the
text on the page, including stand-alone text (such as titles) and text used to
label shapes. Choose Edit➪Find to find text on the current page. To search
for and replace text on the page, choose Edit➪Replace. Note that you need 
to check each page of a drawing separately.
Use your pasteboard
“Pasteboard? What’s that?” you ask. You may not have noticed the blue area
surrounding a drawing page. (In fact, you don’t see the pasteboard if you zoom
in on the drawing page.) When the pasteboard is visible, you can drag shapes
onto it and use it as a holding area for shapes that you’re not ready for yet.
353
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Working Successfully with Visio

The pasteboard is a great place to store shapes when you’re opening a lot 
of stencils. You can drag the shapes onto the pasteboard and then close the
stencils that you’re not using anymore. The shapes are stored with the draw-
ing, but they aren’t printed. When you’re ready to use the shapes, just drag
them into the drawing area. If you think you’ll use a shape more than once,
hold the Ctrl key as you drag to copy rather than move the shape into the
drawing.
Find your drawings quickly in 
Windows Explorer
If you have a lot of Visio drawings, you might not recall exactly what’s in them
by looking at the file name. To identify — and open — a drawing quickly, use
the visual method in Windows Explorer.
In Windows Explorer, go to the directory where your Visio file is located. Click
the Views icon on the Windows Explorer toolbar and choose the Thumbnails
option. Visio displays a thumbnail-sized picture of your file so you can visually
review the contents. To open the file, double-click it. This quick method 
doesn’t even require that Visio be running first; Windows Explorer will start 
it for you!
Print a drawing without opening it
You can use Windows Explorer also to print a file quickly. In the Windows
Explorer window, find the file you want to open. On the Start menu, click
Printers and Faxes to open the Printers and Faxes window, which displays all
printers available to your computer. Arrange these two windows so you can
see the printer icon you want to use and the Visio file you want to print. Now,
back in the Windows Explorer window, drag the Visio file icon onto the printer
icon in the Printers and Faxes window. Windows Explorer opens your file and
Visio and prints it automatically.

A
s you might expect, this chapter starts out with a great big fat disclaimer!
Web sites change, as do people, companies, places, and products. I can
make no guarantees as to the reliability, authenticity, integrity, or any other ity
of non-Microsoft sources. At the time of this writing, however, all resources
listed in this chapter were reliable.
Help from Microsoft
Microsoft provides a wealth of useful online information — almost too much!
The potential problem with all this information is that it’s often difficult to
find what you want. Use the sites in this section as a launchpad to further
information on Visio.
Microsoft Office’s Online home page is a great place to start. Click the Visio
link to find tips, articles, updates, downloads, and more:
http://office.microsoft.com/home/
Go to the following for Visio updates (click the Visio links):
http://office.microsoft.com/officeupdate/default.aspx

For online training and tutorials in Visio, go to the following address. Most of
what’s provided is helpful but the topics are limited:
http://office.microsoft.com/training/default.aspx
At Microsoft’s Assistance Center page for Visio, you can find a variety of infor-
mation on working with Visio. Much of this information is duplicated in the
Visio Help files:
http://office.microsoft.com/assistance/topcategory.aspx
Following is another launchpad site for finding newsgroups, community Web
sites, technical chats, and user’s groups. Look for resources here that suit your
Visio needs and level of expertise:
www.microsoft.com/communities/default.mspx
MVPs.org
For a great general information site maintained by Visio experts who have been
heavily involved with Visio since it was introduced in 1992 by Shapeware (the
creator of Visio), visit the following:
www.mvps.org/visio/
Another site maintained by this group contains a huge variety of download-
able files — some older than others:
http://www.mvps.org/visio/CompuServe.htm
Google
Google is well-known as a search engine extraordinaire. In addition to helping
you find almost any information you’re looking for, Google also sponsors user
groups, where people can share information. As luck would have it, you can
choose from several Visio groups! 
First go to Google’s home page:
www.google.com
356
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Then, for a list of Visio user’s groups, click the Groups button at the top of
the page, and type microsoft.public.visio in the search box on the next page.
At the time of this writing, 17 user groups were listed, providing general infor-
mation to technical help for developers. This is a great way to ask questions
and share information user-to-user.
Yahoo!
If you’re a software developer or network designer, you might want to join
this Yahoo group (members only):
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Microsoft_Visio/
Third-Party Suppliers of Visio Shapes 
and Stencils
Many companies and independent organizations create and supply Visio
shapes. Some shapes are even free. This section lists several great resources
for Visio shapes and stencils.
MVPs.org
MVPS, which was listed previously in the chapter, is maintained by Visio
experts, some of whom are Microsoft employees. You can find a list of third-
party suppliers of shapes, stencils, and templates for Visio at the following:
www.mvps.org/visio/3rdparty.htm
ShapeDev.com
The ShapeDev site contains Visio shape development tutorials and Visio sten-
cils available for free download:
