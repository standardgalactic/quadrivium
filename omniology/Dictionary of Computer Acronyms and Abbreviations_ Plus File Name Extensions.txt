NET APIs for Windows Store apps ~ The subset of .NET APIs that can be used to
develop Windows Store apps. 
NET Assembly Connector ~ An out-of-the-box BDC connector that ships with WSS. It
provides the ability to host .NET Connectivity Assemblies, enabling users to easily add
custom data sources or do data mashups. 
NET Compact Framework ~ A hardware-independent environment for running
programs on resource-constrained computing devices. It inherits the full .NET Framework
architecture of the common language runtime, supports a subset of the .NET Framework
class library, and contains classes designed exclusively for the .NET Compact Framework.
Supported devices include personal data assistants (PDAs) (such as the Pocket PC),
mobile phones, set-top boxes, automotive computing devices, and custom-designed
embedded devices built with the Microsoft Windows CE.NET operating system. 
NET Connectivity Assembly ~ A .NET assembly that implements connectivity
operations such as custom data access, aggregation, and data transformations. Each class
in this assembly typically maps to an external content type and each operation supported
by the external content type maps to a method inside the class. 
NET Framework ~ An integral Windows component that supports building, deploying,
and running the next generation of applications and XML Web services. It provides a
highly productive, standards-based, multilanguage environment for integrating existing
investments with next generation applications and services, as well as the agility to solve
the challenges of deployment and operation of Internet-scale applications. The .NET
Framework consists of three main parts: the common language runtime, a hierarchical set
of unified class libraries, and a componentized version of ASP called ASP.NET. 
NET Framework 45 Language Pack ~ The .NET Framework 4.5 Language Pack
contains localized resources for supported languages. It contains translated error messages
and other UI text for languages other than English. If user does not install a language
pack, this text is displayed in English. Multiple language packs can be installed on one
computer, each for a different language. 
NET Framework class library ~ A library of classes, interfaces, and value types that are

included in .NET Framework. This library provides access to system functionality and is
designed to be the foundation on which .NET Framework applications, components, and
controls are built. 
NET Framework data provider ~ A component of ADO.NET that provides access to
data from a relational data source. A .NET Framework data provider contains classes to
connect to a data source, execute commands at the data source, and return query results
from the data source, including the ability to execute commands within transactions. A
.NET Framework data provider also contains classes to populate a DataSet with results
from a data source and propagate changes in a DataSet back to the data source. 
NET Framework hotfix rollup ~ Package that contains a tested, cumulative set of
hotfixes generally intended to correct issues in a specific area or component for the
Microsoft .NET Framework platform. 
NET Framework Manifest Generation and Editing Tool ~ The Manifest Generation
and Editing Tool (Mage.exe) is a command-line tool that supports the creation and editing
of application and deployment manifests. As a command-line tool, Mage.exe can be run
from both batch scripts and other Windows-based applications, including ASP.NET
applications. 
NET Framework Windows Resource Localization Editor ~ Visual layout tool that
helps localization experts to localize Windows Forms user interface (UI) resources used
by forms. It is part of .NET Framework SDK. Also known as the Windows Forms
Resource Editor, Winres.exe. The .resx or .resources files that are used as input to
Winres.exe can be created using a visual design environment such as Microsoft Visual
Studio.
