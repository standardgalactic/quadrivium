Dedication
Dr. James Gaylord: To my children: Abby, Brendan, and Maggie, who taught
me so much about parenting in the first year of life.
Michelle Hagen: This book is for my babies: Sam, Hal, and Nolan (who truly
aren’t babies at all anymore). I’m constantly amazed by the fact that I’m rais-
ing three incredibly amusing, interesting, and good-hearted young men. I love
you, I love you, I love you.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Dr. Gaylord: I would like to acknowledge my wife Diane whose networking
made my participation in this project possible.
Michelle Hagen: First, to my co-author, Dr. Jim Gaylord, I appreciate your
input, guidance, and patience throughout this long process. I know how
incredibly busy you are with your practice and with your own family, which
makes me even more grateful that you agreed to take on this project in the
first place.
Thank you to Mike and Diane Young, who introduced me to my wonderful co-
author. Thanks to Jessica Faust, my agent at Bookends, for all of your support
and assistance. To Traci Cumbay and Jen Bingham, my editors at Wiley, I
enjoyed working with both of you more than I can say. Not only are both of
you outstanding at what you do, you’re both fun, funny, and fair. You made
my job that much easier. 
Thank you to Dr. Mary Elise Hodson, technical editor on this project, for your
helpful suggestions during the editing process. Thanks to Tracy Boggier,
Acquisitions Editor at Wiley, for your assistance in getting this book off to a
solid start. Kathryn Born, thank you for your outstanding illustrations. Each
one is an asset to this book.
And last but not least, thanks to my husband Mike and to my boys, all of
whom have played a vital role in my interest in and love for babies over the
years. Thanks also for being so proud of my work, especially when the truth
is that without you guys, I’m nothin’.

Introduction
W
hen you’re pregnant and preparing for the future with Baby, it’s so
easy to nail down a “schedule” for feedings, for naps, for your own
return to work. And then your dream child becomes a reality and you find
that — well, she has her own ideas that don’t quite coincide with your best-
laid plans.
For some people, bringing a baby into the home is no big deal — their child 
is quiet and mellow, and just a joy to behold throughout the first year and
beyond. For the parents of a fussy, sleepless infant, however, the experience
is completely different. And because you’ll be talking to other new parents at
the doctor’s office or at a playgroup, the parents of the restless baby assume
that the parents of the quiet infant have a line on some secret method of 
raising a laid-back kid. Enter parental guilt and feelings of inadequacy.
There are bound to be times during Baby’s first year when you feel as though
you’ve got the world by the tail: Baby’s sleeping and eating well, she’s hitting
those milestones right on time, and you’re balancing childcare with work or
with housekeeping. Then again, for every action, there’s an equal and oppo-
site reaction; it only makes sense that there will also be times when you feel
like you don’t know what the heck is going on, and wonder why you ever
thought you could handle this huge responsibility in the first place.
Give yourself a break during those moments. The first year is one big learning
experience — for you and your child. Baby will be conquering new territory
every month (detailed in the pages of this book), and you’ll be right there,
cheering her on and adjusting your own life to meet her latest wants and
needs. There will be days of triumph (as when Baby smiles, coos, and laughs
for the first time) and days that you’d rather just forget (teething — ’nough
said). All of the days go by so quickly, though, and before you know it, Baby
will be 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and then 1 year old. It all happens
without your realizing it — Baby’s a toddler and you’re a confident, veteran
parent.
This book was written with the intention of giving new parents a realistic look
at what Baby’s first year may be like. Think of this as a time to become
acquainted with your child as she grows into her personality and you grow
into parenthood.

About This Book
This book was written by a pediatrician with a booming practice and two
great kids of his own, and a writer/mom who’s raising three boys — and all 
of these kids were completely different during their first years. We’ve left out
a lot of scientific research on why babies behave the way they do and have
mostly focused on the practical and emotional aspects of seeing your child
through the first year.
For example, you won’t find statistics in this book, because, quite frankly, it
isn’t all that helpful to know that a certain percentage of infants sleep through
the night at 3 months if your 3-month-old is still waking up three times between
midnight and daybreak. Knowing how to encourage her to catch forty winks is
far more helpful than comparing your experience to phantom families around
the country, so in this book, you find no-nonsense advice given in the simplest
terms and presented in an easy-to-find format.
We know that parenting is hard work — we’ve been there personally, and Dr.
Gaylord has listened to many, many, many parents’ concerns about the first
year. We’ve laid out information in plain language and with a twist — we took
off our rose-colored glasses while writing in an effort to let new parents know
that the first year, while magical and wonderful and glorious (and far too fleet-
ing), inevitably has its moments of confusion and frustration. We want new
parents to know that they’re not alone, and that feeling this way is normal — 
it doesn’t make you a bad mom or dad. It makes you human.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through this book, we’ve established the following 
conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 Sidebars, which are shaded gray boxes full of text, consist of information
that’s interesting but not necessarily critical to your understanding of
the topic.
Baby math can spin a parent’s head around at times. We tried to keep the
months and the chapter titles in sync in order to eliminate confusion. Please
bear in mind that when we refer to, for example, a “1-month-old” or an
“almost-1-month-old,” we’re talking about a child in the first month of life and
approaching the 4-week mark.
2
Your Baby’s First Year For Dummies 

What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars included in this book are “extra” information — a more in-depth
look at areas of concern during the first year. Some focus on development,
others focus on recent studies — none of them are crucial to your under-
standing the rest of this book. Read them if you want, and skip them if you
aren’t into that kind of thing. No big whoop.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you’ve picked up this book for one of several reasons:
 You’re pregnant and wondering what Baby’s first year will be like.
 You’ve given birth and are reading everything you can get your hands on
regarding the months ahead.
 You’ve given birth and you wanted a book that doesn’t talk down to you
or make you feel as though there’s something wrong with you if you’re
having a hard time making the adjustment to parenthood.
We go on to assume that you’re looking for advice on making it through the
first year, that you know it’s not always going to be easy, that you want to be
the best parent you’re capable of becoming, and that you’re willing to give up
preconceived notions (read: fantasies) of how these first 12 months with a
child should be. That’s all.
In a nutshell: If you have a baby in the house, we want to talk to you.
Other titles in the For Dummies series that you may want to check out
include Breastfeeding For Dummies by Sharon Perkins and Carol Vannais,
Choosing Childcare For Dummies by Ann Douglas, and Parenting For Dummies
by Sandra Hardin Gookin and Dan Gookin — all published by Wiley. These
books will give you a great overview of various aspects of child-rearing.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve broken this book into 24 chapters. Each of Baby’s first 12 months is
addressed in its own chapter, including a list of milestones for each specific
time period, a discussion of what happens during each well-baby visit, and
tips for ensuring Baby’s safety and well-being at every stage of development.
The chapters are grouped into sections.
3
Introduction

Part I: Giving Baby a 
Healthy, Happy Start
These debut chapters focus on preparing your house for Baby, what happens
in the maternity ward, deciding on a method of feeding your child, and actu-
ally transporting Baby home. We also discuss the production of traveling
with an infant in this section, along with information to guide you in making
the decision to return to work — or to stay home. Diverse topics, yes, but
issues you want to know about and consider so that you’re not forced to
make decisions on-the-spot.
Part II: Introducing: Baby!
These chapters focus on Baby’s infancy, including an honest discussion of a
new mom’s recovery from childbirth and how Baby may or may not be set-
tling into her new home. Look for the milestone markers at the beginning of
each chapter to know what Baby may be up to during this time.
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing
Months 4 through 6 are covered in this section, a time when Baby’s personal-
ity begins to blossom and he starts moving of his own accord. Each chapter
in this section contains information on adding solids to Baby’s diet and how
that may affect his sleeping and nursing routines. A discussion on whether to
let Baby “cry it out” is also included in this section.
Part IV: Discovering the 
World Beyond Mom
Baby becomes more mobile during the second half of the first year, and she
also begins to grasp the true concept of communication. She’s becoming a real
person now, and these chapters focus on encouraging her language develop-
ment and keeping her safe when all she wants to do is explore. We also discuss
the other people in Baby’s life — your friends who love to compare your child
to theirs, and your relatives, who refuse to follow your directions when they
watch your child. Tips for dealing with these well-meaning but frustrating pals
and relations are included in this section.
4
Your Baby’s First Year For Dummies 

Part V: Keeping Up with Baby
Baby really starts moving during the last three months of the first year — in
fact, he may be up and walking by his first birthday party! He may also have a
handle on real language at this point, or he may be quite happy to sit on his
blanket without saying a word. Tips for staying sane while parenting an active
baby are given in this section, along with advice for parents whose children
haven’t hit the big developmental milestones just yet. Weaning becomes an
issue at this point, and advice for making it a less uncomfortable experience
for Mom is included here. There’s also a list of toddler-loved toys (just in
case you need some help buying for the big party).
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s 
Health and Safety
These chapters give an overview of the first-year immunizations and common
illnesses, along with advice on comforting a sick child and when to call the
doctor. Basic first aid and baby-proofing measures (to prevent injuries in the
first place) are discussed in these chapters. We also give you some insight into
how to care for a special-needs baby.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
A standard feature in all For Dummies titles, the Part of Tens includes short,
to-the-point chapters focused on presenting need-to-know information in the
most efficient way possible. The Part of Tens chapters in Your Baby’s First
Year For Dummies include advice for making it through the first few weeks
after Baby’s birth, what a dad can do to survive the first year, and what kinds
of situations or illnesses warrant an immediate call to the pediatrician, plus
advice on which ones don’t.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons used throughout the book are bits of information that can make
your life easier or protect your child from harm.
Some situations call for advice from a pro. We use this icon to let you know
when something merits an expert medical opinion. Or when you should con-
sult your doctor to put your mind to rest about a situation.
5
Introduction

This icon points out words of wisdom that we feel are particularly important
and likely to be valuable as you brave Baby’s first year.
When we go into medical details or delve deeply into a topic, we use this
icon. Rest assured that you can skip this information and still come away
with the facts you need.
This icon highlights advice on how to ease Baby into a new situation or to
make less work for yourself.
The Warning icon points out situations in which you or Baby may find your-
selves in harm’s way.
Where to Go from Here
All For Dummies books are written in modular form — that is, each chapter
stands on its own. You don’t have to read the introductory chapters to under-
stand the chapters toward the end of the book. Heck, you don’t have to rely
on any one chapter to explain another. Each chapter contains advice specific
to that particular month or topic, so you can dive in wherever you need to
and you won’t be lost. Start wherever you’re at during the first year. If you
waited until the fourth month to buy this book, skip right to Chapter 9. If you’re
still pregnant, start at the beginning and decide what you need to know at this
point. We know that new parents seldom have loads of spare time to spend
reading, so we didn’t include information that will bore you to tears or put you
to sleep — wherever you choose to begin, you find pertinent information that
you can use at that particular time in Baby’s development.

reparing yourself for what lies ahead can help make
the changes that occur during Baby’s first year a
heck of a lot easier for you and your child. Find out how 
to get your home ready for Baby, how to make the best
travel plans for you and your child, how to find the best
daycare for your infant, and discover what really happens
in the hospital.
These are diverse topics — but believe it or not you may
find yourself dealing with each of these issues over the
course of Baby’s first month. Just imagine what you’ll
encounter over the span of the first year!

W
ondering about how life will be when Baby comes into the fold? Go
ahead and make plans, but give yourself a lot of wiggle room. Counting
on a baby to follow the plans you make months before delivery (concerning
work, or vacations, or sleep, or even having a pleasant day) is like picking a
random date and planning on having nice weather. You just don’t know. You
can’t know until the time comes. Make several contingency plans for Baby’s
first weeks at home — sort of like having an umbrella handy.
The first year is an amazing time of growth (something your pediatrician will
officially track at every well-baby visit) and development. When you hold your
tiny infant in one arm, you’ll hardly be able to imagine her balancing on her
own feet in a matter of just 12 months’ time, when she may also be learning to
talk, eating real foods, and displaying signs of her true personality (which, to
your delight or dismay, may mimic your own — or your partner’s).
Adoptive parents face the same issues and challenges (along with some con-
cerns unique to their situation) when it comes to seeing Baby through the
first year — and beyond. This book is meant to be a guide for everyone who
is taking on the total commitment involved with raising a child.
This chapter gives you an idea of what lies ahead — and where to look for
information in this book.

Bracing Yourself for the Changes Ahead
So, you’re all set to bring Baby home and jump into this gig known as parent-
ing. You’ve thought about this for — well, what seems like forever; you’ve
prepared yourself mentally; you know that your life is going to be different —
but different in a good way.
No matter how long you’ve been dreaming, planning, and discussing this par-
ticular phase of life, you really can’t ever know what it’ll be like until you’re
actually going through it. You may bring home a mellow, quiet, easy-going
child, or you may bring home someone who seems to have been sent to
punish you for all the grief you gave your own parents.
Equipping yourself
Having all the right equipment can make life a heck of a lot easier, as can
having the right people around to lend a helping hand. In the event that
you’ve had a difficult delivery, or that your child just isn’t sleeping the way
you thought he would, having a good support system and accepting the fact
that you need to take it easy for a while (as discussed in Chapter 5) can really
help to ease your transition toward taking complete responsibility for this
one little person.
Make your checklist (or wish list) early and keep track of what you have,
what you don’t have, and what you absolutely must have before you go into
labor. Chapter 2 lists the necessities of new parenthood, from car seats to co-
sleepers.
Keeping an open mind
The best advice for new parents may be this: Be flexible. Although you do
want to educate yourself on life with a baby during your pregnancy, try not 
to settle on one particular idea of how things are going to be.
Babies are unpredictable. You could have a terrific first week at home, resting
while Baby does little more than snooze in your arms only to find that Baby
becomes fussy during the second and third weeks for no apparent reason.
Maybe you’re planning on going back to work after a month, but after a week
of broken sleep and long days at home nursing your child ’round the clock,
you’re beginning to wonder how the heck you’re going to meet that goal.
Chapter 4 tells you about returning to work. Running even the simplest
10
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

errands with a newborn in tow can take twice as long as you may expect, and
when fatigue and frustration (discussed in Chapter 5) hit, they can make you
feel like you’re down for the count. It’s really not the case — you just need to
regroup and recharge and figure out what works — and what doesn’t.
Becoming a parent
Bonding with Baby (covered in more detail in Chapters 2 and 6) can often
take two forms: immediate and absolute from the moment of this child’s birth
or gradual and intermittent. Nothing’s wrong with you if you fall into the
latter group. Sure, you may have been expecting to feel an instant connection
to your child, but remember — he’s a stranger to you. Don’t berate yourself
for not feeling like a parent immediately. The feeling will come to you — you
can bet the farm on it — and after it does (or even before), you may wonder
how you can be trusted to care for this beautiful child.
If your baby comes with special needs or if he gets sick or injured, you have
an even more challenging set of circumstances to handle (but, trust us, you
can do it). Turn to Chapter 18 of this book to find out more about how to care
for Baby when everything isn’t perfect.
Parenting is sometimes an overwhelming responsibility, especially in a year
filled with firsts. Although countless changes are headed your way with the
introduction of a child into your home, there won’t be anything you can’t
handle. Repeat this mantra every morning, noon, and night if you need to —
because it’s the truth.
Planning for Life with Baby
Setting up Baby’s bassinet and swing are good starts to preparing for the big
day when your family welcomes the little one home — however, many other
issues are worth discussing before Baby takes center stage, such as:
 Are you breastfeeding or bottlefeeding? (Read Chapter 2 for an overview
of each.)
 Which partner is going to be the primary caregiver? If both of you are
going to work full-time, who’s going to take charge of feeding and cloth-
ing everyone? Will there be an equal division of household and Baby
duties or will another arrangement work better? (Chapter 4 discusses
some of these topics.)
 Is there anything you can do to prevent sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS)? (Chapter 20 has advice on this.)
11
Chapter 1: Preparing for Baby

 Do you expect to make frequent trips with Baby? (Chapter 3 offers some
tips for smooth traveling.)
 Do you know the Heimlich maneuver for babies? How about infant CPR?
(Chapter 20 goes over this.)
 If you’re returning to work, what kind of day-care arrangements should
you make? (Chapter 4 again.)
 Who do you accept help from, and who do you turn away at the door?
(Chapter 5 advises you in this matter.)
 How do you deal with family members who happen to disagree with
your parenting philosophies? (See Chapter 14.)
 What’s your take on spanking? How about your partner’s view of it?
(Chapter 17 gives advice for handling discipline in an age-appropriate
manner.)
 When do you begin preparing your home to be baby-safe? Before you
know it, Baby will be rolling, crawling, mouthing, and pulling up on
everything. (Chapter 20 gives advice for baby-proofing your house.)
Of course, you must consider much, much more to prepare yourself — and
your life, and your home — for the arrival of your child. These major con-
cerns are really just the tip of the iceberg, as you’ll find after the first year
really gets rolling.
Choosing a Pediatrician
Planning on choosing a doc from the Yellow Pages? Don’t. Buying space in the
phone book isn’t an indication of how qualified a doctor is — no matter how
big and fancy the ad. With just a little research, you’re much more likely to
find the right pediatrician.
The first thing you want to decide is what kind of doctor you’re looking for.
You have two options:
 A pediatrician specializes solely in children; he followed up medical
school with three more years of training in the care of babies, children,
and adolescents. Board-certified pediatricians have taken an exam
demonstrating their vast knowledge of the health and well-being of their
prospective patients.
 A general practitioner sees a much broader range of patients and may,
in fact, be able to take care of your entire family (a big bonus if you’re
frequently ill). On the downside, he may not know as much about less
common conditions in an infant (though if he sees a lot of infants in his
practice, he may be very informed on the latest issues).
12
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

Ask your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and obstetrician — anyone you
know who has kids and/or whose opinion you respect — for the names of
good baby doctors.
Make sure the doctors on your short list accept your insurance, and then set
up an interview with one or more of them. Some doctors don’t charge for this
meeting; others do. Ask about the fee when you make the appointment.
During your interview, you need to find out the following:
 What’s the doctor’s educational background? Did he attend medical
school in another country, for example? You need to do your research
and make sure that the requirements for graduation there are as strin-
gent as they are in the U.S. Also find out whether the doctor is board 
certified. A doctor who isn’t board certified in pediatrics isn’t necessar-
ily incompetent; certification simply means that this physician has com-
pleted extra training and assessment (beyond the minimum require-
ments) by a board of experts in the field.
 What’s his child-rearing philosophy? Does it mesh with yours?
 What’s his take on the use of antibiotics for infections? Some doctors
nowadays are taking more of a wait-and-see approach to ear infections,
for example, to allow them to clear up by themselves. You may love this
approach to medicine, or you may be completely opposed to it. It’s best
to know now how an ear infection will be treated so that you don’t find
yourself at odds with your doctor when the situation arises.
 How many doctors are in the practice? Will you be able to see your
doctor for all well-baby visits? Who will see Baby when he’s sick? You
may be expecting to see this particular doctor at every single well- and
sick-baby visit. That’s just not the case in many practices, at least as far
as sick calls go. You may need to see the doctor on call (who may be
someone you don’t know).
 What are the office hours? If you work full-time you may want to look
for a practice with evening or weekend hours for well-baby checkups.
Many practices have a scheduled time where a doctor or nurse answers
routine questions that don’t require an office visit (such as the recom-
mended dosage of cold medicine for Baby’s age and weight, or how to
treat diaper rash).
 If he’s a solo practitioner, who covers his office when he takes vaca-
tion? You want to know that you have a reliable place to take your sick
baby when your doctor is out of town.
Tell the doctor if you’re concerned or confused about immunizing Baby.
Some physicians won’t take on a child who isn’t going to be immunized. (For
more on immunization, see Chapter 18.)
13
Chapter 1: Preparing for Baby

Another important consideration: How convenient is the doctor’s office to
your home? Driving 20 minutes to see the pediatrician may seem like an
adventure to you right now, but the first time you have a sick child on your
hands, all you’ll want to do is get him in, get him out, and get him home. (Not
to mention that if you have more kids in the years to come, dragging two or
three sick kids across town to see the doctor becomes even more of a chal-
lenge). You can plan on being at the doctor’s office plenty over the course 
of the first year in any event, because your child will have well-baby visits
scheduled at 2 weeks or 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months,
and 12 months.
Adopting
Although some of the advice in this book centers on a new mom’s recovery
from childbirth, it isn’t meant to exclude adoptive parents. You’re taking on
the same role as any new parent and facing the same issues during the first
year.
In today’s open adoptions, birth mothers are sometimes included and/or kept
informed of Baby’s well-being. This is a good thing for your child: First, the
circle of people who adore her is only made larger (and can it ever really be
too large?), and secondly, she’ll never question where she came from or what
kind of medical history she may have.
Bonding sometimes seems to be of particular concern for adoptive parents.
But bonding can be a challenge for biological parents, as well. And of course,
during this first year, you’ll work on achieving that first full night’s sleep, on
feeding Baby, and on developing her motor and communication skills. One
thing is certain: As moms and dads, all of us are in the same boat when it
comes to learning about and meeting the basic needs of our kids.
Looking Ahead: Baby’s 
First Year in a Nutshell
You won’t believe how much Baby accomplishes during his first year. Almost
before your eyes, he transforms from a helpless sleeping and eating machine
into an independent, curious toddler who’s talking and walking and even
telling you “no.” Along the way from dependent blob to busy 1-year-old, you
can expect Baby to reach the following exciting milestones:
 Baby melts your heart with his first smile at about 6 weeks.
 Baby may begin to sleep through the night as early as the second
month, or after he weighs 10 to 15 pounds.
14
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

 At about 3 months, not only does he start cooing and get his first taste
of mobility by rolling over, but — much to your relief, no doubt — he’s
likely to conquer colic.
 Listen for his first real belly laugh to come at about 3 months.
 Watch for Baby to start holding up his head for short periods of time —
and to start putting everything in his mouth — during the fourth
month.
 At 5 months, Baby becomes a little ball of personality, showing different
emotions throughout the day, such as happiness (by smiling and laugh-
ing), anger (by voicing his anger when you remove an object from his
reach), and interest (by attempting to mimic your voice).
 Late in the sixth month, Baby may start sitting up by himself and even
crawling or scooting (or propelling himself across the floor in some
other creative manner).
 During the seventh month (Chapter 12), Baby’s communication skills
take off as he begins to babble.
 He becomes mobile one way or another during the eighth month, whether
he’s just beginning to crawl, or he begins pulling up and cruising around
your family room.
 When Baby is around 9 months, he may suddenly start clinging to a 
special toy, blanket, or other security object, as he begins to realize 
that he isn’t actually part of you.
 His comprehension of language blossoms during the tenth month,
when he’s able to demonstrate an understanding of what you’re saying
to him.
 During the eleventh and twelfth months Baby will refine the skills he’s
already been demonstrating — namely language and locomotion.

D
uring the final stage of pregnancy, reality starts to set it. You can feel that
change is in the air, and you may wonder whether you’re prepared —
emotionally and physically — to deal with it. This chapter gives you advice 
on how to best prepare for Baby’s arrival, what you may experience during
your hospital stay, and how to ease into that transformation from pregnant 
to parent.
Filling Baby’s Bedroom 
(and Your Entire House)
Many moms-to-be experience a nesting phase late in pregnancy, during which
they can concentrate on little else aside from preparing a home for Baby. 
And good thing, because you simply will not believe how much stuff a baby
needs, not to mention how much he will acquire in the form of gifts over his
first few weeks of life. Your home, once a sanctuary for your most beloved
material goods, will become Baby’s storage locker. Soon enough, baby cloth-
ing, diapering supplies, toys, bottles, pacifiers, and props (his swing, stroller,
and bassinet) will be the only visible items in your house — and the only
things you’ll care about, anyway.

Of course, there’s a huge difference between useful baby paraphernalia and
clutter. This section gives you the skinny on what you really need to have on
hand for Baby’s homecoming.
Now that you’re honing in on your baby shower wish list, make sure that you
have some idea of practical versus pretty baby goods. It’s fine to register for all
of the things you’ve ever dreamed of giving your baby (a decorative ceramic
nightlight, the finest infant-sized shearling slippers, the sterling silver rattle 
and spoon set), but you don’t want to miss out on the things you actually 
need (like bottles, bibs, and booties).
Stocking up for Baby’s arrival
After Baby comes home from the hospital, you need to be ready to rock and
roll with supplies and clothing. (In fact, you won’t even be able to drive him
to your house without an infant car seat, so that should be at the top of your
registry list). The following list covers the items you need during your first
few days and weeks:
The Big Stuff
 Infant (rear-facing) car seat: Baby needs something sturdy that will last
at least through the first couple of years, so don’t cut corners on this
purchase.
 Stroller: As soon as you’re up to it, you want to show Baby off to the
neighbors.
 Crib: These vary widely in selection and price, so assess your needs
before you buy. If you’re planning on having a large family, for example,
look for a sturdy crib that can be used again (and again).
 Changing table: Having a designated area for diaper changes makes life
easier during those first few weeks. Stock it with all of the supplies you
may need (listed in “Supplies” section).
 Baby sack or sling: Slings allow for discreet and instant nursing and con-
stant cuddling. Sacks carry Baby upright on your chest (also allowing
for lots of snuggle time).
 Swing: Wind-up swings are cheaper, but you may wake a sleeping infant
when it stops. Battery-operated swings allow Baby to rest comfortably
and quietly with no disruptions.
 Infant seat: This serves as a safe place for you to put Baby while you’re
preparing his bottle or folding the laundry.
18
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

 Bassinet or co-sleeper: Most infants need to feed so frequently in the
early weeks that it’s just more practical to have them in the same bed-
room with their parents. A Moses basket–type bassinet is portable, so
you can easily move it from room to room during the day. Co-sleepers
(cribs with a side that drops down and opens up to the parents’ bed) are
discussed in Chapter 6.
 Baby bathtub: After the umbilical cord heals, you can wash Baby in this
small tub that fits right into your sink.
Clothing
 One-piece outfits: You’ll choose between sleepers (long sleeves, long
legs) and rompers (short sleeves, short legs), depending on the time of
year and/or climate. You need at least eight to ten of these, because
babies tend to mess themselves frequently.
 Drawstring nightgowns: These are easier to manipulate at changing
time than clothing with snaps, but they’re a bit harder to find in stores
these days.
 One-piece undergarments: Similar to rompers, with short sleeves, no
legs, and snaps in the crotch. The one-piece design doesn’t bunch up
under Baby’s clothes, and adds a layer of warmth. Have at least eight of
these on hand.
 Mittens: Some babies are face-scratching champs. These little mitts are
designed to cover Baby’s hands and protect him from himself.
 Outerwear: A baby born in Maine in November is going to need a
bunting of some sort, a hat, and baby mittens.
 Booties and socks: Look for foot coverings with fairly strong elastic
around the ankles. Babies who kick a lot are often left barefoot while
their moms are searching for stray socks.
Supplies
 Changing table supplies: Stock the table with diapers, a waterproof
changing pad, wipes, petroleum jelly (for care of the circumcision),
diaper rash ointment, and a garbage can.
 Burp cloths and bibs: Spare yourself from wearing spit up. Have at least
four tiny bibs and/or six burp cloths handy.
 Bottles and formula: You need four to six 4-ounce bottles during the
early months; when Baby starts to eat more, you need four to six 8-
ounce bottles. You also need a bottlebrush and a drying rack.
 Breast pump: After you and Baby have successfully established breast-
feeding (around 6 weeks), you can start pumping your milk. Your part-
ner can take over the occasional feeding at that point.
19
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

 Breast pads to prevent soaking your clothes: You’ll really come to
appreciate these items.
 Diaper bags: You only use one at a time, but it doesn’t hurt to have a
backup. These bags are now available in the coolest, hippest fabrics and
colors, so you don’t have to frump up your cool-parent outfits with a
striped vinyl tote.
 Bath supplies: For sponge bathing Baby, you need baby soap and sham-
poo, a waterproof pad, cotton balls (for cleaning her eyes), baby nail
clippers (or scissors), a comb, a bath thermometer, and a medium-sized
bowl for water.
 Pacifiers: Some babies love ’em, some hate ’em, and some are very par-
ticular as to what type of silicone nipple they’ll accept. Have several 
different types on hand if you plan to comfort Baby with a binkie.
 Linens: You need crib sheets (at least four), a crib quilt or blanket, a
bumper pad (protects Baby’s head from the side of the crib), receiving
blankets (for swaddling, stroller outings, and placing Baby on an other-
wise unprotected surface, like the floor), and baby-sized towels and
washcloths.
Medicine chest
Losing sight of your furnishings? Hold on — you also need to stock the medi-
cine cabinet with a few must-have items:
 Thermometer: Ear thermometers are easy to use, but they aren’t as
accurate as their digital or mercury counterparts. Infants usually have
their temps taken rectally, anyway.
 Petroleum jelly: To help with the temperature taking.
 Nose syringe: Useful when Baby is congested. (You will actually remove
the mucus from her nose, and you’ll realize then and there how much
you love this child, because you wouldn’t do this for just anyone.)
 Cool mist vaporizer: You may be a fan of hot steam when you’re con-
gested, but because those vaporizers can cause severe burns, cool mist
is a safer option for Baby’s room.
 Medicine syringe and spoon: For easy, accurate measurement and deliv-
ery of medication.
 Bandages, antiseptic, tweezers, anti-itch cream, and diaper rash oint-
ment: Babies get cuts, slivers, and rashes. Be prepared.
Supplementing the shower goodies
As if the above lists weren’t enough, there are some things you may not
receive at your shower that you need throughout Baby’s first year, such as:
 Clothes, in all sizes: Sizes you need include infant, 0 to 3 months, 3 to 
6 months, 6 to 9 months, and 9 to 12 months. Although it’s tempting to
20
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

purchase everything now, you may want to wait and see how Baby
grows. It’s not unusual for a big 6-month-old to wear 9- to 12-month 
clothing.
 Toys: There are educational toys, amusing toys, and hybrids of each
type for every age level. Baby gyms, for example, are a good early toy.
They dangle eye-catching toys above Baby’s head and encourage devel-
opment of his hand-eye coordination.
 Bathtub ring: After Baby is able to sit (or almost), he’s ready to move
into the real bathtub. These rings are designed to help him sit upright
(though you should never, never leave him unattended).
 Ring pillows: Designed to hold Baby during breastfeeding, prop up a
smaller baby, and to fit around an older baby’s bottom, helping him to
sit up.
 Playpen and/or baby gates: If you wind up with a very active baby, pop-
ping him in the playpen may be the only way you’ll ever find time to
make your lunch. Gates protect Baby from those areas of the house that
aren’t baby-safe.
 Exercise ring: Pediatricians generally discourage the use of walkers and
jolly jumpers (also called Johnny jumps-ups). There are just too many
accidents involved in their use (walkers can easily slip down a flight of
stairs with Baby on board, and jolly jumpers can actually flip Baby over
on his head). Look for an exercise ring or saucer — Baby can rock and
roll to his heart’s content, but he can’t actually go anywhere.
Taking a bare-bones approach
You’re averse, you say, to buying anything before you’re sure you need it?
Fair enough. Just make sure that before Baby is carried through your front
door that you have the following items:
 Rear-facing infant car seat
 Diapers and changing supplies (listed above)
 Clothes suitable for your climate and season
 A safe place for Baby to sleep
 Bottles and formula, if bottlefeeding
 Burp cloths
Packing for the Hospital
You’re thinking you don’t need all that much for this little trip? After all,
you’re just going to give birth, and you’ll be right home. Rethink this position.
21
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

Your labor ultimately determines many of the things you need from home —
and unfortunately, there’s no way to tell whether yours will be quick and easy
or long and arduous. Better to pack too much than to find (too late) that
you’ve forgotten the one thing that would have been a great comfort to you
during the delivery.
Don’t leave home without:
 Your insurance card.
 A digital watch or a watch with a second hand for accurately timing 
contractions.
 Change for the vending machines.
The hospital may want you to pay for TV and phone service in cash.
Check with them in advance. If not, change should be all you need, and
you’re wise to leave big bills and any valuables at home.
 A list of your loved ones’ phone numbers. They’ll be waiting to hear the
good news!
 Socks and slippers.
 A robe to cover yourself up (hospital gowns don’t cover your backside
very well) in case you want to walk the halls during labor and for walks
to and from the nursery afterward. Also pack your slippers for walking
the halls.
 Glasses and contacts.
 Soap, shampoo, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, gel, deodor-
ant, hair dryer, and anything else you to make yourself feel fresh. The
hospital will supply you with sanitary napkins after delivery.
 Books, magazines, knitting, crossword puzzles (for the earliest stages of
labor and possibly for after delivery, as well).
 Going-home outfits for you and Baby. Don’t pack the jeans you were
wearing the week you got pregnant; they probably won’t fit for several
months. Instead, opt for an outfit for yourself that’s comfortable and
loose fitting. If it’s cold outside, remember that Baby will need to be bun-
dled up on her trip home.
Rethink purchasing and packing a beautiful new nightgown for your hospital
stay. You’ll be dealing with sanitary napkins again after giving birth, for one
thing, and for another, you’ll be feeding an infant who won’t think twice about
spitting up on your new jammies. You can use the hospital gown or an old
nightgown from home, but go for comfort over style.
You may also want:
 Lollipops to prevent a dry mouth. (Hard candies may be all right, but
present a choking hazard when you’re breathing heavily during labor.)
22
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

 Tennis balls or massage tools for back pain. If you’d like for your hus-
band to use a little lotion during the backrubs, pack that, too.
 Your own washcloth. You may be allowed to hydrate yourself with a
moistened washcloth. Do you really want one from the hospital laundry
anywhere near your mouth?
Don’t forget that you’re going to be bringing a new person home with you.
You may want to have a packed diaper bag ready to go to the hospital with
you, just to make sure all your ducks are in a row. Turn to Chapter 3 for more
on what to include in your diaper bag.
Special Delivery! What to 
Expect After Baby Arrives
This is what you’ve been waiting nine months for — Baby finally makes her
appearance. Nothing can quite prepare you for the experience, and you may
be surprised by the flurry of activity that follows your baby’s birth. This sec-
tion touches on what you can realistically expect in the moments and days
following Baby’s birth.
Wahhh! Baby wants back in!
Why do babies cry when they’re born? (This isn’t a riddle — there really is a
reason.) First off, the cry is an indication that Baby’s lungs are working prop-
erly. But consider how you’d feel if you were resting happily in a dark, warm,
liquid environment and you were suddenly forced out through a tight little
tunnel (or through a surgical opening) into a bright, chilly, loud room, where
strange people were wiping you down and whisking you from one spot to
another, poking and prodding your little body. You’d cry, too.
Testing, testing: How Baby 
is evaluated after birth
The delivery room nurses spring into action immediately after Baby is born,
and you’ll hear them talking about Baby’s Apgar score, the heel prick, and
measurements. What’s happening to Baby, and what does it all mean?
The Apgar score is an evaluation of Baby’s condition taken at one minute after
birth, and then again at five minutes. The one-minute score is basically a tool
to evaluate how hard the delivery was on Baby. The five-minute score is a
23
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

better indication of how Baby’s adapting to life outside the womb. Newborns
who score seven to ten points at five minutes are in good shape; babies who
score between four and six points are in fair condition; infants with a score
below four are in distress and need lifesaving measures. See Table 1-1 for a
complete explanation of Apgar scoring.

Baby’s post-birth routine also includes:
 Measurements: Baby’s length, weight, and head and chest measure-
ments are recorded in the delivery room. The average infant ranges any-
where from 18 to 22 inches; normal weight can range from just-under-7
up to 10 pounds; head circumference averages around 13 centimeters.
 Vitamin K: Baby will be given a Vitamin K injection, which promotes
blood clotting.
 Eye drops: Erythromycin drops are placed in Baby’s eyes to prevent
gonoccocal or chlamydial infections.
 PKU test: Baby’s heel is pricked for a blood sample to test for
Phenylketonuria (or PKU, a metabolic disorder), thyroid disease, and
other disorders 48 hours post-delivery. Tests may vary from state to
state. Also, expanded testing is available at parents’ cost. Your pediatri-
cian will discuss the need for any further testing with you.
 Blood typing: Baby’s blood type will be tested if Mom has type O or an
Rh-negative blood type. Under these circumstances, Mom and Baby may
have incompatible blood types, and Baby could develop jaundice and/or
anemia.
24
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

The umbilical cord blood contains stem cells (immune system cells that have
the capacity to develop themselves into other types of cells), which have
been a hot topic of conversation in the news lately. These cells can be banked
(stored) for future treatment of certain cancers, as well as immune and
genetic disorders. If you’re interested in finding out more about banking stem
cells, ask your doctor or even try an Internet search at home. For more infor-
mation, including a look at the pros and cons of banking your baby’s cord
blood, check out www.cord-blood.org.
No pictures, please! Mom’s 
experience after the birth
Very few brand-new moms look or feel like a million bucks right after giving
birth. And why would they? They’ve just been through an exhausting and
physically demanding experience that may have included highlights like an
episiotomy (an incision at the base of the vagina that prevents tearing during
delivery) or the appearance or worsening of hemorrhoids from all that push-
ing. Other lingering effects from the birthing process may be bloodshot eyes
or broken blood vessels around the eyes (also due to the strain of pushing)
and a shaky feeling, due to having used every muscle in your body to get
Baby out of the womb. Whether you’ve had a natural birth or a cesarean 
section, you’re bound to be feeling tired and anxious after delivery.
The aftereffects of giving birth are temporary, but if you’re overly sensitive
about your image in pictures, delay the family photos for a day or two. When
you look back on these pictures, you may want to focus on the bundle of joy
in your arms, and not on how exhausted and pained you appear to be.
Don’t panic! Baby’s less-than-perfect
appearance
In many cases, labor is just as hard on Baby as it is on Mom. Some kids seem
to pop right out, but others take their sweet time making their debut, which
can leave a newborn with a pointy head, smushed facial features, and a gen-
erally surprising (even disappointing) appearance in the days after delivery.
A baby who has been delivered with the use of a vacuum or forceps may
have swelling or bruises on her head.
Good news: Baby’s features will realign themselves over the next few weeks,
and she’ll eventually be the gorgeous little thing you knew she would be.
25
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

Immediately after birth, Baby may be covered in a thick, cheesy coating
called the vernix caseosa, which protected her skin in utero. She’ll be wiped
down by the nurses in the delivery room.
Baby’s skin will be blotchy and her hands and feet may be purple from time
to time. This is all due to poor circulation and will improve over the first
couple of weeks.
Many new moms are dismayed to realize that their newborns look nothing
like the babies on TV or in magazines. Those babies are most likely several
months older and have had ample time to overcome the less desirable effects
of the birthing process.
Bond. Mom and Baby bond.
Bonding. What is it? Basically, it’s the development of a feeling of intimacy
between you and your child. You bond with your baby throughout pregnancy,
of course, but the bond becomes even more pronounced after birth.
So here you are, just having given birth. Because you’ve already spent nine
months with this child in the womb, you should know what each cry means,
what your baby wants when she’s moving her head from side to side, looking
like she wants to suck on something. You should know how often she’s going
to sleep, and what to expect from her personality — right?
Not necessarily. Even parents who take to their new roles right away have
moments where things aren’t going well. And many parents feel completely
overwhelmed from the get-go. You may expect to magically turn into Parent
Extraordinaire at the moment your child arrives, but that just isn’t the case
for everyone. Some parents find that they learn about Baby as they go and
that their attachment deepens each day.
Give yourself a break here if you’re feeling like you’ve given birth to a
stranger. You have. You need to give yourself time to get to know this little
person.
You can be a great parent even if you never had any interest in dolls as a
child, and even if you’ve never babysat or particularly enjoyed the company
of children. Even if you’ve never had a nurturing bone in your body, things
change when you have your own child; the change may not be immediate,
but it will definitely happen. (You have a hard time believing someone when
they say they would give their own life for their child? Give yourself a couple
of months, and you’ll wonder how you could have ever felt differently.)
26
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

You may not have the slightest idea of how to care for Baby at this point.
Thinking about life at home, alone with Baby, terrifies some new parents. So
ask for help, and don’t be embarrassed. Your nurses see new parents every
single day; there isn’t a question out there (about babies, anyway) that they
haven’t already been asked. The nurses want to see you go home happy and
somewhat confident about the days to come, so use ’em while you’ve got ’em.
Many hospitals also have newborn care classes along with the labor/delivery
classes (breastfeeding classes too). Take advantage of these opportunities
when available. For more tips on bonding with Baby, see Chapter 6.
Rock-a-Bye Baby: The Hospital Nursery
After Baby gets the all-clear from the delivery room doctor, midwife, or nurse
practitioner attending the birth, and when you’re ready to be moved to a
room on the maternity wing, Baby will be rolled off to the nursery, where his
every need is met by a staff of trained professionals. (Notice this says Baby’s
every need — not Mom’s every whim. The nursery staff shouldn’t be con-
fused with servants.)
Rooming-in
Most hospitals give Mom the choice of whether she wants Baby to sleep in
the same room with her or in the nursery. This can be heaven on earth, or a
living nightmare. If you had a very long and/or difficult delivery, or if you’re
just worn out from the experience, you may want to catch a few zzzzs by
yourself, especially if Baby is restless. If you’re breastfeeding, the nurses are
going to bring Baby to you every couple of hours anyway; there’s no point in
losing more sleep than you have to. Remember, you’ll be on call 24 hours a
day for the next 18 years. You’ll have plenty of time to get to know Baby over
that time period.
If you’re feeling great and Baby’s happy as a little clam, rooming-in can be one
of the best experiences you ever have, establishing a bond with your little
cutie right off the bat. For more on bonding with your infant, see the section
“Bond. Mom and Baby bond.” earlier in the chapter.
Relying on help from hospital staff
Although you can safely say that most nurses in this field genuinely love
babies, the maternity wing nurse is a very busy individual. He’s responsible
27
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

for assessing and monitoring your health, and for providing you with all of
the information you should have about Baby and about your recovery before
you leave for home. He’s also responsible for assessing and monitoring
Baby’s health. And because most hospitals adhere to strict budgets, chances
are your nurse has other patients, too. That’s enough to keep an experienced
nurse running from bed to bed for most of the day.
So what can you reasonably expect from the newborn nursing staff — and,
just as importantly, what kind of requests are likely to be met with tight
smiles or flat-out refusals? Your nurse is there to help you care for your baby
and your health. Feel free to call on him in the following situations:
 You need time to yourself. You chose to have Baby room-in, and now
you’re not getting any sleep? Use that call button. A nurse won’t think
you’re a bad mom for sending Baby to the nursery. Will Baby be coddled
there? That really depends on the number of staff available at the time,
but even if Baby cries a bit, he’ll bear no long-term scars from the 
experience.
 You could use some help with breastfeeding. You can discuss feeding
information with your nurse, and she can give you some tips for easy
breast- or bottlefeeding. The lactation specialist may be around during
the daylight hours, but at 3 a.m., your nurse can talk you and Baby
through latching on.
 You’re concerned about pain or other health issues. Your health is a
major issue after delivery. Possible complications include infection and
hemorrhage. One of your nurse’s main concerns is monitoring your
recovery, which includes helping you to manage your pain. She’s willing
to discuss any pain medications your doctor has prescribed and answer
any questions you have about your recovery.
 You have questions about taking care of Baby. Nobody becomes an
expert immediately after giving birth. Feel free to call on your nurse
when you’re unsure about anything baby care–related.
Before you leave for home, your nurse will give you very specific instruc-
tions on how to care for Baby, including how to support her neck, how to
dress and bathe her, how to keep her safe, and how to keep your own
sanity. Listen carefully, and ask as many questions as you can think of.
On the flip side, your nurse won’t be happy about personal requests. She
won’t run down to the gift shop for you. She will expect you to follow the hos-
pital rules, within reason. Sneaking in one extra family member may be some-
thing she’s willing to tolerate, but inviting the entire clan in at once may be
more than she can overlook.
Send relatives to the cafeteria for snacks and drinks — the nurse isn’t a wait-
ress and usually has a lot of other things to keep her busy. Most postpartum
floors have a refreshment room for patients right on the unit and the staff
should be happy to give you and your partner access.
28
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

Routine nursery practices
So what goes on in the hospital nursery, anyway? It looks so quiet and peace-
ful (well, if you can get past the crying babies), but it’s really a hopping place.
Baby will have her first complete physical exam by her pediatrician while
she’s in the nursery. (If you haven’t chosen a doctor yet, the pediatrician on
call will perform the exam. Tips for finding the right pediatrician are listed in
Chapter 1.) There’s quite a bit to this, actually, including evaluation of:
 Measurements (height, weight, head circumference): It’s normal for an
infant’s weight to drop several ounces by the time she’s discharged. The
length measurement may differ from the one done in the delivery room
for the simple reason that some babies won’t hold still for this.
 Heart sounds: The doc is looking for a normal heart rate and the
absence of any heart defects.
 Respiration: A baby’s breathing rate is a bit irregular, but a normal
infant has 30 to 60 respirations per minute.
 The umbilical cord site: Are there signs of infection?
 Palpation of Baby’s internal organs: The doctor will press on Baby’s
abdomen to feel her organs, making sure none are enlarged.
 Extremities, including hips: The doctor will check for signs of disloca-
tion, which indicates that the top of the thighbone isn’t sitting in the hip
correctly.
 Genitals: Are they formed correctly? Any signs of birth defects in this
area?
 Newborn reflexes: There are quite a few reflexes that doctors check for,
all of which are an indication of Baby’s neurological health.
Considering circumcision
If your baby is of the male variety and you choose to have him circumcised,
you can expect that procedure to be carried out by a physician in the nurs-
ery — unless, that is, circumcision is part of a religious ritual for you and you
plan to have it done outside the hospital.
Many parents debate the validity of this practice, wondering whether it’s nec-
essary or just a barbaric tradition forced upon baby boys in this country. No
matter what you decide, someone will tell you that you made the wrong deci-
sion. Tell yourself right now that you’re the parents, and it’s your opinion
that counts.
29
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

The upside of circumcising your infant:
 He will look like everyone else, including Dad (if Dad’s circumcised, 
that is), and his friends. Although this may not sound like a valid “pro”
to you, it is a common reason parents cite in favor of circumcision.
 Lowered risk of infections at this time in his life (including urinary tract
infections), and lowered risk of certain STDs and cancer of the penis
later in life. These benefits arise because it’s easier to keep a circum-
cised penis clean.
 If he decides that he wants to be circumcised when he’s older, the proce-
dure could be far more traumatic for him then. As an infant, of course,
he’ll have no recollection of the circumcision.
And the downside:
 Circumcision carries the risk of complications — including hemorrhage
and infection, although rare.
 Although for many years, doctors believed babies didn’t feel a thing,
studies have shown that babies do feel pain during the procedure. Some
physicians use local anesthesia; some hospitals allow the baby to suck
on a sugar water soaked pacifier during the procedure to help alleviate
pain. The good news is that most babies fall asleep half way through the
procedure; after the clamp is on, it stops hurting.
No matter what your decision, discuss circumcision with your pediatrician
first. It’s a surgical procedure; make an informed decision.

Baby needs to eat. Do you want to breastfeed or bottlefeed? What are the
pros and cons of each? Which is simplest? Which is best for Baby? This sec-

tips for making each a successful venture.
Deciding between breast and bottle
You’ll be making lots of decisions in the days leading up to Baby’s arrival;
including whether you’re going to breastfeed or bottlefeed the little darling.
This is one of those decisions you need to make before Baby arrives, because
she may be hungry in the delivery room. If you’ve made the decision to nurse,
you’ll put Baby to breast as soon as possible in order to stimulate the flow.

Breastfeeding is very popular in some areas of the country and not-so-popular
in other regions. If you’re leaning toward the bottle because you can’t 
stand the idea of turning your chest into a snack bar, try to have an open
mind about the whole thing. Give it a shot. You may be surprised at how
easily Baby takes to the breast, and how you really don’t mind so much 
after all.
Breastfeeding pros:
 You never have to mix or warm a bottle, which is a great perk when
Baby cries at 2 a.m.
 It’s free.
 Very low possibility of allergic reactions.
 Studies show that breastfeeding gives Baby a permanent boost to her
immune system (she gets a healthy dose of your antibodies every time
she nurses).
 Breastfed babies are less likely to suffer from constipation and gas.
 It really is a sweet way to bond with your child.
Breastfeeding cons:
 It may be painful — at first. When your milk comes in, your breasts
might feel like hot rocks, and until your nipples are used to Baby’s suck-
ing, they may be sore, too.
 Risk of nipple and breast infection (mastitis). If Baby is an eager little
eater, or isn’t latching on the right way, your nipple could develop a
crack, which might allow germs from Baby’s mouth into your breast.
 You’re the sole provider of food for your child, which keeps you incredi-
bly busy, particularly during the first few weeks, when Baby feeds at
least eight to ten times per day.
 You have to watch what you eat. Strong or acidic foods, like garlic or
tomatoes, may cause your milk to smell funny, which may lead to Baby’s
refusal to eat. Caffeine and alcohol also enter the breast milk, and limit-
ing their use is recommended while breastfeeding.
 You have to deal with leakage. Investing in some thick, cotton nursing
pads and wearing dark tops can help eliminate embarrassing moments.
Though most doctors will tell you that breastfeeding is best for Baby, it’s not
always possible — for a variety of reasons. If Mom is sick after delivery, for
example, she may not be able to nurse. There’s also always the possibility of
Mom having inverted nipples (which make it extremely difficult for Baby to
latch on) or simply not producing enough milk. Not to worry. Baby can get all
of the nourishment she needs from a bottle of formula.

Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

Bottlefeeding pros:
 Feeding your child isn’t your sole responsibility. Your partner has no
excuse not to get up with Baby once in a while.
 You can clearly see how much Baby is eating.
 Bottlefeeders usually sleep through the night sooner than their breast-
fed peers do. (More on this in Chapter 8.)
 Feeding struggles are minimized. You just don’t often see a baby who
doesn’t take easily to bottlefeeding (as opposed to breastfed babies,
who sometimes flat-out refuse to feed from their moms).
Bottlefeeding cons:
 Formula is expensive.
 Baby doesn’t get any of Mom’s immunities.
 Feeding Baby requires planning — you always have to make sure you
have a bottle in the diaper bag, and formula in the house.
 You’ll be washing bottles and nipples constantly.
Here comes the milk!
Whether you decided to breastfeed or not, your breast milk comes in around
the third day after giving birth. If you are breastfeeding, you’ll start nursing
as soon as Baby is ready and willing to eat, but until your milk comes in, he’ll
be receiving colostrum, the pre-milk that includes antibodies that are very
important to Baby’s health.
Your breasts may feel like rocks on the day your milk comes in. They will 
be engorged with milk. They may be hot. They may hurt. They may be red.
They’ll begin to leak. And when Baby tries to latch on, you may wince in 
pain. You may ask yourself why you ever thought that you could do this —
and why no one ever told you how painful it was. Mercifully, the pain lasts 
for only a short time (a day or two).
Keep several bags of frozen veggies in your freezer at home to use as com-
presses when your breasts feel as though they may explode. Also, try to
nurse as often as possible (every 2 hours or so) to alleviate engorgement.
Choosing to bottlefeed won’t spare you entirely from the pain of engorged
breasts. To ease the pain associated with full breasts, follow the tips for
weaning mothers in Chapter 16.

Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

Getting started breastfeeding
A nurse or lactation specialist will be there to help when you first put Baby 
to breast. Lactation specialists are there to answer all of your breastfeeding
questions and to make sure that you’re comfortable nursing Baby before
you’re discharged. Even if things are going fairly well, listen to the advice
you’re given — after you go home, you may have less support in this venture,
and you want to feel confident enough with this method of feeding Baby to 
be able to quiet any anxious relative who pressures you to stick a bottle in
Baby’s mouth if a nursing session isn’t going well.
Ask your nurse or lactation specialist for outside help if you need it. Certain
lactation specialists can visit you at home in the days and weeks after deliv-
ery to ensure that you and Baby are, indeed, getting the hang of nursing, and
to offer advice about how to make things go more smoothly. There are also
support groups which offer advice and encouragement for nursing mothers.
Your hospital or pediatrician may be able to hook you up with a local group.
Your pediatrician can also offer breastfeeding advice and support.
The most important thing for you to remember about breastfeeding is that
the more relaxed you are about it, the more likely you are to succeed at it.
Although breastfeeding can be difficult for some mothers and babies, that
doesn’t make it impossible. Breastfeeding sometimes starts off in a less-than-
ideal manner — and you shouldn’t be discouraged if Baby doesn’t take to 
the breast like a pro. You have plenty of time to work out these kinks, and
maintaining a positive outlook is important in these early days.
Getting Baby to latch on can be the biggest hurdle to clear when beginning
breastfeeding. Some tips for easing this process:
 Try to feed Baby as soon as possible after delivery. He’s likely to be
hungry then, and may work extra-hard to get some nourishment. In the
hours and days after delivery, he may be very drowsy and uninterested
in putting forth the effort needed to latch on.
 Cup your breast in your hand and run the nipple on Baby’s lips in order
to stimulate his rooting reflex (which causes him to follow anything
touching his mouth).
 Squeeze a drop of colostrum out of the nipple and have it ready and
waiting for him.
 When he opens his mouth, allow him to latch on to the breast. Don’t pull
back. Relax as much as possible.
 Make sure he can breathe comfortably through his nostrils. Signs that
he’s getting milk include sucking motions, swallowing sounds, a calm
baby (who isn’t fighting to get food), and a softening of the breast.
33
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

Let him nurse as long as he wants; he’s learning a brand-new eating tech-
nique that doesn’t come easy to all infants. You need to burp Baby after he
finishes each breast. If he’s having trouble emptying one or both sides, try
burping him more often.
There are several different breastfeeding positions: The football hold and the
cradle positions are among the most popular. The one you use depends on
what works best for you and Baby.
For a more complete look at breastfeeding, check out Breastfeeding For
Dummies by Sharon Perkins and Carol Vannais (Wiley).
Introducing the bottle
What kind of bottle is best for Baby? It really depends on what you’re going 
to be most comfortable with. The standard baby bottle is easy to fill with for-
mula, but is more likely to allow bubbles into Baby’s system, which may result
in a gassy, wailing, spit-up-spewing child. Bottles with collapsible inserts elimi-
nate most of the bubbles, but take more time to fill and prepare (you have to
squeeze the air out of the insert).
Water for mixing Baby’s bottle doesn’t need to be boiled as long as you have
a safe water supply. Also, bottles can be washed in hot soapy water or in the
dishwasher — they don’t need sterilization.
Bottles with collapsible inserts come with their own nipples, which are sup-
posed to mimic real breasts. Standard bottles also include nipples, but you
may have already discovered that a host of different replacement nipples are
available. If your child is doing fine with one particular nipple, don’t try to
force another one on her. If she starts to balk at taking her bottle, though, it
may be time to try a new topper to that bottle. There’s no hard-and-fast rule
as to the nipple-type recommended by nine out of ten babies. You’ll have to
try several different types until baby stops squirming and starts sucking
down her formula.

Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 
What’s it really like to breastfeed?
It’s strange at first, no doubt about it — just real-
izing that your body is actually producing nour-
ishment for your child is mind blowing. And it
may be a bit uncomfortable in the earliest days,
until your nipples get used to the sucking and
you get used to having to bare your breasts
(though not completely) every couple of hours.
After you and Baby settle into it, though, breast-
feeding will probably seem perfectly natural and
very easy.

What kind of formula will you choose? You can ask your pediatrician for a
recommendation, but he may very well tell you that all formulas are the same
and you should choose what’s most convenient for you. Ready-to-feed formu-
las don’t need any mixing; they’re like fast food for Baby (albeit much more
nutritious than your average drive-through fare). However, they’re the most
expensive formulas. Liquid concentrate formula is the middle ground; it
requires mixing with water, and is less expensive than the ready-to-feeds but
more expensive than the powdered formulas, which also require mixing.
Powdered mixes go a long way and are the cheapest option per feeding.
When bottlefeeding Baby, make sure her head is higher than the rest of her
body. Don’t let her lie down flat while she eats or “prop” the bottle on a toy 
or towel while she eats. Lying flat increases her risk of developing an ear
infection; both of these positions ensure that she’s also missing out on 
snuggle time with you, which is an important part of establishing a bond 
with your child.
Expect your newborn to eat 2 to 4 ounces every two to four hours. She won’t
respect the fact that you’re used to calling it quits for the day at 10 p.m. and
sleeping undisturbed for eight hours; she’s going to need to eat around the
clock. She may eat more during the day and less at night, or vice-versa. Let
her establish how much she’s going to eat and when.
Tips for mixing formula:
 Make sure to use a clean bottle. Remember, bottles can be washed in the
dishwasher.
 Use the scoop provided if you’re using powdered formula. In any event,
follow directions to the letter. Never try to create a super-nutrient-
packed formula by adding more formula to less water; likewise, don’t
dilute the formula with too much water.
 If you’re mixing more than one bottle at a time, store extras in the fridge.
There’s no need to warm them before feeding Baby.
 Store open cans of formula in the fridge and use them within 48 hours.
Store cans of powder covered, in a cool, dry place, and use within the
month.
 Pour out any bottles that have been sitting at room temperature for two
or more hours.
Make sure to burp Baby at least once in the middle of each feeding and imme-
diately after. You’ll figure out with time whether she needs more frequent
burping. If she slows down her eating while there’s still plenty left in the
bottle, chances are good she has an air bubble in her tummy. Get your burp
cloth handy, and prop her on your shoulder, gently patting her back, or prop
her against one hand on your lap while patting her back. For a look at some
common burping positions, refer to Figure 2-1.

In the hospital, the nurse will bring Baby to you whenever it’s time for him to
eat, whether he’s awake or not. The nurse will show you some useful tricks
for stimulating a little snoozer, including:
 Undressing him: While Baby is warm and comfy cozy in his blankets and
jammies, he may not want to be disturbed. This is a good time to change
a messy diaper and/or clothes, because this is usually sufficient activity
to wake a little sleepyhead. Undressing him down to his diaper may agi-
tate him just enough so that he realizes he is hungry, after all.
 Tickle, tickle: Take your finger and run it along the sole of his foot. Or
underneath his chin. Or along the sides of his mouth to stimulate his
rooting (sucking) reflex. This may be enough to bring him out of dream-
land long enough for him to eat.
Handling Special Situations
Some parents find themselves facing situations and/or emotions they weren’t
prepared for. You can do all the reading and research on pregnancy and deliv-
ery and still have no idea how you’ll fare in certain situations, simply because
of the nature of the circumstances. This section gives you tips for coping with
postpartum depression, handling two or more babies, and coping with a sick
child.
Postpartum depression
Your nurse will almost certainly go over the warning signs of postpartum
depression with you before you’re discharged. However, because you’ll also be
receiving so much other information and because you may be too exhausted to
remember half of it, I mention it in brief here.
Realize that many, many new moms (some studies suggest the majority of
them, in fact) suffer from normal baby blues in the first couple of weeks after
delivery, which may include bouts of anxiety, general sadness, and mood
swings. If you’re feeling this way, let it out — talk to your husband, your mom, a
friend, your doctor, or Baby’s pediatrician. You’re not the only woman who has
ever felt this way, and no one is going to think any less of you. This is a time of
major change in your life — emotionally and physically (your hormones, par-
ticularly, may be making you feel unlike yourself) — and that can wreak havoc
on your normal coping systems.
37
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

Severe postpartum depression tends to have a more gradual onset and lasts
for weeks. If you (or your partner) have any of the following symptoms in the
weeks after giving birth, call your doctor right away:
 Constant crying, perhaps for days on end
 Thoughts of harming Baby and/or yourself
 Severe fatigue or sleeplessness
 No motivation to care for yourself, Baby, or your family
 Feeling hopeless and/or helpless
Postpartum depression is real, and it’s treatable. There’s no shame in asking
for help if you need it, so don’t try to deal with it by yourself.
Many times blessed: Mom 
and the multiple birth
If you’re a first-time mom giving birth to more than one child, you probably
have nothing to compare this experience to — and so much the better for
you. Having two or more infants in the house at a time is obviously going to
be more time-consuming than bringing home one little guy or girl, but you’ll
find a way to balance your time and to give each child enough love and atten-
tion. You’ll have to give it time, but everyone will fall into a schedule eventu-
ally, and none of you will be any worse for the wear.
That being said, make sure you have plenty of help lined up for that first month
at home. You’re going to be juggling babies while you’re recovering from giving
birth — that’s no small task. On top of that, you’ll have the logistics to work
out (what’s the fastest and easiest way to get both twins into their car seats
and into the backseat before someone needs to eat?). Having a good support
system around you during the early weeks will make your transition much,
much easier.
When Baby needs extra special care
Finding out that your child has been born with special health concerns is
heartbreaking and terrifying. Fortunately, we’re living in an age of medical
breakthroughs, and children who are born with special needs are routinely
identified and treated earlier than ever before, which means these kids have
a better chance at a normal life.
38
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

If Baby is identified at birth as having a special health concern, he may be
taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for evaluation and treat-
ment. Chapter 18 covers what happens there, and what you can expect.
Gulp! Leaving for Home
After Baby is in your arms, you realize how fragile he really is. His head flops
around if you’re not holding him correctly, and his little fingers and toes are
so tiny, you’re afraid you’ll break them. Is the hospital staff really going to
trust you to take this child home? You’re really going to have to dress and
diaper him by yourself? Don’t they know that you need help?!
Relax. You can do this. In this section, we walk you through some of the first
steps. But don’t forget to bring your packed diaper bag along. (For more on
this, turn to Chapter 3.)
Dressing Baby
When dressing Baby for her departure from the hospital (or any other time, 
in fact) you need to pick an outfit that’s appropriate for the weather. Some
moms may advise you to dress Baby similarly to how you’re dressed for the
day (meaning that if you’re wearing shorts, you shouldn’t wrap Baby up in
flannel). Good rule of thumb, but if you’re always sweating (even in the middle
of winter), you may not be able to accurately judge how warm or cool Baby 
is (and because infants can’t regulate their body temperature the way adults
can, you have to make sure that your child isn’t over- or underdressed).
Layers are a good choice for this reason. You can tell if Baby is too warm by
feeling for sweat, particularly on the back of her neck. If she’s perspiring,
remove a layer. If she feels cool to the touch, give her a sweater or a blanket.
When you’re dressing Baby, always take special care to see that her neck is
being supported. She won’t be able to hold her head up consistently on her
own until she’s about 4 months old.
Try to find clothing for Baby with lots of snaps. The snaps may seem tedious
at first, but if you can get Baby’s head through a wide shirt hole (surrounded
by snaps) without feeling as though you’re pulling her through a paper towel
tube, you’ll both be happier. Make sure you snap up Baby’s legs, too, so that
her little toes don’t get caught if she kicks.
39
Chapter 2: Smoothing the Transition to Parenthood

Now boarding . . . Mom and Dad’s car
If the idea of dressing Baby for the first time is intimidating, the prospect of
taking him for a ride in the car is just insane. (Why do these nurses trust you
so much with your child’s life? Don’t they know you’ve never done this
before?)
It may feel strange when you’re actually outside of the hospital with your
Baby, ready to roll on home. You may feel like someone from the hospital
should really be tagging along, making sure you’re being safe enough, giving
you pointers for safely transporting your infant from Point A to Point B. (If
you’re feeling this kind of pressure, this will be the single safest journey
you’ve ever made.)
No hospital will allow you to leave with Baby without first confirming that
you have a car seat. It’s a law in every state that infants need to be in one,
and for good reason. Your arms can’t protect your child in the event of an
accident. He needs good, sturdy support in the car — at all times.
Car seat installation differs widely, and unfortunately, some reports from
police agencies indicate that most car seats may be installed incorrectly. You
should ideally try to get the seat into your car before Baby is born — just in
case there are any major incompatibilities. If you’re just not sure whether
you’ve installed it correctly, call your auto club, your local police, your hospi-
tal, or your Baby’s pediatrician and ask about local car seat inspection sites.
Timing your departure
When Baby is fed and changed, it’s time to hit the road. Or, better stated,
don’t put Baby in his car seat ten minutes before he’s supposed to eat, and/or
with a loaded diaper. Although some babies sleep through anything while
riding in the car, yours may not be one of them. A screaming baby is a major
distraction to even the safest driver, so it’s in everyone’s best interest to take
care of Baby’s needs before you turn that ignition key.
Arriving home
You pull into your driveway (or parking spot) and realize you’ve made it from
the hospital with Baby in the car, and everyone is safe. Whew!
Now what?
40
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy Happy Start 

Don’t plan on having a house filled with guests when you come home with
Baby. Although everyone is chomping at the bit to see the little guy, establish
a firm but friendly time limit (such as saying you won’t be up for visitors for
at least couple days or even a week — and no, your mother is not a visitor, 
so if you want her there to hold your hand, you don’t need to explain that to
your mother-in-law). You’ve just been through a major physical ordeal, and
you need to give yourself time to rest, even if you’re feeling mostly fine and
dandy.
You also want to give yourself some time to settle into this brand-new phase
of life. Life is no longer all about you and your husband and what the two of
you feel like doing at any given moment — it’s all about Baby now, and his
schedule (which may be irregular for the next few months). It’ll take time for
you to fall into the groove of caring constantly for another human. That’s nat-
ural. It will be much easier on you, though, if you aren’t also feeling pressured
to invite the world over and serve them coffee while they’re there.

Chapter 3
Hitting the Road with 
Baby on Board
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to pack
 Surviving a trip with Baby
 Redefining your idea of a vacation
 Ensuring Baby’s safety
You already know that staying home and caring for Baby can be stressful.
Try taking that show on the road without adequately preparing for it,
and you find out what real stress is!
Traveling with your child can be a veritable piece of cake, or it can be a
nerve-shattering experience. The secret to not losing your mind? Look at
each trip as a learning experience for your next venture.
Preparing for the Journey
You want to make sure before you leave your house that you’ve packed
everything you’ll need while you’re en route. If you’re traveling domestically,
you can probably purchase almost anything you’ve forgotten, after you arrive
at your destination.
Checklist for traveling with babies:
 The diaper bag: This bag may be the most important factor in your trav-
eling success. Move the contents of your changing table right into your
bag. Here’s what you need:
• Diapers: Don’t underestimate here. Pack plenty of extras.
• Wipes: Again, don’t skimp here. You need them for diaper changes
and for cleaning hands en route. You can buy a portable wipe con-
tainer at the grocery store.

• Diaper rash cream: Sitting in a car seat for long periods could
make Baby’s bottom red.
• Bottles, formula, and water: If you’re bottlefeeding, or if you’re
feeding Baby breast milk from the bottle.
• Burp cloths: Pack at least two burp cloths. Napkins won’t do the
trick if she spews on your lap in the airport.
• Bibs: To keep bottlefeeders and solid eaters as clean as possible so
that you won’t have to change outfits at 30,000 feet.
• Pacifiers, if Baby uses them: You want to promote calmness while
traveling; if the binkie does the trick, use it.
• Change of clothing: Or two, or three. Despite your best efforts at
keeping Baby clean, her outfit may start to stink. Also pack Ziploc
bags to hold soiled diapers (nobody else wants to smell that in the
airplane trash can) and to hold wet or spit-up covered clothes.
• Snacks, if Baby is old enough: Keep these simple and safe — noth-
ing sticky, nothing too chunky. Variety helps — include several
small bags of different snacks instead of one big bag of Cheerios.
• Toys: Bring along some of Baby’s favorites, but also have a few
brand-new playthings to keep Baby entertained. The quieter these
toys are, the happier you’ll be over the course of a long trip. (And
your fellow travelers will thank you, too.)
 Clothing appropriate for your destination: Again, don’t underestimate
here. If you’re going to your parents’ house, you can do some laundry
easily enough; if you’re headed to a hotel, however, you want enough
clean clothes to last most of the time you’re there. No one wants to
spend a vacation in a laundromat.
 A small container of laundry soap: To hand-wash or pretreat stains.
 Stroller: Most can be checked with the luggage at the airport. If you
have a car seat/stroller combination, call your airline to find out
whether you can store the stroller component onboard the plane or
whether it has to be checked.
 Carrier: If you’re planning on doing a lot of walking and you don’t want
to lug a stroller along, bring a front-carrier or a backpack (for an older
baby only).
 Portable crib: If you’re checking into a hotel, call ahead to reserve a
crib. If you’re going to your sister’s house, pack the portable crib.
 Medicines: You’re on vacation and Baby starts cutting her molars in the
middle of the night. Do you really want to search for a pharmacy? Pack
any pain and cold medication Baby has already been given. If Baby has
never had the need for any meds, check with her pediatrician before you
leave to discuss the best options and correct dosages.
44
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

 A watch set to home time: Baby doesn’t really care what time the clock
in a new time zone says — she wants to eat when she’s hungry. Having a
watch set to her time zone helps you to schedule your plans for the day.
 Bring your own car seat: You can check this on the plane. Car rental
companies may not have the most modern, up-to-date (and safety stan-
dards) car seats to rent, and they charge you a bundle to use them. 
Plus, you’re more familiar with how to strap your own seat into the 
car and how to strap the baby safely. It’s a hassle, but it’s best to bring
your own.
Traveling with Baby
Traveling with Baby is full of challenges, and just when you think you have
the hang of it, Baby grows and changes — and presents all kinds of new ways
to test your parental fortitude.
Planning a successful out-of-town excursion with your infant isn’t impossible —
in fact, because Baby will be far more active in a relatively short time, this is a
golden opportunity to bring your child along without having to chase after her.
When Baby moves past the infant stage, you’ll find that travel becomes a 
bit more of a challenge. For instance, when she cried at 1 month, she either
needed milk or a fresh diaper, but when she becomes more observant of 
the world around her, you have to worry about entertaining her during long
trips. If she develops very definite food preferences, you’ll be wise to have
her favorites close at hand to ward off the munchies (and crabbiness). And 
if she just can’t bear to be in that car seat, you’re going to wonder if you can
take another trip before Baby’s a big kid (and out of the seat for good).
No matter when or where you travel, flexibility is the key to enduring — and
actually enjoying — this new phase of travel.
Allotting a whole lotta time
No matter where you’re headed with Baby — halfway around the world or 
to Grandma’s house — give yourself plenty of extra time. Babies are unpre-
dictable and totally unconcerned with punctuality. And you, as a somewhat
frazzled new parent, are likely to find yourself running through the house at
the last minute looking high and low for the blankie Baby just won’t leave
home without.
45
Chapter 3: Hitting the Road with Baby on Board

Make lists of everything you need for your trip and pack early. Caring for an
infant is a labor-intensive, time-consuming job, and you’ll find out soon enough
that the combination of fatigue and the sheer overload of this new, exciting
experience can make a parent forgetful. You may find yourself rifling through
the diaper bag during a long car trip, knowing that you meant to pack extra
wipes, but finding none.
Baby loves his schedule, so always make sure that Baby’s needs are going to 
be met at about the time he’ll expect, or adjust his schedule slightly to work in
your favor. Feeding him before you get in line at the airport ticket counter —
even though he isn’t scheduled to eat for another 30 minutes — will make your
life much easier (when you’re still standing in line 30 minutes after he was sup-
posed to eat). This kind of adjustment takes planning, and planning is difficult
when you run into the airport with no time to spare.
Although your mother may put off serving dinner if you’re 20 minutes late,
the airline is going to be indifferent. They won’t hold your flight just because
Baby filled his diaper as you were walking out the door. Even if you’ve never
been punctual —perhaps especially if you’ve never been punctual — you
need to give yourself some wiggle room when you’re traveling with Baby and
time is of the essence.
If you’re taking a long car trip, plan on making frequent stops to let Baby out
of his seat — for comfort reasons, for diaper changes, and for feedings. These
extra stops may stretch a five-hour trip into the six-and-a-half hour range.
Keeping a positive attitude about the length of a trip with Baby is of the
utmost importance. There’s really nothing you can do about it — the kid has
to eat, he needs a fresh diaper every few hours, and he has to get out of that
seat once in a while.
Try not to overplan the trip (by marking exactly where and how often you’re
going to stop). Babies are unpredictable people. Maybe your little guy will
sleep from Point A to Point B. Or maybe he’ll start wailing way before your
first planned stop.
It’s wise for mom to get out and walk around every two hours during a car
trip or flight. Prolonged sitting can increase the risk of blood clots in your
legs during the postpartum period.
Feeding Baby en route
With all the luggage and lists of last-minute things to do, it may have slipped
your mind that you’re going to work Baby’s normal feeding schedule into
your travel plans. If you’re breastfeeding, you’re about to be faced with a lack
of privacy that perhaps you haven’t thought about much until now; if Baby
takes a bottle, you need to have a plan for keeping the formula flowing while
you’re en route and out of town.

Breastfeeding
What’s more uncomfortable than breastfeeding Baby in an airport terminal?
If you answered “A lot of things,” your trip is going to be a breeze. If you
answered “Nothing!” you may already be trying to think of another way to
feed your child while you’re traveling.
Breastfeeding in public is no longer the big deal it was generations ago. You
don’t have to be overly modest, though, to feel a little strange about nursing
in public areas. Unfortunately, when you’re traveling, you don’t always have a
lot of privacy.
Use a baby blanket as a shield. It’s light enough so that Baby won’t overheat
underneath it, and big enough to cover you completely. Or carry Baby in a
sling. (Where it’s advisable — babies should not be in a sling during a flight.
The next section addresses how to safely transport Baby on an airplane.)
Chances are, no one will even know when Baby is nursing.
Some airports have a lounge for nursing mothers. This may be located in or
near the restroom, and the space often provides a chair and some quiet for a
feeding session.
Breastfeeding is (literally) the most natural thing in the world, and if you’re
feeling fine about nursing Baby whenever, wherever, don’t hesitate to do so
because you’re worried about offending others. (If they’re truly bothered by
you feeding your child, let them find another spot to sit.) It’s legal to breast-
feed your child in every state (as long as you have a legal right to be on the
premises — in other words, as long as you aren’t breastfeeding while tres-
passing). Ignore (or educate) anyone who tells you otherwise.
Bottlefeeding
Feeding a bottlefed infant on the road takes some planning. It’s easiest to
pack bottles in your diaper bag filled partway with liquid formula base, and
to have distilled water on hand to dilute it, just to be on the safe side: You
don’t want to use an unfamiliar water source to mix Baby’s bottle. As long as
there’s a safe water supply available, water to mix formula doesn’t need to 
be boiled — and while you’re sure of the cleanliness of your home water
supply (or the water at Grandma’s house), you don’t want to take risks with
the water in foreign countries, where hygiene standards are not always on
par with our own. If you’re going camping, or your only water source on a
road trip is the rest stops along the way (which aren’t always clean and don’t
always provide potable water), it’s best to bring along a jug of distilled water
for Baby’s formula. That way, there’s no question about the safety or cleanli-
ness of the water supply.
47
Chapter 3: Hitting the Road with Baby on Board

Well water should never be used in Baby’s bottles or for preparing his food,
as it may be high in nitrates, which can lead to something called blue baby
syndrome. (More details on this in Chapter 10.)
Make sure that you’ve packed enough formula in case you’re delayed some-
where unexpectedly.
Staying safe on airplanes
Jetting off to Paris right after Baby is born? You may want to rethink that
plan, because most airlines don’t allow infants younger than 7 days old to fly,
and some doctors recommend that you keep Baby out of the friendly skies
until she’s at least 2 or 3 months old. Seems that airplanes are havens for
recycled germs, and a tiny infant is not only more susceptible to catching
colds (because her immune system is immature), but is also likely to get
much sicker than an older baby (and that’s the last thing you want when
you’re out of town).
Children under 2 fly free on domestic flights in the United States, as long as
they can sit on a caregiver’s lap (who is, of course, sitting in a full-fare seat).
We strongly recommend against this practice. It doesn’t take a horrifying
plane crash to injure a child who isn’t in a car seat during a flight — a bumpy
ride may be enough. Infants need constant neck support. The fact is, your
arms simply aren’t strong enough to protect Baby on an airplane in the event
of severe turbulence, a rough landing, or an emergency situation. Also, in the
event of depressurization, one air mask pops down from above your seat.
(Enough said.)
Pay the extra fare and get Baby her own seat, if only to give you peace of
mind during the trip. Airlines often offer a discount on seats for children
under 2, so they’re doing their part to keep Baby safe — make sure you do
yours.
You may wonder whether it’s safe to keep Baby in a front-carrier or a sling
during a flight. At least then, she’s being held close to your body no matter
what, and you’re not relying solely on your own strength to protect her. But
again, this isn’t something we recommend. Some airlines may not permit
these carriers during a flight, for one thing, and for another, there’s still the
issue of Baby’s fragile neck. The sling and the carrier just don’t offer the same
support as a car seat in the most extreme conditions. Why take the chance?
Handling car-seat disputes
The back arches. The wailing begins. Baby’s face and entire head turn red
from the force of his screaming. The car-seat wars have begun.
48
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

No matter how long the trip, avoid the urge to take Baby out of his seat when
you’re in a moving car or for long periods of time on a flight. He really is
safest in his seat, even if he doesn’t quite appreciate that fact. Accidents
happen quickly and most often without any warning. Your goal may be to
quiet and comfort him by removing him from the seat, but when you do that,
he’s also more exposed to the inherent dangers of travel.
But listening to Baby scream in the car is a safety hazard in itself if you’re the
one who’s driving, and you can be fairly certain that your fellow passengers
onboard the plane don’t want to hear Baby’s screeching for the next three
hours.
Do some troubleshooting to begin with:
 Could he be hungry?
 Does he need a new diaper?
 Is it naptime?
 Is he too warm?
 Is anything pinching or scratching him? (A tag in his shirt might be dri-
ving the poor kid crazy.)
On the other hand, if Baby’s just plain miserable because he’s confined
(unjustly, in his little mind) to his seat, and it’s nowhere near his naptime,
you’ll have to do your best to either distract or soothe him. This is the exact
reason you’ve packed that diaper bag to nearly bursting. Get out the goodies,
and keep them coming (slowly — don’t overwhelm and/or smother him with
surprises; this could annoy him even more). A favorite toy or stuffed animal
may do the trick or at least buy you a few minutes of quiet. A snack may
make him downright happy. Read one of his favorite baby books, play some
finger games, or quietly sing him a favorite lullaby. Baby’s ears may pop with
the change in altitude. A pacifier or bottle can help to ease this discomfort.
And even if naptime is fast approaching, don’t be confident that sleep will
just overtake your traveling baby. All bets are off when she’s not in her own
crib and in the midst of all sorts of new stimuli, which may cause her to fight
sleep. If she appears to be wide awake when she’s due for a snooze, rub her
little head. Offer her a pacifier. If you’re waiting for a flight, hold her, pat her
back, rock her back and forth. Even if she doesn’t fall asleep, you’ll probably
quiet her down for a while, and that’s better than nothing.
Remain calm — even if you’re extremely close to blowing a fuse while Baby is
demanding his right to be free of the car seat. Do whatever it takes — take
deep breaths, count to ten, concentrate on the scene out your window (or on
the tip of your shoe, for that matter) for a minute — but try not to react with
anger. Baby isn’t old enough to be reasoned with, and he’s not screaming to
49
Chapter 3: Hitting the Road with Baby on Board

be naughty. He just wants out of that seat — now. Raising your voice to him
will most likely make the situation worse. Two of the greatest challenges of
parenting are summoning patience and understanding when you need it
most. Think of this as an opportunity to practice these virtues. (No, really.)
Vacation? What Vacation?
Realize before you make your vacation plans that your traveling days have
changed forever. Gone are the days when you could sleep until 10 a.m., hit
the beach until 4 in the afternoon, nap until early evening, and top the night
off with drinks and dancing. Vacationing with babies and kids is pretty much
packing up your normal life and moving it to a more scenic locale. The kid
runs the show until he’s mature enough to accept that he isn’t the center of
the universe (about the next 20 years).
Schedules, fatigue, and frequent diaper changes are all part of your vacation
now. You probably won’t be eating in the finest restaurants or toting Baby
along to that hot new show. Instead, you’ll be eating in whichever restaurant
can serve you the fastest (Baby has no interest in watching you eat) and visit-
ing the local zoo.
You may be able to include some of the things you love to do when you travel
with Baby, but certain types of trips are of almost no interest to small chil-
dren. If you’re an avid hiker, for example, you may be able to tote Baby along
for a relatively short trek in a backpack carrier, but if spending all day sight-
seeing is your thing, you’re probably out of luck. Baby’s schedule and dislikes
dictate your planning. If she needs a two-hour nap in the afternoon and is in
bed at 7 p.m. every evening, you just have to work your daily itinerary
around her timetable. Ditto for mealtimes. And if the kid doesn’t like to sit
still in her stroller, you can forget planning any vacation that involves a lot of
walking on your part.
Choose a destination that mirrors Baby’s activity level. If she loves to run,
make sure you’re near a park. If she loves to sit and watch the world go by,
tote her around the big city. Don’t expect Baby to conform to your expecta-
tions of a particular vacation. Mold the activity levels to best suit her needs.
Generally speaking, it’s easiest to take babies somewhere you can reasonably
create the surroundings and comforts of home. Renting a house or condo 
is a good choice for this reason. You can still put Baby to bed on time, in 
her own room, and you won’t have to tiptoe around a hotel room for fear of
waking her.
50
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

Traveling with Baby is, for all of the extra planning and worry, completely
worth it. Every vacation is practice for the next one, and an added opportu-
nity to get to know your child better.
A bottlefed baby can be left behind with a trusted caregiver if Mom feels the
need to escape on her own (or with her spouse) for a few days. Breastfeeding
moms, on the other hand, may spend their entire vacation without Baby
pumping breast milk. Either way, when a new mom leaves Baby at home,
she’s often surprised to realize how much time she spends worrying or think-
ing about her child.
Keeping Baby Safe Away from Home
Having realistic expectations about vacationing with your child actually
means dreaming up anything that could possibly happen while you’re away.
Is he going to sleep well? Could he possibly get sick? Who will stay in the condo
(or hotel) with him while he naps, and who will get a nice, long break? Work
out as many details as you can before you leave, including the pre-emptive
strikes (packing cold medicine, for example), and you’ll have much less to
stress over when you arrive at your destination.
51
Chapter 3: Hitting the Road with Baby on Board
Revising your master vacation plan
Vacationing with a small child can feel like more
work than it’s worth, especially if you’re used to
taking care of no one but yourself when you travel.
Adapting gracefully goes a long way toward help-
ing you enjoy your trips with Baby. For example,
when their daughter Abby was an infant, Dr.
Gaylord and his wife took her on a camping trip.
Abby’s colic decided to come along for the ride,
but instead of packing it in and returning home, the
Gaylords found themselves fashioning a ham-
mock to swing and soothe their little one (thus also
sparing other campers from her cries). The family
had a successful first outing into the wild, and the
memories from that trip are, of course, priceless.
It’s hard to imagine — before finding yourself in
similar circumstances — that you can accept
and adapt to the workload involved with travel-
ing with a child and still be able to enjoy your-
self. It’s a whole new ballgame, for sure, but the
benefits outweigh the drawbacks by far. Every
time you take your child on a trip, she’s exposed
to new situations — and so are you. Essentially,
your child is learning about a different environ-
ment, while you’re learning more about her,
about yourself (and what you’re capable of
dealing with), and about your family dynamic.

Here are some tips for keeping Baby protected while you’re out of town 
with him:
 Assess any potential baby hazards the moment you arrive, and be pre-
pared to remedy them. Bring along a package of plug guards, for exam-
ple, and put drapery cords up high where Baby can’t reach.
 Bring sunscreen. Apply it often and liberally. Babies under 6 months of
age should be kept out of the sun entirely.
 Watch those waves. Even if it’s a relatively calm day, an unexpected
wave can come up on the beach, knocking Baby down and dragging him
into the water. Keep Baby out of the ocean, even if you’re carrying him. If
a wave hits you, you could lose your grip on your child. Stick to the
pool, and maintain constant physical contact with him there.
 Never leave Baby unattended. Not in a car, the airport, not in a hotel
room, not for a moment. An overheated car can turn into a deathtrap for
a child in a matter of just a few minutes, and though rare, abductions do
happen to normal people.
 Know where the nearest hospital or emergency room is. In the event
of illness or injury, you don’t want to lose any time finding help for Baby.

Chapter 4
Returning to Work?
In This Chapter
 Making the right decision for you
 Getting the best childcare
W
hile you were pregnant, you may have thought that working after
Baby was born would be a piece of cake. After all, you’re far more
familiar with the parameters of your job than with the parameters of parent-
ing; so going back to work is really no big deal.
Except that you have to find someone qualified and capable to care for your
child as well as you would care for her yourself. And you have to leave Baby.
Nothing is easy ’bout that.
Looking for good childcare can seem like a crapshoot — after reading this
chapter, we hope you will feel it is less of a gamble and more of an informed
decision. For a more complete look at hunting down the right sitter or center,
read Choosing Childcare For Dummies by Ann Douglas (Wiley).
Making the Big Decision
Every mom is a working mom. (And that ain’t just lip service.) Some moms,
of course, are faced with the decision of whether to work outside of the
home. For many, that decision looms toward the end of the second month,
when six- and eight-week maternity leaves come to an end. Some new moms
have to make the decision even sooner, out of economic need or because
they simply don’t have the leave time from their jobs.
Realize from the start that each situation has its benefits and its drawbacks.
Moms who work in an office building sometimes suffer from the heartbreak 
of not being with their babies, and moms who stay home sometimes feel as
though they’re not appreciated by society — or by their families.

Returning to work doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing situation. Maybe
easing back into the workplace part-time would work best for you; perhaps
taking a leave of absence for six months or a year is an option. You may be
able to quit your current job and easily find a new one whenever you’re ready
to jump back into the workforce. Get creative with your thinking here; resist
the temptation to simply follow the same path that your friends have fol-
lowed when faced with juggling kids and work. Determine what will make you
feel best about yourself — as a parent and as a person — by asking yourself
what you need most. Do you have to be home with Baby in order to feel ful-
filled or do you need to have an adult, work-oriented outlet? Happy parents
have happy children. It’s really that simple.
Every mom eventually comes to the conclusion that she’s darned if she does
and darned if she doesn’t — work, that is. It’s best to make this major decision
based on what you and your partner feel is best for your family and then ignore
the naysayers (and there will always be someone who will think you’ve made
the wrong choice). So ignore your in-laws, resist the temptation to listen to
your work friends (who want you back at any cost), turn off the TV shows that
show working moms balancing everything easily and stay-at-home moms who
are miserable, and determine what’s going to work best for you.
Considering the pros and cons 
of working away from home
How will returning to your office job affect your tiny infant? Honestly, very
little, as long as you find a good caregiver to fill in for you. Baby is pretty
adaptable, and far too young to suffer from separation anxiety (something
which will kick in closer to the end of the first year). In order to make an
informed decision, give some thought to how returning to work may affect you. 
Here are a few things to consider:
 Work stress: How much will you be expected to do? How many hours
per week do you anticipate working? How often will you have to work
late?
 Baby — and all of his needs: Are you ready to leave a busy workday
and come home to the second shift (feeding, changing, and bathing
Baby)? Nursing Baby after you return to work is absolutely possible, but
it requires advanced planning on your part. We discuss this in detail
later in this chapter.
54
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

 Feeding and clothing the family: How will you tackle dinner and laun-
dry — the two ever-present (and unending) tasks of working moms
everywhere? How willing to pitch in and help out is your partner?
 General expenses: Does it make financial sense for you to return to
work? Although some moms choose to work because it fulfills them per-
sonally, others who are doing it strictly for the money are sometimes
surprised to find that they’re spending more than they’re making when
they rejoin the workforce. More on that in the “Divvying up the divi-
dends” section.
Some women are able to return to work without missing a step — from the
get-go, everything runs smoothly. Others find that returning is a lot harder
than they imagined. Your level of organization and your tolerance for things
not running as smoothly as you’d like (at least once in a while) will most
likely have some effect on how you come to view life as a working mom.
Divvying up the dividends
If you have the luxury of being able to make ends meet without returning to
work, and you have no desire to step foot in your former workplace, your
decision is an easy one. However, if you’re on the fence about going back to
work and you’re not quite sure about the money, add up the hidden costs of
working outside the home and make sure that you’re not going to lose money
by going off to work:
 Wardrobe: How much do you spend on pantyhose, shoes, and new busi-
ness outfits over the course of a month?
 Food: Do you brown-bag it or do you join your colleagues for frequent
lunches on the town? Does your morning commute include a pricey cup
of coffee and an expensive pastry?
 Commuting: Add up your gas and the wear-and-tear on your car. In some
instances, just having a second car is a work-related expense (though
out in the suburbs, most stay-at-home moms like to have a car at their
disposal, anyway).
 Childcare expenses: Day care, nanny, sitter — they all cost you.
 Take-out: At the end of the day, do you feel the need to order out so that
you can spend more time with Baby?
Now, when you crunch these numbers, be honest. Don’t tell yourself that 
you only spend $50 a month on lunches out when in reality you order a $6
pastrami-on-rye sandwich at the deli every day. And although some of these
costs are redundant, some of these expenses are likely to be higher than they
would be if you were at home. For instance, you do need to eat, so it’s not as
though staying home will totally eliminate your food bill, but remember that
by staying home, you could make that same pastrami-on-rye for a fraction of
the cost that the deli charges you.
55
Chapter 4: Returning to Work?

Now, if you do the math and you come out ahead at the end of the month,
you’re in a good spot — especially if you want to go back to your office. Your
income could make your life easier all the way around: Hiring a cleaning lady
or picking up take-out on your way home from work are ideal ways to make
your evenings more relaxed, and to give you more playtime with Baby.
On the other hand, it’s tough finding yourself in a pickle where your income
is crucial to the family’s well-being but you don’t want to go back to work.
Before you make a unilateral decision about quitting your job, you and your
partner need to sit down and have a pow-wow about the family finances. A
lot of couples find that they really can cut back on their expenses and live on
one income (even a rather meager salary). It’s not an easy thing to do (espe-
cially if you’ve become accustomed to buying whatever you want, whenever
the mood strikes you), but in many cases, it’s entirely within the realm of pos-
sibility. Check out Frugal Living For Dummies by Deborah Taylor-Hough
(Wiley) for tips on living within (or even below) your means.
Handling working-mom guilt
Some moms have to go back to work in order to make ends meet or because
their job carries the family’s medical benefits. But what if you don’t have to
work — but you know you just can’t stay home? What will people say? Who
cares?
Admitting to yourself that your work makes you happy is not a bad thing. 
A happy mom is what every baby needs, after all.
There’s nothing wrong with wanting adult interaction during the day, or with
craving the satisfaction you get from your work. Staying home with an infant
isn’t every mom’s idea of heaven. As long as you find a caregiver who can
nurture Baby while you’re bringing home the bacon, your child will be fine.
Really.
Some families choose to have Dad stay home instead. What a great opportu-
nity to have a parent at home with the baby when Mom’s income potential
and health insurance or benefits are better. Don’t forget this as an option!
More Dads stay home with their kids today than many of us realize. It is
macho to be a caregiver!
Working breastfeeding into your worklife
Returning to work doesn’t mean you must wean Baby from the breast. You 
do need to learn to express your milk in the most efficient way, however, so
that you aren’t spending every minute of your downtime filling bottles for 
the next day.
56
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

Expressing milk by hand is an option, but it can be messy and very time-
consuming. Breast pumps are good options for most breastfeeding moms —
though you’ll have to determine whether an electric or manual model works
best for you. Check with your pharmacy to see whether they rent electric
breast pumps. Many do. Look for a double-sided pump that pumps both sides
at once — you may feel like a cow at the milking machine, but you’ll be done
in half the time!
There really isn’t a general recommendation concerning which breast pump
works best. Every woman is physically different, so the pump that worked
wonders for your sister may leave you feeling full and sore — and with nary
an ounce in the collection cup.
Be sure to discuss your nursing situation with your boss and co-workers 
on a need-to-know basis. You need to express milk at work just to keep your
supply up, and you need a quiet, private area, free (or almost free) of distrac-
tions to ensure a productive pumping session. (So be sure to tell the intern
from the mailroom to hold your packages during your lunch break.) You also
need access to a refrigerator to store your milk until it’s time to go home.
Working from home
Bringing your work right into your home office (even if it is technically a
dining room) is a growing trend among moms, and for several good reasons:
 No commute
 No wardrobe expense
 You can often set your own schedule
 You can nurse Baby while working
 It’s the best of both worlds — accomplishing career goals while not sac-
rificing time with Baby
Working from home isn’t all strawberries and cream, though. It actually has
some drawbacks, including:
 Isolation: The biggest challenge for many moms who don’t work outside
of the house is feeling cut off from the world. You have to accept that
you won’t go to lunch with your co-workers and you won’t always be
able to bounce ideas off colleagues.
 Motivation: You really have to be a self-starter and be disciplined enough
to follow through on projects without having a boss to prod you along —
all in spite of an extremely demanding “boss” who’s still in diapers.
57
Chapter 4: Returning to Work?

 Juggling too many responsibilities: You just may feel as though you’re
expected to work, take care of Baby, and keep house simultaneously. And
you thought your old job was stressful.
Keeping your expectations on the realistic side is an incredibly important
part of working side-by-side with Baby. Although you’re working your career
around him, he’s still at center stage. When he’s a tiny infant, he’s not going
to delay any of his needs so that you can work. When he wants to nurse,
you’d better be able to feed him. When he needs a nap, you won’t be able to
run to the post office to overnight a letter across the country.
Having someone to call on in times of work-related emergencies (your boss
wants you to come into his office pronto) is a sound plan for moms who choose
to work from home. If you simply don’t have that luxury, try to take each day
as it comes and learn from each experience — positive and negative — what
you can do to make life run a little more smoothly.
Becoming a full-time mom
Choosing to stay home full time is a major decision, especially if you worked
40 hours a week before Baby came along. You’re losing your income, your
benefits, and — most importantly to many women — your identity as a
career woman. Moving into full-time mom mode results in a whole realign-
ment of how you’re seen and judged by others and by yourself.
Staying at home is a luxury that many moms would love to have. Even so, you
may find yourself accused of being lazy or putting pressure on your spouse
to become the sole supporter of the family. Develop a thick skin and remind
yourself that you’ve made the best decision for yourself and for your family.
A big problem stay-at-home moms face is the equitable division of household
duties. Is it fair for a mom who isn’t working outside of the home to expect
her husband to help out with the baby or the chores when he comes home at
night? The answer is yes! Don’t expect him to do the laundry, iron, and mop
the floor, but he should be able to give you a break from Baby at some point,
because, after all, you’ve been working all day, too.
Identify — and communicate — your expectations concerning your partner’s
pitching in around the house. This is brand-new territory for him, too. He
may not know that you want help at the end of the day. Furthermore, if he’s
had no prior experience with infants, he may truly believe that you’re spend-
ing your days napping and gabbing on the phone while Baby sleeps content-
edly in his bassinet. Give him the opportunity to spend some time with Baby
alone so that he knows that it really is hard work to care for an infant day-in,
day-out.
58
Part I: Giving Baby a Healthy, Happy Start 

Most importantly, let the less important, less urgent matters go for now. The
house may be in need of a good scrub-down, but it’s even more critical for
your family to find its groove in these infant days.
Finding Childcare
Whether you’re thinking about putting Baby in day care, placing her with a
private sitter, or bringing a nanny into your home, you’ve got your work cut
out for you. Each choice requires a fair amount of research to ensure that
Baby will be left in the most capable hands.
To ease your search:
 Know your priorities. Are you looking for a day care down the street
from your workplace, or around the corner from your house? Is cost a
major consideration, or is money no object? Do you want your child in a
group setting or in a one-on-one situation? Narrowing your choices from
the get-go will make your search that much easier.
 Do your research. Ask other parents for recommendations before you
do anything else. They’ll be eager to tell you about a day care they had a
good experience with, and even more eager to tell you what they discov-
ered about lesser day-care situations along the way.
 Interview the candidates. Set up a face-to-face meeting with a prospec-
tive caregiver and don’t be shy about asking the hard questions.
59
Chapter 4: Returning to Work?
Fitting work into your day
Working from home while caring for a baby pre-
sents all kinds of challenges, and figuring out
how to accomplish the bazillion things you need
to do is one of the biggest. Sticking to a sched-
ule as much as possible can help your days to
run smoothly. Run errands first thing in the
morning. Schedule playtime during your lunch
hour. Plan business calls around Baby’s naps.
But realize that your day may not go exactly
according to plan (if Baby becomes ill and you
end up in the pediatrician’s office, for example,
instead of finishing up an already-late project),
and allow yourself some leeway. Save more
time-consuming projects until dad gets home so
he can occupy baby and you can focus on work
for a couple of hours.

No matter which direction you’re leaning in — finding a day-care center or 
a nanny — give yourself plenty of time to do your research and to make a
decision. Begin your research while you’re still pregnant, if possible, so that
you’re not faced with a time crunch (when you find yourself with a week left
on your maternity leave and no arrangements made for Baby!). This one deci-
sion will determine your child’s comfort level — and, by extension, how well
your return to work goes, so don’t rush it. For a more complete look at this
topic, read Choosing Childcare For Dummies by Ann Douglas (Wiley).
Checking out day cares
Realize that the most reputable centers often have waiting lists, so the
sooner you start investigating day-care options in your area, the better your
chance of getting your child into your first choice. Call ahead and make an
appointment to tour the facility. Questions you’ll want to ask include:
 How long has the center been in business? There’s no “right” answer
for how long a day care should be in business. Some parents may be
more comfortable knowing that the center has been around for a long
time, and a center that has been open for years and years may also have
the benefit of having built a solid reputation.
 Are you licensed? There is a difference between licensed and unlicensed
providers. Check out the rules in your state. If you choose an unlicensed
sitter or facility, especially watch caregiver to child ratios.
 What kind of training and/or education do the staff members have? Are
they infant-CPR certified? You want to know that your child is being left
in capable, experienced hands. Ask how long the employees have been
working there, what the center’s training policy is, and what the training
consists of. (Is training a one-hour thing, or a monthly requirement? The
latter is better). Also, there should always be at least one staff member on
the premises who is trained in infant and child CPR.
 How are staff members screened for employment? Has the center done
a background check for drugs, felonies, child abuse? Have all employees
(caregivers and maintenance workers alike) been screened?
 How do you handle an infant’s feeding and sleep schedules? Infants
eat and sleep when they need to eat and sleep. It’s unwise to try to foist
a rigid schedule on an infant.
 Will I have to provide diapers and wipes or are they included in the
monthly fee? Just an extra cost to consider.
 Center hours? Weekly fees? Extra fees for late pickup or early drop
off? What about their holiday schedule? You obviously want to find a
60

place that will fit into your work schedule. Keep in mind that good child-
care is oftentimes expensive, but that an expensive day care isn’t neces-
sarily good. Don’t plunk down your money without checking it out. If
you’re going to be late from time to time, you may be charged for it —
ask now so that you aren’t left reeling from the bill later. And if you’re
going to be working on Christmas Eve and the Fourth of July, make sure
your day-care provider is going to be working, too.
 What’s your sick-baby policy? Find out what types of symptoms require
you to keep you baby at home. If Baby has a runny nose, will she be
turned away at the door, or must she kept home only if she’s vomiting
and/or running a fever of 100 or more? Plus, you may be expected to 
pay for days when Baby is home sick, so ask about that up front, too.
 What’s the caregiver-to-infant ratio? Centers should generally provide
about one caregiver to every three infants — in some instances, four
infants to one employee is okay.
In almost every state, a day care is required to be licensed if it has more 
than 12 kids. However, licensing isn’t necessarily a guarantee of excellence,
because criteria vary from state to state (some states have much lower stan-
dards when it comes to cleanliness, for example). Licensing ensures that a
facility has met the bare-bones requirements in areas of health, safety, and
childcare training. However, you still need to check centers out for yourself.
What you’re looking for in a day care is a good reputation, for one thing.
Remember, other parents are only too eager to share their day-care 
experiences — good or bad. You want to know that this is a fairly stable 
environment.
If most of the staff is brand-new, the center may have a high turnover rate,
which raises two concerns: First, your child may be handed off to someone
new every month and never have the opportunity to bond with any one care-
giver. Second, why are the employees high-tailing it out of there? There could
be any number of reasons, but generally speaking, any business with a high
turnover rate has less-than-devoted employees.
Ask what kind of pay is offered at a day care, and/or whether the employees
are given vacation and other benefits. Decent-paying jobs with nice perks are
more likely to stay filled, which means that a caregiver will probably stick
around for a while.
Also, take a look around. Is the place clean? Are the children clean? Are crying
infants being tended to promptly? Do the older kids appear to be having 
fun — or at least appear content? These are all good signs. Check references
and pay an unannounced visit before you make a final decision. And trust
your gut instinct. Visit at different times of the day: drop-off, pick-up, nap-
time, mealtime, and so on. Know what they’re doing throughout the time
your baby will be under their care.
61
Chapter 4: Returning to Work?

Don’t settle. If something is telling you that this place isn’t right, then move on.
Looking into a home day care
The nice thing about finding someone in the neighborhood who watches chil-
dren is that you may already know something about this person — and if you
don’t, you can usually find a friend who does (in fact, a friend may have rec-
ommended this place to you in the first place). If you’re thinking about using
a private day-care setting for your child, make sure to follow the same guide-
lines we suggest in the earlier section, “Checking out day cares,” and also ask
the following questions:
 Are there any personal visitors to the home during the day? Who are
they? You want to know that your child is safe and that your babysitter’s
ex-con son isn’t running a less-than-reputable business out of her home
(which would mean that his less-than-reputable customers would be
around your child all the time). Not that she would be this forthcoming
with the information, but if you know about the son and his business,
you can check it — and him — out for yourself to make sure all’s well 
on the babysitter front. Try an Internet search to find information about
visitors.
 When do you expect to take vacation? What happens when you get
sick? When you depend on one person to watch your child, you have to
make concessions — like scheduling your time off around her vacation,
or having a backup plan if she comes down with the flu.
 Do you have assistants? How are they screened? How long have they
been there? Again, you’re checking on who’s going to be around your
child. Your babysitter should have done her own background check 
on any assistants, and should be forthcoming about her methods for
doing so.
When you know a person who provides care in her home, you may be more apt
to cut corners — to say, for example, “Well, she isn’t licensed and she isn’t reg-
istered with the state, but I trust her, so that’s all that matters.” (Licensing and
registering are two separate actions. A license means that a sitter or center has
met minimal health and safety regulations; registering makes the state aware of
the business.) Just be aware that if your state licensing agency is somehow
made aware of this unlicensed, unregistered facility, they may shut it down
immediately — which will leave you in a lurch, big-time. It’s a better idea to
have all your ducks in a row right from the start and to find someone with a
legitimate operation.

Finding a nanny
Searching for someone to come to your home and care for Baby is a luxury
that many parents only dream of. Finding the right person can be something
of a challenge, however, if you don’t know where to begin. Start by asking
friends, co-workers, or neighbors if they know anyone in this line of work.
One nanny may know of another nanny who’s between jobs at the moment.
Look for postings on public bulletin boards — in coffee shops, cafes, play-
grounds, or anywhere college students and nannies may hang out. As your
last resort, advertise in the paper — just be forewarned that you may be
completely inundated with responses.
Another option for finding a nanny is to contact a local nanny agency. Their
services are usually costly, but they prescreen applicants, help you find some-
one with the qualifications you’re looking for, and can also confirm that she 
is who she claims to be and has the experience she claims to have. (Online
nanny agencies provide some of these same services and are generally less
expensive.)
What you want to ask a nanny:
 What’s your educational background? If she’s working toward an edu-
cation or a child psychology degree, for example, you can bet she’s not
in this solely for the money.
 Do you have kids of your own? How old are they? Although a childless
nanny can be a wonderful person, a mom who’s been in your shoes may
be far more sympathetic toward your fussy baby. However, if your nanny
isn’t planning to bunk with you and has small kids of her own, you may
want to know where they are while she’s with your baby (in other words,
are they going to be at your house?), and what she’ll do if her own chil-
dren are sick (will you be left nannyless?).
 Any previous experience with infants? Why did your last gig as a nanny
come to an end? This is really hard work. You don’t want to leave your
infant with someone who’s never cared for a newborn before. (Sure, she
has to learn somewhere, but not on your child.) A good answer to the
second question may be along the lines of, “My employers moved,” or,
“The kids are all grown up now,” not, “My boss was too demanding and
wanted me to change diapers all day long.”
 Do you have transportation? You want someone reliable.
 Do you have another job? Ditto.
 Why do you like being a nanny? Listen for heartfelt responses, like,
“I love kids,” not, “My parents cut me off without a penny, and I need 
a job.”
 Do you know infant CPR? Anyone who takes on a caregiver role should
know infant and child CPR.
63
Chapter 4: Returning to Work?

If you expect her to cook, clean, or run errands, run that by her now. Be pre-
pared to answer her questions regarding pay and vacation.
If you find a candidate who seems like the one, have her come to your home
for a trial period of a couple of days — just to make sure the arrangement is
agreeable to both of you before you’re ready to leave her and Baby on their
own for the entire day.

Babysitting the babysitter: Nanny cams
Nanny cams are selling like hotcakes in some
regions. These tiny cameras are hidden in a
friendly-looking household object (like a clock, a
plant, or a stuffed animal) and provide parents
with an opportunity to keep tabs on what’s going
on between Nanny and Baby while Mom and
Dad are at the office. Obviously, an infant can’t
squeal on a neglectful or abusive caregiver, so
these cameras can provide comfort to parents
who want an extra measure of security. Two
things to consider, though, with the nanny cams:
First, in some states, it’s legal to secretly record
video only — clandestine audio recordings are
off-limits. And secondly, before you purchase
and set-up a secret camera, ask yourself why
you’re doing it. If you just have to know that your
nanny is the saint you think she is, that’s one
thing. But if you suspect she’s not doing her job
well or that she’s helping herself to your loose
change — do you really want her taking care of
your baby? Whether your suspicions are con-
firmed by the tape or not, if there’s something you
just don’t trust about a caregiver, she doesn’t
belong in your home to begin with.

oming home with a brand-new baby sets off a verita-
ble volcano of emotions in new parents: happiness,
fear, excitement, fear. Maybe not all parents are cowering
in the corner while Baby coos in her crib, but the realiza-
tion that life will never be the same — that your basic needs
must be put aside in order to care for your newborn —
can be overwhelming, as can knowing that you are totally
responsible for the care, feeding, and general well-being of
another human being.
The first three months can be the most difficult of Baby’s
entire first year — for you and for her. This section offers
a realistic look at what your experience might be like
during this time and offers you advice on how to ease into
this new phase of life known as parenthood.

oming home from the hospital with Baby in tow can be exciting and ter-
rifying all at once. The last time you were sitting in your house, you were
just you. Now you’re a parent. You’re completely responsible for this little
person.
The first few days at home with your child are like nothing you’ve ever expe-
rienced before, even if you’ve been around babies your entire life. This time,
this experience, this child — they’re all yours. These could be the most mem-
orable days of your entire life, or they could end up being days you’d rather
forget. Rest assured, you’ll make it through your own recovery and your
baby’s premiere days intact and ready to take on the rest of the first year.
Rolling with the Punches (and Stitches)
Any woman who has given birth must deal with some discomfort afterward. 
If you were able to watch a video of a real birth before you actually went into
labor, then the repairs you’ve suffered through came as no surprise to you. 
If, on the other hand, you were expecting a hassle-free delivery and are cur-
rently sitting in a sitz bath soothing your episiotomy wound, you may have
been a bit shocked to discover the discomforts associated with giving birth.

Post-delivery pain can be magnified by the lack of sleep that many new moth-
ers must endure. If you went through a long labor and delivery, or your child
was born in the middle of the night, chances are you missed out on at least
one night of sleep. You may wonder how you can ever catch up when your
baby needs to nurse so frequently.
You will feel better soon — and you will sleep again. This section offers you
tips on how to make it through these days with your new baby when all you
want is for someone to baby you.
Coping with new levels of fatigue
Maybe you expected the nurses to feed your child and were surprised when
they brought her to you every three hours — couldn’t they see how tired you
were? Of course they could. But part of their job is to make sure you know
how to feed and care for your child before you head home, and they have a
relatively short time in which to teach you everything you need to know
about Baby.
Now that you’ve been discharged, you’re finding that Baby isn’t sleeping like
the nurses said she would — she’s been up all day and all night, and you’re
more tired than you ever dreamed you’d be. You don’t even recognize the
person looking back at you from the mirror — she looks old and pale and
plain worn out. How will you ever recover from childbirth if you can’t sleep
for more than an hour at a crack?
Many babies hardly cry in the hospital and only eat every four hours. This
won’t continue at home! Babies wake up, discover they’re starving, and want
to nurse about every two hours until your milk comes in. Usually this hap-
pens the first night you’re home sleeping in your own bed again. Be ready!
Although the first days home from the hospital with Baby can be the longest,
hardest days of your life, they’re not an indication of how the rest of Baby’s
first year will be. If your newborn isn’t sleeping 20 hours a day, her immature
nervous system may be keeping her awake; this will probably pass. And no
matter what you’ve heard from other mothers, newborns don’t come home
from the hospital ready and willing to sleep through the night. They need to
eat — often — so don’t lose heart if you feel as though you’ve done nothing
but nurse this child since she was born. It’s completely normal, and incredi-
bly time-consuming.
The best advice for tired moms during this time is simple: Rest when your
baby is sleeping or quiet. If she’s content to lie in her bassinet alone, don’t
feel as though you have to hold her. She’s okay. Don’t push yourself to fold
her little outfits or to restock the changing table when she finally closes her
eyes for an afternoon snooze. Seize the opportunity to pull the shades and
snuggle under a nice warm blanket all by yourself.
68
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

If Baby wakes and cries every time you put her down, go ahead and hold her
while you rest. If you’re ready to nod off, though, place her in her bassinet or
infant seat. Even if she’s unhappy, she’s safe, and you can (hopefully) sneak
in a couple of minutes of rest by yourself.
Holding Baby while both of you rest is fine in these early days, when you
both need to get some rest at any cost. Just keep in mind that in a month or
so, she needs to start learning to be alone in her bassinet or baby seat. She
needs to learn how to comfort herself, or you could be dealing with sleep
issues for years to come.
Go to the extreme when you’re on a quest for rest. Turn off the phone. Put a
sign on your front door telling visitors to come back later. Put your dog in his
crate or send him to your mother-in-law’s house. Let the rest of the house-
hold chores go. Soon enough, real life will be in full effect again. These first
days with Baby aren’t your average, run-of-the-mill days. You need to take
care of yourself now so that you’ll have the strength to tend to your child’s
needs.
Babying your body
You’ve passed a small human being through your loins or through an incision
in your abdomen. (Yeah, ouch.) Recovering from childbirth requires effort on
your part — the effort to allow yourself to just sit back and heal. Before you
laugh at what seems to be the simplest advice ever given, ask yourself this:
When was the last time you let the housework and/or your office work com-
pletely go — while you were in the house with full access to cleaning supplies
and your computer? A lot of women simply don’t know how to rest; even when
they legitimately use a sick day, they’re catching up on projects around the
house or on work that has to be done by the end of the week. For the first ten
days to two weeks after giving birth, your one job is to take care of your baby.
No matter how smoothly your vaginal delivery goes, you’re going to be 
sore afterward. Whether you have stitches or not, keep your weight off your
bottom for the next week or ten days — sit on your side, lie down, or use a
donut pillow. If ice helps to lessen your discomfort, use it. Having a sore and
engorged vaginal region at this point is normal — but being in extreme pain a
week after delivery isn’t. A simple change in your physical position (from
upright to sideways or horizontal) can help to ease the pain.
Although women give birth every day and have been doing so for millions 
of years, and even though you’ve heard stories of how your great-great-
grandmother gave birth in a field and went right back to planting potatoes —
giving birth is a big deal. Your body has been through an ordeal (albeit a good
ordeal). This is true whether you’ve gone through a natural childbirth or a 
C-section.
69
Chapter 5: Settling In with Baby

Acknowledge that you’re human and that you do need time to recuperate and
regain your strength. You’ll bounce back faster in the weeks to come if you
take care of yourself now.
Caring for an episiotomy
You no doubt received instructions for caring for your episiotomy while you
were in the hospital. If those instructions have somehow slipped your mind
(little wonder with your fatigue and all of the information you’re trying to
remember concerning Baby), here’s the lowdown on how to take care of it:
 Change your sanitary pads often and make sure they’re secure. You
don’t need a pad slipping back and forth, irritating the wound.
 Don’t touch the wound.
 Use the squirt bottle you were given in the hospital to cleanse the area.
 Practice your usual hygiene when using the bathroom, being extra
gentle.
 To help soothe the area, try sitting in a warm sitz bath (with just enough
water to cover the affected area). If you were given anesthetic cream or
spray in the hospital, go ahead and use it. Witch hazel pads can also
ease the pain.
 Be alert for signs of infection: a bad smell; intense, constant pain that
only gets worse as the days go by; or fever.
Tending to your body after a cesarean delivery
If you had a C-section, you’ll be feeling sore for at least a couple of weeks.
Your stitches will most likely be removed within the week after you give
birth, but remember, you’ve been through surgery — it’s a full six to eight
week recovery window you’re looking at. 
Here are some tips to help your healing process:
 Don’t lift anything heavier than Baby.
 Don’t be surprised if your incision is numb for several weeks. This is
normal after any surgery.
 Try to keep Baby off the incision site.
 No vacuuming or sex for six weeks. (Bummer for your partner — on
both counts.)
 Watch for signs of infection: A foul smell; worsening pain and inflamma-
tion at the incision site; or fever.
 Don’t try to tough it out — if you’re in pain, take the medication your
doctor has approved. Expect the pain to be the worst during the first
week after delivery.
70
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Get up and move as much as you can — but don’t overdo it. This is good
advice for any woman who has just given birth. You want to get your circula-
tion going, but you also need plenty of rest. Take time to assess how you’re
feeling throughout the day — if you’re worn out, sit down. And keep an eye on
your lochia, the bleeding and vaginal discharge that follows childbirth, caused
by the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. During the first post-
delivery week, it may be a lot like your normal menstrual flow, or it may ini-
tially be heavier than your average period. Lochia can last anywhere from a
couple of weeks to more than a month, though it becomes lighter in color and
flow as the weeks go on, changing from red to pink to a yellowish discharge
before drying up completely. Make sure you’ve got plenty of sanitary pads in
the house. Tampons are banned for six weeks after delivery, because using
them could cause a uterine infection.
If bright red, heavy bleeding continues after the first week, if the flow becomes
very heavy (soaking through a pad in an hours’ time), if the flow and color
lighten and then revert back to heavy bleeding, or if you’re passing large clots
(anything larger than a quarter is the rule of thumb), call your doctor without
delay! These may be signs of hemorrhage — but may also simply be an indica-
tion that you’re doing too much physically. Also be alert for signs of infection,
which include fever and a foul-smelling discharge.
Accepting help
Maybe you have no trouble accepting offers of help. You don’t mind if your
mother spends the entire day in your house feeding your pets, cooking, and
cleaning. Your mother-in-law is more than welcome to do your grocery shop-
ping. Why, you even let your brother-in-law change the light bulb in the bath-
room yesterday. You’re lucky to have so much help, and you’re going to have
a splendid recovery period — as long as you remember that you do have to
get up off the couch every now and then in order to keep your circulation
surging.
Or maybe you have a very difficult time allowing friends and family into your
home for the sheer purpose of taking care of you. You hate being pampered,
and as for the cooking and the cleaning — you want it done a certain way, so
you’d rather do it yourself. What’s wrong with that?
Well, normally, nothing’s wrong with having such a can-do attitude. If you’re
having an easy time with Baby and you’re feeling up to making your own
lunch every day, go ahead. Just make sure that you’re not doing too much —
you do need time to just sit and rest and care for Baby without worrying
about the dishes in the sink or the dirt on the kitchen floor.
71
Chapter 5: Settling In with Baby

A woman who’s bouncing back from childbirth shouldn’t be tackling the
heavy-duty household chores during her first week home — like hauling laun-
dry up and down the basement stairs, or even dusting the house from top to
bottom, which may not seem like especially hard work, but really does take a
toll on the body. There is a slight chance of hemorrhage during this recovery
period, so it’s essential that you allow your body to heal.
Think of it this way: If you were recovering from a bout with the flu, you’d
remember how weak your body was at the peak of the illness, and you’d let
yourself recuperate. You may not feel particularly weak when you’re recover-
ing from childbirth — and that’s good. You want to feel well. The danger here
is that when new moms feel great, they sometimes take on too much, too
soon (mopping the floor four days after giving birth, or running errands on
the fifth day), and end up feeling completely worn out. Just keep in mind that
your body is healing from the inside; you need to conserve energy to heal
more quickly.
If you can let the deep-down cleaning go for now, great. But if you can’t — if
the dirt on the floor is going to drive you crazy — let your mom help. Or look
the other way while your mother-in-law does a lousy job of sweeping. Your
focus should be on you and your baby right now. The dirt will still be there in
a couple of weeks — you can do away with it then.
Defending your right to solitude
After giving birth, you’re faced with physical and emotional feelings you’ve
never experienced. You’re elated. You’re nervous. You’re more exhausted
than you’ve ever been. Your breasts are starting to hurt. You’re sore. Oh, and
you’re hormonal, which is causing you to experience the extremes of your
emotions (some of which are in reaction to your physical state) in roughly 
15-minute intervals. (All right. It’s probably not that bad. But maybe it’s
close.) The last thing you want is a house filled with relatives offering to 
feed and comfort you.
Go ahead and send good Samaritans away right now. There aren’t many
instances in a person’s life where it’s completely acceptable to say, “This is
all about me, and if I’m hurting someone’s feelings, that’s too darn bad.” But
now is one of those times. We’re not advising that you should be mean to
people who are only trying to be kind. But you have to look out for yourself
at this point, and if you can’t get any rest with your three aunts and four
cousins milling around your bedroom and setting up Baby’s crib (which she
won’t be sleeping in for a couple of months, anyway), speak up now or suffer
the consequences of a meltdown later.
72
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Keep in mind that no matter how much you crave solitude right now, you
don’t want to send everyone away. A well-chosen nursemaid/assistant can
even be your voice for you, turning visitors away at the door by saying, “She
and the baby are sleeping right now. I’ll tell her you dropped by.” Keep some-
one around for the first week just in case you’re feeling weak or ill.
Realize that you can’t be alone forever, and that some relatives just have to
come in and take a peek at the baby. Your mother-in-law, for example, can’t
be kept at bay for more than a day or two after you’ve returned home. So let
her in — but don’t be afraid to make it very clear that you aren’t up for a long
visit just yet. You can deal with the fallout later, if there is any, or better yet,
let your spouse handle it. And if mama-in-law wants to hold the baby while
you get some sleep — weigh the benefits (you will be able to rest) against any
negatives (will she insist on taking over your entire recovery?). Chances are,
she’s just ga-ga over her new grandchild, and she means no harm.
Nourishing the Newborn
Whether you’re breastfeeding Baby or offering her a bottle, you want to be
sure that she’s getting enough to eat. Should you feed her when she cries?
Should you wake her every few hours? Will feeding her more make her sleep
longer? These are common and sometimes confusing issues for first-time 
parents — and even for parents who have been through this before.
Whether you’re bottlefeeding or breastfeeding, most doctors advise parents
to feed Baby on demand — which means when Baby shows signs of being
hungry (crying, rooting around with her mouth).
Time to nurse . . . again?!
During Baby’s first few days and weeks, you can start to feel as though all you
ever do is unbutton your shirt and whip out your breasts. You finish feeding
Baby, and 90 minutes later, she’s hungry again!
Don’t worry. Nursing your child won’t always be so time-consuming. For one
thing, during Baby’s first days at home, you’re both still getting the hang of
breastfeeding. Baby is learning to latch on and suck, and you’re dealing with
the pain of “breaking in” your nipples and discovering which position works
best for you and your child. Baby may not be eating all that much at this
point, especially if she tends to doze off every time you feed her. On top of
everything else, her little stomach can’t hold much at this age anyway.
73
Chapter 5: Settling In with Baby

When the two of you work out all of these little kinks, her nursing sessions
will go much more smoothly and more quickly. For now, realize that frustra-
tion is something that a lot of new breastfeeding mothers experience and that
the vast majority of babies eventually whittle down their nursing sessions
considerably.
Some nursing moms worry that because Baby is eating so often, it may be an
indication that she’s not getting enough milk. For now, you can be sure that
she’s getting enough to eat if:
 She has six to eight wet diapers a day.
 The urine is pale — not dark yellow. Dark-colored urine is actually a sign
of dehydration and may mean that she isn’t getting enough milk.
 She has several seedy-looking bowel movements every day.
 You can hear her swallowing during her feedings.
 She appears calm and relaxed after nursing.
 Your breasts may also feel empty or soft after a feeding session.
 You may be able to see milk in Baby’s mouth.
If Baby seems content after she nurses, and she’s going through diapers like
mad, she’s doing fine.
Most doctors recommend waking a sleepy newborn to feed at least every three
to four hours during the day. Baby should be fitting in a total of 8 to 12 breast-
feedings over the course of 24 hours. Not only does she need the nourishment,
but it’s also necessary for her to feed often to establish your breast milk (the
more she nurses, the more you make in order to meet her demands). Keep in
mind that some newborns nurse every couple of hours during the day and
then sleep for a longer stretch during the night. That’s okay, to a point. She
shouldn’t (and won’t) sleep for eight hours at a crack right now — she needs 
to eat.
The breastfeeding mother is Baby’s only source of nutrition in the early
weeks. Don’t start introducing supplemental bottles until Baby has clearly
mastered the art of breastfeeding. Silicone nipples can sometimes lead to
nipple confusion in a newborn. Because latching onto the breast is much
more involved than sucking from a bottle (each requires its own method of
successfully working the mouth and the tongue, as well as different swallow-
ing techniques), offering Baby a real nipple in the morning and an artificial
nipple in the afternoon can leave him feeling as though he has no idea what
to do with either one. Best to stick to one method for now. Hold off on giving
Baby a bottle until he’s about 6 weeks old. At that point, you can be sure that
he’s settled into nursing and a plastic nipple shouldn’t throw him into a tizzy.
74
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

If you’re nursing and things are going well, consider yourself lucky — many
babies have a hard time getting the hang of breastfeeding.
Bottlefed babies
Bottlefed newborns usually eat 1 to 3 ounces of formula at a single feeding
and tend to need to eat every two to three hours. After she reaches 10
pounds, Baby will probably be ready for more — your pediatrician will advise
you in this matter as Baby grows. For now, let Baby determine how much and
how often she eats. Don’t try to feed her when she’s clearly lost interest in
the bottle, and never prop a newborn with a bottle in her mouth (by placing
the bottle on a pillow or stuffed animal in Baby’s bassinet, for example, so
that you don’t have to hold her while she eats).
You don’t need to use boiled or distilled water to prepare Baby’s bottle, nor
do you need to even warm it. (In fact, if you can get Baby to drink cold and/or
room temperature formula, you make your life a heck of a lot easier — espe-
cially in the middle of the night, when you can just grab a bottle from the
fridge.) If Baby seems to prefer warm formula, however, consider purchasing
a bottle warmer. You can also run the bottle under warm water or stick it in a
pot of hot (but not boiling) water.
Never use the microwave to warm a bottle, because the liquid may end up
with “hot spots” that could burn Baby.
Burp Baby at least midway through the bottle, and sooner than that if she
seems to be slowing down. Some kids do well with one good burp; some need
to burp several times. Some babies hardly produce any spit-up; some spit up
a lot. Your doctor will evaluate Baby’s progress at the first check-up. Even if
your child is a champion spitter, as long as he’s growing, he’s okay.
If Baby’s spit-up shoots halfway across the room, or if it’s dark (yellow, green,
or brown), consult your pediatrician at once. This isn’t normal spit-up and
could indicate the presence of gastrointestinal problems.
And with intake comes 
output: Baby’s diaper
Breastfed infants fill their diapers frequently — some of them have a bowel
movement every time they nurse, and some very tiny infants can produce
huge amounts of poop. Expect these stools to be yellow and seedy-looking
and to smell foul. Bottlefed infants tend to have fewer, better-formed bowel
movements.

Chapter 5: Settling In with Baby

Change Baby as soon as she’s finished eating (even if she’s fallen asleep) 
so that she doesn’t develop a rash, signs of which include red, raw-looking
skin anywhere in the diaper area. Use a diaper ointment to help quell these
flare-ups.
Call your pediatrician if the rash turns to meaty-looking welts in the folds of
Baby’s skin (signs of a yeast infection — possible even in boys), if the rash is
brown or crusty (signs of impetigo, which is contagious), or if it spreads to
other parts of Baby’s body. Your doctor may prescribe an ointment to help
clear the rash.
Boys can sometimes get a diaper rash on the penis, which usually clears up
in a few days. If it doesn’t go away on its own, if it gets worse, or if it’s inter-
fering with Baby’s ability to urinate, call your pediatrician.
Yes, You Have to Look: Umbilical 
Cord and Circumcision Care
Although they aren’t beautiful, taking care of the umbilical cord and circumci-
sion are easy tasks. Time heals all wounds, right? That holds true here, as
well. You need to provide a minimum amount of care to these areas for about
ten days to two weeks while keeping a sharp eye out for infection.
76
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 
Getting Dad in on the act
Breastfed babies rely on Mom and only Mom for
feedings, which means Dad is left out. He may
feel like he’s out of the picture for more than just
feedings. Although bottlefed babies can be fed
by anyone (and even breastfed babies can take
a few bottles after they’re about 6 weeks old),
Dad still may need some encouragement to step
in and start learning the fatherly arts.
Too often, Dads are relegated to the background,
not really expected or allowed to do much of
anything. Because Mom is the primary caregiver
in many instances, she takes complete control of
feedings, diaper changes, and comforting ses-
sions. Dad either sits back and smiles, knowing
that he’s off the hook, or stands by frustrated,
wanting to do more but feeling inept because —
well, he can’t learn how to care for Baby if Mom
has taken complete charge.
Get Dad in on the Baby game. He really is capa-
ble of helping, and the more he’s allowed to do,
the more he’ll do of his own accord — because
he feels like he’s part of this whole experience,
and not like he’s watching from the sidelines. In
the end, a dad who has been feeding, burping,
and changing Baby from the beginning (or, in the
case of the breastfed newborn, a dad who has
been diapering and rocking his baby from day
one) is going to feel like he’s really part of this
child’s life. And that’s good for the entire family.

Caring for the cord
Until the umbilical cord falls off, you do have to look at it — but unlike par-
ents of days gone by, you probably won’t have to clean it. The old medical
advice had parents dipping a swab into rubbing alcohol and cleaning around
the base of the cord at every diaper change. Today, doctors think that the
alcohol does very little to hasten the cord’s departure, and many advise par-
ents to just leave it alone.
Even when it’s hanging on by its last little thread, don’t ever try to pull the
cord off! Let nature take its course — it will fall off all by itself.
With the disposal of the alcohol swabbing of the umbilical cord area, the risk
for infection increases slightly. Watch for:
 Redness or swelling around the base
 Discharge (yellow or white pus, or anything that smells foul)
 Bleeding
If you aren’t using diapers with a cutout for the umbilical area, simply fold
Baby’s diaper down in front until the cord has been replaced by a cute little
belly button. (And keep in mind that a little bit of bleeding is normal when
the cord finally comes off.)
Tending the circumcision
Caring for the circumcision is fairly easy. The worst part of the experience is
having to look at your little boy’s sore genitalia. Use petroleum jelly around
the circumcised area (so that it doesn’t stick to the diaper) and leave it alone!
When the glans (the circumcised area) no longer appears red and moist, dis-
continue the use of the petroleum jelly.
It’s normal for the penis to appear irritated or to have white or yellow spots
during the healing process. However, it shouldn’t be bleeding, it shouldn’t
continue to swell and appear increasingly irritated, and you shouldn’t see
any foul-smelling pus. Call your pediatrician if these symptoms of infection
occur.
Baby should be creating wet diapers throughout the day. If he has gone more
than six hours without urinating, call your pediatrician.
77
Chapter 5: Settling In with Baby

Yellow-Bellied Babies: Jaundice
Jaundice comes in two different types: The type of jaundice that requires
phototherapy is usually diagnosed and treated shortly after birth, and
because you and Baby are already home, you may think that he successfully
dodged this condition.
The truth is, a lot of otherwise healthy infants develop a slight case of jaundice
after they’ve been discharged from the hospital. It can be a bit disconcerting
for a parent to realize that the whites of Baby’s eyes have gone yellow — and
so have his cheeks!
More than half of all healthy infants have a bout with jaundice. It usually
peaks on the second or third day after delivery and resolves itself within a
week to ten days. Usually, no treatment is required.
If Baby becomes very yellow and appears ill, call your pediatrician immedi-
ately. Additional symptoms can include diminished sucking, seeming too
weak to cry, not waking for his feedings, not regularly wetting or passing
stool, and listless newborn reflexes. These are signs of a more serious form of
jaundice that needs to be evaluated without delay. It may be treatable at
home with something called a bili blanket, which will be placed on Baby for
most of the day. (The more it’s used, the sooner the jaundice will clear up.) If
Baby is jaundiced but doesn’t need the bili blanket, place her in a sunny loca-
tion in the house and make sure to feed her frequently — this should help in
clearing up the yellow tint.

efore you know it, this little person who can’t seem to stay awake for
more than an hour at a time will be rolling across your living room floor
and giggling herself silly. The first month is a really precious time with an
infant precisely because it goes so fast. The entire first year is full of firsts for
you and for Baby, and they start now: The first checkup, the first real bath,
the first time since your wild college days that you’ve been up all night.
(Somehow, bone-crushing fatigue seemed a lot more fun back then.)
Real parenting includes moments of unbelievable pride and joy — along with
moments of frustration and fatigue. These are your first steps on a long, long
journey, and the lessons you learn now (about yourself and about your child)
will be with you long after Baby is out of diapers.

Checking In with Baby
You’re going to make a new friend this year — your pediatrician. Baby will be
in for six well-baby visits (and possibly a sick visit or two, as well). Hopefully,
you’ve found a doctor you feel comfortable talking to, because your pediatri-
cian is your best source of information as far as your child’s health is con-
cerned. (If you’re still up in the air about Baby’s doctor, Chapter 1 offers
some advice for finding a good match.) The 1-month milestones are also
listed in this section.
Baby’s first checkup
Suddenly you, like your parents before you, are the parent hovering nearby
while the doctor checks out your little guy — and you feel all the things your
parents felt: You’re just so darn proud of this child, and so eager to have the
doctor tell you that he’s healthy and on the right track.
Taking Baby in for his first checkup is like clearing a hurdle — you and your
partner took him home, you took care of him by yourselves, and here you’re
presenting him back to the pediatrician’s staff, fine and dandy. The doctor
will attest to the fact that you’ve done a marvelous job during these first
couple of weeks.
Expect this checkup, which will take place anywhere from two to four weeks
after delivery, to include a regular examination, including baby’s height and
weight, and head and chest circumferences. Your doctor will give baby a
good once-over, checking his nose, ears, eyes, and mouth. In each case, he’s
looking for any irregularities. It’s not uncommon, for example, for an infant to
develop a clogged tear duct. The doctor is also checking to make sure that
everything is working as it should. An abnormal fluid level in Baby’s ears, for
example, can affect his hearing. Doc will pull out the stethoscope and listen
for a normal heartbeat and good lung sounds. Baby’s internal organs will be
palpated to check for any irregularities. His spine will be examined, to make
sure it’s straight and intact.
Baby was born with several newborn reflexes, which are indicators of his
neurological well-being. Your pediatrician assesses the reflexes during this
check up and lets you know how Baby’s doing.
Baby’s fontanels are also assessed. These are the soft spot membranes on his
skull that allowed his head to change shape and come through the birth
canal. The larger, anterior fontanel is on top of the head; it starts to close by
the time Baby is about 6 months old (and will completely close by the middle
of the second year). You may see this soft spot vibrating to Baby’s heartbeat
or bulging upward when Baby cries, which, while disturbing, is completely
normal. The smaller, posterior fontanel is in the middle of the back of Baby’s
head and will close by the end of the third month.
80
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

In addition, Baby’s thyroid is examined, and the doctor checks for swollen
lymph nodes in the neck, groin, and armpits. He checks the umbilical site for
signs of infection or hernia (the latter will also be ruled out in the groin area).
Baby’s genital region is examined to make sure there are no signs of abnor-
malities. Any birthmarks that were present in the hospital are also assessed;
any new spots (birthmarks can also appear in the months after birth) are
identified.
Immunizations aren’t usually given during the first office exam. This is a visit
for getting to know your doctor, and for your doctor to get to know you and
Baby.
Write down questions as they occur to you at home, and when the doctor
turns to you and asks how things are going, toss those questions his way.
Just remember, he’s heard it all; he’s seen just about everything; and he isn’t
going to think you’re a ninny for not knowing what that strange red mark on
Baby’s arm is. For more on this, see “Identifying Baby’s Beauty Marks” later in
the chapter.
You can expect the doctor to ask you about Baby’s sleep and eating patterns,
his bowel movements, and how the adjustment at home is going. Be honest. If
parenting thus far has exceeded every expectation you had, tell him that.
Pediatricians love to hear good news from the home front.
During the first pediatrician visit, you’ll be handed a health record booklet,
which you’ll tote back and forth to the doctor’s office in order to record
Baby’s growth, immunizations (see Chapter 18), and feeding information.
Milestones this month
From birth through the first month, Baby’s development is slow but steady.
These are only guidelines as to what most babies are doing at this age. Your
pediatrician is your best source of information regarding your own child.
Here are a few milestones to look for:
 Having lost weight after delivery, Baby returns to her birth weight by the
time she’s 2 weeks old.
 Her length increases about 11⁄2 inches this month.
 She gains about 1⁄2 ounce to 1 ounce a day, which translates into almost 
2 pounds.
 Baby has virtually no neck strength at this point. Her head lolls back and
forth or side to side without constant support.
 Baby’s movements are random and jerky. Her limbs are flexed, and she’s
easily startled.
81
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You

 She grabs onto a finger and holds it.
 Her rooting reflex is still strong and she sucks on something placed in
her mouth. She also follows an object placed near her mouth with her
mouth.
 Expect her to sleep at least 16 hours a day (but not consecutively).
 Baby is very nearsighted at this point. She can only clearly see things
that are 8 to 12 inches from her face. She also lacks the ability to track
objects with her eyes.
 The umbilical cord falls off ten days to two weeks after delivery.
 Baby loves faces and will stare at you for long periods of time (as long as
you’re close enough for her to see you).
 Baby has an affinity for female voices, perhaps because she’s grown so
used to the sound of her mother’s voice while in the womb.
Charting height and weight
When Baby is born, and with every well-child visit (into his school-aged
years), he’ll be weighed and measured. Those measurements will then be
graphed onto a standardized height and weight chart, and your doctor will
tell you where Baby’s growth falls, percentile-wise. For a look at growth
charts go to www.cdc.gov/growthcharts.
Now, growth isn’t a pass-fail thing. If Baby measures in the 50th percentile for
height and weight, it doesn’t mean that he’s not thriving. It simply indicates
that about 50 percent of infants his age are somewhat larger and heavier than
he is, and about 50 percent are smaller and lighter. And of course, there are
all sorts of variations in between — Baby could measure in the 95th per-
centile for height and the 50th percentile for weight, which simply means he’s
a long, thin infant.
Parents sometimes worry if Baby consistently measures on the lower end of
these charts. But remember, an infant who measures in the 30th percentile
for height every single time he’s in the doctor’s office is showing a definite
pattern of growth — he’s a bit smaller than his peers, but he’s holding his
own. The percentile isn’t the important thing, its how your baby grows over
time. We chart height and weight to track overall growth trends and usually
only get worried if a baby is falling off a height or weight curve he was on pre-
viously. Generally speaking, a sudden, drastic drop in height- or weight-
growth may be a worrisome sign of Baby’s not thriving. Your doctor will take
note of any radical changes as she charts Baby’s progress at each checkup.
82
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

The numbers on the growth chart are indicative of where Baby is now and
where he’s likely to stay, size-wise. Other areas your pediatrician will take a
look at when evaluating Baby’s growth include:
 The size of Baby’s parents. A 5-foot parent is more likely than a taller
person to have a child who is on the lower end of the height chart.
 Baby’s general health and happiness. Is he eating, sleeping, alert when
awake? Does he cry constantly? (If so, he may not be getting enough 
to eat.)
 Baby’s development. Is he hitting those milestones when he should?
The fact is, babies come in different sizes, from teeny to extra-large. As long
as your child seems to be eating well, and her growth patterns are consistent,
there’s no need for concern, no matter where she falls on the charts.
Height and weight charts have undergone a revision in the past few years.
The current charts were revised in 2000; the old charts are from the 1970s,
when breastfeeding was less in vogue, infants were regularly given whole
milk, and babies were started on solids earlier than they are today — hence,
babies tended to be larger and heavier during the first year. If you’re referring
to a chart on your own, check its publication date. Also feel free to ask your
doctor’s office whether they’re using the latest charts.
Rub a Dub Dub, Using the Tub
After Baby’s umbilical cord falls off and the circumcision heals, you’re ready
to move your child from sponge bathing to a real, live mini-tub. (If you didn’t
get one of these at your baby shower, buy one. They’re cheap, and they’re
83
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You
Charting the breastfed babe
Do breastfed babies and their bottlefed pals
grow at the same rate? Recent studies show
that there is a difference: Breastfed infants tend
to gain weight faster than bottlefed babies
during the first three months of life, and bottle-
fed infants tend to be heavier than breast-
feeding infants during the second half of 
the first year. This isn’t a worrisome occurrence,
as long as Baby is growing consistently. One
area of concern may pop up if a breastfeeding
mother is feeling pressured to supplement
Baby’s meals or to put him on solids too early
because the child seems smaller than other
infants. Talk to your pediatrician if you’re con-
cerned about Baby’s growth progress. If there’s
no problem, he’ll assure you of this in no uncer-
tain terms; if Baby legitimately needs more
nourishment, he’ll be able to give you advice on
that angle, as well.

the easiest way to safely bathe a small baby.) The tub sits right in your
kitchen sink. You can also put it in your bathtub, in which case you only fill
the small tub with water, leaving the big tub empty.
Putting Baby in the tub for the first time can be daunting, but it’s worth the
effort. A real bath may stimulate or soothe your child — and in either case, it
may tire her right out, which may be good news for you! And after you get the
hang of it, bathing your infant in a tub of water will probably seem easier than
trying to both wash her and keep her warm during a sponge bath. In fact, a
baby who routinely cries during sponge bathing may surprise you by settling
right into her lukewarm bathtub. And another bonus is that Baby won’t be as
slippery in the tub as she is when you try to sponge bathe her!
Believe it or not, you’ll be a bathtime pro in no time. Initially, though, you
may need anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes just to get all of your supplies
ready, fill the tub, and wash, dry, and dress Baby.
Never, never leave Baby alone in the tub, not even for a few seconds. Take the
phone off the hook, put your pets in their crates, and don’t answer the door
until bathtime is over. In the event of a real emergency, where you have to
respond to someone or something, take Baby out of the tub.
Giving Baby a good wash
Choose the least hectic time of your day and take your time. Here’s what 
you do:
1. Gather all of your supplies and place them near the tub.
You need soap, a baby washcloth, shampoo, and a cup to rinse Baby’s
head. Place these items in easy reach of your dominant hand, and open
or loosen the caps before you put Baby in the tub.
2. Make sure the tub is safely secured on the sink. It shouldn’t wobble 
or tip.
3. Fill the tub only halfway (slightly more for a large infant) with luke-
warm water.
Baby doesn’t need to be fully submerged, but you will need enough
water to rinse the soap off and so that she isn’t freezing. Test the tem-
perature with the inside of your wrist to make sure it’s not too hot for
Baby’s sensitive skin.
4. Run the cold water (turning the spout away from the tub) until the
faucet feels cool.
This ensures Baby won’t grab a hot faucet; also, any water that drips on
Baby will be cold.
84
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

5. Ease Baby into the tub.
Keep a constant hand on Baby so that she feels secure. Move her close
to the side of the tub if she seems frightened. Sing to her, talk to her, play
with her little toes, but keep it on the quiet side for now. You want this to
be fun time for her, but you don’t want to overstimulate her — at least
not until she decides that bathtime is playtime.
6. Wash her with baby soap and a washcloth.
Wash her neck, her cheeks, behind her ears, her body, her back. Save
her diaper area for last so that you aren’t wiping her face with a dirty
washcloth. If Baby decides to urinate in the water, you probably won’t
even know about it, unless you have a boy. It happens. Change the water
and continue the bath.
If she has diaper rash, use plain water (without soap) for her bath. If you
need to wash off diaper rash ointment, rub it softly with a washcloth.
7. Wash her hair with baby shampoo.
Rinse her head slowly and carefully with a cup of lukewarm or cooler
water. Baby-safe shampoo and plain water won’t harm Baby’s eyes, but if
you don’t like the idea of her having soap in her eyes, just take extra
care to shield her face from the water while you rinse. Hold a hand right
at her hairline to redirect any wayward bubbles.
8. Dry her off, diaper, and dress her.
Comb her hair with a baby comb; clip her nails with the baby clippers.
Use lotion if Baby’s skin is dry, but avoid the use of powder, because it
can be harmful to Baby if inhaled.
Now that you’ve done the work, enjoy the benefits: Take a deep, long sniff of
Baby’s clean head. There’s that perfect infant smell!
Cradle cap
You may notice that your child has a thick, scaly substance on her head that
just won’t come off when you rub it with a washcloth. The substance is prob-
ably cradle cap — a rash caused by a hormonal reaction. Normally, we all
shed our dried skin cells. Baby’s sebaceous glands are emitting an oily matter
that’s causing the old skin cells on his head to stick there.
Cradle cap is unpleasant to look at, but is common in infants. It’s not harmful
to your child, nor is it contagious.
Dandruff shampoo may be helpful in eliminating cradle cap; use it one or two
times a week, making sure to guard Baby’s eyes from the suds, because these
shampoos are not tear-free. You can also try rubbing some mineral oil into
the scales before you begin Baby’s bath. Let it sit for a few minutes before
85
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You

using Baby’s comb to loosen the scales. If this doesn’t work, let the oil sit for
a longer period of time before using the comb again. Baby’s hair will be
greasy afterward and will need a thorough cleansing.
If the rash appears to be red and itchy, call your pediatrician. He may pre-
scribe a special cream to alleviate any discomfort. Sometimes, cradle cap is
so thick that mineral oil doesn’t do much to loosen it. Call your doctor’s
office for a recommendation in this case, as well. Certain shampoos may
help, but they’re not formulated for infants’ use. Your doctor may advise you
to wait on using these until Baby is older.
Connecting with Baby
Comparing yourself to other new parents can really make you feel rotten.
Your brother and sister-in-law just had a baby, and they seem completely at
ease, as though they’ve been doing this parenting thing all their lives. In fact,
everyone you know who has a new baby seems to have settled in quite
nicely, while you’re just waiting for the Parent Fairy to sprinkle you with
magic dust and make you feel like a real mom (or dad).
Deep down, you know that parenting is a tough new gig to jump into, espe-
cially if you’ve never cared for anything more significant than a houseplant 
in the past. The first month is a time of major adjustment for you and your
partner — as mates and as parents. And if you’re on your own, bringing a
baby into your home may seem overwhelming. With all of the excitement,
anxiety, and loss of sleep, you may not fully acknowledge what’s really hap-
pening in your life at this point. The best thing you can do is to take a step
back and go easy on yourself. Everything will fall into place and seem incredi-
bly natural — it just takes some time.
Beginning to trust yourself as a parent
Baby is a complete stranger when you bring her home from the hospital. She
may be a very easy stranger to have in the house, or she may be a bit of a
scary stranger, exhibiting signs of a temperamental little personality. Either
way, you have to give yourself time to get to know her and her patterns.
You have to give yourself time to adjust to the fact that you’re caring for this
little stranger 24 hours a day now. Sometimes, you may have to try several
tactics before you figure out what Baby really wants. Sometimes, you get
things right on the first try, and other times, you feel like you have no busi-
ness being a parent. Don’t fool yourself — being confused is part of being a
parent.
86
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Beginning to trust yourself where Baby is concerned isn’t always an easy
task, and it seems to come a lot easier if you have a good support system
around cheering you on and showing you the ropes. But cheering section or
no, you can figure this out. Just realize that there is no such thing as a Super
Parent. We’re all human, we all have real emotions, and anyone who’s ever
had an infant with a powerful, long-lasting cry has wanted to join in and shed
a few tears.
Preserving your mental health is crucial in these initial days when Baby’s
schedule is topsy-turvy. Tag-team parenting can be very effective during this
time: Catch a nap whenever your partner is available to take Baby for an
hour. If your partner isn’t available, but your trustworthy friend volunteers to
help, accept the offer. A well-rested parent is going to enjoy the Baby experi-
ence way more than a worn-out parent is.
Waiting — and waiting — 
to feel the bond
You’ve had Baby home for a week, and still, you’re not feeling like a real
parent. You may still be suffering the effects from a rough delivery, and you’re
also feeling the effects of the hormonal changes that come after delivery. On
top of that, your breasts may be incredibly sore if you’re nursing. If you’re a
dad, you may be suffering the effects of surviving on very little sleep, along
with trying to keep your partner happy. This isn’t an easy time for anyone.
Moms and dads alike may also be feeling disappointed that this hasn’t been
the perfect experience you were expecting — and you may even be feeling
guilty for not being happier. Let go of your perception that every new parent
is ecstatic.
Baby blues — feelings of anxiety and sadness — are a fairly common occur-
rence in the first two postpartum weeks, and they can be enough to make
you doubt your abilities as a parent and make the bonding experience diffi-
cult. More details on postpartum sadness are included in Chapter 2.
Most pediatricians won’t treat mom’s depression. Call your OB first. The best
thing to do is cry for help, not cry alone.
Although the baby blues are fairly common and somewhat fleeting, postpar-
tum depression is less common but far more serious. If your mood changes
from a general sad feeling to one of hopelessness; if you can’t sleep or you
can’t get out of bed; if you can’t stop crying; or if you’re thinking of hurting
yourself or Baby, contact your doctor or Baby’s pediatrician at once.
87
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You

Many parents need time to ease into the loving bond they expected to have
right off the bat. Rest assured, the love will come, and it will be as strong as
you thought it would be — all in due time.
Identifying Baby’s Beauty Marks
When you’re pregnant, you picture your baby as a perfect little infant with
dimpled cheeks and a rosy complexion. No parent ever includes a birthmark
on their fantasy child, and yet . . . they pop up all the time. Many will fade or
disappear all together, but some will remain with Baby for a lifetime. We
explain some of the most common birthmarks in the following sections.
“Stork bites” or “angel kisses”
These are by far the most common birthmarks; well over half of all babies
have one of more of these flat purple, red, or pink splotches. They’re com-
monly seen either on the back of Baby’s neck or on his eyelids, on the side of
his nose, or on his forehead. The bites or kisses (also called salmon patches)
are actually dilated capillaries just underneath the skin. Most will fade by the
time Baby is 2 years old (marks on the back of the neck tend to be most per-
sistent). In any event, they’re harmless and don’t require any intervention.
You may notice that they become redder when Baby cries or fills his diaper
because the blood vessels fill with blood. This is completely normal and
nothing to be alarmed about.
Café au lait spots
Also quite common, these tan or brown patches may appear anywhere on the
body, and they may also appear in groups. They could be present at birth, or
they may show up during Baby’s first couple of years. These don’t go away,
and may become darker if exposed to the sun. If Baby has more than six café
au lait spots, make sure your pediatrician is aware of it; this could be indica-
tive of an underlying medical condition and may need further evaluation.
Mongolian spots
These flat spots of pigment are bluish-black or gray in color and appear most
commonly on the lumbar region or the buttocks of dark-skinned children,
though they can also show up on the shoulders and legs. Mongolian spots are
caused by a group of melanocytes (cells containing melanin) close to the sur-
face of the skin. Statistics show that almost all African American, Asian,

Indian, Native American, and Hispanic babies have Mongolian spots. These
may darken during the first year, but they will eventually fade.
Make sure your pediatrician documents these spots, because they can be
mistaken for bruises by well-meaning babysitters.
Hemangioma
Hemangiomas are clusters of blood vessels and fall into two types:
 Strawberry hemangioma may appear as a raised, red area anywhere on
Baby’s body, either at birth or during the first month. The spot increases
in size for six months to one year, and then stops. When Baby is about
11⁄2 years old, the mark will start to shrink, and will eventually fade over a
period of years. It will probably disappear completely by the time your
child is 10.
 Cavernous hemangioma involve deeper layers of the skin and vascular
system. These are less common than strawberry hemangioma and are
usually not present at birth; instead, they start out as flat spots (they
may look like a scratch) and increase in size rapidly during the first year.
They can be quite large, spongy, and bluish in color — some may resem-
ble a bump or bruise (leaving you to answer the question from complete
strangers — over and over again — “What happened to your child?”).
Good news, though: Most get smaller by the time your child is in
preschool and will probably disappear completely by the time he’s in
kindergarten.
Hemangioma birthmarks of both kinds can be quite large and disfiguring,
especially when they appear on Baby’s face. This is sometimes very upsetting
to parents (because thoughtless people may feel the need to point out your
child’s birthmark, as though you’ve somehow overlooked it). Unless the
birthmark is interfering with Baby’s vital functions (his breathing is
obstructed or he can’t eat because of a hemangioma on his lip), most derma-
tologists recommend waiting it out. Removing a hemangioma prematurely
can leave a lifelong scar, whereas allowing nature to take its course leaves
Baby with almost no visible remnants.
Doctors also get concerned about hemangiomas near the eye and over the
spine. Hemangiomas over the spine can be a sign of an underlying abnormal-
ity in the spine and need to be brought to the attention of your doctor.

Port-wine stain
Also called nevus flammeus, port-wine stains are dark red or purplish flat
marks that can appear anywhere on the body. These birthmarks are present
at birth, appearing flat and red; they increase in size as Baby grows, and in
thickness over time. Port-wine stains can lead to serious emotional distress
for parents and children alike. As the child reaches adolescence, laser treat-
ments become an option for fading these birthmarks.
The cause of port-wine stains was unknown until recently; they’re thought to
be caused by a deficiency in the body’s ability to constrict certain blood 
vessels. Port-wine stains that appear near Baby’s eye or on his cheek could
also be indicative of other medical conditions, most notably Sturge-Weber
Syndrome, in which blood vessels of the eye and brain are also affected. Your
pediatrician will evaluate port-wine stains in this area to rule out further 
complications.
Letting Sleeping Babies Lie
Having a baby in the house makes you stop and consider the most rudimen-
tary needs of human beings. Your day is suddenly focused on a basic need
you have probably either taken for granted for years and/or never given
much thought to: sleep. And one thing you notice right off the bat is that
Baby’s internal clock is far different from yours.
How much sleep does she need?
Every baby is different, but generally speaking, newborns sleep 16 to 20
hours a day, mostly in spurts of a couple of hours here and there. Your little
one will probably wake to eat, spend some time having her diaper changed,
stare at you while you cuddle with her, and then doze off again before too
long.
Most children this age don’t fall into any kind of sleeping pattern, but some
do. If your infant is awake at different times every single day, you’re not doing
anything wrong. Baby’s just doing what her little body is telling her to do: eat
and rest. (We should all have it so good.) In addition, she’s still working out
the little kinks in her nervous system, which is tiring work for an infant. An
immature, overactive nervous system can keep a baby awake at the most
inopportune times (all night long, for example); when all of her neurons start
firing properly (as they will over the next couple of months), her sleep cycle
will settle into more of a routine.
90
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Night owls and go-go-go babies
Babies who just don’t want to sleep may be at the mercy of their developing
nervous systems. Because Baby is easily overstimulated at this age, he may
not be able to drop off to sleep by himself. It’s all right to rock him and rub
his little back in a quiet setting to calm him down, but try to put him in his
bassinet or crib while he’s still awake. You don’t want to establish a pattern
of rocking him to sleep every time he dozes off, or he may never learn to
comfort himself in those final moments before sleep takes hold.
Night owl babies (infants who are most alert very late at night right into the
wee morning hours) have their little clocks mixed up. The theory as to why
this happens seems logical enough: In the womb, many infants are lulled to
sleep by their mother’s movement during the day. These infants begin their
kicking and the rolling inside the womb when their moms retire for the
evening. This can be fatiguing enough when Mom is still pregnant — when
the kicking turns to real-life crying, what’s a parent to do?
You can help Baby turn his schedule around by doing the following:
 Keep nighttime sacred. Turn down the lights, keep noise down to a
whisper, and all other stimulation to a minimum.
 Save the crib for night sleeping. Put Baby down for his naps in his
bassinet out in the living room.
 Cut back on his daytime naps. Keep him busy by putting him under the
baby gym, giving him a bath (unless that makes him drowsy), tickling his
feet, or singing. Giving him more stimulation during the day may make
him want to stay awake for longer periods of time.
 Don’t tiptoe around the house during the day while baby is sleeping.
Let him get used to the daytime noise of the TV, radio, phone, and
vacuum. Then when it’s quiet at night, he’ll sleep more soundly.
Unless he’s really crying, avoid the urge to sprint over to Baby when you hear
him in his crib or bassinet during the night. Give him a chance to drift off
again by himself. By rushing to his side, you could inadvertently encourage
his nighttime wakefulness.
Considering sleeping with Baby
For reasons of convenience and closeness, many parents consider sleeping
with Baby in the adults’ bed. There’s a lot of conflicting information about
sharing your bed with Baby, and people tend to feel very strongly one way or
the other, dismissing any dissenting opinions. There are definite advantages
and disadvantages to having Baby in your bed. Take a look at Table 6-1 for a
quick run down of both

parents, setting the parents up for
years of either sleeping with an older
child or bedtime battles over the child
sleeping in his own room.
Weeks and weeks of nighttime feedings take their toll, and you just get to the
point where you want a full night’s sleep — or anything close to it. But the
potential serious risks of sharing a bed seem to outweigh the temporary ben-
efits. Placing your infant in his own bassinet next to your bed is a better
option; you’ll have him right there, and yet he has a sense of being on his own.
You can also try a crib equipped with a drop-down side that connects to your
bed (Figure 6-1), called a co-sleeper. This offers you the best of both worlds.
Baby is just a reach away, but in his own bed. You’ll have the convenience of
almost having him right there with you, without the worries involved in shar-
ing the bed with him.

Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Figuring Out Feeding Time
Like sleep, feeding becomes a focus of new parents’ lives. You may be sur-
prised by how much time you spend worrying whether Baby is eating 
enough — or too much. Top that off with some serious concerns about gas
and a heart-to-heart about poop, and you can consider yourself fully initiated
into new parenthood.
Growing pains
Because pediatricians recommend feeding newborns on demand (that is,
when Baby says it’s time to eat), new parents are constantly on call, ready
and waiting with a bottle or the breast whenever the cries of hunger begin.
Baby may not settle into a definite pattern in the first few weeks.
Right around the 3-week mark (and again at 6 weeks and 3 months), all babies
(bottle and breastfed) undergo a growth spurt. Your breastfed Baby will start
nursing more often, more energetically, and possibly for longer periods of
times. Your breasts may start leaking (almost like they did when your milk
initially came in) and they may hurt more than usual.
Your body has a remarkable capability to adjust to this demand, and the dis-
comfort you’re feeling is only temporary — after Baby has established just
how much milk she needs at this point (she’s doing this by feeding more and
by sucking harder), your breasts will settle into this new phase. Expect her
voracious nursing to last a few days, and probably no longer than a week.
93
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You
Feeding baby too much?
Even small babies can have big appetites. Some
parents, especially those of bottlefed infants,
who are actually doling out larger amounts of
formula to their child (as opposed to breast-
feeding moms, who can’t see what Baby is
eating), start to wonder if they’re giving Baby
too much to eat. The truth of the matter is 
that as long as you’re letting Baby control the
feeding sessions (allowing him to eat whenever
he needs to and offering him an adequate
amount of formula), he’ll cut himself off when
he’s had enough. This is an automatic part of his
programming. You really can’t feed him too
much, but you can underfeed him. Remember,
his little body has a lot going on right now, and
he needs every bit of nourishment he’s taking in.

It’s important to nurse Baby through a growth spurt so that your milk supply
will match her demands. You may be tempted to add a bottle to the feeding
schedule in order to give yourself a break during these growth spurts, but
doing this is counterproductive. Unless Baby is allowed to feed as often as
she needs, your milk supply won’t increase to an adequate level, leaving both
of you frustrated. In the end, supplementing with a bottle could end up caus-
ing you to wean your child sooner than you had planned.
The scoop on poop
Many newborns seem as though they’re determined to single-handedly keep
the diaper companies in business. An infant may fill his diaper every time he
eats, which could be somewhere in the neighborhood of ten times a day for a
breastfed babe. This isn’t at all unusual. What goes in must come out, after
all, and Baby’s frequent bowel movements are one way for you to know with
certainty that he’s getting plenty to eat. (If your nursing Baby is having fewer
than five bowel movements per day, he may not be getting enough breast
milk.) A breastfed baby’s stool may be runny, yellowish, and look like it has
little seeds in it. A bottlefed infant has fewer bowel movements (one a day,
one every other day, one every third day . . . your child will develop his own
pattern) and the stool is usually tan and more solid.
A tiny infant’s bowel movement can be surprisingly explosive, so don’t be
alarmed by the noise (he may even grunt) or the amount of stool in his
diaper. Keep a healthy stock of diapers in the house, along with plenty of
clean outfits on the changing table.
During the second month, bowel movements tend to become less frequent,
though they may remain explosive until Baby starts on solids, at which point
his stool will become . . . well, more solid.
Green stools are also normal. Worry about red (blood), black (old blood), or
white (possible liver problems) stools.
What a gas!
Babies can be gassy little creatures. Gas can be caused by Baby’s swallowing
air or possibly by something that a nursing mother has eaten. Some babies
pass gas regularly throughout the day, blissfully unaware of it. But sometimes
that gas gets stuck in their little tummies or intestines, bubbling up in there,
making Baby very uncomfortable.
94
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Painful gas is no laughing matter. Your infant may scream in pain and/or pull
her little legs up to her stomach. Your goal, of course, is to soothe her, get
that gas out of her, and try to prevent this from happening in the future.
If your bottlefed child suffers from gas regularly, try using a bottle with a col-
lapsible insert. You actually remove all the air from the insert before you feed
Baby, so it minimizes the chance of her ingesting a lot of air along with her
formula. You can also try changing the nipple on a regular bottle to see
whether that helps reduce Baby’s gassy spells. The nipple you’ve been using
may be too small, causing Baby to suck air while she’s only trying to get
some food.
Burp Baby in the middle of her feeding (or two or three times during the feed-
ing if she seems very gassy) and after she’s completely finished. If you don’t
get a healthy belch after a minute or two, keep trying. It’s important to help
her ease the gas out of her system so that it doesn’t pop up an hour later and
cause her major discomfort.
A breastfeeding mom should keep track of her own diet for a few days and try
to eliminate foods that could be irritating to Baby’s gastrointestinal system
like:
 Dairy products (milk, cheese, ice cream). Remember, you don’t have to
drink milk to make milk.
 Spicy foods (including garlic)
 Stimulants (like caffeine)
 Gas-inducing foods (broccoli, beans, or a diet heavy in veggies)
Don’t eliminate all of these foods at once, or you’ll never know which is the
culprit. Instead, isolate and eliminate each group for several days at a time,
making sure to note Baby’s reaction. If the gas seems to be gone, you can
attribute it to whichever food group has most recently been subtracted from
your diet.
In spite of your best efforts, Baby may still suffer from an occasional bout
with painful gas. There are some positions you can try to soothe her and to
break up those bubbles and get that gas out; all of them involve applying firm
pressure to her tummy. If doing this causes her more discomfort, stop imme-
diately. Try this:
 Lay her on her back on a flat surface and press gently on her tummy as
you rub it.
 Hold her up on your shoulder, patting her back, just as if you were burp-
ing her during a feeding. You may get a decent belch from her.
95
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You

 Sit in a chair and place her facedown on your leg. Pat her back and
bounce her very gently.
 Add a little warmth. Fill a hot water bottle with warm water and lay Baby
tummy-down on top of it (on a safe surface, like the floor), rubbing her
back. (Caution: Don’t use hot water! You could burn Baby’s delicate
skin.)
If nothing seems to work and this is a regular occurrence, call your pediatri-
cian for further guidance. He may recommend simethicone drops to break up
the gas, but this medicine has very mixed results (it works like a charm for
some kids, but doesn’t touch the gas in others). He may also want to discuss
a change in formula for your bottlefed infant.
Cry Me a River
Every baby cries — some just cry more often and more intensely than others.
Your infant, as intelligent as he is, doesn’t have the capacity to communicate
with you at this point in time except through crying. As Baby gets a bit older,
you may be able to discern which cry means what — but right now, there will
probably be times when you don’t know why the heck this kid is crying. Hang
in there. This happens to almost every parent, and it’s always confusing, no
matter how well prepared you thought you were to care for Baby.
Running down reasons for tears
Hunger is at the top of the list of reasons babies cry. If he’s still crying after
you’ve offered him the breast or bottle, run down this checklist to determine
whether there’s another fairly simple answer to his problem:
 Does he need a fresh diaper?
 Is he too hot or too cold?
 Could he be tired?
 Is a tag scratching his neck, or is his toe caught in a snap?
 Is he sick? (An infant who has a high fever or is vomiting should be seen
by his pediatrician as soon as possible.)
Obviously, you know how to remedy these situations. If nothing jumps up as
the obvious cause of Baby’s unhappiness, he may be feeling overstimulated,
frightened, or just not right. Remember, his nervous system isn’t fully devel-
oped, and things that wouldn’t bother an adult (noise, light, a funny smell)
can seriously irritate a sensitive little one.
96
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

In this case, try some of these comfort measures:
 Swaddle him. Infants love the feeling of being bundled up, safe and
secure. Take care not to bundle him too tightly, or this could cause more
crying.
 Hold him, rock him, move him around. Motion soothes some criers.
 Offer him a pacifier. Babies need to suck for comfort. Your child may
need to suck more often than every few hours at a feeding. Chapter 8
offers a more detailed look at the pros and cons of pacifiers.
It can be incredibly frustrating when nothing soothes a crying infant. Realize
that this is also normal, and that it has almost nothing to do with your abili-
ties as a parent. As long as you’re looking for the cause and not further over-
stimulating him, you’re doing everything you can.
If you suspect gas is to blame for your breastfed child’s crying, check out the
earlier section, “What a gas!” You may also have a child who is more sensitive
than the average infant to the world around him. As a result, an entire day’s
worth of stimulation — light, voices, smells, movement — may result in a 
volcanic crying explosion in the evening, when Baby has to let it all out. I dis-
cuss dealing with sensitive babies in Chapter 8.
When your frustration reaches its apex and Baby is still crying, leave him in
his crib for a few minutes while you comfort yourself. All new parents find
themselves feeling frazzled from time to time; walking away from the situa-
tion for a short time is sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself and
for Baby. Take some deep breaths. Do some stretches, if that helps. Call a
friend or your mom. Tell yourself that Baby isn’t doing this to ruin your day,
and that eventually, this will all pass.
Coping with colic
An infant who cries for hours on end at specific times of the day without any
obvious cause may have colic, which is an entirely different level of misery —
for Baby and for you. Any parent who has dealt with a colicky baby will tell
you that it’s incredibly difficult, so if you suspect your child’s crying is due to
something other than hunger or discomfort, you have the sympathies of care-
givers around the world.
Colic is loosely defined as crying that lasts for at least two hours, occurs at
specific times of the day (often late in the evening), at least three times a
week. This pattern usually sets in sometime during the first month. The
cause is really unknown. It used to be blamed on Baby’s immature digestive
system roiling up in gas, and while that theory is still floating around, new
theories suggest that colic is due to an infant’s immature nervous system and
his inability to shut out an irritating environment.
97
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You

Whatever the cause, colic is harmless to your child, and will usually subside
completely on its own by the end of the third month. It’s hardest on Baby’s
caregivers, who listen to the wails every day or every night. There are some
tried-and-true tips for quieting the colicky baby, including:
 Soothe him with white noise and vibration. Run the vacuum cleaner or
a fan, or buy a white noise machine. Put him near the clothes dryer
while it’s running. Take him for a long car ride. Let him rest in his swing.
The combination of white noise and vibration has been known to put
many a colicky child right to sleep.
 Tote him around. Put Baby in a front-carrier or a sling. Sometimes being
close to Mom is just what the colicky baby needs.
 Give him a pacifier. Sucking is soothing, especially for a child who’s
senses are more intense.
 Massage him. Touch is an incredibly soothing force for an infant.
 Change the scenery. Try taking him outside — or giving him a bath. For
some reason, some colicky babies sometimes respond to these sudden
change-ups. (Hey, if it works, don’t question it!)
Most importantly, if someone offers to help with a colicky baby, accept the
offer. Listening to the crying on a daily basis can wear out the most patient
parent. Go easy on yourself if you find that yourself lying on your own bed
crying while Baby is screaming in his crib. The old adage that parenting is the
toughest job in the world was likely coined by someone with a colicky baby.
Colic can wreak havoc on your relationship with your mate. Maintain commu-
nication about the issue and give each other a break. One person shouldn’t
deal with a colicky infant all the time — it’s not good for that parent, and it’s
better for Baby to have a well-rested (relatively speaking, of course) caregiver.
Escaping the House with Baby in Tow
Staying home with your baby isn’t always the sweet deal other people may
think it is. (Like your former co-workers, who truly believe you’re sleeping in
all day and painting your toenails whenever the mood strikes you.) In fact,
spending every waking moment inside your house — no matter what size 
it is — starts to feel like you’re doing hard time, albeit for good reason and
with good company.
As long as you’re feeling well (with the effects of delivery almost a memory),
you can surely take Baby out of the house. Some tips for your first outings:
98
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

 Pack the diaper bag with everything you need. Include plenty of extra
diapers, the changing pad, wipes, bottles, and formula for the bottlefed
infant, burp cloths, and a pacifier, if your child uses one.
 Don’t make any big plans. There’s a lot involved in toting an infant
around, including feedings and diaper changes. An errand that took you
30 minutes to complete in your pre-baby days may now take you well
over an hour. Be prepared for this.
 Take someone else along on your first outing or two. You’re going to be
getting used to an entirely new system of leaving the house and dealing
with Baby’s needs while you’re out and about. Having an assistant the
first few times will make your transition to this system much smoother.
 Avoid taking Baby into a house filled with sick people. A tiny infant’s
immune system isn’t yet equipped to do battle with the cold and flu
season. The result is twofold: Baby is more susceptible to catching cold,
and is also more prone to becoming very ill from it.
Although you’ve certainly left the house in the past, doing so with Baby is
very different, both from a planning point of view and because your schedule
now rotates around Baby’s needs. For now, take each moment as it comes
and don’t have any grand expectations of how things should go. In time —
believe it or not — your outings will become a normal part of everyday life.
For more information on getting out of the house with Baby, see Chapter 3.
99
Chapter 6: The First Month: Getting to Know You
Taking care of yourself
Along with figuring out Baby’s wants and needs
during this first month, you’ll also be figuring out
yourself. Parenting takes an extreme amount of
fortitude, patience, and sacrifice (the first sac-
rifice, you’ve no doubt noticed, is sleep). In
order to be ready to take care of your child, you
have to take care of yourself. Make sure you’re
getting enough to eat. Sleep (or at least rest)
when Baby does. Accept all offers of help that
you can tolerate, and communicate your level
of tolerance. (You may not want your mother
over all day long, but let her know you’d cer-
tainly appreciate her giving you a hand in the
evening.)
Above all else, have a realistic outlook. The first
few months with Baby require big adjustments
across the board, and it takes time for everyone
to settle in. Go easy on yourself and on your
mate, who’s figuring out life with Baby right
alongside you.
Allow yourself to take the shortcuts in life that
you may have avoided till now: Eat take-out.
Clean the house once a week. Let your mother
fold your laundry. Maybe fried chicken in a box,
a dirty bathroom, and your mother’s odd way of
folding underwear never made it into the fan-
tasy you developed of the perfect life with Baby,
but anything that makes your life easier gives
you more energy to care for your child — and
that’s pretty darn ideal.

 Adjusting to the breastfed baby’s schedule
B
aby’s been very busy, growing and learning new tricks — it’s hard to
believe she was just a blob a few weeks ago who couldn’t smile, coo, or
stay awake for very long. The second month is a time of little accomplish-
ments and continued adjustments. Parents who are able to go with the flow
may have a slight advantage over parents who live their lives by the clock,
simply because most babies aren’t quite up to establishing a fixed schedule
at this point.
In this chapter, we bring you up to date on what to expect of Baby’s new
growth and help you deal with Baby’s changing activity patterns. Formula-
feeding moms may notice that their babies are falling into definite patterns at
this point. You know how much Baby is taking at each meal, and feedings are
starting to come at more regular times. Breastfeeding moms may not be so
lucky; in this chapter we give you some clues on how to deal with a breastfed
baby’s hectic schedule.
Checking In with Baby
Starting now, the changes come fast and furious. Baby starts to look more
like the cutie pie you had imagined while you were pregnant, and he starts to
notice his world a bit more. And although you may be content to sit back and

watch him grow, you can play an active role in encouraging his development.
Don’t expect too much, though: He may be ready to roll, but he’s not quite
ready to run.
In this section, we tell you what to expect from your monthly doctor
checkup, give you some tips on how Baby may be changing, and then give
you a few clues on how to help her with development skills.
The 2-month checkup
Expect this month’s checkup to focus on just about everything. You’ll be
exhausted, naturally (as much as from the excitement of watching Baby’s
latest developments as from the 3 a.m. feedings), so prepare yourself with a
list of questions and concerns you want to discuss with your pediatrician.
You may want to know, for example, whether Baby’s explosive bowel move-
ments are normal (yes, they are), or if he can see you from all the way across
the room (not yet). Because a baby is an endless source of wonder, there’s
really no end to the questions that new parents may have. Don’t be shy about
asking them. Your doctor’s your best source of baby-related information!
Keep a small memo pad handy at home for jotting down questions that pop
up between visits. Slip it into the diaper bag when you’re finished with it, so it
won’t get lost in the general baby mess in the house.
During this visit, you can expect the following:
 Baby is weighed and measured (including head and chest 
circumferences).
 The doctor takes note of Baby’s physical development: Can he lift his
head while he’s on his stomach? How’s that belly button looking? What
about the circumcision?
 The doctor asks about any areas of concern you may have: Is Baby’s
bottom red and raw? Is this kid a spit-up champion? The doctor will
advise you on how to handle anything you’re particularly worried about
(diaper ointment for that rash) and further assess anything that may
cause him concern (he may want to know how far baby spits, for exam-
ple, to rule out any gastrointestinal problems).
 Your doctor wants to know how things are going with Baby — feeding,
sleeping, bowel movements, bonding, the general state of affairs at
home. Be honest. (These first months aren’t easy for everyone, and your
doctor may have helpful advice that’s specific to your situation.)
102
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Immunizations
During the first year, most of Baby’s checkups will often include at least one
immunization shot. These shots come complete with a series of confusing ini-
tials that may make you fear you’re about to do a geometry problem. Don’t
worry, we break all this down in Chapter 18 for you, where we tell you exactly
what the initials mean and how they protect your child. This month, Baby
will be given:
DTaP #1
IPV #1
Hib #1
Ask about the side effects of each, how you can soothe Baby’s discomfort,
and what sort of reactions warrant a call to the doctor.
Milestones this month
Baby turns the corner from adorable little alien to incredibly cute baby this
month — physically and socially. During the second month, Baby will proba-
bly do the following:
 Baby loses the pointy head. The plates in Baby’s skull are still quite mal-
leable, and this month, they take on a more normal shape after that trip
through the birth canal. The soft spots on the top and at the back of her
head (fontanels) allow for this realignment of the skull bones.
 She can lift her head 45 degrees while she’s on her tummy.
 She can follow the movement of an object in front of her by turning her
head.
 Her movements become less jerky, more purposeful.
 Baby finds her hands, which are an endless source of amusement for
some infants (as the month progresses, she may also be able to swing at
the toys hanging from a baby gym).
 She can smile and coo.
Support that neck! Some babies have a good handle on holding their heads
up at this age, but most are still pretty wobbly. Real, dependable neck
strength won’t kick in till about the fourth month. Continue to support Baby’s
neck and head whenever you pick him up. Allow him to try out his burgeon-
ing neck muscles when you’re holding him, but always be prepared to catch a
heavy head.

Chapter 7: The Second Month: Finding Your Rhythm

Promoting baby’s development
During the second month, baby’s strength and hand-eye coordination
increase — you can help to develop them faster, though (and no, you don’t
have to buy him a little baby barbell set or a teeny-weeny eye chart in order
to do so).
Allow your little one to spend some time each day on his stomach. Sure, it
looks uncomfortable, but it’s great way to make him work those muscles. Lift
that head! Turn that neck! Find those hands!
Place Baby on a safe, clean surface for his mini-workout — a blanket on the
floor will work just fine. Let him try out his muscles for as long as he’s con-
tent to, or for as long as you can stand to watch him rub his face into the
blanket. Even at this age, you can never be sure when the little one will make
a surprising movement and propel himself backward, forward, or sideways,
which means countertops and sofas aren’t good workout areas.
Give your child a baby mirror (available in toy stores) and he’ll have ample
entertainment during his workout.
Encourage his hand-eye coordination by placing Baby on his back or in an
infant seat and holding items of interest in front of or above him. Babies love
the contrast of black-and-white objects, and they also love the human face.
Before long, Baby will reach out and try to touch someone or something,
which is the beginning of his hand-eye coordination. The more opportunities
he has to practice this skill, the sooner it’ll develop.
Babies aren’t able to see in full color until the fourth month, but research has
shown that newborns love contrasting, black-and-white patterns. Look for
toys with black-and-white swirls, stripes, or checks. Babies are also intrigued
by human faces, particularly areas of high contrast, such as your hairline. 
(So you aren’t just imagining that Baby is infatuated with you.)
Sleep, Baby, Sleep (Please!)
Parents of newborns can easily be identified by their drooping eyelids, their
pale complexions, and their uncanny ability to compute exactly how many
minutes of sleep they’ve had during the past week. The first sleep-deprived
month with Baby takes its toll; by month two, you’re seriously starting to
question whether your child will ever sleep through the night. The answer is
yes — but perhaps not quite yet.
104
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Cutting back on the daytime zzzzzs
If your little one refuses to sleep at night, she may be napping too much
during the day. If Baby still has her days and nights mixed up, or if she has
simply decided that nighttime is the right time (for eating and cooing), start
making a concerted effort to keep her awake more during the day. A sleepy
newborn in her first month of life can only handle so much stimulation before
she has to conk out; a 2-month-old can take a bit more.
To keep Baby awake and alert for longer periods:
 Put her on her stomach for her daily exercise
 Show her some cool black-and-white patterned toys
 Tickle her tummy and toes
 Sing to her
 Bring visitors in
Try to keep a 2-month-old night owl awake for at least two hours at a stretch
during the day for starters. As she starts to become more alert during your
waking hours, add more and more time, in ten-minute increments.
Let Baby sleep when he’s had enough! Most babies at this age can’t go more
than three to four hours without a nap. It’s all right to let him get a little
cranky — but only for a short time. Get the nap in before he turns into Mr.
Miserable. Overstimulated, overtired babies may have a terrible time trying
to fall asleep.
Plan some evening activities for the baby who tuckers out at 7 p.m. only to
rise three hours later, geared up for the nightlife. Many babies find a pre-
bedtime bath very soothing — and exhausting (bonus for you!).
If you address and try to correct each of these potential trouble spots, are
you guaranteed to have a baby who sleeps for hours on end during the night?
Nope. Each child is different, and what’s been helpful for quieting your
friend’s 2-month-old may only irritate your infant further. Unfortunately, some
parents find that no matter what they try, their infant just isn’t ready for
marathon snoozing. Keep telling yourself that this child will eventually 
sleep — and so will you.
105
Chapter 7: The Second Month: Finding Your Rhythm

Supplementing for sounder sleep
Bottlefed newborns tend to sleep for longer stretches during the day and
sleep through the night sooner than their breastfed buddies: Formula isn’t
digested as quickly as mother’s milk, so babies on the bottle stay fuller
longer. If your breastfed little one is dozing off after his nighttime nursing
only to awaken two hours later, squealing for more, chances are good that
he’s legitimately hungry.
If you’ve gotten to the point where you just can’t take being up constantly
during the night, ask you pediatrician about the possibility of adding a sup-
plemental bottle of formula at bedtime. Check out the upcoming section,
“Determining whether you need to supplement” for more information.
Breastfeeding Blues
Feeding Baby during the second month isn’t the uncertain venture it was
when he first arrived on the scene. By now you know what to expect from
each session, which is in itself reason to rejoice. When your breast starts
spraying milk clear across the room, for example, you hardly bat an eye.
But breastfeeding moms sometimes get discouraged at this time because
their babies are often far from being on any sort of schedule, and no one hap-
pened to mention this during Lamaze or in the hospital. Your job as a 24-hour
diner (Open All Night! Breakfast Served Anytime!) can start to feel like a drag.
You start wondering why you aren’t putting Baby on some sort of schedule —
that’s what mothers do, isn’t it?
Determining whether you 
need to supplement
During Baby’s checkup, discuss her feeding patterns with the doctor, who
will be able to tell by Baby’s growth whether she’s getting enough to eat.
Occasionally, a breastfed Baby doesn’t get enough milk — for several reasons
(maybe your nipples are inverted, Baby’s sucking reflex could be weak, or
sometimes milk production is low). This isn’t a failure on anyone’s part — 
it’s just something that happens from time to time. If Baby’s doctor deter-
mines that this is the case, he’ll probably want you to start giving Baby regu-
lar supplements.
106
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

If you’re not producing enough milk for Baby’s growing appetite, take a look
at what’s going on in your life and see if you can ease up a bit. Moms are
often back to work at this point. You may be on the go all day, forgetting to
increase your fluid intake; you may not be eating correctly or getting enough
rest — all of these are vital to successful nursing or pumping sessions! (Also,
continue taking your prenatal vitamins.)
Supplements have other benefits aside from filling Baby’s belly. Introducing
Baby to the occasional bottle means that Dad can easily take over a nighttime
feeding now and then. You can also leave Baby with a sitter for a night out
with your hubby, knowing that Baby won’t starve before you return.
Don’t add supplements to Baby’s feeding schedule until your breast milk is
well established — usually after six weeks. Introducing Baby to a bottle prior
to this time may also cause nipple confusion, because bottlefeeding and
breastfeeding require different methods of sucking.
You may be concerned about springing a new feeding system on your infant,
but the truth is there’s no time like the present. Waiting until he’s 4 months
old could result in a flat-out refusal from Baby to take to a substitute.
Baby is more likely to ease into taking a supplementary meal with nary a
peep if he’s good and hungry — but not so hungry that he’s screaming for
food. If he becomes really upset, he may want the comfort that only you (and
your breast) can provide.
Babies may get lazy with the bottle versus the breast. They get instant gratifi-
cation from the bottle and have to wait for the letdown when breastfeeding. If
this is a problem, express a little breast milk before latching the baby on so
there is something to taste right away.
What if Baby is starving — but not screeching — and he still won’t take the
bottle? Let Dad or another caregiver give it a go. Your intelligent, highly sensi-
tive child recognizes your voice, your touch, and your scent, which is likely
laden with breast milk. And even if you smell like a daisy, his crying will prob-
ably stimulate your milk — and after he catches a whiff of it, he’s going to
fight for his right to nurse.
Supplementing Baby’s meal with formula is fine; adding cereal at this age
isn’t. Your infant’s gastrointestinal system simply can’t handle solids yet, so
even if you think she’s ready . . . she’s not.
107
Chapter 7: The Second Month: Finding Your Rhythm

Feeding more often
If you’re determined to stick with breastfeeding, you may need to nurse 
Baby more often. The more often Baby feeds, the more milk you produce.
Alternatively, there is also a feeding system that allows Baby to breastfeed
while providing him with supplemental nutrition called the Medela
Supplemental Nursing System (SNS). Basically, it works like so: A bottle hangs
from the mother’s neck. Two long, thin, soft tubes extend from the bottle and
are taped to the mother’s breasts, so that they are positioned over the areola.
As a result, the baby takes the supplemental feeding tubes into his mouth
when he latches on to nurse. The sucking is helpful in encouraging milk 
production, and, most importantly, allows for breastfeeding to continue. 
For more information on this product, go to www.healthquest-nf.com/
suppnursSys.htm.
Demanding a schedule
If it turns out that your breastfed baby is getting plenty to eat, then you can
just say to him, “Hon, we’re going to sit down every three hours for a feeding,
and not before then.” Right?
Not really. Babies don’t just nurse for nutrition. Sucking and cuddling calm
Baby’s nerves. And most experts advise moms to continue feeding breastfed
babies whenever they show signs of hunger (turning their heads to the side,
rooting for something to suck on, and finally, crying).
The constant need to breastfeed Baby can be disheartening for the mom who
is finding that breastfeeding is a lot more work than she thought it would be,
but bear in mind that these early months are by far the most time-consuming
as far as nursing Baby goes. If this is your first time at the Mommy Rodeo,
breastfeeding can seem overwhelming at this point — especially when you’re
worn out (and were expecting Baby to be on a normal schedule by now).
You’re not a horrible mother if you’re feeling tied down to your nursing
infant. Many, many new moms feel this way. Take heart in the knowledge that
your baby won’t need to nurse every two hours for the rest of her life. She’ll
be on solids in a couple of months, which will curtail her need to breastfeed.
In the meantime, acknowledge that Baby may always nurse erratically, and
that it has nothing to do with your inability to put her on a schedule. It’s just
her nature.
108
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

If you really, truly decide that this breastfeeding thing isn’t working out, for-
mula is always an option. Tips for bottlefeeding are included in Chapter 2,
and tips for making the weaning process easier on yourself are included in
Chapter 16.
Seeing things in a new light
When you first start to breastfeed, every session is a huge production. You’re
still figuring out how to hold Baby, he’s learning to latch on, you’re concen-
trating on relaxing so your milk will come in, plus you’re exposing your
breasts to an audience of relatives (or at least a nurse or lactation specialist).
As Baby gets older, it’s okay to let go of some of the pageantry of nursing and
to find the easiest way to fit feedings into the rest of your busy life.
If nursing still seems like a huge ordeal, try a different position for Baby — or
for yourself. Do your reading, prepare your grocery list, or catch up on phone
calls and other easy tasks while nursing. On the other hand, if you’re feeling
exhausted, you need to chuck the chores and relax with Baby while he
nurses. Put your feet up and recline in your favorite chair, and you may just
find yourself looking forward to the next feeding.

The Third Month: Rolling Away
from Infancy
In This Chapter
 Developments into the third month
 Confining Baby safely
 Seeing whether Baby is ready for a routine
 Looking at a few concerns
D
uring the third month, Baby continues to develop her little personality.
She’s morphing from tiny infant to a real baby (now she looks like the
babies you see in commercials). Depending on how well she’s settling in at
home, you may be feeling that raising this kid is a breeze or that it’s harder
than you ever imagined. Either way, you may be wondering how the rest of
the first year is going to progress: If Baby is easy to deal with now, are you in
for it later, when she starts to walk? And if Baby hasn’t slept more than three
hours at a time from the day she was born, does this mean that she’ll never
settle into a routine?
The third month is a transitional time between true infancy and burgeoning,
active babyhood. Parents are also transitioning, as they settle into life with
Baby, but continue to adapt to the experience.
Checking In with Baby
During the third month, there’s usually no well-baby visit scheduled, but if
Baby isn’t feeling well or if an issue of concern pops up, call your pediatrician
for advice or to schedule an office visit. Because Baby is becoming more
active and alert this month, questions concerning her development may be
coming up on a regular basis. Jot your questions down and keep them in your
diaper bag so that you’ll have them handy at next month’s appointment.
Meantime, this section covers what Baby may be up to both physically and
socially over the course of this month.

Milestones this month
So, what’s Baby up to this month? He’s very busy growing, moving, and devel-
oping his communication skills. Here are a few changes you can expect to see
at this time:
 Baby gains about 11⁄4 pounds and adds 1 inch to his length.
 Baby starts to gain more neck strength and control. When pulled to sitting
position, his neck still lags behind, but noticeably less so than last month.
 He lifts his head and chest when you place him on his tummy. He isn’t
doing full push-ups yet; he’s happy to rest on his forearms.
 He bats and swings at objects in his baby gym. He probably doesn’t
grasp hold of them just yet, but he’s definitely getting closer.
 He can unclench those baby fists; he may be able to hold a rattle or
small toy.
 Baby makes small circular movements with his arms.
 Your child starts to discover and explore different parts of his body.
(What’s this? An ear?)
 He may be able to roll over one way, or at least he’s making the effort to
do so.
 He makes and maintains eye contact for longer periods of time.
 Baby stays awake (and sleeps) for longer stretches of time.
 He now shows emotions: surprise, fear, anger, happiness. He may also
mirror someone else’s facial expressions.
 Baby exhibits more interest in the world around him (which may mean
he’s less interested in nursing or sitting still with his bottle).
 He recognizes voices.
 He attempts deliberate communication by using different cries or by
cooing.
 Baby will look at a space where an object used to be, but has no sense of
object permanency at this point. (In other words, he may notice if some-
thing isn’t where it should be or where it once was, but he has no idea
that the thing is somewhere else now. To him, the object is simply gone.)
Catching Baby’s undivided attention
People without kids are sometimes shocked to see relatives talking comfort-
ably with an infant. It just doesn’t look natural, and it can seem downright
silly. The kid doesn’t understand what the heck you’re saying, so why say
anything, right?
112
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Look more closely, and you can see that Baby loves the attention. She may
not be able to answer just yet, but Baby can definitely understand some of
your message — the tone of voice you use, for example, is a great indicator of
your mood, and the more sing-songy you can make your voice, the more she
wants to listen to you.
How can you get Baby to respond to you when you speak? By following some
of these tips:
 Talk to her. Keep up a running narration of what’s going on: “Now it’s
time to eat, and then we’re going for a walk.”
 Sing to her. Even if you’re not ready to cut your own CD, Baby won’t
care. Sing her silly songs, lullabies, or whatever you’re into.
 Play games with her. Tickle her little toes and play “This little piggy.”
Hold her toys where she’ll have to reach for them. Blow raspberries on
her tummy.
 Look at her. You don’t have to stare into her eyes 24 hours a day, but
make eye contact while you’re talking or singing.
You don’t have to use baby talk with your infant — just speak in a soothing
tone of voice and give her your undivided attention. You may be pleasantly
surprised at Baby’s reactions (when she tries to vocalize during part of a
favorite song, for example), which can lead to more and more satisfying —
and completely natural — interactions between the two of you.
Physically speaking
Babies are a mixed lot. The chubby baby may have thin parents, and the
skinny kid may have a heavy family.
But should you worry about a chunky baby — or a very skinny one? Well, as
long as your pediatrician isn’t worried, you shouldn’t be, either. When your
pediatrician pulls out the growth chart each month, Baby is put into a growth
percentile for height and weight. (Check out www.cdc.gov/growthcharts
for more information.)
Kids often change very quickly. As soon as the butterball baby starts crawl-
ing, cruising, and walking, he’s probably going to slim down considerably
(and continue to do so over the next few years, as walking turns to running,
climbing, and skateboarding). And instead of being at a disadvantage, the
wiry babies often have an advantage in the movement department: Because
they’re thin, it’s often easier for them to get up and get going.
113
Chapter 8: The Third Month: Rolling Away from Infancy

Sometimes an under- or oversized child may have an underlying medical con-
dition causing him to lose or gain weight at an unusual rate. Your pediatrician
is tuned into these potential problems, and will suggest further testing if he
suspects, for example, that baby’s thyroid isn’t working properly. Otherwise,
try not to worry about your child’s baby fat (or lack of it).
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
Baby is becoming more active this month. She’s rolling, she’s reaching for
things, and she’s almost ready to do more. Every day is a new opportunity for
her to expand her horizons beyond her baby blanket, which means the issue
of keeping her safe has just expanded, also.
Baby seat safety
Baby loves her little seat, where she can sit and have a bird’s-eye view of you
cleaning the kitchen, preparing her bottle, or chatting with Grandma. When
she was an infant, placing Baby in her seat on top of the kitchen table was
fairly safe — after all, she slept all the time, and when she was awake, she
was content to take in her surroundings quietly.
That’s changing now, of course. Baby’s awake more, for one thing, and for
another, she’s becoming curious — mostly about herself, and what she can
do, but also about her surroundings. Three-month-olds are rollers, kickers,
and swatters — and your child may be able to do these things with more
force than you realize. If she isn’t properly secured in her baby seat, she
could accidentally propel herself out of it. This is especially important if you
know you’ve been a little lax at times about strapping her in, figuring she was
always sleeping and unable to move about freely in any event.
The seatbelt should be used whenever Baby is in her seat. If unfastened, the
strap can become a strangulation hazard if Baby slips down and out of the
seat. Figure 8-1 shows you how to strap Baby in securely.
To keep Baby safe in her infant seat:
 Secure the strap each and every time you put her in the seat. Adjust it
so that it’s tight enough to hold her in place.
 Don’t place the seat on a raised surface. At this age, you just never
know what Baby will discover she’s capable of doing.
 Never leave Baby unattended in her seat. For instance, if you’re going
to put the laundry away, move her seat upstairs so that you can keep a
constant watch on her.
114
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Placing her in her seat is sometimes the safest way for you to get some things
done around the house (especially if you don’t have a playpen or you just
hate to put her in there). After all, if you place her on her baby blanket now,
she’s going to roll right off before long. Just make sure she’s not in that seat
all day long. She needs the chance to practice her new moves with supervi-
sion but without restraints.
Playpen safety
Playpens, portable cribs, and play yards are similar products used for similar
purposes. Babies play, sleep, or wait patiently for their caregivers to let them
out, depending on the household.
Don’t keep Baby in a playpen for long periods of time. Go ahead and put him
in while you’re preparing dinner or answering the door (at these times, the
playpen may be your safest option, in fact, to corral and protect your increas-
ingly active little guy). He isn’t going to reach his potential sitting in a
playpen, though, and in fact, he may become very bored — very quickly.
Babies at this age are becoming more aware of what’s going on around them.
If Baby is on his blanket on the floor, he can reach for an object just out of his
grasp — and he just may succeed, which will lead to more experimentation. If
he tries to reach for something outside the safe confines of his playpen, he
fails. No prize for Baby.
No matter what type of playpen you choose — the traditional kind, the
portable type, or a more expansive play yard —inspect it thoroughly before
you place Baby inside. Make sure you:
Figure 8-1:
Baby
properly
secured in
infant seat.
115
Chapter 8: The Third Month: Rolling Away from Infancy

 Check all latches and/or hinges to make sure they lock securely in
place. Lean on them a little bit and test their strength. If they don’t
remain locked, the playpen could collapse, injuring or trapping Baby.
 Always open the playpen completely. Don’t leave a side down because
it’s easier to get a small baby in and out. Baby could roll into and under
that side, becoming trapped or suffocating. See Figure 8-2.
 Keep large stuffed toys, fluffy bedding, or other big items out of the
playpen. For one thing, these items can be used as a ladder to freedom
for a little climber. For another, they present a suffocation hazard for
smaller babies.
 Only use the mattress that came with the playpen. It’s firm, and it fits
snugly in the pen, decreasing the risk of suffocation and possibly
decreasing the risk of SIDS. (For more on SIDS, see Chapter 20.)
 Never string toys across the top of the playpen. The rope you use to
string the toys can become a strangulation hazard when Baby decides
he’s ready to pull up on the side of the pen (and you never know when
that may be). The rope can also be a problem if it comes loose from the
side of the pen and slips down within Baby’s grasp. For the same reason,
never tie toys to the side of the playpen.
Figure 8-2:
The sides of
a playpen
should
never be 
left down.
116
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

 Check the sides of the playpen for signs of bites, rips, and other
damage. Teething babies chew on the sides. One piece of foam or plastic
from the railing of the playpen presents a choking hazard to Baby. Also
look for loose hardware; obviously, the small pieces are a choking
hazard, but missing screws can also indicate that something else may be
about to come loose.
 Check out the size of the mesh holes before you purchase or borrow
an older playpen. The openings could be wide enough to allow a button
from Baby’s clothing to get caught in them, which could lead to strangu-
lation. Larger openings may provide a mesh stairway out of the playpen
for creative climbers with very agile toes. The openings should be small
enough so that you can’t get your pinky finger through them.
 If you’re using a play yard, be extra safety conscious. If you move the
play yard from place to place — even within the confines of your own
home — make sure you thoroughly check the floor for any choking haz-
ards before placing Baby inside. If you’re using an older play yard, make
sure the slats aren’t wide enough for Baby to get his head caught
between them.
It is perfectly safe to allow Baby to have his toys in the playpen, by the way,
and if he’s amusing himself nicely the entire time you’re on the phone or writ-
ing out bills, don’t feel guilty about having some time to yourself. Babies
should learn to entertain themselves (some are just better at it than others,
as many moms will tell you). It’s the overuse of the playpens (and infant
seats) that could be detrimental to Baby’s development.
Setting Your Watch by Baby . . . or Not
By the third month, many babies are starting to do some of the same things
at about the same time every day. This may be a great comfort to parents
who were starting to wonder whether things in the house would ever settle
down to anything approaching normal.
But just as many parents end up with a baby who seems to not have the
slightest idea that she’s supposed to be falling into a routine. For the parents
of a child like this, infancy is a long, unpredictable, and often exhausting 
journey — one that leaves them wondering what will happen during the
second year, and the third. Will this child ever conform to any kind of 
schedule?
117
Chapter 8: The Third Month: Rolling Away from Infancy

Baby settles into a routine
As the third month progresses, Baby may seem more content with the way
her days are going. She’s staying awake longer; she’s taking naps at the same
time each day; she’s finding ways to amuse and comfort herself; she’s ready
to nurse at generally the same time day after day. Her nervous system is set-
tling down now, and her internal clock is starting to kick into high gear. (Yay
for you!)
If Baby is settling down, you can safely assume it isn’t a fluke. Baby won’t be
completely upending her schedule next week in favor of a wildly different
timetable. You’ve made it through the hardest part of infancy, at least as far
as fatigue goes, if your child seems somewhat settled at this point.
Congratulations!
But don’t be surprised down the road when Baby starts waking at night or
refusing to eat or generally seems cranky. Teething pain will rear its nasty
head, perhaps beginning as early as the fourth or fifth months, and Baby’s
schedule could be thrown for a loop then. (Teething is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 10.)
Until then, encourage the schedule. Stick to the schedule. Love the schedule
and be thankful for it. The parents of a schedule-adverse baby are envying
your life right now (those kids are discussed later in this chapter). It’s not
always easy, though, to maintain Baby’s routine perfectly, particularly if your
family is extremely busy. Some tips to keep Baby on track without being a
slave to her inner clock:
118
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 
Right on schedule
Co-author Dr. Gaylord sees it all the time:
Exhausted parents with their newborns, won-
dering what the heck they’ve gotten themselves
into. They knew they’d lose some sleep when
Baby arrived, but they never expected an infant
could wear them out like this.
How does Dr. Gaylord comfort and reas-
sure these moms and dads? By letting them
know approximately when (during which calen-
dar month) life with Baby will become more
enjoyable. Most of the time, his predictions are
right on the money: Sometime between the third
and fourth month, Baby turns into a little ball of
sweetness, even if the first couple of months
were rocky.
If your child is just coming into his third month,
just watch and see what happens in the next
few weeks. You may be very surprised at the
way he settles into his little life.

 Give your sitter complete instructions as to what time Baby usually
naps, eats, takes a walk, and so on. Kids who are in a groove will get
cranky if the bottle is slow coming out of the kitchen, or if a sitter
decides a nap isn’t really necessary.
 Make every effort to squeeze some snooze time in if you’re going to
be out of the house during Baby’s beloved naptime. If she won’t drop
off on her own, take her for a spin in the car until she closes those heavy
eyes. You may be able to move her from her car seat to her stroller while
she sleeps and then continue with your errands.
 Limit off-schedule naps. If you do miss her naptime entirely, you may be
tempted to allow Baby to snooze later in the day. She does need some
rest, but allowing her a two-hour nap at dinnertime will only throw her
bedtime out of whack (and possibly her morning wake-up time, and her
naptime the following day). Curtailing rest time may be painful for both
of you, but only allow her a short nap, and put her to bed earlier than
usual.
 Feed her when her stomach says it’s time. Feeding time isn’t the least
bit negotiable, as far as Baby is concerned. Sure, it may be your first day
out of the house in weeks, but Baby doesn’t really care whether you’re
enjoying a cup of coffee with your girlfriends. She wants her milk when
she wants it.
At this age, babies should only be receiving breast milk or formula. Their
digestive systems aren’t mature enough to handle solids yet, and studies
have suggested that introducing food too early could lead to the develop-
ment of food allergies and diabetes. (For more information on food allergies,
see Chapter 11.)
Whatever you’re doing with this child, keep on doing it. She’s happy, you’re
happy, and that’s what really counts.
Dealing with an early riser
You feel like you’ve just fallen asleep, and then you hear it: The cooing. The
little “aahs.” The kicks in the crib. And then the crying. Baby is ready to start
the day. The clock reads 5:15 a.m. Is this some sort of joke?
Is there any way to adjust Baby’s schedule, or is this something you just have
to resign yourself to?
The answer may lie somewhere in the middle, and it really depends on sev-
eral factors:
119
Chapter 8: The Third Month: Rolling Away from Infancy

 Is Baby going to bed too early? If he’s settling down for the night right
after dinnertime, try keeping him up later — but do it slowly, 15 minutes
each night until he’s going to bed at a time that allows him to sleep in a
bit later in the morning.
 Can you settle him back down? Are you resigning yourself to the early
morning wakeups too soon, by turning on the lights, for example? Try
nursing and rocking Baby in the dark and see what happens. If he settles
down, you may be able to slip him back into his crib and grab a few
more hours of sleep yourself.
 How many naps is Baby taking during the day? Add up all the little cat-
naps, the big naps, and his night sleep time. Although a 3-month-old still
needs plenty of sleep, he should be awake for at least ten hours over the
course of the day. Lose one of his naps, or cut back on all of them.
 Is the room too bright? Baby may just be sensitive to the morning light.
Buy room-darkening blinds.
 Is outside noise interfering with Baby’s sleep? Maybe traffic or other
noise is waking Baby in the morning. A white-noise machine drowns out
outside sounds and may allow Baby to catch a few extra winks in the
morning.
 Are you rushing to Baby’s side? Give Baby a few minutes to soothe him-
self before you go into his room. Add a minute or two to this time every
morning, and he may eventually decide he’s tired of waiting — really
tired — and fall back to sleep.
Coping with schedule-scoffing babies
Don’t blame yourself if your child isn’t falling into a predictable pattern just
yet. You’ve probably followed every bit of advice you’ve been given (feeding
Baby on demand, allowing her to fuss but not allowing her to scream in her
crib), and this is just the way things have turned out. Not your fault. It’s just
the way things are. Other parents have been in your position in the past, and
are in the same position as you right now — and none of you are less compe-
tent than the parents of on-schedule infants
However, a 3-month-old may be ready for you to coax her toward a more reg-
ular routine, especially if her naps seem to be willy-nilly all day long, and she
wants to nurse the night away. If she seems able to sleep, in other words, she
may just need some help in condensing those sleep times into one solid nap
and a good nights’ rest. To encourage regular sleep and feeding patterns,
evaluate what Baby is doing with her day right now:
120
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

 Is she sleeping too much during the day, or does she refuse to nap at all?
 Is there any pattern at all to her feeding times, or are they different
every single day?
 How does she react when you try to feed her or put her to bed at regular
intervals?
Trying to take control of Baby’s schedule may feel like an uphill battle,
because she’s probably going to be very unhappy about it. Naps may be
easier to control than feeding times, because frankly, unless she’s really insis-
tent on nursing almost constantly (which she shouldn’t need at this point),
she’s probably just hungry at different times every day. On the other hand,
you can probably keep her awake a bit longer, stretching the time out in 10 or
15 minute increments each day until you’ve eliminated a nap, moved her bed-
time later, or accomplished whatever it is you’re setting out to do.
The baby who never seems to sleep presents a special problem for parents.
This child just can’t seem to settle down for anything more than a catnap on
her mom’s shoulder — which is hardly the break Mom’s looking for (and after
three months of this no-sleep business, Mom needs a break!). Desperate
times call for desperate measures. First you need to teach Baby that napping
is actually a nice thing for her, so get her to sleep any way you can, even if
that means rocking her or taking her in the car for a drive. See how long she’ll
sleep, and let her wake herself up when it’s time. You’ll convince yourself —
after doubting it for the past couple of months — that this child actually 
does need to nap, and that she isn’t some odd species of infant who runs on
batteries.
You can do this until you’ve established a pattern of when Baby is going to
nap. You’re developing the habit for her. She’ll come to expect it at the same
time every day. And that’s when you move the nap into her crib. She may fuss
at first, or she may take to it like this is what she’s been waiting for all along.
Don’t give up if she cries. Soothe her, but them leave her alone to rest in her
crib (unless she’s screaming her little lungs out — that’s just counterproduc-
tive for both of you). This may seem like a lot of work to get Baby to accept
that naptime is necessary, but if you can eventually get her to rest on her
own every day, it’s definitely worth it.
Your goal is to encourage Baby to go to sleep on her own. Avoid falling into a
pattern of always rocking her to sleep, or else she may never learn to settle
down by herself.

Chapter 8: The Third Month: Rolling Away from Infancy

Answering Other Concerns 
at the 3-Month Mark
Now that your child is getting older, you’re starting to get an idea of his per-
sonality. At the end of the third month, it may be apparent to you that you
have a giggly child on your hands — or that your baby doesn’t seem to find
humor in much of anything (even after colic disappears, as it does at the end
of this month). Just as adults have very different personalities, babies do,
too, even at this early age. In this section, we delve into concerns parents
may have if their child seems too serious. We also let you know that colic
should be coming to an end at this point. Pacifiers and thumb sucking are
also cause for concern among some parents; we give you the low-down on
each and whether either should be outlawed in your home.
“Unhappy” babies: Real or myth?
Just as kids are different physically, they have different personalities. Some
babies are downright silly, and others hardly ever crack a smile. If your child
falls into the latter group, is it because you’re neglecting to do something that
would turn him into a laughing machine?
Chances are, no. He’s just the way he is. Studies indicate that the “unhappy”
or “difficult” baby is just programmed to react to the world differently —
often these kids are more observant and sensitive to everything around
them, including tastes, smells, and feels (which is why they’re often labeled
as “unhappy” — a particular blanket is too itchy, or certain foods are simply
unpalatable to them). Your serious little one may have suffered from colic,
which is a common pattern with these kids. These babies also tend to fall
into irregular sleep and feeding patterns, and often resist all attempts to rec-
tify the situation.
The key to dealing with this type of child is to figure out what sets him off
and remedy it or prevent it. If Baby cries every time you put socks on his feet,
leave his tootsies bare. It could be that his skin is extra-sensitive. If too much
noise causes him to have a meltdown, keep the house as calm as possible.
You can’t force the entire world to conform to his likes and dislikes, of
course, but you can create a little peace at home for him — and for you, too.
The end of colic! Hooray!
At the end of the third month, babies who have been howling with colic turn
into new little people. Suddenly, they smile. They sleep. Why, they’re content!
It’s like someone flips a switch and hands you the child you dreamed of
having — before colic came to call.
122
Part II: Introducing: Baby! 

Three months of colic can seem like an entire year. You may be shocked —
truly shocked — at Baby’s new disposition and how much you love being a
parent. You’ve definitely earned this time, so enjoy this new, nice phase with
Baby.
Thumb sucking: Okay or no way?
Babies are born with a sucking reflex, which not only comes in handy at feed-
ing time, but also allows them to comfort themselves when they’re tired or
upset. Should infants be encouraged to suck their thumbs (or fingers), or
does this just lead to the heartache of deformed teeth down the line?
Infants who suck on their fingers are doing what comes naturally to them.
The major advantage of letting Baby suck on her fingers is that her fingers
are always there when she needs them. No pacifier to search for in the car or
in the middle of the night, and no wailing while you find it. On the down side,
it can be harder to break Baby of this habit, for the same reason — there’s a
finger, she’s kind of bored, and before she realizes it, the finger’s in her
mouth. Many kids break themselves of this habit later during the first year,
and most doctors will advise completely breaking it by the age of 2, as long-
term thumb sucking can cause misalignment of the permanent teeth. In the
meantime, if Baby is content with a thumb or forefinger for comfort at bed-
time, let her be.
The pacifier: Godsend or an 
unnecessary habit?
Now, what about those pacifiers? People (and babies) tend to love them or
hate them. If your baby loves his binkie, let him use it. Some infants just need
to suck more than others, and long after feeding time is over, such a child is
looking for some comfort.
By and large, pediatricians don’t object to the use of pacifiers as long as
they’re not overused. If Baby is using a pacifier occasionally for comfort,
that’s fine; if he has it in his mouth constantly, because he always wants it or
because you’re constantly popping it in for him, it may be time to cut back.
Saving the pacifier for times when he’s tired or agitated instead of using it
’round the clock will make it more effective because it won’t be just another
fun thing in his life; it will be a tool for calming Baby’s nerves.
If you can encourage Baby to comfort himself in some other way (such as
sucking on a finger), or if Baby discovers that he doesn’t really miss that paci-
fier after all, taking it from him cold turkey may work. Otherwise, try cutting
back on its use little by little until he’s not using it at all.
123
Chapter 8: The Third Month: Rolling Away from Infancy

When the pacifier is gone for good, don’t keep it around for “emergencies.”
Allowing Baby to have his treasured pacifier one day and not allowing it the
next will only serve to confuse and irritate him.
Of course, the big disadvantage to using a pacifier is that it falls out of Baby’s
mouth at the most inopportune times. Always have a backup handy when
you’re leaving the house and when Baby is in his crib. Keep a clean replace-
ment on his dresser so you won’t have to crawl under his crib with a flash-
light looking for the pacifier he dropped.
Never tie the pacifier to Baby in order to keep it nearby, as doing so is a
strangulation hazard.
Tips for using a pacifier:
 Buy the right size. There are small pacifiers for infants younger than 
6 months, and larger ones for older infants.
 Make sure the plastic guard around the nipple is large enough so that
there’s no chance of it slipping into Baby’s mouth. The guard should
also have airholes.
 Wash pacifiers in the dishwasher or sterilize them in boiling water
until Baby is 6 months old. At that point, he’s less susceptible to germs.
 Try all different nipple varieties until Baby finds one he’s happy with.
 Never use the top of a baby bottle as a pacifier. A voracious sucker
could pull the nipple out of the ring and choke on it.
 Inspect pacifiers regularly for signs of wear and tear. Toss and replace
them if the nipple is torn or cracked or feels sticky.

In this part . . .
I
n the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, Baby transitions
from being your itty-bitty infant into developing a bit of
personality. She starts making intentional hand and head
movements, gives you her first real laugh, and by the end
of the sixth month, might be starting to scoot across your
kitchen floor! More advanced communication begins
during this time as well, giving you a little insight as to
what she really thinks about your singing (chances are,
she loves it, even if no one else does).

Chapter 9
The Fourth Month: Food!
In This Chapter
 Baby’s 4-month checkup
 Keeping Baby safe
 Vocalizing
 Feeding the first foods
T
he first three months are a trial period for parents and Baby alike —
you’re getting to know each other. You’re trying each other on for size, so
to speak, and discovering how to work with each other (although you’re
going to be the one making all of the concessions, at least until Baby’s a bit
older). You’re entering into a time of amazing growth and development. By
the time three more months have passed, Baby will bear little resemblance to
the newborn you brought home not so long ago.
Checking In with Baby
During the fourth month, Baby really starts cracking out of his infant shell by
vocalizing and showing an interest in food and activities. He may become a
bit more independent and start rolling around on the floor and reaching for
toys and other objects of interest. He may also start to take note of the differ-
ences among his family members (Mom’s the greatest; Dad’s the big, strong,
one; and Sis is the goofball), who before this point may have seemed like one
and the same to Baby’s mind. All in all, he’s moving toward developing a real
personality, which is one of the biggest joys of the first year.
The 4-month checkup
It’s business as usual at the 4-month checkup. You can expect your pediatri-
cian to weigh and measure Baby and to assess her progress. There will be a
physical exam, of course, during which the doctor will be checking Baby’s
fontanels (soft spots on the head that allow Baby to fit through the birth

canal). The posterior fontanel (the one on the back of Baby’s head) may have
closed at this point (which means that the plates in Baby’s skull have come
together in that area); the one on the top (called the anterior fontanel) may
actually have increased in size.
While the doctor is assessing the soft spots, he’ll also be looking for evenness
(which he’ll probably call symmetry) in Baby’s head. You’ve heard the stories
about how your cousin (or friend, or neighbor) has a flat head because his
mother never turned him in the crib. You may be surprised to discover that
this can really happen because Baby’s skull is still so malleable.
If your doctor notices that the back of Baby’s head (or one side) is noticeably
flat, he’ll probably suggest that you observe which side Baby favors in the
crib. Although he should be lying flat on his back when you put him in for a
nap or for the night, he may naturally turn his head toward the door — or the
window, or the mirror on the side of his crib. Make sure he has something to
catch his eye on both sides of the crib, or install something interesting that
can be moved from side to side, so that Baby is more likely to turn his head
once in a while. Most babies’ heads start to round out naturally when Baby
spends more awake time sitting up.
Make sure Baby is spending time on his tummy while he’s awake. Give the
back of his head a break while he’s out of his crib.
In addition to giving Baby’s head the once-over, your pediatrician also checks
on Baby’s internal organs, including the liver and kidneys (making sure noth-
ing is enlarged), he checks Baby’s heart and respiration, and he also checks
Baby’s groin area (for hernia), and Baby’s hips (to rule out hip dysplasia).
Hernias, which are protrusions of the bowel (and usually quite small), can be
one of two kinds: An inguinal hernia is located in the groin area and usually
requires surgical repair to prevent complications. An umbilical hernia
(located — you guessed it — near the belly button) is a different story. Most
will resolve themselves by the time the child goes to school, and don’t
require any surgical intervention.
If baby has either type of hernia and it seems to be stuck, is painful to the
touch, or turns a purplish color, call your pediatrician immediately.
Your doctor will also check for signs of teething, which may include:
 Drooling
 Mouthing objects
 General crankiness
 Elevated temperature
 Bumps on the gum
128
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Doctors look for these signs so that they can let you know what’s happening.
If you know Baby is cutting a tooth, you won’t be surprised when he cries in
pain and you can’t find anything wrong with him. Your pediatrician will give
you advice on which pain relievers to use and how much (based on Baby’s
weight). Just remember that even though Baby may be drooling you a river,
the tooth may not come in for another month — or possibly even two.
During the 4-month checkup, your doctor will ask you a host of questions,
including:
 How is Baby sleeping? How many hours at night? Is he still waking up to
eat? How many naps? (Baby should be sleeping about 14 to 17 hours
throughout the entire day and night.)
 If Baby had colic, is it gone now? For more on colic, see Chapter 6.
 What is Baby eating these days? Breast milk? Formula? A combination of
the two? Have you started him on cereal?
 Are Baby’s bowel movements normal? (Before Baby starts on solids,
they’ll be fairly consistent — yellowish and seedy for breastfed kids; tan
and a little more solid for bottle babies)
 Is Baby able to roll at least one way? Is he able to push himself up on his
arms while he’s on his tummy? Is he at least trying to accomplish these
things?
 Does he reach for things? Can he hold a toy or rattle?
 Does Baby appear to see and hear well?
 Is he attempting to vocalize? (More on this later in this chapter.)
Of course, the doctor also wants to know how everyone is doing at home,
because even though you’re starting to feel like a real parent, each month
brings its own crop of foreign concepts where Baby is concerned. If you’re
worried about something, ask. (For example, should Baby still be waking up
to nurse at this age, or should he be past that?)
Immunizations
This month, Baby continues with her regimen of shots. If the following list
makes your eyes cross in confusion, don’t worry: We break all this down in
Chapter 18 for you, where we tell you exactly what the initials mean and how
they protect your child.
129
Chapter 9: The Fourth Month: Food!

Shots given this month may include:
 DTaP #2
 Hib #2
 PCV #2
 IPV #2
Baby may experience pain at the injection sites for a couple of days following
the shots. Remember to ask the doctor or nurse about the possible side
effects of each immunization and which side effects warrant a call to the
office. If you’re not sure how much pain reliever Baby should be getting at
this age, make sure to ask about that, too.
Milestones this month
The average baby is a busy little person with lots of little milestones to hit by
the end of this month. Read on:
 Baby gains about 1 pound this month.
 Baby’s neck strength starts to really kick in this month. She holds her
head steady when she’s on your lap or when you pull her up (very
gently, of course) from the floor, although she isn’t able to hold her head
up for indefinite periods of time just yet. See Figure 9-1.
 Along with neck strength comes head control. In addition to holding her
head up nicely now, she can turn it to look at something in another
direction.
 She may be able to roll both ways (but should be able to roll at least one
way), starting from her tummy.
 She can probably push up onto her hands (lifting her head and chest)
while she’s on her stomach.
 Baby is able to focus her eyes on objects at this age and hold her gaze.
She’s also able to follow a person or an object moving across the room
with her eyes.
 She reaches for objects, holds them, and puts things in her mouth (she
may be teething at this point, though most kids don’t start for another
month or two).
 Baby is wiggling and kicking now.
 Baby can bear weight on her legs now when you hold her on your lap
(she appears to “stand”). Contrary to old wives’ tales, this will not make
her bow-legged, and will actually strengthen and help straighten her
legs.
130
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

 She can probably sit if you prop her up with pillows. (A great use for
your C-shaped nursing pillow!)
 She may find her hands and feet at this age and just fall in love with
them. You’ll note that whenever she discovers a new part of her body,
she’s completely fascinated by it (at least until the thrill wears off and
she finds something new).
 Baby enjoys interacting with people at this age and may be disappointed
when playtime comes to an end (demonstrating her displeasure through
frowning, pouting, or crying).
 She is also able to communicate fear, pain, and loneliness through crying
(with real tears).
 Baby shows excitement. She can demonstrate her interest and pleasure
at this age. She may be excited about a toy, or because you’re tickling
her toes, or because she wants some of your food.
 She responds to your smile with a smile of her own. And will smile at
you to get you to smile at her.
 She may react to an angry face by crying.
 Babies this age get a big kick out of a game of peekaboo.
 Baby is exploring the world through her mouth and will try to put every-
thing in there (or will try to get her mouth on anything and everything).
 She attempts to vocalize. She can imitate simple sounds, like “oh” or
“ah,” and will do so if you initiate the communication. (So for example,
stand in front of her and slowly say, “ah,” giving her a chance to
respond.)

Chapter 9: The Fourth Month: Food!

Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
Baby is reaching, stretching, rolling, grabbing, and starting to find the most
interesting things on the floor. Coupled with his increased mobility comes
Baby’s ability to actually manipulate small objects with his hands and work
them into his mouth — and everything goes into the mouth at this age. This
becomes a big safety issue: Choking is the number one safety hazard to small
children.
Sweeping up the hazards
Offer Baby toys that are safe for him to mouth. These may include teething
rings, rattles, or rubber blocks.
132
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 
Teaching language
A baby is a blank page, a creature without
knowledge, someone who’s going to have to
learn the relevance of communicating with
other people. How does a parent teach this? For
starters, let Baby know that we all rely on com-
munication. You can accomplish this simply by
talking to her and by making eye contact as you
chat, even though she isn’t grasping the mean-
ing of your words. During the fourth month, slow
your speech down a bit. In addition to telling her
what’s going on in your day (“We’re going for a
walk,” or “Let’s go get Daddy”), give her a
chance to show you what she’s capable of,
communication-wise.
At 4 months, Baby is likely to be making cooing,
vowel-like sounds — “oo,” “ah,” “oh,” and 
“ay” — with some measure of ease. You can
help her to develop her language skills by play-
ing an “echo” game with her. Give her a simple
sound to throw back at you (you say “oo,” she
says “oo”) and when she does, show her that
you’re delighted with her efforts. This back-and-
forth teaches her that communication requires
at least two people, and that she’s successfully
getting into the game. The first consonant
sounds babies make are usually “k,” “p,” “b,”
and “d,” and this may take a few more months
for Baby to master, though you won’t cause any
harm by trying to teach her now.
Something that helps babies to distinguish the
consonant sounds within words is using short,
simple phrases, and adding a “y” to the end of
words where it’s appropriate to do so. For exam-
ple, say the word “dad” out loud. Now say
“daddy.” The “d” in the middle of the word
becomes much more obvious to the ear when
the “dy” ending is added. So a short, simple
sentence like, “Let’s go get Daddy,” contains
sounds that are short, crisp, and completely
audible to a child, whereas a phrase like,
“We’ve gotta run to the office and pick up your
father” has a bit too much going on. Yes, in time,
Baby will be able to decode a sentence like this,
but the process is a bit easier if the information
comes in easy bits and pieces.

Just because a toy is soft doesn’t mean it’s safe. Always check the label to
make sure that a toy is intended for your child’s age group. A foam-rubber
ball, for example, isn’t meant to be chewed on. For one thing, it may have a
plastic coating, and chips of the plastic will surely end up in Baby’s mouth if
he chews on it long enough. For another thing, foam rubber may break into
small pieces, which then present a choking hazard.
Another thing to think about: What’s actually on your floors? Baby will be
spending more and more time down there as he works on his rolling, sitting,
and crawling skills. His hands will be on that floor, and guess where they’re
going after that? You know it — in his mouth. Although you don’t have to
sterilize the floor every single time you put Baby on it (after all, if he’s never
exposed to any germs, he’ll never work up a resistance to them), you should
pick up any clumps of dirt or dust bunnies within his reach. Establish a habit
of sweeping hard surfaces in the morning and at night to keep any stray dirt
out of your child’s hands (and mouth).
Make sure that he’s on a relatively clean surface and that you’re not allowing
him to play on a surface that’s wet with cleanser. Pretty much all commercial
cleansers are unsafe as far as ending up in Baby’s mouth goes. Even the
“organic” cleansers (like vinegar or baking soda) can make a kid sick.
Continue to check your floors for small pieces of food, buttons, loose 
change — anything Baby may be able to put into his mouth and choke on.
(Even though it may seem unlikely that Baby could pick up a penny, kids
really do the darndest things. Anyway, if you see something laying there, how
hard is it to pick up?)
Advice on baby-proofing your home (including items that should be kept
completely out of Baby’s reach) is given in Chapter 20.
Keeping Baby on the table
Of course, now that Baby is kicking and able to move about more intention-
ally, the changing table becomes even more of a safety issue. Sure, you’ve
been keeping one hand on him at all times, even using the safety strap most
of the time. Now it becomes absolutely imperative that you don’t take your
eyes off this child for even a second while he’s being changed. He can roll,
wiggle, or kick his way right down to the floor and sustain a serious injury in
the process.
If your child is still happy as a little clam on the changing table, content to lay
perfectly still, be aware that he is now strong enough to surprise you with a
big move to the left, to the right, downward, or upward. Even if you haven’t
really needed to hold your child down, now’s the time to start doing so.
Remember, Baby has no concept of heights — and therefore no fear of 
133
Chapter 9: The Fourth Month: Food!

falling — at this age, so it’s up to you to make sure he doesn’t learn the hard
way about taking a spill. Sooner or later, wiggling at changing times becomes
a safety concern for every parent. You want to catch it, so to speak, before
you’re actually catching Baby on his way down to the floor.
Try distracting an extremely squirmy kid. Because he can hold a toy now,
keep a couple of rattles or teething rings on the changing table. These can be
special toys, used only at changing time, or they can be his all-time favorites
(though you’ll have to remember to bring those along with you when you
whisk him off for a fresh diaper). If that doesn’t work, try talking to him while
you’re freshening his diaper. Teach him those consonants now. Smile at him.
Sing to him. Keep his concentration on you, and chances are he’ll forget that
he has places to roll to — at least for a moment or two.
In the event that changing time becomes an exercise in torture for both of
you (with Baby trying his hardest to roll away and you trying your best to
change this child without losing a grip on him), move the show down to the
floor. Your diaper bag probably has everything you need for a quick change,
so use it as your portable changing table. This won’t stop Baby’s squirming,
but it eliminates the potential for a great big fall.
Expressing Herself
Right around this age, an amazing thing happens to your baby: She starts rec-
ognizing herself as an entity separate and apart from the rest of the world.
Though this recognition will grow and deepen with time and maturity, the
first little seeds are starting to sprout right now. Her desire and ability to
communicate is one indication of this; you’ll soon see other signs in the ways
she chooses to express herself.
The crying game
Say you’re having a nice little tickle time with Baby, and suddenly the phone
rings. Although obviously nothing could ever come close to being as impor-
tant as this game the two of you are playing, you’re expecting a call from your
mother (or from the office), and you’re suddenly forced to stop tweaking
Baby’s toes and focus some of your attention elsewhere. Your child, in all of
her intelligence and burgeoning independence, may frown at first, and then
she may cry out of frustration. She’ll soon realize that crying is one way to
bring your focus back to herself.
134
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Baby’s ability to capture your attention is something brand-new to her —
something she didn’t realize was possible just a few weeks ago. This skill is
pretty huge in both its communicative and socialization aspects. She’ll use it
in the future with other skills after she learns them. (Crying? That works.
Laughing? That works. Playing quietly when she really wants your attention?
Doesn’t work.)
Realizing that Baby’s frustration can be
part of her development
At this age, frustration can start to work its way into Baby’s daily activities.
She’s learning new skills now, with the intent of accomplishing things (in
other words, she’s trying to roll; it’s not just a reflexive action). When the
intent precedes the skill, she may become frustrated enough to cry — hard.
Crying may increase when babies are in the process of learning a new trick.
This, of course, is usually related to the child’s temperament. High-intensity
kids (those who appear to be very serious and determined, no matter what
they’re doing; possibly the same kids who had colic) may become more
easily frustrated when a new task isn’t going as well as they’d hoped. Easy-
going babies may not be as susceptible to frustration, at least at this age.
If you’re the parent of a child who seems to be crying more as she’s trying
again and again to accomplish a new feat of physical strength, what’s the best
course of action? Should you just hand her that toy she’s working so hard to
get? Will that make her happy?
Probably not. Allowing the child to work through her frustration is probably
the best course of action (within limits). Let her keep inching her way toward
that toy, even if she’s clearly not happy about it. Give her a tiny push to help
her flip over if you must, but let her do most of the work on her own. Kids
who are intense enough to get frustrated are also intense enough to stay frus-
trated until the job is done, so to speak. So, for example, you may hand her a
pacifier that’s just out of her reach — something she’s been slowly working
her way toward — and she’ll continue to act unhappy, or she’ll continue to
kick and squirm, because she wasn’t able to get all of her energy out. A little
frustration can be a healthy thing if it helps her work toward her goal.
You know your child best. If she’s becoming frustrated working at a new skill,
watch her closely. Allow her to keep trying until she’s obviously had enough
(when healthy frustration has spiraled downward into a crying fit). Pick her
up and soothe her then — and repeat the process later. Hand her the toy she
was working toward. If the toy helps to quell her anger, great; if it makes no
difference to her at this point, put it away. The real point here is that she
must learn to do some things on her own, and handing her every toy before
she can even try to get it only delays the process.

Chapter 9: The Fourth Month: Food!

Getting to know you
Babies at this age show a definite preference for their parents, siblings, care-
givers — basically anyone they’re in regular contact with (though no one
really compares to Mom and Dad). They delight in sharing smiles with their
loved ones, but may begin to show signs of wariness around people they
don’t know. This is another sign that Baby is becoming more of a social crea-
ture — she’s fine while hanging out with certain people, but she may need a
minute or two to warm up to others.
These are also the tiny little seeds of stranger anxiety — something that
won’t truly affect Baby’s mood for at least three or four more months. For
now, if you notice your child is becoming less comfortable with strangers,
give her a short time to adjust to the new person. Chances are, the two of
them will become fast friends after Baby gets over her initial wariness.
Planning for First Foods
Pediatricians these days recommend waiting until closer to 6 months to
begin Baby on a regimen of varied solids. However, if baby is showing signs of
being ready for solid food, most doctors will give you the green light to add
some iron-fortified cereal during the fourth month. These are the things to
watch out for:
 Baby can easily hold her head up.
 She’s putting things into her mouth.
 She shows an interest in what you’re eating.
Iron-fortified cereal is the best food to start Baby on for a few reasons:
 Baby may not be getting enough iron from Mom’s milk. Breastfed
babies need some additional iron by the time they’re 4 to 6 months old
in order to stave off anemia.
 Cereal is a fairly bland substance, and yet it’s filling. So it’s well worth
your time — and Baby’s. Baby’s delicate digestive system just isn’t ready
to handle sugar and/or spice at this age.
 Cereal is highly unlikely to cause a food allergy. It’s a good jumping-off
point into the world of real food.
You’ll be feeding Baby just once a day for now, so cereal is a good bedtime
meal, because it may help to keep her from feeling hungry until the morning.
If Baby hasn’t yet been able to sleep through a night, you just may find that
136
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

she snoozes away after she’s fed cereal before bed. After all, Baby’s stomach
is getting larger now, big enough to hold enough food to keep the hungries at
bay while everyone gets a good night’s sleep. Some kids continue to cry for
Mom in the middle of the night even after they’ve established a routine of
having cereal before bedtime. These babies are probably not hungry —
they’re looking for the comfort of a parent to pass the dead of night with.
If your child continues to wake up regularly during the night even after he’s
been taking cereal well for a few weeks, talk to your pediatrician. He can eval-
uate your child and may advise you to feed Baby more during the day, pre-
cisely because children this age need to start sleeping through the night —
for their sake, and for yours. Most doctors recommend maintaining at least
four bottle or breastfeeding sessions throughout the day, regardless of Baby’s
schedule of solids.
It will take you some time to work out your feeding routine after you add
solids, but you’ll be mixing his cereal with breast milk or formula, so he’ll be
getting some of those nutrients there, anyway. Because he’s settling in for the
night, he’ll want to top off the meal with his bottle or the breast. You may
choose to nurse him, feed him cereal, and then finish nursing. Or you may
feed him the cereal and then let him have his bottle or the breast.
Be aware that although she may meet the minimum criteria for eating solids,
Baby may not be good to go yet. If you notice that most of the cereal you’re
putting into her mouth is coming right back out, over and over again, it prob-
ably means that she still has an infant tongue thrusting reflex going on. (Touch
Baby’s lips, and her tongue will thrust out of her mouth. This reflex is present
at birth and disappears within the first several months.) Scrap plans for the
cereal feeding and try again in a few weeks.
Preparing for the feeding
Preparing Baby’s first batch of cereal is really very simple. She’s not going to
eat much at this age, so start by spooning a tablespoon of rice or oat cereal
into a bowl (as Baby’s appetite grows, you use more cereal). Mix it with
breast milk or formula until it’s fairly runny. After a week, when you’re sure
that Baby isn’t going to have a negative reaction to the cereal (a rash or diar-
rhea, for example), you can opt to mix the cereal with a Vitamin C fortified
juice (apple or white grape juice, for example), which will help Baby absorb
the iron in the cereal. Avoid citrus juices (orange and grapefruit, for example)
at this age, because they may be too harsh for Baby’s digestive system. After
she masters watery cereal, cut back a little on the liquid. And remember: You
don’t have to warm the cereal in order to make it edible.
137
Chapter 9: The Fourth Month: Food!

In this year of firsts, you just never know what’s going to happen, so when
you introduce Baby to his first feast of cereal:
 Make sure he’s hungry. He’s much more likely to give the solids a whirl
if it’s time to eat — just make sure he hasn’t crossed into “I’m so hungry,
I’m going to explode” territory. (He should be somewhat at ease when
being introduced to anything new.) You can nurse him for a short time or
allow him a bit of his bottle, but don’t let him fill up on liquids.
 Use the appropriate utensil. Don’t try to feed him with a teaspoon. They
make baby spoons for a reason — they fit into Baby’s mouth.
 Don’t try too much, too soon. Especially during the first feeding, offer
Baby teeny little bites of cereal. Let him get used to the texture and the
taste. It may seem like a pretty dull meal to you, but remember, putting
something in his mouth that he’s supposed to swallow — and that isn’t
liquid — is a foreign concept to him. He needs time to perfect his swal-
lowing technique.
 Keep the cereal pretty watery at first in order to let the baby get used
to the spoon and texture. Gradually thicken it up as he gets used to the
solids.
 Use the bib and have a burp cloth nearby to clean up any messes. And
there will be plenty.
When Baby starts eating solids, you’ll notice a change in his bowel move-
ments. Where once a breastfed child produced seedy, loose stools, you’ll
notice a trend toward more solid stool. A bottlefed child’s already semi-solid
stool will also follow suit, becoming more like real poop. Bowel movements
will also decrease in frequency. This is good news for you, because Baby is
likely to go through fewer diapers and less likely to shoot poop out the side of
those leg openings (yes, very gross) after his stool becomes firmer.
Safety hints for feeding solids
Four-month-olds don’t belong in highchairs, unless the chair reclines to allow
younger children to sit comfortably. Even though your child can hold his
head up well at this point, he can’t sit up without being propped — and that’s
not what those highchair safety straps are meant for.
Instead, keep him in his infant seat when introducing cereal. He shouldn’t be
lying down, obviously, but he should be comfortably (slightly) reclined.
Forcing him to sit propped up while he eats will only cause his head to droop
and the rest of his body to sag all over the place.
138
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Never feed Baby cereal in a bottle. Baby is likely to be completely reclined
when eating from the bottle, which makes the cereal a choking hazard. Also,
he’s not learning to eat from a spoon, which is something he’s going to have
to do in the next few months if he ever hopes to conquer vegetables and
fruits!

The Fifth Month: 
Rocking Baby’s World
In This Chapter
 Seeing what Baby’s up to
 Protecting Baby
 Adding more to Baby’s plate
 Teething
T
he fifth month is a nice, quiet time for Baby to practice what he’s already
learned and prepare for the next stages of development. His communica-
tion skills continue to blossom this month, and for the first time, you may see
signs of a little sense of humor (like when he blows a raspberry and smiles,
absolutely delighted with himself). Baby may also start to mimic a speaker,
adding pitch, tone, and length to his cooing sounds. He’s rolling over like a
champion by this point, and by the end of the fifth month, some children are
starting to get up on their elbows while trying to pull their knees beneath
them — they’ve got wanderlust, all right, and are preparing to explore the
world beyond the baby blanket.
In this chapter, we take a look at some safe “exerciser” choices for the
increasingly active child and explain why you should avoid walkers and
bouncers. We also touch on teething — what to look for, and how to comfort
a child who is suddenly mad at the world (but mostly at his gums).
Checking In with Baby
Most pediatricians don’t schedule well-baby visits during the fifth month.
Baby’s next appointment will likely be his 6-month checkup. Of course, this
doesn’t mean that you won’t have questions this month. Questions borne of
simple curiosity that aren’t really related to something that could actually
hurt your child can probably wait until the next office visit (Baby can stick

his entire hand in his mouth and you want to know if you should allow him to
do this). Questions regarding medical conditions warrant a call to the doctor
right away (Baby has diarrhea and a high fever).
Milestones this month
What’s Baby up to during the fifth month? He’s getting bigger, stronger, and
much more personable. Here’s what he can do by the end of the month:
 Baby holds his head up well.
 He pushes himself up on his arms, raising his chest.
 He may try to get his knees underneath himself and begin a primal form
of crawling by the end of the month.
 He can grab objects and transfer them from one hand to the other.
 He’s able to put an object in his mouth, which means that you have to be
on constant lookout for choking hazards. For information on how to per-
form the Heimlich maneuver, see Chapter 20.
 Baby may show signs of displeasure or anger if you take something away
from him.
 He smiles and laughs. You’ll love the tickle-me game — Baby will roll
with laughter, and so will you!
 He may be able to sit when propped up or by himself for a second or
two. (Most children this age are still pretty floppy.)
 Baby turns his head in the direction of a speaker.
 He tries to imitate a speaker by using a singsong voice.
 Baby loves to blow raspberries.
 Teething may begin.
 Baby may love to “stand” on your lap while you hold him.
 A particularly strong child may be able to pull himself up toward the end
of this month and stand while holding onto something or someone.
 Baby may be able to drink from a cup (or hold his own bottle) and/or
feed himself a biscuit.
 He may begin to babble at this age (and even though he says “Dada” or
“Mama,” he doesn’t attach meaning to his words yet).
Baby’s emotions are really beginning to show during this month. He lets you
know if he objects to you removing something from his grasp. He shows his
delight when he works hard to reach a toy — and finally does it!
142
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Encouraging language development
Though Baby may not be a masterful speaker just yet, he’s learning the basic
rules surrounding communication — that people use speech for a purpose,
that people take turns speaking, and that you’re happy when he makes the
effort to “talk” to you. He enjoys interacting with people and loves to practice
his own form of speech. Encourage him to do so by talking to him throughout
the day. Keep your words short and simple, giving him the chance to hear the
sounds. By 5 months, he may repeat simple consonant sounds back to you at
this age: “ma,” “ka,” “da,” “ba,” or “ga.”
Introducing Baby to books at this age — if you haven’t already — is a wonder-
ful way to encourage speech. Picture books focus on simple words and con-
cepts; basically on Baby’s first words. Ball. Dog. Cat. Your child may not truly
understand at this age that everything has a name, but it’s never too early to
acquaint him with new sounds and words.
Books for Baby should be short, sweet, and filled with interesting colors and
pictures. He’s not ready for chapter books or longer stories that may interest
older children. Look for books that are made of durable material (cardboard,
vinyl — your child may find that chewing on books is as much fun as looking
at them), and are chunky enough for Baby to hold easily.
When he’s through looking at his picture book, try reading a simple story to
him. Reading to him engages him in so many ways — he’s looking, he’s listen-
ing, he’s trying to imitate your sounds — his developing brain is getting a real
workout from this one simple activity.
Other benefits of reading to Baby from an early age:
 It ensures cuddle time for the two of you, which is also an important
part of Baby’s day.
 Reading to Baby may help to increase his vocabulary later in the first
year.
 Sitting through a story may help to increase Baby’s attention span.
 Introducing him to the world of books now will make him more likely to
embrace the possibility of reading later in life — he’ll want to know for
himself what those words say!
Encouraging a love for reading in your child now can have positive effects for
a lifetime. After Baby can read for himself (years down the road), an entire
new world of ideas and imagination opens up for him. For now, you can lead
him through that door by reading to him. Shoot for at least 15 minutes of
reading every day at this age. Even if he isn’t willing to sit and listen at first,
he may show signs of interest as you continue to make storytime a regular
part of the day. Those 15 minutes can come in 5-minute increments if that’s
what works for your baby.
143
Chapter 10: The Fifth Month: Rocking Baby’s World

Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
Baby’s at a crossroads this month: She’s too small to sit by herself, and yet,
she’s got the itch to do more on her own. Before you let her loose in an exer-
cise device or highchair she isn’t ready for, make sure she’s going to be safe.
She may seem a little bored or frustrated with her inability to actually move
around freely these days — but she isn’t going to be amused if she suffers a
major injury.
Walkers, bouncers, and saucers
Active children need, well, action. Years ago, parents would pop their chil-
dren into a walker at this age and then stand back as the babies delighted
themselves with their newfound mobility. Children loved being in these seats-
on-wheels. Why, they could shuttle themselves all over the house while
eating a snack on their tray. Life couldn’t get much better, as far as these kids
were concerned.
Today, pediatricians discourage the use of walkers. Thousands of children
suffer walker-related injuries every year, most caused by walkers slipping
down a flight of stairs. Many walkers on the market today are wider than
those of years gone by, which may prevent the walker from fitting through a
doorway, for example, but the best way to prevent the devastating injuries
that can result from an accident in a walker is to keep your child out of it in
the first place.
Bouncers, also called “Johnny-jump-ups,” are also discouraged by pediatri-
cians. These are the swinglike contraptions that attach to the top of a door-
way and dangle down to a seat that’s connected by a spring. Baby is able to
spin and jump to her heart’s delight. The problem with these products is that
Baby may also be able to flip herself forward and bang her head on the floor.
Jumping exercisers can also cause stress fractures in an infant’s legs. Simply
put, a baby’s legs are not designed to handle this type of activity.
A popular and much safer alternative to these products is the stationery
baby ring. Baby is placed into a seat that’s much like a walker’s. She can spin
around, rock, play on the tray that surrounds the saucer-like contraption, but
she can’t go anywhere. She can’t flip herself over and suffer a concussion.
She’s not going to hurt her developing bones. She’s happy as a little lark
being held upright, being able to move around, having her toys all around
her, and at the same time — she’s safe. And that makes Mom and Dad 
happy, too.
144
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Using the highchair
If Baby can sit fairly well this month, she may be ready to try out her high-
chair during her feedings. If your highchair leans back to support the child
who is just getting used to the upright seated position, it’s best to adjust the
seat slowly, letting her get the hang of sitting like a big kid. Using a chair that
has only one position — upright — is a little trickier for a novice. Even after
she can sit by herself, she won’t be able to do it for extended periods of time.
You may have to use a towel or pillow for support.
Always use the highchair’s safety strap. It doesn’t qualify as support for the
newly-sitting-up baby, but it does help make sure that she isn’t going to slip
out of the chair.
If she isn’t ready to sit up, don’t try to train her by putting her in her high-
chair. This is not what those straps are designed to do! Continue to feed her
in her infant seat until she’s able to hold herself up —at least for short peri-
ods of time.
Buying (or Preparing) 
Baby’s First Foods
Whether Baby has already had his first taste of cereal or you’ve held off and
plan to add solids now, he’ll be ready to move on to vegetables and fruits in
the near future. You may wonder whether it’s better to buy the prepared
baby foods in the grocery store, to go organic, or to make your own.
Going with regular ol’ baby food
Many, many parents make their initial foray into the baby food aisle wonder-
ing if there’s some sort of secret to choosing the right food for their child.
Should they go with the most popular brand or with the all-natural food?
Which foods should you feed to your child first?
Most doctors recommend starting Baby off on the yellow vegetables (corn,
squash, and the like) before moving onto the green ones (beans and peas, for
example). Read the labels on commercial baby food jars and avoid foods con-
taining high levels of sugar or salt or that use tapioca as filler. Your child only
needs the simplest ingredients (like the vegetable itself and some water) to
get the nutrition from his meals. Stick with pureed foods during these early
feeding months. Baby won’t be ready for chunky foods until much later in the
first year.
145
Chapter 10: The Fifth Month: Rocking Baby’s World

The main perk of using commercial baby foods is that they’re extremely con-
venient. However, if you take the time to break down the cost-per-ounce of
many of these prepared fruits and veggies, you find that they’re usually more
expensive than the vegetables you find in the produce section. If you’re look-
ing to pinch pennies, we offer some helpful advice for preparing your own
baby food later in this chapter.
Looking for organic options
These days, you can buy prepared organic baby food in the grocery store.
Look for a commercially prepared baby food that lists the fruit or vegetable
as its first ingredient on the label. A truly organic food won’t use sugar or
water as its main filler, nor will it use chemical additives or preservatives.
Many parents choose to go organic because they’re concerned about the
amount of pesticides in their child’s food. Because most research on the pes-
ticides contained in food has been focused on what effects, if any, adults may
suffer, we don’t have a lot of solid evidence (good or bad) about the effects
that pesticides may have on a developing child.
Becoming Baby’s personal chef
Preparing your own baby food at home is easy as pie (though Baby’s not
quite ready for your delicious desserts). There are a couple of major benefits
to this do-it-yourself approach. First, it’s much cheaper to buy an entire
squash, for example, and to cook it, puree an entire batch of it, and freeze it
for your child than it is to buy that same quantity of squash already prepared
by the big baby food companies. Secondly, you have the final word on what
goes into Baby when you prepare his food. (You know that you didn’t add
food coloring or any preservatives.)
Making your own baby food really isn’t hard. You need some basic kitchen
equipment and fresh fruits and vegetables. Keep in mind that if you plan on
purchasing your produce in the supermarket, it could very well contain the
same pesticides you may be trying to avoid. Growing your own or purchasing
produce at an organic market is a better choice for parents whose main con-
cern is keeping Baby pesticide-free.
To prepare Baby’s food at home, you need:
 A pot: For boiling fruits.
 Steamer basket: For steaming veggies.
 Blender: For pureeing foods.
146
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

 Peeler and corer: To make removal of skins and cores easier.
 Storage containers: You prepare the food in batches and save some for
later.
Even if you’re not an experienced gourmet cook, making your baby’s food is a
snap. Here are some tips for making the entire process incredibly easy:
 Peel, core, and chop hard fruits (like pears and apples) before simmer-
ing them in a pot (filled with just enough water to cover the food, any-
where from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of fruit) to make
them soft. Puree and serve or freeze.
 Steaming veggies allows them to retain more nutrients than boiling
them. Vegetables should be peeled and diced and then placed in a
steamer basket or a double boiler. Puree them.
 When Baby is ready for meats, poach them before pureeing them.
 Softer fruits (like banana and mango) can be mashed and served to Baby
without any further preparation.
 Don’t add salt, butter, or sweetener to Baby’s foods — he hasn’t had
them yet, and he won’t miss them.
 Store pureed foods in the freezer for several months; in the fridge for
three days maximum.
Use ice cube trays to freeze small portions of Baby’s food. This method is
neat, gives you a small serving size, and enables you to easily blend and mix
two different foods together (if Baby really hates peas, for example, you can
try mixing them into the sweet potatoes that he just loves). Use plastic wrap
to cover the tray and protect the food from freezer burn, or place the frozen
cubes in freezer bags. To thaw, leave several cubes in the fridge overnight or
use a double boiler.
Steering clear of risky foods
Baby’s body is growing and developing at breakneck speed during the first
year — inside and out. Because her digestive and immune systems aren’t as
strong as an older child’s, there are some foods that need to be limited in
quantity or avoided altogether during the first year.
Don’t give Baby any honey at all during the first year, because it may contain
Clostridium botulinum, the spores that can cause botulism, a form of food
poisoning that can make Baby very ill.
147
Chapter 10: The Fifth Month: Rocking Baby’s World

Steer clear of stringy vegetables like broccoli, or put them through a baby
food strainer before freezing or feeding. The strings are a choking hazard.
You should also limit Baby’s intake of nitrates, which, if ingested in large
quantities, can lead to methemoglobinemia, a serious medical condition that
prevents the red blood cells from effectively transporting oxygen throughout
the body. Children under 6 months old are most susceptible to this condition,
which is sometimes called blue baby syndrome.
Foods that are high in nitrates include leafy vegetables, like:
 Spinach
 Kale
 Collard greens
 Lettuce
 Cabbage
The nitrate levels in these foods are high to begin with; the levels rise if the
foods have been grown with nitrate fertilizers. Improper storage and prepara-
tion of these foods further raises the levels (and allows the nitrates to turn to
nitrites, which are the agents that damage the red blood cells).
Root vegetables (like carrots, beets, turnips) also contain nitrates, though
not at levels as high their leafy counterparts.
If you’re preparing these foods at home for Baby, choose only organic produce
and freeze leftovers immediately. Organic veggies are grown without the use
of nitrate fertilizers, thus eliminating a huge risk factor in using these particu-
lar foods. Commercial baby foods are also a safe choice; their produce comes
from low-nitrate regions (areas where nitrate levels in the soil are low and
less likely to seep into the veggies) and their preparation methods don’t
allow time for the nitrate/nitrite exchange to take place.
Relieving the Torture of Teething
If Baby hasn’t shown any signs of teething just yet, it’s only a matter of time.
Many kids cut their first teeth between 4 to 6 months of age, although it’s not
uncommon for babies to cut them much earlier — or later. Most often, the
bottom central incisors (the two bottom front-and-center teeth) are the first
little guys to come in. (The top central incisors will be next.)
148
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Some of the signs of teething include:
 Crankiness
 Drooling
 Rash
 Desire to chew or bite on anything
 Diarrhea
 Low-grade fever (below 100)
 Loss of appetite
 Difficulty sleeping
 Cough (due to all that drool)
Now, obviously, these are all symptoms of illness, as well. How can you tell
the difference between a tooth that’s making your child miserable and a
virus?
You can usually tell by taking a peek at Baby’s bottom gum. If the gum is red
and angry-looking and Baby is showing all the other signs of teething, he’s
teething, but it’s going to be a while yet before any teeth show up: Teeth can
take up to two months to break through the gum surface. If the gum has a
bluish blister-type sore on it (called a hematoma), that’s a tooth coming in.
Hematomas contain blood. Those bluish things are usually eruption cysts,
which contain clear fluid. They pop, and there you have it: a tooth!
Baby is in a very oral stage right now, where he naturally wants to put every-
thing into his mouth, so his chewing on everything in sight is not in itself a
reliable indicator of teething.
How can you comfort Baby and make his little mouth feel better? Pain
reliever sometimes works wonders (although sometimes it seems to make
very little difference to a teething baby). If you’re unsure of the dosage that
Baby should be receiving, call your pediatrician’s office for advice. Oral gels
seem to work very well for relieving some kids’ teething discomfort. Use the
recommended dosage on the container; if Baby doesn’t respond to it, discon-
tinue its use. And with either medication, only use it if Baby appears to be
uncomfortable (instead of using it to ward off potential discomfort).
If used to excess, some of the oral gels can cause methemoglobinemia, a seri-
ous medical condition that is also caused by the feeding Baby foods that are
high in nitrates. (For more on this, see the section “Steering clear of risky
foods,” earlier in the chapter.) Gels should not be used more than four times
a day. Also, health food store teething tablets contain chemicals you may not
want your baby to have, like catnip and belladonna.
149
Chapter 10: The Fifth Month: Rocking Baby’s World

Other ways to soothe Baby during a teething spell:
 Have some teething rings on hand. This is what they’re made for. Baby
may prefer a solid rubber chew toy or a fluid-filled ring. Stick with what-
ever works. Don’t freeze the ring, but keep it in the back of the refrigera-
tor so it’s really cold.
 Offer Baby cold, soft, bland foods and drinks.
 Baby may enjoy chewing on a teething biscuit or a bagel.
 Give him extra comfort during the day and at sleep times. All he
knows is that something hurts. Mom’s love can make the pain a little
better.
 Wipe the drool from his chin and neck as often as possible. Change his
shirt when necessary. Constant exposure to saliva can cause an irritat-
ing rash. If you just can’t keep him dry, rub a little bit of petroleum jelly
on these areas.
 If Baby has diarrhea, make sure to change his diaper often. The last
thing he needs right now is a sore bottom.
If Baby’s fever rises above 100 degrees or he seems to be sick, call your
doctor to rule out illness. Although the signs of teething can mimic other con-
ditions (like an ear infection), it’s always better to err on the side of caution.

The Sixth Month: Baby 
on the Move!
In This Chapter
 The 6-month checkup
 Safeguarding the active baby
 Looking into a changing appetite
 Sleeping at 6 months
T
he sixth month arrives, and suddenly you realize you’re halfway through
Baby’s first year! Baby heads toward more independence during this time,
pushing up on hands and knees, sitting, and possibly — for the very preco-
cious babe — even pulling himself up on the coffee table. Safety becomes more
of an issue as you watch your innocent child move toward the stairs (with no
inkling of the danger that lies ahead). Some parents may find themselves in a
state of anxiety, wondering how all of this happened so fast — Baby was just
born, and here he is, squirming on the changing table and rolling away from the
spot where you last left him. The changes will come fast and furious during the
second half of the first year, so don’t blink — you may miss something!
Checking In with Baby
At this age, Baby is becoming more mobile, more sociable, and more respon-
sive at playtime. You may find yourself really enjoying this phase of life,
because Baby may become more predictable and generally easier to care 
for. This is also where he begins to make the change from cute infant to real
babyhood — crawling, sitting up, holding his bottle, giggling, and stealing
your heart every time he smiles at you.

The 6-month checkup
The 6-month checkup covers a lot of territory. Baby is weighed and mea-
sured, as usual, and his growth is plotted on the charts. He’s given a physical
exam by the doctor, who will probably have a lot of questions about what
Baby has been up to this month. The doctor will ask whether Baby is reach-
ing for toys or other objects, whether he tries to get things that are out of his
reach, and whether he’s rolling both ways, sitting, and pushing up on his
hands and knees.
Your doctor will also want to discuss safety issues with you, like installing
gates near stairways, and making sure that Baby is strapped into his feeding
chair. Make sure that you take the time to write down any pertinent informa-
tion and to ask any questions that you may have.
Immunizations
Most of Baby’s checkups include at least one immunization shot. Don’t worry,
we break all this down in Chapter 18 for you, where we tell you exactly what
the initials mean and how they protect your child. This month, Baby will be
given:
 Hib #3
 DTaP #3
 PCV #3
He may also receive IPV #3 and/or HBV #3, although these shots can be given
anywhere between 6 to 18 months. Pediatricians also recommend a flu shot
for children 6 months to 2 years; this is given in two doses in the fall.
Ask the doctor or nurse about the side effects of each shot, and appropriate
comfort measures for each. Also make sure to ask which side effects warrant
a call to the doctor.
Milestones this month
Baby is a busy little bee this month, both physically and socially. During the
sixth month, you’ll likely notice the following changes and developments:
 Expect Baby to gain about 1 pound.
 He increases in length by about 1⁄2 inch.
 Baby can now hold his head steady.
152
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

 He can hold and drink from a cup or bottle.
 He rolls both ways.
 Baby is able to transfer objects from hand to hand.
 He may be able to “stand” (support weight on his legs) when you hold
him on your lap.
 Can probably sit up for a short period of time, supporting himself with
his hands.
 Baby may begin to push up on his hands and knees or drag himself for-
ward; a few kids perfect the art of crawling this month.
 He can feed himself large finger foods (like a baby biscuit).
 Baby recognizes the difference between his parents and others; stranger
anxiety may begin.
 He mimics facial expression and sounds.
 Turns his head toward a voice or a sound.
 Recognizes and responds to his own name.
 Is able to participate in a game of peekaboo.
 Begins to babble.
Keep in mind that some kids are slower to reach physical milestones, but
may still be well within the range of normal development. Doctors are most
concerned with a steady stream of progression — whether or not Baby is
working toward these milestones. Maybe he can’t quite shift a block from his
left hand to his right, but does he make an attempt? Is he trying to roll, or
does he just lie on his blanket without moving at all?
Some children never really learn to crawl, opting to create their own unique
styles of movement instead. This is also quite normal and nothing to worry
yourself about.
Stimulating the older baby
So with Baby showing all of this wonderful potential for physical and social
growth, how can you encourage his development?
For starters, take a step back and let him try to do some things on his own.
Putting the bottle in his mouth just as he’s reaching for it only delays the time
when he’ll actually be able to hold it himself and get it into his mouth. The
same goes for his toys: Let Baby struggle a bit to get a toy that’s out of his
reach. He has quite a sense of achievement when he finally grabs it, and he’ll
work even harder the next time, realizing that there’s a benefit to his efforts.
153
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!

Speaking of toys, buy him playthings that are age-appropriate. At this age,
Baby may take an interest in toys that make noise (something that rattles or
jingles when Baby shakes it) or toys that offer some visual interest (bright,
primary colors catch Baby’s eye now).
The best way to stimulate Baby is by playing with him. Take the time to
engage in a game of peekaboo; sing songs and tickle his tummy, giving him a
chance to respond.
Reading to Baby at this age seems nonsensical to some folks. (Can he really
understand the story? Will he seriously sit through the reading of a book?)
Baby’s tolerance for listening to a story is as important as choosing the right
book. A child who has no interest in sitting still for more than a minute or two
isn’t going to enjoy storytime right now, and trying to force him into it will
only set up a battle of the books between the two of you that isn’t necessary.
Have some cloth books around for him to look at when he chooses; have a
few very brief board books on hand, too. Let him look at the stories when
he’s in the mood. Soon enough, he’ll probably allow you to read one to him —
though he may always prefer to be somewhat on the move while you do.
Continue talking to Baby by giving him a play-by-play of the day as it happens.
Now that he’s starting to babble, slow down on some of the single-syllable
words, giving him time to interpret the sounds coming out of your mouth. 
Six-month-olds are just starting to get the hang of repeating sounds. Give him
every opportunity to practice, even if he’s only able to copy the inflection of
your voice, and in a very short time he’ll be forming his first little words.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
She’s rolling, she’s dragging herself all over the floor, she’s able to pick things
up, and she may even be able to hoist herself up. As Baby becomes more
active this month, you need to re-evaluate your safety plan for her. The house
needs a good inspection at this point. And every time you go anywhere with
Baby, check that she’s properly secured in whatever kind of seat she happens
to be traveling in (stroller, car seat, grocery cart, and so on). For more on
making your home safe for Baby, see Chapter 20.
Now that Baby is becoming more mobile, keep the car seat completely out of
her reach unless she’s riding in it. Most seats are left in the car for all eternity
(or at least until Baby outgrows it), but in some households, the car seat
shifts among Mom’s, Dad’s, and Grandma’s vehicles, and is sometimes left in
the house when it’s between cars. The harness straps, which play a vital role
in keeping Baby securely fastened in her car seat, are a strangulation hazard
when the seat isn’t in use. Don’t allow Baby to play in or around the car seat.
154
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Because Baby is so much more portable and interactive at this age, we’ve
included some tips on keeping her safe when you take her for walks and on
shopping trips.
Stroller safety
All kids need to be buckled into their strollers, whether they love the ride or
hate it. You just never know what kind of hazards may come your way when
you’re walking Baby down the street or through the park. You could hit a huge
bump in the road without even seeing it. You could park him for a moment
and the stroller could roll away from you. The stroller itself may have a flaw
and fall apart. Kids have been flipped right out of their stroller seats before
their moms could even realize and react to what was happening. A seat belt
may not prevent injury in every case, but it may help — and it doesn’t make
matters any worse.
Another reason to buckle Baby into his stroller: The seat belt can be a stran-
gulation hazard when it’s not in use. Now that Baby is able to scoot himself
around a bit, you just can’t take any chances with straps of this sort. Put
them to use around his waist and you won’t have to worry about them harm-
ing him.
Jogger strollers aren’t recommended for infants under the age of 6 months.
These strollers don’t offer Baby the option of reclining or lying down, so really,
only older infants who’ve achieved a good measure of neck strength should be
placed in these strollers. Also, because the speed of running (and any bumps
along the way) can jolts an infant’s neck and spine, many doctors recommend
waiting until Baby is 1-year-old before bringing him along on your workout.
The same goes for baby bike trailers and baby seats that attach to adult bikes:
They’re not safe for infants. Baby needs to be able to sit well, control his head
movements, and wear a bike helmet — which don’t come in infant sizes —
before he can ride on or behind your bicycle.
Check your stroller frequently to make sure that all of its parts and mecha-
nisms are working properly and that nothing is rusting or looking ready to
fail. As Baby gets older, heavier, and more active in the stroller seat, anything
that’s ready to break probably will. Children can be seriously injured by
faulty strollers, so don’t take any chances. Replace a dangerous-looking
stroller with something sturdier.
Shopping with Baby
Grocery carts are a common, yet often unconsidered, hazard to infants and
older children alike. Every year, kids have accidents in grocery carts.
155
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!

Carts are fairly prone to tipping. Some stores have carts with wider bases
that make tipping a bit less of a hazard, but when an older sibling climbs on
the front, back, or side of any grocery cart, that cart may go over. If Baby is in
the cart, he’s going over, too.
When kids do fall out, it’s a long way down onto a hard surface. To eliminate
this possibility, an older baby (one who’s sitting up) should always be strapped
into the seat of a grocery cart. An infant who isn’t yet able to sit on his own
should be strapped into an infant seat. If you’re using your own car seat for this
purpose, place it in the basket area of the cart — don’t try to balance it on the
seat portion up front. Some car seats have been designed for this purpose, 
but because they’re not 100 percent compatible with all grocery carts, there’s
always the risk of the seat not staying put — which could be disastrous. Many
grocery stores offer carts with infant seats bolted on. Those seats aren’t going
anywhere, so use them — and always make sure that you adjust the harness
straps to hold Baby in the seat.
Put something heavy in the opposite end of your cart early in the shopping
trip to help balance the weight. If baby is the only thing in the cart and you
step away to reach for some ice cream, the end-heavy cart can tip over with
minimal effort.
Feeding Baby’s Changing Appetite
You start to introduce more solids (pureed veggies, for example) into Baby’s
diet this month. Breast milk and formula are enough to satisfy a small infant’s
hunger and nutritional needs, but by the middle of the first year, Baby needs
more. He’s becoming more active, and his body is growing. This includes his
stomach, which was just a tiny little pouch when he was born. It can hold
more now, which means that Baby can eat more and go longer between feed-
ings (which also means he’ll sleep longer at night).
What effect does this have on his already-established schedule? He’ll need to
nurse less often, or he’ll start to take less formula. At this point, continue to
allow Baby to set the schedule for breast- and bottlefeeding, just as you did
when he was born. He’ll make sure he’s nursing enough, and he’ll drink for-
mula with each meal.
Introducing Baby to the cup now will make weaning him easier in the long
run, especially if he’s breastfed. Nursing children who are used to drinking
from a cup don’t need to be weaned to a bottle; they can be weaned directly
from the breast to the cup.
156
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Adding solids
Baby has probably had his fair share of cereal at this point. If he hasn’t been
introduced to vegetables, start easing those into his diet, too, preferably
before fruits (Baby is less likely to embrace bland squash and carrots if he’s
become accustomed to eating sweet peaches and applesauce). Introducing
your child to solids is a gradual process. Even if he eats everything you put in
his mouth, it takes time to establish a pattern of feeding him every day. Don’t
rush it. Some days he’ll eat solids like a champ; other days, he’ll prefer his
bottle or the breast. This is normal for all novice feeders.
How will you know when Baby is ready for solids? He should be able to hold
his head up well, and he’ll probably start showing an interest in what you’re
eating. Time your initial feedings carefully: Don’t try to introduce him to
pureed carrots after he’s already gorged himself on formula — he won’t be
interested. Wait until it’s mealtime, and allow him to nurse a bit or to have a
nip at his bottle before placing him safely in his infant seat (he shouldn’t be
in the high chair until he can hold himself up well) and presenting him with
the good stuff: veggies. Most pediatricians recommend starting with the
yellow vegetables (squash, sweet potatoes, corn), because they’re fairly
bland and packed with nutrients.
At this age, Baby probably can’t eat more than half of the smallest jar of food.
Because his saliva can break down the remaining food, causing it to become
watery and very unappetizing, don’t spoon the food directly from the jar.
Instead, pour half into a bowl, cap the unused portion, and refrigerate it.
Take it nice and slow, allowing him plenty of time to feel the food in his
mouth, to taste it, and swallow it before offering him more. He may resemble
a baby bird with his mouth open, waiting for the next bite, or he may decide
that he’s not wild about this whole set-up. You want him to get acquainted
with solids while he’s still relatively open to new ideas, but you don’t have to
make sure that Baby eats the entire portion you’ve spooned out for him. If
he’s reluctant to gobble up his veggies, make that spoon behave like a choo-
choo train headed for the tunnel or an airplane coming in for a landing in
Baby’s mouth. Feeding time should be enjoyable, even at this age.
Introduce new foods very slowly — the general rule of thumb is one new food
every four to five days — to watch for signs of food allergies. Some parents
are so anxious to get into the solids that they disregard this advice, but imag-
ine what a hassle it will be to determine the cause of an allergy if Baby has
been given several new foods at once. You have to eliminate all of the new
foods and reintroduce them one by one, knowing that Baby is going to react
badly to one of them. It’s just easier — for you and for Baby — to hold off on
introducing each new food until you’re sure that the previous new food
hasn’t affected Baby adversely.
157
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!

Many doctors recommend introducing veggies to Baby before fruits are
brought on board at feeding time. Veggies aren’t sweet and they don’t taste as
good as fruits (or so most children would have us believe, judging by the way
they twist their little faces into horrible grimaces upon receiving a spoonful of
spinach). Although some parents may argue that children learn to hate their
veggies when they’re older and they have to finish them in order to have their
dessert, it’s just a fact that most kids enjoy sweeter-tasting foods, and even 
a baby will balk at a strange-tasting vegetable — even more so if he’s accus-
tomed to eating only peaches and applesauce. So the theory goes that if you
introduce him to vegetables first, he accepts them more easily and continues
to eat them even after he’s gotten a taste of the sweeter side of baby food.
Don’t feed Baby real desserts — use fruit as dessert. Babies get introduced to
dessert soon enough!
As Baby becomes accustomed to solids, you can add in some finger foods,
probably around the end of the seventh or the beginning of the eighth month.
We discuss this in more detail in Chapter 12.
When Baby starts eating solids, his bowel movements become less frequent,
but more like real poop. They vary in consistency according to what he’s
been eating: A kid who just loves his sweet potatoes will have orange bowel
movements, for example. This will end when he’s older and his gastrointesti-
nal system is better able to filter his food.
Food allergies
You need to be on the lookout for allergies as you introduce new foods. Most
reactions occur within an hour or two of Baby’s ingesting an allergen — but
contrary to what you may think, most reactions don’t happen the first time
Baby eats a food. Allergies tend to develop over time, building up over a sen-
sitization period, where the groundwork is basically being laid by the body’s
immune system for future allergic reactions. (In other words, if Baby has
eaten a food three times without any problems, she could still have an aller-
gic reaction the next time she eats that food — which is why it’s so important
to introduce new foods one at a time and over the course of several days.)
The good news is that most children outgrow food allergies by the time
they’re school-aged.
Watch for the following signs of food allergies:
 Gastrointestinal distress: Baby seems crampy, bloated, and uncomfort-
able, or has diarrhea or vomiting.
 Rashes: Food allergies may result in a facial rash or an itchy mouth.
Hives, eczema, and itching are other symptoms of food allergies.
158
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

 Cold symptoms in the absence of a cold: Wheezing, runny nose, or
itchy eyes with dark circles underneath them.
 General crankiness: Unusual crying during the day or at night (espe-
cially if Baby is normally a good sleeper) may indicate that she isn’t feel-
ing well. If she’s been introduced to a new food recently, the food could
be the cause.
Many pediatricians recommend holding off on certain foods, because studies
have shown allergies may be caused by introducing them too soon, causing
the body to prematurely develop antibodies against them. Common food
allergens you should avoid feeding your child during the first year include
cow’s milk, eggs, wheat, strawberries, and soy. Shellfish, and nuts are also
common allergens that can cause more serious reactions, like anaphylactic
shock, which is a severe, sometimes fatal allergic reaction that can include
respiratory distress; a swelling of the mouth, throat, or eyes; hives; itching;
and a loss of consciousness. If you notice any of these symptoms in your
child, call your doctor or get her to the ER without delay.
An allergy to milk is a fairly common occurrence in small children and is 
different from lactose intolerance, both in its symptoms and its underlying
cause. Most kids outgrow milk allergies; lactose intolerance may last a life-
time. Chapter 18 discusses the specifics of these conditions in more detail.
If you suspect that Baby is showing signs of a food allergy, discontinue the
food — and then bring it back after a week or ten days. Watch to see whether
the same symptoms develop. If they do, food allergies are a probable cause.
Talk to your pediatrician about Baby’s reaction at her next checkup. If she’s
showing signs of several food allergies, you may be referred to a specialist.
Giving the cup
Introducing Baby to the cup now can only make your life easier down the road.
Remember, eventually you’re going to have to wean Baby from the breast or
bottle. A breastfed Baby who is comfortable with the cup will never have to use
a bottle; introducing a bottlefed Baby to the cup now will make weaning him in
the future all that much easier.
Find a cup that Baby can reasonably get his little hands around. If you’re using
a cup that prevents spills, leave the insert out of the cap for now, so that Baby
realizes that there’s something in that cup that he wants. (Leaving the insert
in requires Baby to suck on the cap to get his drink — and because the cup 
is completely foreign to him at this point, and completely unlike a bottle or
breast, he probably won’t quite get it.) Help him to get a drink from it the first
time you offer it to him. Don’t refuse it to him when he wants to try it himself —
just make sure you’re not doing this near your brand-new carpet.
159
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!

If Baby simply won’t drink from the cup no matter how you try to cajole him
into it, don’t lose heart. Put the cup away for now and let him drink from his
bottle if he wants to. Try reintroducing the cup in another month or so.
Offer Baby formula or breast milk during his meals. He can also have a little
bit of diluted juice during the day. The weaning process is slowly beginning
now, but it can take months to complete. Baby will continue to want to nurse
before his naps and at bedtime. Weaning is discussed in far more detail in
Chapter 16.
Lullaby and Good Night
If you’re the parent of a child who still hasn’t come to terms with the fact that
nighttime is rest time and that he really does need more than a cat nap on
your shoulder during the day, you’re probably feeling as though you missed
some meeting in the hospital where the maternity nurses discussed ways of
getting Baby to snooze. Convincing Baby to rest his weary head is a challenge
that may drive you both to the sleepy brink of insanity, but some tried-and-
true methods may help — or at least prevent you from making things worse,
and sometimes, that’s the best you can hope for.
At this age, Baby should be taking two decent naps during the day, which
may range from one and a half to two hours each. Some kids even consoli-
date that time frame and take one long power nap. Early risers will need to
take a nap sometime mid- to late-morning; later risers can probably forego a
morning nap in favor of a longer afternoon rest. Whatever works for you and
your household schedule is fine, even if it’s very different from the way your
friends’ babies are doing things.
Baby may also be settling down for a nice, long, uninterrupted, restful night
at this point.
Encouraging a schedule
You may have a child who hasn’t yet fallen into any sort of discernable nap 
or bedtime pattern. At this point, your own lack of a daily schedule may be
getting to you, as you see and read about parents whose kids sleep and wake
like clockwork. Those moms are able to plan their days around their kids’
naps. You’re still playing a guessing game: What time will Baby wake you up
tomorrow morning? Will you be able to get your errands done before Baby
falls asleep in his car seat? How many times will he have you up in the middle
of the night — and will you be so tired tomorrow that you’ll spend the day in
a fog?
160
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Setting the stage for naps
Some children have trouble settling down in the daytime because they’re
supersensitive to the environment. It’s a myth that all babies can learn to
sleep through normal household noise. (Can you automatically shut out the
light, ignore all the noise, and take a nap?) Plenty of kids can, of course, but
there are some who simply need to have a quiet, dark room to settle down in.
If your 6-month-old is still balking at taking a daytime nap, think about making
a few adjustments to her room and to the household schedule at naptime:
 Darken her room. Install shades, curtains, or blinds and move her crib
out of the direct line of sunlight coming through the window.
 Keep things quiet. Some babies are light sleepers. Put a fan in her room
(on lowest speed) to help take the edges off the loudest noises (like the
phone, the dog’s barking, horns honking, and so on).
 Slow things down. Don’t just stick her in her crib according to the clock.
Make naptime an event of sorts by establishing certain routines leading
up to it. Feed her, change her, read her a story or rock her for a couple of
minutes, and then put her in her crib — awake, so that she realizes this
is also part of the routine.
 Allow her to establish her own pattern. Naptime is sacred — try not to
mess with it. After she’s down and out, let her sleep. As long as her day-
time naps aren’t affecting her ability to sleep at night, schedule the rest
of the day (outings and errands) around the naps — not vice versa.
Realize that this is a temporary phase in Baby’s life. In another year or so, her
naps will shift and probably shorten. Encouraging decent napping habits now
may have a lasting effect on how well she naps throughout her toddler years.
Creating a bedtime ritual
Establishing a schedule for nighttime, especially if Baby isn’t much of a day-
time sleeper, should, theoretically, be a snap. (She should be completely
exhausted by the time bedtime rolls around if she hasn’t slept all day, right?)
Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case; babies who don’t get enough rest
during the day can become overtired and overstimulated, which can mean
that they have an harder time sleeping at night than their nap-loving peers.
This pattern often leads to a vicious, sleepless cycle that repeats itself day-
in, day-out.
To encourage a regular bedtime pattern, follow through on what you’ve done
with Baby’s naps: Make bedtime an event, every single night. If you find that 
a bath zones her right out, bathe her. Read to her, rock her, feed her one last
time, and put her to bed — again, make sure she’s awake so that she realizes
that this is something she’s expected to do on her own.
161
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!

If you rock her to sleep at this age, she’s not learning to comfort herself
before drifting off, and you can guarantee that when she wakes in the middle
of the night, she’s going to need you to put her back to sleep.
Avoid certain activities in the evening — namely anything that riles Baby up
and makes it difficult for her to go to sleep. Don’t get Baby wound up with a
rousing round of tickling. Put the most stimulating toys away. And don’t take
her on an outing an hour before you want her in bed. She needs plenty of
time to unwind from her long day of exploration and learning.
It can sometimes be very hard for parents to establish a quiet evening ritual,
especially if both work all day and look forward to spending the evening with
Baby. Just keep in mind that establishing good sleep habits for Baby benefits
all of you in the long run, so the sooner you do it, the better.
Nixing nighttime waking
Babies at this age sleep about an average of 11 hours at night — mostly
straight through, perhaps stirring once or twice, but without needing Mom or
Dad to come in and feed or comfort them. They also usually take two daytime
naps of an hour or two each.
This can be heartbreaking news if you’re the parent of a child who is still
waking and lustily crying two to three times every night. Unlike the baby who
wakes and murmurs in the crib only to fall back asleep moments later, your
child seems to really be hungry and is unable to go back to sleep without
rocking.
Here’s the deal: Baby’s eating solids now, and by the time he’s 6 months old
he shouldn’t need to eat during the night. If he’s waking and crying and latch-
ing onto you at 2 a.m. (and again at 3, and then at 4), he’s most likely doing so
for comfort and company. Breastfed infants seem particularly prone to this
behavior, and it’s not because they’re not getting enough to eat. More likely,
it’s because they want to snuggle with Mom in the middle of the night. You’re
his parent, and it’s hard to say no when Baby seems so desperate.
Is there such a thing as tough-love for infants? Yes, and it’s commonly referred
to as letting Baby “cry it out” during the middle of the night. This is exactly
what it sounds like: Baby wakes and cries for a parent, only to find that the
nighttime feedings and visits are not forthcoming. Baby cries himself back to
sleep.
Deciding to let Baby cry it out is a heart-wrenching choice, but it does tend to
be very effective — and mercifully short-lived. Many babies cry for a long time
the first night (an hour or more), and for a substantially shorter amount of time
the second (perhaps as little as 15 minutes); by the third and fourth nights,
there’s nary a peep out of them. And suddenly, you have a little sleeper.
162
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Easing Baby off your nighttime company
Aside from letting baby cry it out (see the preceding section), there are a
couple of other methods for breaking Baby’s dependence on you little by
little:
 Go to Baby when he cries, but don’t pick him up. Instead, keep the
lights low and try other means of comforting him, like rubbing his back,
singing to him softly, or just standing nearby, slowly cutting back on the
amount of time (five minutes the first night, four the second, and so on)
you spend with him until eventually he doesn’t need you at all.
 Allow Baby to cry for a predetermined amount of time each time he
wakes up before you respond to him. For example, if your child is up
three times during the night, you may wait 5 minutes before responding
to him the first time, 10 minutes before you respond the second time, and
15 minutes before answering his third call. The next night, you’d start out
with a longer time interval the first time he wakes up, and lengthen the
others accordingly. This method could take several nights, but if it works,
it’s less painful than hearing Baby cry for over an hour.
Whether these gentler methods work for you and your child depends largely
on Baby’s temperament. Waiting several minutes and then going into him
anyway isn’t going to teach an exceptionally determined child anything except
163
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!
Making the decision to let Baby cry it out
This is another one of those parenting issues that
divides people into two separate and very differ-
ent camps. Advocates claim that letting Baby cry
it out teaches Baby that he must comfort himself,
that there’s no way of getting around it or doing it
halfway, and that he will learn — rather quickly —
to put himself back to sleep. Critics of the practice
generally frown on leaving a helpless, frightened
infant all alone in his crib while he screams.
Where your opinion falls on this topic will prob-
ably depend on two things:
 Your level of desperation
 Your tolerance for hearing Baby cry
Different articles by different experts will give
you conflicting advice: One will tell you that
allowing Baby to cry will damage his self-esteem
for the rest of his life; another will tell you that
Baby will be more self-sufficient during his child-
hood if he learns to comfort himself now. Forget
the experts and make your own decision on this
one. Only you know the situation in your own
home and how sleep deprivation is affecting you,
your mate, and your child.
Fact is, unless you’ve experienced six straight
months of almost sleepless nights, you can’t
appreciate what it’s like to be in the position of
wanting to let your child cry it out. It’s not that
you’re cruel — it’s just that you want to stop this
nighttime behavior.

that when he cries long and hard enough, you show up. This could actually
make matters worse, because one of two things are apt to happen: You either
abandon all hope of sleeping through the night until Baby decides it’s time
(which could be never), or when you do decide to let him cry it out, it takes
longer than it may have originally because now he’s convinced he can get you
to come running.
Making a difficult process easier
Getting Baby to sleep through the night is likely to be a real challenge, but
the following pointers can help:
 Make sure he’s full. If you think that Baby is legitimately hungry during
the night, talk to your pediatrician. He can take a look at your child’s
growth pattern to date and determine whether it’s possible your child
needs more to eat. He may recommend adding more food during the day
because Baby needs to sleep at night.
 Connect with Baby physically during his waking hours. Hold him a bit
longer, play with him a little more, rock him for few extra minutes before
putting him to bed. This may help each of you to let go of those middle-
of-the-night meetings.
 Help him comfort himself. Direct Baby to his fingers; sucking is a great
comfort to infants, and if he learns to use his own appendages for this
purpose during his waking hours, chances are good that he’ll continue
the practice in the middle of the night. Most finger-suckers break them-
selves of the habit by the end of the first year.
 Stick to your guns. Try to wean Baby away from your company slowly,
but be firm about whichever set of rules you’re working with. If you
decide to comfort him for two minutes without picking him up, follow
through, especially if he continues to cry while you’re in the room.
Giving into him at that point reinforces the idea that he only has to cry
longer and harder to get what he wants, even when it’s not the best
thing for him. In turn, this only prolongs the nighttime sleep deprivation
for both of you.
Baby will still love you in the morning if you let her cry it out. And you’ll love
her too!
Taking the ba-ba to bed: 
Baby-bottle mouth
Some babies love to take a bottle (of formula, juice, or breast milk) to bed. It
quiets them, it comforts them, and their parents know that their children
aren’t going to be hungry in the middle of the night. Sounds like a pretty
sweet deal, huh?
164
Part III: Moving, Shaking, and Growing 

Well . . . it is, and that’s the problem. Sugar can have a detrimental effect on
Baby’s budding teeth, especially if he goes to bed exposing himself to the
sweetness for hours on end.
Baby bottle mouth is tooth decay affecting the front teeth, and can begin in chil-
dren anywhere from infancy through 2 years. What happens in any instance of
tooth decay is that bacteria feeds on whatever food source it can find to break
down the tooth enamel (the tooth’s protective covering). Your child is left with
discolored, rotted-out teeth (if they don’t fall out or need to be removed) —
right there, front and center, for the world to see.
Baby’s first teeth set the stage for his future dental and emotional health. He
needs his front teeth for biting and chewing. Premature loss of these teeth
can lead to speech difficulties. Tooth decay in the early years can also lead to
self-esteem issues, when a child is teased about missing or discolored teeth.
In addition, the health of his baby teeth lay the groundwork for the condition
of his permanent teeth. Depending on the severity of the decay, the child with
baby bottle mouth could have a lifelong dental crisis.
Most cases of baby bottle mouth occur when a child is allowed to suck on a
bottle for hours on end. There have been instances of nursing babies devel-
oping tooth decay, but usually only if they’ve been allowed to nurse for hours
and hours — say, if Mom regularly falls asleep while nursing her child and
Baby suckles all night long.
Of course, some sugary drinks are worse than others, and although it’s fine 
to give Baby a bit of juice during the day, she definitely shouldn’t be drinking
soda. There’s no nutritional value to the drink and it’s one of the worst things
to give a kid, especially one who’s developing new teeth. Studies also show
that developing a soda habit in early childhood leads to other problems
down the road, most notably obesity.
The good news is that baby tooth decay is not an inevitability — in fact, it’s
easily preventable. Here are some do’s and don’ts:
 Don’t put Baby to bed with sugary drinks.
 Don’t substitute a bottle for a pacifier. Babies who need to suck and are
allowed to have a bottle throughout the entire day (or night) are
extremely prone to tooth decay.
 Don’t give Baby a pacifier dipped in sugar or honey. This is akin to you
wiping the sweetener right on her teeth and leaving it there.
 Don’t allow Baby to nurse throughout the night.
 Do give her plain water if she needs her bottle during her nap or at 
bedtime.
 Do wean her from the bottle or from breastfeeding around 12 months.
165
Chapter 11: The Sixth Month: Baby on the Move!

So when is it time for you to start caring for those little teeth, anyway? As
soon as they come in. Baby teeth play a vital role in eating and speech, and
are also the foundation for Baby’s permanent choppers.
Adequate fluoride intake is very important to the development of teeth. 
If your water supply doesn’t have fluoride in it, your pediatrician will give 
you a prescription for drops.
As soon as Baby is finished eating, wipe her teeth off with gauze or a soft, clean
cloth. This will remove any leftover food and plaque, leaving the bacteria in her
mouth little to build cavities with. To encourage good dental hygiene habits
that will last a lifetime, you can also buy her a teeny little toothbrush for this
purpose.
Adult toothpaste shouldn’t be used until your child is 2 years old, and then
only sparingly. (If ingested in large quantities, toothpaste can be harmful to
your child, so keep it up and out of her reach.) For now, cleaning Baby’s teeth
with a clean cloth or a toothbrush with water is adequate.
Keep an eye on Baby’s teeth and look for the signs of tooth decay, which
include discoloration and pitting of the teeth. If you suspect a problem, call
your pediatrician. Children generally see the dentist for the first time around
the age of 2, but substantial dental problems require earlier intervention.

In this part . . .
D
uring the seventh to ninth months, Baby becomes
more and more curious and mobile — and more fun!
Of course, parents are presented with new safety issues at
this time, and these chapters offer tips on keeping your
increasingly active child safe. You may find he’s becoming
so active he thinks he’s too darn busy to eat — or to
nurse. Find out how to introduce semi-solids and what to
do when Baby loses interest in the breast during these
months.
Baby is making an even better effort at real communica-
tion during this time and may be able to utter his first
little words soon. You can have a huge influence on his
speech simply by talking to him. These chapters offer
advice on that angle as well. (Listen carefully — he’s
saying, “The first year is whizzing by, Mom!”)

Chapter 12
The Seventh Month:
Developmental Delights
In This Chapter
 Looking at what Baby’s up to
 Protecting Baby
 Adding more food
T
he seventh month is a time of major achievements for Baby — in move-
ment, in development, in personality. Although you can hardly count the
many changes that Baby’s gone through in the first six months, expect at
least as many to come during the next six. Not only is Baby continuing to flex
his little muscles and show you what he can do physically, he’s also starting
to use his brain to figure out the world around him. He’s not just a pretty
little face lying around the house anymore — he’s actually putting the pieces
of day-to-day life together. For example, he now knows that if he drops some-
thing, it doesn’t disappear — and someone will probably give it back to him.
He’s also learning that dropping stuff and getting it back is a pretty fun way 
to pass some time!
Your child is becoming more independent, more opinionated, and more lovable
because of it. He can handle more foods at this point, and he may lose interest
in the breast or bottle because he’s just so darn busy discovering what he’s
capable of doing every single day. Language — in the form of babbling — is
another significant developmental milestone during this time.
Checking In with Baby
Most pediatricians don’t schedule a well-baby visit during the seventh month.
And because Baby won’t see the doctor again for a checkup until the ninth
month, some questions may pop up in the interim, especially because Baby is
changing so much. You may just find yourself with the phone in your hand at
times, wondering whether you should call or whether the office staff will think

you’re crazy. (All parents have been in this position at one time or another.)
You’ll read your baby books, you’ll search for information on the Internet, and
still, you’ll have a nagging feeling that you need to talk to your pediatrician.
So if you have any concerns about Baby’s behavior during these months, call
the doctor’s office and at least speak with the nurse. She may be able to tell
you that your child is behaving normally, or she may determine that Baby
needs to be seen in the office. Baby is in a stage of major change right now,
which may explain why she’s crying more these days (it may be due to frus-
tration, as she’s trying to accomplish more and having a hard time reaching
her goals).
If you’re dealing with something that seems to have an underlying medical
cause — Baby is crying like crazy for no apparent reason, or she’s running a
high fever, or something about her behavior or movements just aren’t right —
call without delay.
Chapter 23 gives you a list of reasons why you would definitely want to call
your pediatrician; Chapter 24 provides you with a list of reasons to hold the
phone.
Milestones this month
Baby’s moving and shaking this month (and bouncing, and creeping, and
maybe even standing!). What kind of development will the parent of a kid 
this age see?
 Baby can control his head movements completely and hold his head up
indefinitely.
 If he hasn’t mastered the art of rolling both ways yet, he will probably do
so this month.
 He may be able to push himself into a seated position from his stomach.
 He can sit unsupported.
 Baby loves to test out his strength, and may just love to “stand” while
you hold him on your lap.
 He may be able to pull himself up (see Figure 12-1), and may even be
able to stand on his own for a short time. (Smaller, skinny babies seem
to master this skill earlier than their larger peers.)
 If he’s mastered the art of standing while holding onto something, he
may even be able to cruise around the room (“walking” while holding
onto objects).
 Baby loves to bounce when in a standing or seated position.
170
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

 His fine motor skills are coming along nicely: Baby can hold an object
with one hand at this age, which leaves the other hand free to explore
other objects.
 Baby is able to feed himself larger finger foods.
 Teething may begin, if it hasn’t already.
 Baby turns toward the focus of his attention when lying on his stomach
or sitting.
 He may begin creeping (up on his hands and knees, working toward
crawling) or crawling if he hasn’t already.
 Baby shows signs of preferring Mom over anyone else in the entire
world.
 Because Baby is becoming more attached to Mom, the first signs of
stranger anxiety (a definite wariness around new people) are beginning
to exhibit themselves, though they probably won’t peak for another
month or two.
 Baby may begin to become attached to a comfort object or two (a result
of stranger anxiety and his increasing understanding of object perma-
nence).
 Baby loves a good game of peekaboo, “This Little Piggy,” or any game
that gives him a chance to respond and interact.
 He may begin to babble by the end of this month.
 Baby now turns his head in your direction when you call him.

Chapter 12: The Seventh Month: Developmental Delights

Baby should be able to recognize his name at this point, and he should also
respond to it. If you call him over and over again and he doesn’t respond,
make sure to mention this to your pediatrician. Although Baby’s lack of
response may be due to the fact that he’s distracted by a new skill or some-
thing happening outside the window, there’s a slight chance he may not be
hearing you. Your doctor will want to evaluate your child to rule out any
hearing problems, signs of which include not only Baby’s inability to respond
to his name, but also a lack of vocal interaction (if he isn’t trying to babble at
this point and/or his voice is somewhat monotone).
Building memory
Baby is just beginning to grasp the idea of object permanence, which means
he knows that when something “disappears,” it’s really just somewhere else.
Prior to this point, when a toy or a person went away, they were gone for
good, as far as Baby knew.
At around 7 months, memory starts to increase (though not as we under-
stand it — a child this age may only remember something for a week or two,
tops). As memory increases, Baby is able to draw certain conclusions about
the constancy of objects in his world, and he begins to expect certain things
to happen. For example, if he presses a lever on a toy and it makes a noise or
a figure pops up, he’s going to play with that toy knowing what’s going to
happen.
172
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 
No creepy crawlies?
Your child is showing no signs of creeping or
crawling at 7 months? Don’t lose sleep over it.
Although most children gain some sort of major
mobility at this age, many don’t. The kids in the
latter group are content to take the world in from
their perch on their baby blanket, and are in no
rush to learn how to get from Point A (the family
room) to Point B (the kitchen). Some babies
never learn to truly crawl at all; they go from
dragging themselves along the floor to pulling up
to walking, or they may create their own style of
crawling (using straight legs instead of bending
their knees, for example). As long as Baby is
making some sort of attempt to move around and
is not just lying listlessly on his blanket day after
day, he’s probably just taking his time embracing
and exploring the joys of locomotion. You’ll be
chasing after him soon enough and you’ll barely
remember the days when he stayed where you
put him.

Baby may also start to push your buttons at this time, though without any
malice. Tossing his toy from the highchair, for example, is his way of seeing
what kind of reaction he can elicit from you. (Because he also knows that that
toy isn’t disappearing off the face of the earth, he can do this without upset-
ting himself in the process.) If you hand it back to him a couple of times, he’ll
probably start to think of this as some sort of game. (Clever, isn’t he?) Your
best bet is to give him a no-nonsense “No” (even though you’re secretly
proud of his cognitive skills) and employ some sort of diversionary tactic so
that this doesn’t become a day-in, day-out activity.
Lagging behind: Common concerns
If your child isn’t hitting the major milestones on time, should you be con-
cerned? Maybe there’s a hidden problem somewhere — physical, neurologi-
cal, or a combination of the two?
Generally speaking, milestones are just guidelines: They indicate what most
children can do at a given age. If your child seems to always be a bit behind —
but he’s making definite strides in the right direction, then there’s probably
nothing for you to be concerned about. Talk to your pediatrician to rule out
any definite problems; chances are, he can put your fears to rest.
Many babies excel in one developmental arena and lag a little behind in
others (great mobility but not so much speech for example). This is common
and no reason for concern.
173
Chapter 12: The Seventh Month: Developmental Delights
Beautiful babble
At this age, Baby moves from acing the vowel
sounds (“oo,” “oh,” “ay”) and tries on the conso-
nants for size. The first hard consonant sounds
that she will probably master will be “k,” “p,” “b,”
and “m,” though others (like “d” and “g”) will
follow soon after. How can you encourage her
language skills now? By doing what you’ve been
doing for the past few months: Talk to her slowly,
using short words and phrases, giving her a
chance to really take in the sounds. At this age,
she’s listening for the beginnings and endings of
the words — a skill called word segmentation.
She doesn’t quite understand the words’ mean-
ings, (she probably won’t be able to do so for at
least two or three more months), but this is a nec-
essary step in that direction. She’ll start to mimic
your sounds — “ba,” “ma,” “ka” — and when
she does, show her your excitement. Encourage
her to try again. This is how she learns what com-
munication is: people responding to one another.

However, premature babies may take years to catch up to the development of
their full-term peers, for many reasons. Depending on how prematurely your
child was born, he may be dealing with quite a few long-term physical prob-
lems, or hardly any at all. The child who is suffering from a metabolic disorder,
for example, will not grow at a comparable rate to the child whose metabolism
is normal. He may also be harder to nourish, which (again) can often mean
that the child will be smaller and weaker than his peers. Obviously, this will
translate into developmental delays simply because — for example — he may
not have the strength to pull himself up, which means he also won’t be learn-
ing to stand by himself or to walk for some time. Preemies can catch up to
their peers in a matter of years, or they may always lag behind. Your pediatri-
cian is your best resource for evaluating your premature child’s development.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
You’re going to want to reassess your baby-proofing plan as your child starts
moving about the house with more regularity and purpose.
No matter what you do Baby is going to take her fair share of falls. Just make
sure she’s not going to fall off your second-story deck or out her bedroom
window. No, you can’t walk behind her and catch her every single time — and
no, you shouldn’t even try. She needs to learn that falling isn’t failing; it’s just
part of life.
What kinds of things should be baby-proofed for the increasingly mobile 
7-month-old? Basically anything that’s within reach, both on the floor and
above it. Remember that she’s learning to pull up now — which means that
she can also pull things down on herself. A tablecloth, a hot cup of coffee, 
a heavy ornamental bowl filled with potpourri (the contents of which also
look and smell like a suitable snack, as far as Baby’s concerned) — all of
these things need to be out of her reach (and not just for now, but for the
next couple of years). If she isn’t pulling herself up just yet, she will be soon,
so it’s not too early to start making these adjustments in your home.
Also remember that Baby’s becoming better with her grasp — quicker and
more dexterous. Where once she would really have to work at picking up a
quarter off the floor, for example, she’ll be able to do so with more ease now
and in the months to come. Yes, it’s always been important to keep small
objects out of her reach, but it becomes increasingly important now that
she’s able to manipulate them so easily.
174
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Hitting the high points of baby-proofing at this age:
 Protect Baby from big falls. Gate off stairways and open railings. Don’t
install a pressure gate at the top of a stairway, as it can easily become
disengaged by a child leaning or climbing on it.
 Protect Baby from sharp edges. She’s learning to stand, she’s pulling
up, and she’s not looking for hazards when she’s on the way down.
Cover the edges of the coffee table and the fireplace.
 Look for things she may pull down when she pulls up. Chairs.
Tablecloths. Curtains. Drawers that could pop open and cause a nasty
spill backwards. Remove or block these things from Baby’s reach or
secure them to prevent injuries.
 Keep small objects out of reach. Coins. Pen caps. Marbles. Hard can-
dies. Button-sized batteries. Buttons. If there’s any possibility that Baby
could swallow and choke on it, remove it. You can buy “choke tubes” in
the baby-accessory aisle, which are plastic tubes representing the size
of baby’s windpipe. If the object can fit in there, Baby can choke on it. If
you can’t find one of these commercial tubes, use the cardboard tube
from your paper towels as a guideline.
 Lock away household poisons. Baby’s getting more mobile, and faster
and better with her grasp. Don’t keep potential hazards anywhere Baby
will have access to them. (This includes houseplants — many are poiso-
nous. Keep them up and out of Baby’s reach.)
It’s never too soon to start baby-proofing more and more around the house.
These months move quickly, and Baby will be acquiring new skills (like climb-
ing or opening cabinets) before you even realize what she’s doing, in some
cases. Consider yourself constantly on the offense against Baby’s best efforts
to find holes in your baby-proofing plan. Get down on all fours and be the
baby, just for a short time — you may be surprised at what you’ve overlooked.
For more on baby-proofing your house, see Chapter 20.
Fill ’Em Up: Feeding at 7 Months!
By the end of the month, Baby should be accepting solids as part of his daily
fare — for a couple of reasons: First, he needs more nutrition at this point
than a diet of only breast milk or formula can offer. He’s growing, his teeth are
starting to come in, and while breast- and bottlefeeding met his every need in
the early months, he simply needs a nutritional boost at this point.
175
Chapter 12: The Seventh Month: Developmental Delights

Secondly, he’s going to have to eat solids at some point. It’s much easier to
start him on “real” food now, when he’s more likely to welcome it, than when
he’s 1 year old and unwilling to try something new. (If Baby hasn’t yet started
on solids, flip to Chapter 11, where you’ll find all the basics for getting this
show on the road.)
After Baby has settled into a routine of having solids throughout the day, he
may be looking for more. It’s not unusual for kids to show a definite interest
in what you’re eating, by either reaching for your food or doing their best
impression of baby birds (sitting with mouths wide open, just waiting for
something to fall in). Because Baby’s able to pick up large and small objects
at this age, it’s the perfect time to introduce him to either mashed or finger
foods and allow him to feed himself.
As with the introduction of anything new into Baby’s life, pick a time when
he’s most apt to go with the flow of finger foods. Don’t hand him a cracker
after he’s sucked down an entire bottle, but don’t wait until he’s shaking from
hunger, either. He’s most likely to accept the idea of eating foreign finger
foods when he’s in a good mood and ready to fill his little tank.
If Baby isn’t getting the concept of finger foods (picking them up and putting
them into his mouth), by all means, help him out by placing a piece of food
into his grasp. He’ll probably pop it into his mouth before long. If, on the other
hand, he seems completely disinterested in the idea of feeding himself, let it
go and try again in a week or two. Mealtime should be 100 percent pressure-
free, with Baby feeding himself as much — or as little — as he cares to eat.
He’s his own best regulator in that regard, and when he’s ready to feed him-
self, he’ll take over the feeding duties, lickety-split.
Babies do best when introduced to larger finger foods first — teething bis-
cuits, baby pretzels, or something along those lines. As baby’s grip becomes
more advanced, he’ll be able to handle some trickier eats, like:
 Toasted oat cereal (a perennial favorite)
 Mashed soft fruits (kiwi, papaya, pear, banana — just make sure any
strings from the peel have been removed)
 Bread (remove the crust)
 Teeny pieces of meat (chicken or beef, for example, ground or finely
chopped)
 Cooked pasta (not spaghetti — twists or wheels are good choices)
 Vegetables or legumes that are cooked until soft (broccoli, zucchini,
potatoes, kidney or green beans, peas, or mashed potatoes)
Before Baby’s grasp is fully developed, you can place fresh, mashed fruits
and vegetable in a mesh feeding bag, available in most baby departments.
This bag allows Baby to taste the food and to get small pieces in his mouth
while eliminating the risk of choking. (What will they think of next?!)
176
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Take special precautions when feeding Baby potentially “stringy” foods, like
bananas, oranges, or certain cheeses (meats can also occasionally contain
sinewy strings), which can cause gagging or choking.
Can Baby have what you’re having for dinner? Sure, within reason. You want
to keep his foods simple for now, until you know for certain that he doesn’t
have any food allergies. So although you may be hankering to introduce him
to your award-winning Shepard’s Pie, hold off on this meal unless he’s already
been introduced to every single food in the recipe. Otherwise, if he starts to
show signs of an allergy, you won’t know if it was the carrots, or the beans, or
the potatoes. (For more on food allergies, turn to Chapter 11.)
Avoid feeding Baby anything that is very spicy, salty, or sweet. His little diges-
tive system can’t handle an overload of these ingredients.
To prevent choking, Baby should only be offered solid foods while he sits
upright in his highchair. Also, use the safety straps at all times to prevent any
neat little tricks (“Look, ma! I’m standing!”) he has up his sleeves.
What kinds of finger foods should be avoided? Anything that’s hard or not
easily gummed into small pieces (although Baby may have a couple of teeth,
he’s relying on those gums to break up his food at this age). Baby is not quite
ready for:
 Raisins
 Nuts
 Hot dogs (even if they’re cut up into small pieces, they’re very high in
sodium and not the best choice nutritionally speaking)
 Olives
 Popcorn
 Candy (whether it’s hard candy or a chunk of chocolate, it’s not going to
be easily gummed)
 Hard (uncooked) veggies
Just remember — Baby’s got a lot of years ahead of him to sample all the culi-
nary delights in this world. He’ll get around to trying that popcorn when he’s
a bit older. For now, keep his meals soft, simple, and safe.
By the time Baby is about 7 months old, he may be eating:
 Fruits and veggies twice a day (at lunch and dinner, perhaps)
 Cereal twice a day (breastfed babies in particular need the extra iron
provided by this meal)
 Formula or breastmilk three to five times over the course of a day
177
Chapter 12: The Seventh Month: Developmental Delights

What is Baby getting from these foods? Fruits and veggies are an excellent
source of Vitamins A and C. Cereal is iron-fortified. These are essential nutri-
ents for a growing child. (His formula, meanwhile, provides him with protein,
and breastmilk continues to provide him with protein and antibodies.)
Wondering about weaning?
When children develop a feeding schedule that’s heavy on the solids, moms
start wondering how this will affect their nursing or bottlefeeding schedule.
Baby isn’t ready to completely abandon the bottle in favor of cow’s milk at
this point. If introduced in the first year, cow’s milk can cause an allergic reac-
tion in Baby. Worse, it can also produce a mild inflammation of the intestine
in some babies, which can lead to chronic mild bleeding and iron-deficient
anemia.
Formula is still the food of choice for non-nursing mothers, so keep it flowing
(or mixing). Although formula intake increases during the first half of the first
year, with some kids downing 40 ounces a day by the sixth month, most doc-
tors recommend that your child top off at a maximum of 32 ounces of formula
a day after a diet of solids is established. If Baby is drinking more than that,
she’s not going to be hungry enough to sample the interesting new delicacies
(mmm pureed broccoli!) you’ve prepared for her, and she’ll also miss out on
their nutrients. For more on introducing food, see Chapters 9 and 10.
Offer Baby a cup at each meal with formula, breast milk, or diluted juice. She
can actually be weaned from the bottle to the cup anytime after she masters
the art of holding and drinking from a cup. The sooner she knows how to do
this, the easier it will be on both of you in the long run. If she’s breastfed,
teaching her to drink from the cup now will allow you to wean her directly
from the breast to the cup when the time comes, without ever having to
depend on a bottle as an interim dispenser of liquids.
Vary what you put in the cup. If baby only ever gets juice in the cup, she’ll
expect sweet stuff to come out of the cup and may reject formula (or later,
milk) from the cup.
If you’re thinking of weaning Baby from the breast, don’t jump the gun. She’s
becoming more active, she’s acquiring new skills, she’s tasting new foods —
every day brings something different for her. It’s only natural that she would
let her old habits fall by the wayside a bit in favor of exploring her latest
options. She isn’t rejecting the breast so much as she’s embracing the new
world around her, with all of its possibilities. You can allow her to regulate
her own intake, offering her the breast after each round of solids, or you 
178
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

can take a measure of control by offering her the breast at different times
throughout the day (the downside of which is that you may start to feel as
though you do nothing but feed Baby).
Establishing a feeding schedule that includes a healthy dose of solids along
with several nursing sessions each day may take some trial and error. Don’t
worry about what your friends are doing; find out what works best for you
and your child and go with it.
Try to stick with a minimum of four breastfeedings daily to ensure proper
nutrition. Don’t let baby choose food over breastmilk or formula.
Most doctors recommend nursing Baby throughout the first year — but if
your child is interested in everything but breastfeeding at this point, you may
be thinking that that goal is darn near impossible. It may seem as though
nursing means much more to you than it does to your child at this point.
Some tips for keeping a distracted kid on the breast:
 Don’t pull her away from playtime to nurse. She needs a transition
time, something (such as allowing her to have some solids first) that sig-
nals that she ought to settle down and eat.
 Limit the cup to mealtimes. If she’s able to crawl around, play with her
toys, stand, and bounce, all the while toting a cup of juice or formula
around, there’s really no need for her to ever nurse, is there?
 Make it fun. Allow her to bring a toy along while she nurses (unless this
causes her to become more distracted), or keep an interesting necklace
nearby that you wear only during nursing sessions.
 Use a different position. Maybe she wants to nurse while sitting straight
up? This change may be so interesting to Baby that she looks forward to
nursing again.
 Offer her the breast more often if you find she’s barely nursing — or
start pumping. You have to keep up your milk supply or the weaning
decision will be out of your hands.
Rejecting the breast is such a common thing that there’s a term for it: a nurs-
ing strike. Whether you work through the strike or call it quits ultimately
comes down to how much nursing means to you.
Gradual weaning — which is simply cutting back on the number of nursing
sessions and/or their length — often naturally begins at this age. It doesn’t
mean that you have to cut Baby off all together. You can nurse her less fre-
quently without weaning her completely.

Chapter 12: The Seventh Month: Developmental Delights

Eating more, eating less
So how much should a typical 7-month-old be eating each day? As much as
he wants to. You really can’t overfeed a child this age. His stomach can only
hold so much, after all, and he has a wonderful built-in “I’m all full” trigger
that tells him when enough is enough. Depending on how active he is, he may
come to the highchair starving — or he may not be all that interested in
eating. This pattern may vary from day to day. You tell your mother-in-law
how your child eats like a lumberjack, and then he refuses anything you offer
to him during the course of her lovingly prepared Sunday dinner.
If your child is regularly disinterested in solids at this age, we know of a few
ways to lure him into eating a bit more:
 Make mealtime pleasant. Let him have plenty of time to sample the new
foods on his tray. If he likes to linger over teething biscuits and juice, 
let him.
 Time it right. If your baby tends to get very focused on his activities, he’s
going to need a few minutes to ease into mealtimes. He may be so busy
crawling and playing that he doesn’t even realize he’s hungry. Start by
giving him a cup of water or diluted juice while he’s on his blanket, which
will signal that lunchtime is fast approaching — and then follow through
by putting him in his highchair several minutes later. Establishing this pat-
tern will get him thinking about the act of eating, at least.
 Demonstrate. Everyone can picture a parent tasting a bit of the pureed
veggies and faking a smile in an effort to coax their child into giving peas
a chance. Why are these parents willing to go to such lengths? Because
it works — at least in many instances.
 Offer snacks. Not every meal has to be structured. Let Baby have some
tasty snacks throughout the day (like cereal or crackers), which may
whet his appetite for more solids.
Should you be worried if your child isn’t into solids at this age? Not really. 
He will be, eventually. Developmentally, he’s probably ready for them — the
problem is that he’s also developmentally ready to do so many other things
right now. Food may just be at the bottom of his list of priorities. When
should you be concerned?
 If Baby just won’t eat at all. He may have some underlying illness going
on. Ear infections, for example, often manifest themselves in a reluc-
tance to eat because pain radiates down the jaw, making it unpleasant
for Baby to chew or suck.
180
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

 If Baby refuses all solids, all the time. He may be so dependent on nurs-
ing or the bottle that he isn’t at all interested in other foods. Though
there is a theory that it’s natural for children to nurse exclusively for the
first year — a theory that’s bolstered by examples of what children do in
other countries — it’s really in Baby’s best interest to start eating other
foods now. Remember, children in other countries often don’t have other
nutritious foods readily available. Sure, they nurse for a long time, but
they may also be very limited in their options.
A 7-month-old who was born two months prematurely is 5 months old, devel-
opmentally speaking (which means that his digestive system isn’t ready for
minced chicken and mashed mangoes). At this point, he’s ready to get his
first taste of solids in the form of strained baby foods. Don’t expect him to 
be able to feed himself at this point. For more on introducing Baby to solids,
read Chapter 11. Your doctor is the best source of information where your
premature child is concerned, so check with him before starting your child
on solids.
Feeding Baby is just matter of finding what works best — for example, does he
need to snack during the day, or do snacks prevent him from eating his more
nutritious meals? Does he tolerate mealtimes well (can he sit in his highchair
long enough to ingest some food without crying?), or does he need to get back
to his playtime? The most important thing for you to do is to make the effort.
Offer him the food, but don’t force it. Baby will eventually fall into a somewhat
normal (for him) feeding schedule.

W
hoa! Where’s Baby going? He’s up, he’s steady, he’s hanging on — and
he’s navigating his way through the living room! Though not all kids
master the art of cruising (walking while hanging on to furniture or walls) by
the end of this month, some do!
The eighth month is a busy, busy time, filled with milestones and develop-
ments. Parents are often left wondering where their happy-go-lucky, I-love-
everybody child has disappeared to and how he was replaced with this shy,
timid child. Though it can be hard to watch, stranger anxiety is completely
normal — and is a sign of healthy development. By the end of the month,
Baby will probably start to show a real preference for certain people and
things in his life, whether they’re toys (he just loves his stacking blocks),
foods (the kid can’t get enough mashed banana in his diet), or activities
(banging the pots and pans till you’re deaf? It’s fun!). He may also start to
show an interest in — yikes — TV. In this chapter, we go over the possible
effects of allowing Baby to get hooked on virtual entertainment at this point
in time.
Checking In with Baby
Most pediatricians don’t schedule a well-baby visit during the eighth month.
Baby will be back in the office next month for a full examination and, if he’s
missed any shots to date, another round of immunizations.

If Baby falls ill, however, you may need to check in with the doctor anyway.
So keep jotting down any questions you may have instead of trying to 
remember what it was that you wanted to ask as you’re walking into your
appointment.
Your doctor has less time for chit-chat during a sick call, so don’t plan on dis-
cussing the nuances of Baby’s cruising skills at this time; however, if you’re a
little concerned that something is amiss and it isn’t serious enough by itself
to warrant a call to the office, ask about it now.
Milestones this month
Up, up, and away this month — well, almost. Baby may feel as though she has
acquired superhuman strength now that she’s able to move rather indepen-
dently. This newfound freedom will take her into new and interesting situa-
tions every day, and may result in complete contentedness (because she’s
able to keep herself busy now) or frustration (as she strives to do so much
more).
Here are the milestones Baby is likely to reach by the end of this month:
 Baby can crawl or otherwise move across the floor (by dragging herself,
for example).
 She sits without support.
 She has complete head control now. She turns in the direction of a voice
or when she hears her name.
 Baby is able to get into a sitting position from her stomach.
 She’s able to pull herself up.
 She can stand holding onto something.
 She may be able to stand briefly by herself.
 Baby may be able to cruise by holding onto furniture. See Figure 13-1.
 She’s able to hold one object in each hand.
 She can feed herself.
 She can “rake” a small object along the floor with her fingers in order to
pick it up.
 Waves bye-bye.
 Shows a definite preference for particular people, toys, and activities.
 Expresses her frustration or anger if something is taken away from her.
 She says “Mama” or “Dada” (without meaning).
184
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

 Baby understands the word “no.”
 May incorporate “strings” of babbled sounds into her communication.
 Baby will begin to understand the concept of object permanence, if she
doesn’t already (more on this in Chapter 12).
 Stranger anxiety begins in full force this month. (More on this later in
this chapter.)
 Baby begins to understand that certain objects have specific uses. She
may start to mimic you by babbling into her toy telephone, for example.
Outfitting the feet?
When Baby starts cruising, you may be tempted to buy the latest high-tech
footwear in order to ensure his success on the floor. But shoes are just too
bulky for Baby to handle at this point. Instead of offering him support and
some sort of podiatric guidance, they’re more likely to cause a lot of trips
(this is true even after he’s learned to walk well). And unless they have
rubber treads on the bottom, socks are slippery — even on rugs.
In fact, it’s best for Baby to make his first attempts at walking (which cruising
is a prelude to) barefoot. He needs to get a good feel for how his bare feet
work if he’s to master the art of toddling in the next few months. Plus babies’
feet have fairly flat arches. Learning to walk barefoot allows the foot to really
work out those arches, developing them properly. Walking barefoot also
allows the ankles to naturally become stronger over time.

185
Chapter 13: The Eighth Month: The Cruisin' Kid

It’s fine to have shoes on hand for Baby to wear on special occasions. Just
keep in mind that ultra-expensive shoes don’t enhance foot development in a
baby or a toddler. Look for an inexpensive, lightweight, supportive shoe with
a nonskid surface.
TV for babies? No way!
Yes, yes, we know that there are videos available today that are marketed
directly to the parents of infants, promising that their babies will become
geniuses if they’re allowed to sit and watch.
Now check your gut feeling. Chances are, you suspect that watching TV can’t
really be all that great for a child who should be spending her time exploring
and playing by herself. This is what the first few years of life are all about —
discovering the world (and not through the magic of television).
You know how easy it is to become completely dependent on the tube for
entertainment. Think of all the things that adults miss out on when they have
a serious television habit: They’re not interacting with their families. They’re
not fostering any hobbies. They’re not educating themselves by reading.
They’re not using their imaginations to think of anything better to do. Plus,
they’re getting fat.
The same is true for kids who get hooked on TV, but the results may be even
more insidious, because some studies suggest that watching too much TV can
actually result in the development of attention deficit disorder and aggressive
behavioral problems in older children. At the very least, a child who spends
her time in front of the TV isn’t spending her time doing what she should be
doing — namely, being active in the real world and finding out what she’s capa-
ble of. TV isn’t a necessary part of a baby’s life — so avoid starting her on a
habit that may be incredibly hard to break years down the line.
Pediatricians don’t recommend TV viewing for children younger than 2 years
old. At the age of 2, the recommendation is for a child to watch no more than
an hour a day of educational programming.
Allowing Baby to watch an occasional show on TV isn’t going to irreparably
damage her. What it comes down to is whether she watches so much TV that
she’s going to become dependent on it, unable to amuse herself otherwise, or
unable to interact meaningfully with other people. If you know any older chil-
dren who talk about nothing but their favorite cartoons, then you know what
we’re talking about here. These kids have nothing else to talk about because
their lives revolve around TV shows.
186
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Think of it this way: Baby has this brain that’s primed to develop in all kinds
of exciting ways. If she gets zoned in on being entertained electronically, cer-
tain avenues of her creative development will be stifled.
Avoid the urge to use the TV as an electronic babysitter. An occasional lapse
probably won’t be harmful to your child, but setting up a habit of all-day TV
viewing at this age may lead to a long-term dependency on what will become
the love of her life.
So what about those videos that are marketed to newborns and babies? Take
a good look at them and decide for yourself whether you could be the star of
the show, singing the alphabet for Baby in your own home. (Yeah, you can do
that.)
Encouraging Baby to amuse himself
If you have spent every moment of every day not more than 2 feet from 
your child, it’s time to give him a little more space. He’s at the age where he
acknowledges that you and he are two separate entities, and he also recog-
nizes the concept of object permanence. (He knows that although you may
step out of the room for a minute, you’re coming back.)
187
Chapter 13: The Eighth Month: The Cruisin' Kid
Turning off the tube
Even if you have every intention of keeping your
baby TV-free for as long as possible, you may
find it hard to keep yourself away from the hyp-
notic powers of the television. Try the following
alternatives:
 Get out of the house. Join a playgroup. Plan
an errand for each day. Go visiting.
(Alternatively, have people in.) Do some-
thing. It’s good for you and Baby.
 Read. Now that Baby is old enough to play
by herself, at least for a short time, catch up
on your own reading. Not only will it expand
your mind, it’s a good example for Baby.
Remember, she’s at the age where she’s able
to mimic your actions. She may become very
interested in her own books after watching
you read yours.
 Catch up on everything around the house.
Hey, if you’re there, you know the work is
never done. It’s amazing how much you can
accomplish when the TV isn’t distracting you.
 Take time to play with Baby. Encourage her
new skills. Tickle her. Dance with her. Listen
to music together. Read to her. Again, the
amount of time you have to spend with your
child expands exponentially when there’s
nothing in the background competing for
your attention.

Although you should certainly strive to interact with Baby, your goal is to
find a healthy balance. Baby has to learn to amuse himself at some point. Just
as he had to (or still has to) learn to comfort himself at night, he should be
able to play by himself now, at least for a short time. He’s physically capable
of manipulating his age-appropriate toys. He probably has his favorites at
this point, and he knows exactly what to expect from them (which is wonder-
ful, because children thrive on repetition).
Don’t try to entertain your child every minute of the day. Yes, he’s the absolute
apple of your eye, and yes, you want to play with him and educate him and do
what’s best for him. It’s not in his best interest, though, to think that you are
nothing more than his court jester. (Do you want a kid who cries every time
you’re not singing and dancing for his amusement?) So let Baby have some
time to himself each day — even if you’re sitting nearby (and obviously if you
aren’t, he should be in a safe environment, like his playpen) — to try to amuse
himself with his own toys. Trying to figure what he likes on his own gives him
the opportunity to learn a lot about himself — what he finds funny, or what he
doesn’t care for at all.
Stranger anxiety rears its scary head
Suddenly, Baby has a fearful look on her face when your neighbor — some-
one she’s seen and accepted regularly — approaches. Before you know it,
Baby is crying, clinging to you, and won’t lift her head from your shoulder.
What’s going on here?
In the past few months, you’ve no doubt noticed that Baby has become more
interested in interacting with people. You may have felt a surge of pride,
thinking that your child is so easy going, so laid-back, so loving toward every-
one — why, you could just see her high school yearbook: She had a definite
lock on being voted Most Popular. With this latest development, however,
you may be concerned that Baby’s personality has changed, that she doesn’t
like people, and worse, if she continues to act this way, people won’t like her!
You can stop worrying. Your intelligent child is going through a very normal
developmental stage — she’s experiencing stranger anxiety. Although for sev-
eral months she truly has enjoyed interacting with other people — no matter
who they were — she has just turned a corner, so to speak, and realized that
not all people are the same. Or, more to the point, she knows that these
people are not her parents. She’s becoming more selective in whom she
chooses to interact with — at least when she’s first confronted with someone
who isn’t Mom or Dad.
188
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

The severity of stranger anxiety (which can begin as early as the end of the
eight month) varies from child to child, though it does affect almost every
baby sooner or later. Some children show a slight reluctance to greet
strangers, and some become completely paralyzed with fear. There’s nothing
wrong with either extreme, and none of this means that you’ve done anything
wrong in your parenting. This is just a normal part of being a baby.
You can help your child through this distressing phase of life by:
 Acknowledging her fears as being real. Although you may think it’s
crazy for her to be afraid of relatives she’s seen many times, it’s not crazy
to her. Don’t force her out of her shell; she needs to know that she’s safe
with you.
 Discussing Baby’s stranger anxiety with friends and relatives. Let
them know that Baby is going through a normal stage so that they aren’t
hurt by her sudden unwillingness to play with — or even look at —
them.
 Giving her time and space. When she’s entering into a situation with
outsiders (or friends are coming into your home), allow Baby to take her
time adjusting to the situation. She may want to cling to you the entire
time, she may want to play by herself, or she may very well decide that
these people are all right after she checks them out from afar. Follow her
lead and tell your company to do the same.
 Asking visitors not to jump right in and hold or even try to talk to
Baby. Have them just ignore Baby for a while until she’s ready to initiate
an interaction.
Most kids have resolved their stranger anxiety issues by the time they’re 3
years old.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
In the eighth month, Baby is more active — which means he will inevitably
take a knock to his noggin once or twice. He also may be running into more
germs as he gets out and about, exploring his world. Fear not: Bumps and
bruises and sniffles and colds are all part of the grand scheme of growing up.
Big steps, big falls
With increased locomotion comes the increased risk for injury to Baby. He’ll
have lots of falls onto his well-padded bottom, which are rarely cause for any
189
Chapter 13: The Eighth Month: The Cruisin' Kid

sort of alarm. Though Baby’s pride may be hurt, you can be sure that his
diaper will save him from any real harm to his backside.
The first time Baby takes a real spill, though, can be an alarming experience
for him and for you. Once he’s able to pull himself up, and especially after
he’s off and cruising, there’s no telling what can happen, often before you
ever have a chance to see it coming. If he smacks his forehead on the coffee
table, or he bumps his head on the floor, he may react by screaming in pain. 
If there’s blood or a bump, you may react similarly, as though you actually
feel his pain.
Stop yourself in your tracks. Reacting to your child’s injury by becoming hys-
terical isn’t going to help matters — at all. It won’t even make you feel better
(which is a justification we moms sometimes use for getting emotional). It
will only serve to scare Baby and yourself — perhaps far more than the 
situation warrants.
When Baby bumps his head, the following steps are your best bet:
 Go to him. Pick him up and comfort him.
 Remain calm, even if there’s blood.
 Assess the situation before reacting further. For more information on
how to assess a head injury, keep reading.
Chapter 19 covers the treatment of common injuries. What you need to know
right now is that babies do get hurt — some more so than others.
Not every bump to the head calls for a trip to the emergency room, but you
do need to call the doctor if:
 Baby has bumped his head and lost consciousness, even briefly, or if he
has sustained a bump to the head and is pale, cranky, vomiting, unable
to perform his usual physical activities (crawling, pulling up, and so
on), has large or dilated pupils, or has discharge coming from his ears.
Call without delay. These are all signs of a serious head injury.
 Baby has cut his head and you can’t stop the bleeding. Head wounds
tend to bleed a lot, but a cut that continues to bleed after several
attempts at applying direct pressure (ten minutes each try) and/or has
jagged edges (which probably won’t heal nicely without a stitch or two)
warrants a trip to the doctor’s office.
 Baby has hit his head after a fall from a height (off the couch or
counter, for example). This falls into the category of an accelerated head
injury, which is more likely to cause serious injury than a simple fall
from a standing position.
190
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Now, you may be wondering if it isn’t just a better option to pop a little
helmet on Baby’s head and/or simply hang onto him all the time until he’s
mastered the art of cruising and walking. The answer is no. He needs to know
that taking a tumble now and again is just a normal part of the learning
process.
Do what you can to prevent major injuries by gating off stairways and by gen-
erally preparing a safe environment where Baby can work on his new skills.
But don’t hover and don’t show him your fear. Seeing a parent fall to pieces
after he’s taken a relatively minor tumble can send the message to Baby that
this walking business is seriously dangerous stuff, which may make him
reluctant to try, try again.
Giving up the battle against germs
If Baby has already suffered through a nasty cold, you know how hard it is to
stand by and watch as a virus squashes Baby’s zest for living. You’ve made
up your mind that you must do everything in your power to keep your child,
your home, your car, your spouse, and your entire lives germ-free. It’s just
part of the job of parenting, you say, and there’s just no greater gift that you
can give your child.
Put your cleanser down and back away from it — just for a moment. The
world is a dirty, germy place. We are all covered in bacteria — our bodies and
our mouths are just loaded with specimens. We’re exposed to germs every
single day, mostly without our knowledge, and for the most part, we adapt
and survive. Part of that adaptation is being exposed to germs in the first
place and building up immunity to them. Simply put, you can’t fight the
germs if you don’t have the strength. You can’t get the strength if you hide
from the fight.
None of this is to say that you should take every illness lightly — just don’t
think you can prevent every illness. When Baby is sick, keep an eye on him
for signs of serious complications (fever, listlessness, labored breathing) and
call your pediatrician at once if any of these symptoms develop.
191
Chapter 13: The Eighth Month: The Cruisin' Kid
Building stronger bacteria?
As antibacterial soaps and cleansers become
more widely available, you may think that the
world is on its way to becoming germ-free. To the
contrary, some studies have suggested that the
proliferation of antibacterial soaps, wipes, and
cleansers has only encouraged germs to mutate
into new forms that are resistant to antibacterial
soaps and antibiotics. More research is needed
to prove or disprove this theory.

You need to find a middle ground. Don’t let your child play in the cat’s litter
box, for example, or eat food off the floor, but realize that you can’t clean
every germ, everywhere. Heck, you can’t even see the little buggers, so how
can you avoid them all?
You can take some measures to prevent serious illness, but you needn’t
spend every waking moment cleansing the world with bleach. A little knowl-
edge and some common sense are all you really need:
 Take precautions in the kitchen, particularly when handling raw
foods. Prepare meats and produce separately — using separate areas
and separate knives and cutting boards — to prevent the spread of 
salmonella (from poultry) or E. coli (from raw meats). Wash cutting
boards and knives thoroughly — either in the dishwasher or in hot,
soapy water — after each use.
 Use sponges and cloth wipes sparingly for cleaning counters and
Baby’s highchair tray. Sponges and wipes create a perfect environment
(continually moist) for trapping, spreading, and breeding bacteria (like
E. coli). Paper towels are a healthier choice for cleaning up spills and
wiping down countertops.
 Always wash your hands before feeding Baby, after changing his
diaper, and whenever the need arises. This simple act can prevent the
spread of many illnesses and bacteria.
192
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 
Sterilizing toys for tots
Do toys need to be sterilized if you later find out
that Baby’s playmate was incubating a conta-
gious illness? If Baby was in proximity to a child
with an airborne illness, he’s already been
exposed. And keep in mind that most viruses
can’t live on surfaces for a long period of time
anyway, so your scrubbing may be for naught.
This also goes for toys in the doctor’s office.
Don’t let your baby suck and chew on them, but
don’t be afraid to let him play.
Sick baby, well child?
Your child is going to catch colds and other
viruses — but each time he does, he’s strength-
ening his immune system, and that’s a goodthing!
Studies have shown that kids who aren’t in a
group daycare setting catch as many illnesses as
children who are in daycare — the difference is
that the daycare kids are exposed to many germs
earlier in life. And the earlier a child is exposed to
certain illnesses, the stronger his immune system
may be when he goes off to school. He won’t be
knocked flat by every germ coming down the pike
in kindergarten (and there are plenty of them).

In some circumstances, you may have to be more cautious than other par-
ents. If your child has asthma, for example, a common cold can be very seri-
ous for him, and you’re right to limit his exposure to the outside world during
cold and flu season. For an otherwise healthy child, though, being exposed to
common illnesses is just a part of normal life. Yes, it’s a real drag to have a
sick child — but isn’t it even more difficult to try to sterilize your entire
world?
Bathing in the Big Tub
Now that Baby’s getting bigger, you’ll probably find that bathing her in the
real tub is much easier than dragging out the infant tub, setting up the sup-
plies on the kitchen counter, and taking care of rub-a-dub-dubbing in an area
that really was never intended for bathing a child. In this section, we give you
some pointers on making the move to the adult tub.
Unless Baby is absolutely filthy (with dried juice in her hair and peas in her
ears) at the end of every day, she probably only needs a bath a couple of
times a week. However, some parents find that a nightly bath helps to signal
the end of the day for reluctant sleepers or helps to calm active children
before bedtime. If that’s the case in your house, then by all means, make
bathtime a soothing nighttime ritual for everyone — followed by a book and
some snuggling time. (Your on-the-go child may actually start looking forward
to this peaceful conclusion to each day!)
Keeping Baby supported
At this point, Baby should be sitting well unsupported. If she’s still a bit wobbly
and you’re just not comfortable about putting her into the tub without any kind
of support, you can use a bathing ring, which attaches to the bottom of your
tub with suction cups, and gives Baby the support and security of sitting in an
actual seat while she’s soaking up the bubbles. (See Figure 13-2.)
Although bathing rings have been around for years and have been used with-
out incident in many households, they are not intended to be a replacement
for constant adult supervision while Baby is in the tub. They can flip — for-
ward or backward — if they lose suction, which could send Baby underwater
if you’re not hanging on to her. Babies have also slipped though the seat por-
tion of the rings. Bottom line: Whether you’re using a ring or not, you need to
be right next to the tub at all times when Baby is splish-splashing.
193
Chapter 13: The Eighth Month: The Cruisin' Kid

Considering bathtub safety
Many of the same safety rules that apply to bathing Baby in an infant tub
(check out Chapter 6) apply here, with a few additions:
 Place a nonslip pad in your tub.
 Never allow Baby to play with the faucet. She’s not coordinated enough
to turn it on and off right now, but you don’t want to encourage this
habit. When she is able to turn on the water, she could inadvertently
burn herself.
 Buy a cover for the spout. The spout may have sharp edges, which
could cause a painful injury if Baby bumps her head on it.
 Don’t allow Baby to stand or pull herself up in the tub. She could slip
and hit her head on the side or bottom.
 Use baby-safe, liquid soap and shampoo. Children have choked on the
small, sliver-like remnants of bar soap. (Besides, bar soaps are irritating
to the eyes.)
 Never, ever, ever leave her alone in the tub. Babies can drown in 1
inch of water in under a minute. Nothing is worth risking your child’s
safety. If you absolutely must leave the bathroom, take her with you.
 Always empty the tub when Baby’s bath is finished. Leaving a tub filled
with even a little bit of water could be a hazard for a mobile child.
Figure 13-2:
Using a
bathtub ring
requires
vigilance on
a parent’s
part.
194
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Baby really only needs 1 or 2 inches of water in the tub at this point. She
doesn’t need to soak her cares away in a tub filled up to her neck — that’s
your secret escape from the world. She just needs enough water to splash in.
Making tubtime fun
There’s no reason bathtime can’t be fun, or at least a not-unpleasant experi-
ence for the bath-phobic. Try these tactics to keep Baby happy in the tub:
 If she’s less than thrilled about the prospect of being in this big, scary,
water-filled tank, keep her close to the side. This could just make her
feel secure enough to comply with the bath.
 If she just hates having water dumped on her head, try a bath “hat.”
This is basically a foam-rubber ring that goes around Baby’s head, keep-
ing the water from running down into her face.
 Wash her hair just before she comes out of the tub. Shampooing too
early can leave her feeling chilled, and may cause her to cut her play-
time in the tub short.
 Make sure you have a towel handy and that it’s big enough to wrap
Baby in. You want to keep her as warm as possible between tubtime and
pajama time.
 Keep a stash of bath toys in the bathroom for easy access when bath-
time rolls around. You don’t need to rush out and buy the fanciest,
most educational bath-themed toys you can find (though there’s cer-
tainly no harm in doing so). At this age, kids love simple plastic contain-
ers that they can fill with water and dump — over and over again.

D
uring the ninth month, your Baby is creeping ever closer to becoming 
a real little person. He’s able to communicate, he’s able to move about
independently, and he has his likes and dislikes. It’s almost easier for you to
imagine him as a toddler than to remember what he was like during those
first few weeks after he was born (although, thanks to the magic of video, 
you can replay those days as often as you like — sometimes with a heavy
sigh, when you realize how quickly the time has gone, and how quickly it 
will continue to fly by).
Because he’s accomplished so much, and has so much more to tackle, it’s
easy to fall into the trap of comparing your child to your friends’ similarly-
aged kids — or to compare him to any older siblings. If you’re exposed to
children who are about the same age as yours (or if you have older children)
what you realize more than anything else during the second half of the first
year is that every child is different. They each have their special talents; they
each have their own way of doing things. Comparing them to one another
isn’t fair.
Checking In with Baby
Baby catches up with the doctor this month with a full-fledged well-baby
visit, which will cover the basics of measurement and a host of questions
about Baby’s day. This month, Baby may be hitting some major physical and
cognitive milestones, which are listed for you in this section.

The 9-month checkup
Baby’s back in the saddle this month, paying the good doctor a visit for a
well-baby exam. Baby may be lucky enough to avoid immunization shots this
month, although some doctors do give a late HBV at this point. (For the low-
down on immunizations, see Chapter 18.) What else will happen during the 
9-month checkup?
To begin the visit, Baby has her height and weight measured. Your doctor 
plots her growth on the charts to make sure she’s progressing steadily. She has
her head circumference measured. She’s examined as usual, with the doctor
assessing her overall development and checking for signs of any abnormalities
(by palpating her internal organs, listening to her heart and lungs, checking out
her hips and spine, and peeking into her ears, eyes, and mouth).
Your pediatrician will have a slew of questions for you, including:
 How much is Baby eating these days? If she’s bottlefed, the doctor will
want to know how many ounces she’s taking in each day; if you’re
breastfeeding, you’ll be asked how often and how long she nurses.
 What types of solids is Baby eating? Baby should be eating solids by
this point. Your doctor wants to know which baby foods and table foods
Baby takes in.
 How long does Baby sleep at night? How many naps during the day,
and how long is each nap? Babies this age sleep an average of 14 hours
a day (about 11 hours at night and a total of 3 hours at naptimes). If
Baby is sleeping less or still waking at night, your doc may suggest
upping her intake of food during the day.
 What kind of physical activity is Baby capable of? Does she sit unas-
sisted? Pull herself up? Stand alone? Babble? Enjoy a game of peekaboo?
Play with her toys? A list of 9-month milestones is included in this 
chapter.
In addition, your doctor will want to know about your home. He isn’t simply
being nosy — he’s looking for any potential hazards or situations that may
pinpoint trouble on the horizon. He may ask about your baby-proofing mea-
sures, for example, and offer you advice on things you may have missed.
The doctor may ask if you rock Baby to sleep each night. Remember that 
you should ideally put Baby into bed while she’s awake so that she can learn
to comfort herself. Failing to learn this may mean years of disrupted sleep 
for her — and for you.
198
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

No matter what your doctor asks, answer him honestly. He really does have
your child’s best interest at heart — and he’s an expert. He’s seen and heard
of situations concerning child development and injuries that may not occur
to most laypeople.
Milestones this month
During the ninth month, Baby continues to accomplish new tasks, and he may
just discover that he is quite a little thespian. You’ll realize that he may not 
be content to sit in his highchair and eat quietly while you move about the
kitchen — he wants all eyes on himself. Children this age suddenly realize that
they can garner quite a bit of attention by coughing, letting out squeals of
pleasure (or displeasure), and performing “tricks” for their parents. Parents
are so amused and delighted at these real attempts at communication that
they’re only too happy to comply by giving Baby an audience to play to. Here’s
what else Baby’s up to this month:
 Baby crawls well or scoots himself along using his own means of cre-
ative movement.
 He may discover that he’s able to hoist himself up the stairs — but he
probably won’t be able come back down.
 Baby is also able to sit well by himself and for an indeterminate amount
of time — just like a regular kid. He should be able to work himself into a
seated position from his stomach at this age.
 He pulls himself up.
 He may be able to stand without holding onto anything, possibly for a
considerable length of time.
 He’s able to cruise (make his way around the room hanging onto furni-
ture, people, or whatever’s available).
 Baby may be able to carefully seat himself when he’s finished standing —
unlike previous months where he let go of whatever he was hanging onto
and simply fell backward.
 He’s able to use his pincer grasp (thumb and index finger) to pick up
very small objects (as opposed to using his thumb and fingers to “rake”
objects into the palm of his hand). See Figure 14-1.
Now that Baby can pick stuff up more easily, you need to be doubly con-
scious about making sure that small items he can choke on are placed
out of his reach.
199
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

 Baby learns to command the attention of the masses by intentionally
coughing, squealing, or grunting. This is the result of his learning to
mimic and repeat the actions he sees going on around him.
 Another part of his intentional communication and mimicry is his use of
singsong babbling, which is his attempt to sound just like you when he
“speaks.”
 Baby is also quite the cute show-off this month, intentionally doing things
(like standing, or giggling, or clapping his hands) for your attention,
amusement, and approval.
 Baby may point to objects of interest this month.
 He looks for objects that have dropped (he understands object perma-
nence — that things aren’t gone forever just because he can’t see them)
and may become quite upset if you take something away from him.
 He waves hello and goodbye.
 He’s able to say “Mama” or “Dada,” perhaps still without meaning. But
some children are beginning to attach meaning to their words at this
point. (In addition to naming Mom and Dad, he may also be able to say
“ba” for “ball,” or “da” for “dog,” for example.)
 Baby is capable of expressing empathy for others at this age. He may, for
example, cry when a nearby playmate breaks into tears.
 Stranger anxiety becomes an issue, if it hasn’t already. Baby is likely to
shy away from anyone who isn’t Mom or Dad (or the primary caregiver).
More on this in Chapter 13.

Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

 Baby may be able to follow simple (one-step) instructions, such as, “Put
that down,” or “Come to Mommy.”
 He understands the concept of “no.”
 He may start to tote a security object around this month. (More on this
later in this chapter.)
 Children this age begin to develop fears. Prior to this time, your child’s
brain simply wasn’t wired to acknowledge the possibility of danger
around him. Baby may start to show a wariness of heights, for example,
when he climbs to the top of the stairs and realizes he can’t get down
without getting hurt.
 Baby’s memory is also starting to improve at this age. He won’t remem-
ber for the rest of time the “conversations” the two of you had over
lunch while he was a 9-month-old, but he will definitely remember how a
story goes (for example, if something exciting happens halfway through
his favorite book, you may see his eyes grow wide in anticipation), or
how to “sing” along with his favorite songs.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
Baby’s new moves toward independence may be very exciting for your child —
but they can also be a bit unsettling, which may make her want to cling to a
security object for comfort. Particularly now that Baby may be crawling up
stairs, you need to reassess and upgrade your baby-proofing at this point.
Going up! Baby takes to the stairs
At 9 months old, Baby’s no longer satisfied to simply crawl from here to
there, pull herself up, stand a while, cruise, and sit back down. Surely there
must be something more to do, she’s thinking.
And then she spots the stairs. Why, it’s so logical, so exciting, so natural — 
she feels that she belongs on those stairs and intends to put her motoring skills
to work by climbing them, just the way you and your other family members 
do. (Remember, at this age, Baby is watching and mimicking your moves.) For
some children, crawling up the stairs is just a small trick they quickly add to
their already long list of accomplishments; for others, it’s like learning to scale
the vertical side of a mountain.
Ideally, children this age should be kept off the stairs. Realistically, parents
allow kids to climb them. If Baby does nothing but hang on the gate at the
201
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

bottom of the steps all day long, you may figure that she’s ready and that it’s
best for her to learn to climb those steps the right way. Allow this activity
only if you have one hand on her, ready to catch her at every second, and
only if you take care to safeguard her from accidental injury.
If Baby has little interest in the stairs, consider yourself lucky. Don’t take this
as a sign you need to teach her to climb them. Keeping her away from stairs
in the first place is the surest way to keep her from taking a roll down them.
Even if Baby becomes a veritable master of the stairs, you must continue to
gate the stairs at all times. Stairs are just plain dangerous, and Baby should
not be allowed independent access to them. Remember, after Baby has navi-
gated those steps, she can disappear out of your sight without your knowing
which level of the house to search for her on. She shouldn’t be on the steps
at all unless you’re supervising her and ready to steady her.
Children this age usually don’t grasp the concept of coming back down the
stairs (something Baby may not manage for at least a couple of months or
perhaps not even until she’s in the second year). Be aware that if she has not
developed any fears — specifically of falling or of heights — she may try to
crawl head-first down the steps, which is why you may want to reconsider
allowing her access to them until she’s old enough to appreciate the inherent
dangers of this activity. This is also why it’s so important to continue gating
off the stairs — just because she can go up without incident doesn’t guaran-
tee a safe return trip.
Lovin’ that blankie: Security objects
Around this time, you may notice that Baby has a favorite stuffed animal,
blanket, or toy that he carries around with him for most of the day. Some chil-
dren start to develop this loving relationship with a particular object as early
as 6 months old, while others never cling to anything special. Baby may play
with and talk to his beloved bear, or he may retreat to his super-soft blanket
at different times throughout the afternoon. Whatever it is that he’s clinging
to, it probably goes with him for naps and at bedtime. (Or perhaps these are
the only times he needs his comfort object.)
Fear not: This new attachment to a security object isn’t a result of something
you did or didn’t do. Attaching himself at the hip to a security object is very
normal behavior.
As Baby continues to master new skills, he also begins to recognize that he’s
not merely an extension of his parents but his own person — able to move
more and more independently through the world. At the same time, he’s
202
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

taken a few spills, suffered from a few bumps and bruises, and realized that
the world is a big, big place filled with a lot of not-so-nice possibilities — and
that his parents aren’t always available to comfort his fears. By finding a
friendly or soft security object, Baby is looking for a way to comfort himself
when he’s feeling a bit anxious — which may be almost never, or may be
quite often.
Experts actually refer to security objects as transitional objects — meaning that
whatever Baby is holding onto is merely a temporary stand-in for his parents’
comfort and affection. The security object, however, may be a constant pres-
ence in Baby’s life, whereas Mom — although loving and attentive — isn’t able
to literally stand right next to the child every moment of the day. Transitional
objects also play a part in Baby’s developing autonomy — he decides how
much comfort he needs, and he is in control of the object that offers him some
peace of mind.
The use of a transitional object actually benefits parents, too. Baby needs 
to learn to comfort himself. If he’s had a difficult time sleeping through the
night, the use of a comfort object may help him snooze peacefully. If he cries
when you leave him at the babysitter’s, allowing him to bring along some-
thing that reminds him of home — and of you — may help him quiet down
faster.
Some experts believe that children who never find a transitional object to
cling to may have a hard time calming themselves. If you have an almost
inconsolable little guy who gets very wound up over the course of his day
and acts out in frustration or crankiness, offer him a soft blanket or a plush
animal while you soothe him. You may see a remarkable change in him, and
he may actually start enjoying his naps and quiet times.
If, on the other hand, Baby’s attachment to his transitional object is clearly
affecting his ability to relate to real people or is preventing him from reaching
his developmental milestones, it may be wise to limit the blanket’s use to
naps and bedtime.
Here’s how to keep that blankie or stuffed bear in perspective:
 Allow Baby his beloved object. As long as it’s not interfering in his
normal development, there’s no harm in letting him have his stuffed
bear nearby.
 Wash it. Baby is probably as attached to the smell of his blanket or
stuffed animal as he is to the feel of it. Even though he despises the
clean smell, it’s important to rid the comfort object of all of the germs
and bacteria it accumulates while it’s dragged along the floor.
203
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

It’s especially important to wash his blankie or animal after Baby has
been sick. You don’t want to risk recontaminating him.
 Let him bring it along when possible and when necessary. The entire
point of the security object is to alleviate Baby’s anxiety. When he’s
entering into unfamiliar territory, he’s not going to be distracted enough
by his new surroundings to forget about his stuffed panda — he’s going
to need more comfort than usual.
 Respect the security object. The security object is sacred to Baby. Right
now, it’s second in his life only to you. Don’t tease him about it or play
hide-and-seek with it.
 Make sure the security object isn’t harmful to Baby. Pacifiers and bot-
tles of water are acceptable as comfort objects, as long as they aren’t
interfering with Baby’s attempts at speech. If Baby is attached to her
bottle of juice or formula, however, you need to nip that habit in the
bud. Kids who tote bottles filled with sugary drinks around with them
during the day or who are allowed to regularly suck on them during 
naptimes and throughout the night are prone to developing baby bottle
mouth, or decay of the baby teeth. For more on baby bottle mouth, see
Chapter 11.
 Recognize that the object isn’t a substitute for you. His security object
only helps him to deal with the fact that he can’t constantly cling to you.
Continue to offer Baby lots of attention and snuggle time.
 Let Baby decide when he wants his security object. If he has forgotten
all about his stuffed cat and is playing nicely with other toys, don’t bring
the animal over and say, “Mr. Cat wants to play, too.” Let Baby decide
when he needs comfort — and when he’s all right on his own.
 Protect it — or be ready to replace it. Any parent who has had a child’s
cherished blanket, stuffed animal, or toy go missing will attest to the fact
that it is no fun to search for a stuffed bear in the park after nightfall
while your spouse tries unsuccessfully to cajole Baby into going to bed
alone. If it’s at all possible to have an imposter on hand, by all means,
do. Save yourself from witnessing the heartbreak of Baby’s first lost love.
Expect Baby to continue to cling to his blankie or teddy bear through at least
the second year. By around age 3, the need for security objects dwindles a
bit, because your child will be able to emotionally attach himself to people
other than you and your partner. In other words, Baby’s comfort will come
from a variety of sources, and he will become less dependent on receiving
consolation and attention only from Mom and Dad.
No, you shouldn’t feel guilty if your child is in day care and clinging to his
blanket — children have been searching for security objects forever, and the
kids of stay-at-home parents are as prone to needing a little extra comfort as
other kids are.
204
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Comparing Kids: The Irresistible Urge 
to Rank Baby’s Development
Comparing children comes as naturally to parents as your child’s develop-
mental milestones come to her. Most parents fall into this trap without even
realizing it, and most parents believe that their own children are doing things
“right” — though occasionally, you may meet a parent who believes that her
own mothering skills are so lacking that her child will never catch up to his
or her peers (and usually, this is a major exaggeration of the situation).
Why do parents (and grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends) do this? It may
be out of genuine curiosity — first-time parents, in particular, need to seek out
and listen to the stories of other first-timers. This can be a great help to par-
ents who are feeling anxious or unsure about the way their child is learning to
feed herself, for example (by smashing the food everywhere on her face except
into her mouth) — when they hear that someone else’s child is doing the same
thing, they realize that it’s probably normal behavior.
Interacting with parents during a playgroup or another supportive environ-
ment where children will inevitably be compared can emphasize the very
healthy message that all kids are different — and wonderful — in their own
unique ways.
Keeping up with the Joneses’ kid
We live in a competitive society. Many moms, at one point or another, have
worked outside of the home and have experience with the dog-eat-dog world
of business. Many dads go off to the trenches every day to seal huge deals,
knowing that aggression is the key to winning. A lot of people live in neigh-
borhoods where they’re constantly keeping up with the Joneses. When chil-
dren come into the picture, parents who are naturally competitive sometimes
view their offspring as dominant creatures — at least in relation to the other
people’s kids.
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with thinking your child is the greatest little
person to ever walk the planet, as long as you acknowledge that other par-
ents feel the same way about their children — and that all of you are correct
in your feelings.
When a friend or neighbor has a child who is roughly the same age as yours,
your first reaction may be, “How great! Automatic, life-long friends!” That feel-
ing may quickly change to, “How do I get these people out of my life?” as
205
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

soon as you realize that, at least according to this other parent, your child is
not nearly as advanced as hers (look at her child cruise, would you?!), your
child has no sense of humor (did you just see her child giggling earlier?), and
you’re using the wrong diapers — and diaper ointment (you’re just setting
your kid up for a nasty rash — you should really switch to the brands your
friend uses for her baby). Oh, and by the way, your child also goes to bed too
late and gets up too early, and he should be wearing something on his head
at all times during the cold winter months — even indoors — like her daugh-
ter does.
Believe it or not, those parents who insist that their child is ahead of the
curve and that you’re in need of their expert guidance are likely just looking
for evidence that they’re doing everything correctly. Or maybe these people
honestly believe that their child raising is progressing perfectly — which is
great. We should all be so happy and confident in our child-rearing skills. Just
don’t let these competitive parents raise doubts in your mind where there
weren’t any.
Kids reach physical, social, and cognitive milestones at generally the same
ages — but there can be wide variations in these time frames. Some very
strong children start pulling up late in the sixth month, while others may not
try hoisting their bottoms off the ground until the ninth or tenth months. As
long as your pediatrician is satisfied that Baby is progressing normally, you
shouldn’t let other parents make you feel as though your child is behind in a
particular area of development.
Having confidence in yourself
Not only do children develop differently, but parents also parent differently.
Parents can follow completely different philosophies about raising children —
one set of parents may place a high value on rigid scheduling, for example,
while another family is working on a much more relaxed timetable — and yet,
the children, for the most part, turn out fine. As long as what you’re doing
works well for you and your household, and your child seems happy, then no
one can tell you with absolute authority that your way is wrong.
Recognize “suggestions” for what they are: Another parent’s way of determin-
ing whether she is doing the right thing for her child. Every time she draws a
comparison between what she’s doing and what you’re doing, it’s her way of
telling herself that her way is better — and it may be, as far as her own child
is concerned. Just remember that she is measuring your methods against her
child’s personality and specific needs. If her son is exhausted at seven in the
evening, then yes, he needs to be in bed at that time. If your daughter fares well
until eight-thirty, then that’s when she needs to be tucked in. Make sure you’re
happy with your routines; someone else’s routine may not fit in your life.
206
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Thankfully, comparisons of this sort are most common among first-time
moms and dads and may decrease considerably over the years. As more kids
enter into their family picture, you may see a startling mellowing in these
folks — because as they juggle their own kids, they realize now that their
first-born is not the center of the universe, that they did not, in fact, write the
manual on how babies should be raised — and that despite their best efforts,
their second-born isn’t buying into the scheduling business the way his older
sibling did. (Yes, it’s all right to smile — just a little, and only to yourself —
when this happens.)
Stroller envy: Equating great 
gear with great parenting
Parents sometimes love to equate spending a lot of money on their child with
raising her well. You see it in parks and malls in certain areas of the country:
Mothers surreptitiously checking out each other’s strollers. Some of them,
you see, have spent big bucks on their carriages to ensure that their children
will be riding in maximum comfort. They have a certain amount of disdain for
mothers who have chosen lesser buggies for their babies. Don’t they care
about their children?
This type of comparison isn’t limited to the stroller, of course. Parents choose
hand-knitted sweaters instead of fleece pullovers because Baby deserves the
best. They purchase the most expensive organic baby foods because they’re
more concerned with their child’s health than most parents (or so they tell
themselves — and others). Baby’s quilt was imported from a far-flung land,
and Baby’s teething ring was custom-designed by an orthodontist.
It’s enough to make average parents who are trying to make ends meet (espe-
cially those who have taken a big cut in income in order to stay home with
Baby) feel as though they have no business raising a child. It never even
occurred to you to consult with an orthodontist!
Say it out loud: “Spending less money on baby accessories doesn’t make me 
a bad parent.” Spending more money on baby accessories doesn’t automati-
cally qualify you for Parent of the Year. Spend what you can reasonably afford
and stop yourself — and your comparisons between what your baby has and
what other babies have — right there.
Having your first child is incredibly exciting, and filling the house with clothes,
toys, and decorations for your child can be entertaining beyond belief. But feel-
ing bad because you can’t provide your child with the most expensive things is
just silly. You may want her to have a round cherrywood canopy crib instead of
207
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

the plain crib she has now. Sure, it’s a beautiful piece of furniture, but it’s not
going to make your baby any happier than she already is in her less expensive
crib. The pricier bed isn’t going to help her sleep better; it’s not going to ensure
that she’s a nice child; it’s not going to put her at the head of the class later in
life. These are just cribs we’re talking about — something you’ll be forced to
put away in a relatively short period of time.
Just about everything Baby has or uses right now will be packed away — or
given away — eventually, which is why many parents choose to keep their
spending way down. On the other hand, some parents know that they’re
going to have more children and feel it’s wisest to invest in quality items that
can be passed down from child to child. Neither way of thinking is wrong —
and neither indicates how much or how little a parent cares for a child.
So the next time you’re in the children’s section of your favorite store and
some other mother is sneaking a peek at the make of your stroller, realize
that she’s the insecure person in this scenario, drawing a parallel between
stroller brands and parenting skills. (Ridiculous? You betcha.)
Sibling versus sibling
Maybe this isn’t your first time parenting a child. If you have an older child,
you’ll almost inevitably draw comparisons between him and your baby. Most
parents find themselves doing this, although it’s not always exactly the
healthiest way to look at your children.
Take the children in your baby’s playgroup. They differ from one another in:
 Size
 Physical appearance
 Physical development and abilities
 Language skills
 Cognitive development and abilities
 Personality
Guess what? Siblings can have all of these differences, too.
How can that be? If they have the same parents and are raised in the same
household by the same set of rules, how could children possibly turn out so
differently?
208
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Well, a host of nature versus nurture theories try to explain why some of
these differences occur. For instance, boys are often more active and motor-
oriented, while girls may grasp language earlier. And personality may be
largely affected by birth order, which falls under the nurture label — parents
tend to treat their children differently, depending on their birth order:
 Firstborns tend to be more responsible and mature than their siblings
because parents expect them to be the “big brother” or “big sister.”
 Youngest children tend to be free spirits and practical jokers. By the
time this kid makes his appearance, the rules in the house have some-
times relaxed considerably — and the youngest never has to compete
with another baby for attention.
 Kids in the middle tend to be mild-mannered rule followers and keepers
of the peace. They’re caught between domineering older siblings and
show-stealing younger ones and find comfort in creating and following
routine.
Other traits, like hair color or your child’s size, are determined by nature. You
may have one son who looks exactly like Mom, another who is the spitting
image of Dad, and a third who looks like no one in particular. (Insert your
own mailman joke here.) You can’t make your tiny son tall or your daughter’s
black hair blonde. Accept them as they are — because they’re beautiful, even
if they don’t look like anyone else in the family.
Cognitive skills and language development could be dependent on nature or
nurture (or maybe both!). Some kids are just wired differently. Speech, in par-
ticular, is a milestone that varies widely from child to child, even within the
same family. Your older child was saying “Mama” while pointing to you at 
8 months; your second, at almost 10 months, says “ma” to indicate every-
thing from his foot to the sky.
Your first child may have been walking at 10 months. She also may have been a
skinny little thing, able to get up and move without much physical hindrance. If
your second child is a big, chubby guy, he’s probably going to be slower in the
movement department, simply because he’s toting more mass around. Now,
you may have also been able to help your daughter learn to walk by physically
supporting her and encouraging her every moment of the day — something
that’s much harder for you to do for your second child when you’re keeping
him out of trouble, chasing an older child, and trying to clean up the breakfast
dishes.
The good news is that although one child may be slower in some areas than
another child, most kids end up developing normally all the way around. The
bad news is that parents sometimes compare children out loud — that is, at
the dinner table, Dad may say to his eldest child, “You should see how your
209
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

brother hit the ball at practice today. You could do that if you tried.” Or, to a
younger child, “Your older sister always had straight As in math. You can do
better if you start concentrating.” These parents are trying to stimulate
healthy competition between a child who’s perceived as being lazy and one
who’s doing well in a particular activity.
Comparing siblings to one another — especially in front of the children — is a
bad, bad idea. The resulting competing attitudes are almost never healthy. The
“lesser” child resents the “better” sibling and feels betrayed by the parent, who
is, in the child’s mind, showing clear favoritism toward that sibling.
Of course, when your kids are babies, you won’t be comparing math grades
and athletic abilities. But you may say to a screaming toddler, “Your baby
brother doesn’t scream. Can you be as quiet as he is?” An innocent compari-
son here or there isn’t going to set up a lifetime of sibling rivalry — but if
your toddler’s personality becomes more and more disagreeable while your
baby only becomes sweeter, it may be hard not to compare kids silently in
your mind, noting that your older child has always been sort of difficult,
come to think of it. She was never an easy kid — like the baby is.
Giving in to this kind of thinking may make your toddler’s behavior seem worse
than it actually is. Allowing yourself to compare positive and negative traits
among your children can lead to an exaggeration in your perception of the
kids’ behavior. You may think, for example, that your baby is the best child in
the world when you compare him to what your older child put you through at
the same age. Try hiding that attitude from an uncooperative toddler.
210
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 
Slower to talk, quicker to crawl
An interesting trend that pediatricians often
notice in families is that a second-born child will
often develop speech at a later age than his older
sibling did — but the younger child’s motor skills
develop at an earlier age. These variations in
development are completely normal and aren’t
cause for alarm. Several theories exist for why
this may be true:
 Parents are better informed as to how to
enhance an infant’s motor skills the second
time around.
 Older siblings may intervene on Baby’s
behalf and either talk for him or anticipate
his needs so that he doesn’t have to verbal-
ize his need for his bottle, for example.
 Mom is busy with a toddler and the infant is
left on his own in the playpen for longer peri-
ods of time. He finds ways to amuse himself
early on (by learning to reach for toys, exam-
ple), because he has to.
 The second child may simply be trying to
keep up physically with an older sibling. Your
firstborn didn’t have anyone to chase after —
or to chase him.
Any of these theories may be true, depending
on the household.

It can be very difficult not to compare siblings — in fact, it may be impossible
to never note their differences and similarities. You can, however, keep an
open mind and an even hand when it comes to dealing with each child by
assessing his or her personality traits and specific needs. Your difficult tod-
dler is probably not trying to make you angry, for example — she may just be
looking for more attention.
Also keep in mind as your kids get older that what works as discipline for one
kid may seem like a treat for another, and what helps one child grasp a con-
cept quickly may not help the other at all. Viewing each sibling in the house
as a different person filled with his own unique potential that has nothing to
do with his brothers and sisters can be difficult — but it’s what parents strive
to do in order to raise happy children who end up loving their siblings
instead of competing with them.
Taking on the Grandparents: 
When Rules Collide
You love your parents — you really do. But why do they insist on feeding Baby
ice cream and candy when they baby-sit? You’ve made it very clear that you’re
concerned about milk allergies during the first year, and you don’t want your
9-month-old eating anything laden with fat, sugar, and caffeine. Why can’t they
respect your wishes and follow your rules?
Apparently, the old rules that your parents applied to your own upbringing —
Mother and Father know best — have gone out the window now that you’re
the parent (the rule has now been revised: Grandma and Grandpa can do
whatever they want). They expect that you will still yield to their whims with-
out making much fuss about it. After all, they’re the grandparents, and it’s
their privilege to spoil Baby. They’ll point to your child and say, “Look how
happy he is! You should give him candy more often.”
It’s the dance of the new parents versus the old hands. Not only will some
grandparents (or friends or other relatives) call Baby’s diet into question,
they may also completely ignore your routines surrounding:
 Bedtime: You want Baby in bed at eight o’clock or else he’ll be a bear in
the morning? Your mother wants to visit with the tyke while she’s baby-
sitting, so he’ll get to bed when Grandma is ready to say goodnight to
him — whether that’s at nine o’clock or eleven-thirty.
 Medication: Your sister doesn’t think that Baby looks sick, so she 
doesn’t give him the antibiotic you left behind (along with specific
dosing instructions).
211
Chapter 14: The Ninth Month: Grabbing Your Attention (With Intention)

 Appropriate clothing: Your dad took Baby to the park in February with-
out putting mittens on your child. He says it was warm enough to go
without; you’re checking for signs of frostbite.
 Bathtime: It’s part of Baby’s bedtime routine, but your parents thought
that Baby looked clean enough and put him to bed without a thorough
cleansing.
 Allowing pets near the child: Your aunt swears that her dog is harmless
and allows the animal to sniff Baby while she holds your child.
 Hygiene issues: Your mother-in-law thinks the way you clean Baby’s
hands with a baby wipe before he eats is ridiculous. She lets you know
that she never did that for her kids — and you know she doesn’t do it for
yours when he’s visiting at her house without you.
How do you deal with these issues? Surely these people are wrong to disre-
gard your rules concerning your own child — but do you really want to insti-
gate what could be a drawn-out fight over a few pieces of chocolate? (Keep in
mind that some grandparents become very offended if their judgment is
called into question — never mind that by ignoring your wishes, they’re
putting your judgment under the microscope.)
First, rate each issue in order of importance. It wouldn’t have hurt your father
to put mittens on Baby — but maybe he couldn’t find them, or maybe — just
maybe — it really was warm enough for Baby to go barehanded. No permanent
damage is done, and it’s best to let this incident go. Next time your dad is plan-
ning an outing with your child, make sure you hand him the mittens and say,
“You know how I worry. Please put his mittens on him when he goes outside.”
You’re telling him that you’re concerned for your child and that this isn’t some
arbitrary rule you’ve created to make Grandpa’s life more difficult.
Matters of scheduling — a skipped bath or a late lunch — are usually random
and won’t affect Baby adversely. These really aren’t worth fighting over. What’s
done is done, and whoever fed Baby late had to suffer the consequences (and
learn the lesson) of dealing with a hungry, cranky child. (The exception to this
is a late bedtime, because you’re the one left to deal with the fallout, in the form
of a crabby kid the following day. This is worth a fight if it happens on a regular
basis.)
Hygiene issues mean a lot more to some parents than to others. Baby’s hands
should be cleaned before he sits down to eat finger foods. He’s been crawling
around on the floor, pulling himself up on everything, and generally exploring
the world through his tactile senses. Wiping his hands before a meal doesn’t
make you obsessive-compulsive; it makes you observant of what he’s been
doing. Do you accept that your mother-in-law isn’t going to wipe Baby’s hands
off, or do you insist on it? If you’re not around to make sure it gets done, realize
that arguing with her could make her that much more defiant on this issue. As
long as he’s not coming home from her house vomiting, you’re probably wise
to look the other way on this particular issue.
212
Part IV: Discovering the World Beyond Mom 

Some issues are completely non-negotiable. If Baby is on some sort of med-
ication, giving it to him is not a debatable whim (will he get it or won’t he?).
Whoever is left in charge of caring for the child needs to understand this and
be given explicit directions as to the timing and administration of the drug.
And pets should always be kept at an arm’s length from Baby, no matter how
docile (and humanlike) their owners believe them to be.
No one wants Baby’s care to cause an irreparable family rift, so before things
get out of hand:
 Assess: Is this issue important enough to argue over, or is it possible
that you can overlook it completely — again and again?
 Plan: If it’s something that isn’t negotiable, think of the nicest way to tell
the offender that this can’t happen again.
 Lay off: You can — and should — check up on matters of importance.
But after you’re convinced that the issue has been resolved, there’s no
need for you to continue to remind your aunt to keep that dog away
from Baby. She gets it.
 Find a new sitter: If things have gotten so out of control that what’s 
happening is effectively a power struggle between you and the errant
sitter, find someone else, no matter what the financial cost. Trusting the
person who is caring for your child is worth every penny you shell out.
What this comes down to in the end is a matter of respect — for your parent-
ing skills and for your position of authority as this child’s parent. No one
should blatantly flout your rules. An occasional slip-up by a caregiver should
be expected and tolerated (because, after all, Grandma is only human), but
an out-and-out debate over what you do and don’t allow your child to eat
shouldn’t really be of concern to anyone else — as long as your child is
healthy and your pediatrician is satisfied with Baby’s progress.

Keeping Up 
with Baby

In this part . . .
I
n the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, Baby makes
huge strides, physically and socially. She’s able to
stand and move around the room, she may be walking by
the time she’s 1 year old, and she’s communicating with
you by using at least a couple of words. She’s walking her
way right into becoming a toddler — and you can’t believe
how fast the year has gone by!
Weaning becomes a concern at this point in time. Tips for
easing the transition off the breast or bottle are given in
this section, along with suggestions for alleviating the
breastfeeding mom’s discomfort during this time. And
because you’ll be planning for Baby’s first birthday soon,
this section includes a list of toys to please your almost-
toddler, along with advice for planning a party that she’s
going to love.

B
aby moves on into the tenth month — literally. He may be standing on
his own two feet now, and perhaps even taking his first steps by the end
of the month. He’s starting to attach real meaning to his words — although he
may have been saying “Mama” and “Dada” before now, during this month, he
definitely begins to understand that people and objects alike have names —
and he starts using them!
Along with comprehending simple directions and the meaning of “no”, your
child will also begin to understand the concept of doing his own thing this
month — what experts refer to as Baby’s autonomy. He’s realizing that not only
is he not physically attached to you (a realization that may have caused him
some distress in the past few months), but that this lack of attachment has
some definite advantages from time to time. For example, Baby doesn’t always
have to do what you say. Though you are well aware that you can force him to
stop pulling on the drapes, he may not immediately comply when you tell him
from across the room to let go of those curtains. He may look at you, look at
the drapes, and decide that yanking on them is a pretty fun way to pass some
time. He’s not really being naughty; he’s just doing what feels right to him at
the time — while simultaneously testing your reaction.
During the tenth month, Baby inches closer and closer to the end of the first
year. He’s eating real foods now, and he may start to show an interest in
sweets. Nipping that habit as soon as it shows signs of starting is important
and is discussed in this chapter, along with tips for keeping the active child
safe — indoors and out.

Checking In with Baby
Most doctors don’t schedule a well-baby visit during the tenth month, so
Baby can sit tight until the 1-year checkup.
During this time in Baby’s development, the 1-year molars may start to erupt,
which can cause intense pain in your child’s jaw and ear — symptoms that
may mimic an ear infection or another virus. If Baby is crabby, bats at her ear,
refuses to eat, has a low-grade fever (just at or below 100 degrees), has runny
stool, and is having trouble sleeping, take a peek at the very back of her
lower jaw — if it’s red and swollen, it’s a good bet that her misery is being
caused by the appearance of those molars.
Pain reliever will help to alleviate Baby’s discomfort as her molars come in.
Speak to the nurse in your doctor’s office for advice on the correct dosage if
you’re unsure about how much medication Baby should be receiving at this
age (and weight).
Soft foods are easiest for a teething Baby to tolerate. Though Baby isn’t quite
ready to handle a Popsicle on her own, you can offer her small chunks of an
icy treat, along with yogurt, gelatin, soup, applesauce, or anything pureed.
Cold foods may be more soothing to her sore gums.
You may be tempted to use a medicated numbing oral gel to soothe baby’s
gums. Many parents find that these gels really don’t seem to work very well —
Baby may still be crying after the gel is applied. Follow the directions on the
tube; if the gel helps Baby, great — but if not, toss it. There’s obviously no point
in using a medication that doesn’t work. Don’t use more than four times daily.
Take care to wipe Baby’s chin as often as you can if she’s drooling a lot.
Constant exposure to saliva can cause some kids to break out in a rash,
which will only add to her discomfort.
If Baby’s symptoms do not seem to be caused by teething, of course, call
your pediatrician so that she can be evaluated in the office.
Milestones this month
During the tenth month, your child’s mobility increases, as does his quest for
autonomy and independence. You may notice that while he’s definitely still a
baby, he’s showing signs of becoming his own little person — a real kid.
Here’s what he may be up to by the end of this month:
 Baby sits as well as you do now — and for as long as he wants.
 He’s crawling or has created his own form of scooting from place to
place. He can balance on just one hand now, which means that he can
reach for objects or pull up while crawling.
218
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

 Your child will be able to crawl up the stairs, but probably won’t be able
to come back down.
 Baby can pull himself up to standing from a seated position or from his
hands and knees.
 He cruises (“walks” by hanging onto objects) around the room like a pro.
 Baby may be able to stand on his own for several minutes. He may be
able to seat himself nicely when he’s finished.
 He’s able to take steps with someone holding both of his hands.
 He may be taking his first small steps on his own.
 His pincer grasp is fully developed now and Baby is able to pick up the
smallest objects with his forefinger and thumb.
 Baby understands the connection between names and people and
objects. When he says “mama” now, he means “Mama.”
 He also comprehends simple phrases and instructions. When you say,
“Show me the ball,” Baby will hold the ball up for you to see.
 Baby loves to mimic others. He may show an interest in combing his
own hair or brushing his own teeth if he sees his parents doing these
things.
 He points to objects of interest or in response to your questions. (If you
ask, “Where is the dog?” Baby will point in Rover’s direction.)
 Baby waves hello and goodbye.
 Baby shows affection for those he holds dear; he may be wary of
strangers.
 Baby understands what “no” means, but he may test his autonomy by
not following your simple directions.
 His singsong babbling continues, though you may be able to pick out a
word or two at this age.
Baby’s developing language skills
Baby’s comprehension of words and their meanings continues to develop
this month. You’ve been giving him the chance to mimic the sounds for
months — now give him the opportunity to truly understand the meaning
behind the words. 
219
Chapter 15: The Tenth Month: Chatting Up Baby

The following practices will help Baby understand language and begin to 
use it:
 Name everything you see, from the window to the floor and from his
head to his toes.
Offer him the names of these things slowly, and wait for a response. His
speech won’t be perfect, but he may be able to mimic part of a word —
“doe” for “window,” or “ha” for “hand,” for example. He may or may not
be ready to move onto more challenging consonants.
 Ask Baby lots of questions throughout the day, and give him a chance 
to respond, whether by babbling, attempting a real word, or by pointing
(which is a nonverbal way to show that he understands what you’re
saying).
 Repeat his words back to him to let him know that you understand what
he’s saying (he’ll be thrilled), and to encourage him to continue trying to
form new words.
 Use picture books to teach Baby common words that he may miss out
on otherwise. You may not have a horse in your home, for example —
but if there’s one in his book, he’s going to learn that word now, along
with many others.
As a child tries unsuccessfully to express himself verbally, he may throw
tantrums due to his frustration. If this happens, show sympathy, and don’t
push Baby to repeat what he’s trying to say. Give it a rest for the time being.
Language, in particular, is a variable milestone — some kids are chatting up 
a storm during the second year, while other, perfectly healthy kids don’t get
around to speaking in sentences until much later. Baby should know and
respond to his own name and be making attempts at babbling — failure to 
do so at this age could indicate a hearing problem. Of course, if you have 
concerns about Baby’s speech (or lack of it), consult your pediatrician.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
She’s here, she’s there . . . wait, where is she?
Of course, Baby is just off playing in her room, or sitting in the closet, or
trying to open the back door. And most times, she’s no worse for the wear
(thanks to your intense baby-proofing plan). But when you realize that she
isn’t where you thought she was — the fear can be paralyzing.
220
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

What can you do to prevent moments like this? You can’t chain her to your
leg, after all. She needs to know that she’s her own person and she’s allowed
to explore the world around her. But she just also needs to understand the
serious limits to what she can and can’t do.
Updating your baby-proofing
You’ve already eliminated a lot of hazards with your baby-proofing — at this
age, you need to double-check:
 Doorknobs and locks: Though most small children can’t manipulate a
doorknob into behaving the way they’d like it to, some can — and some
end up doing so purely by luck or accident. Plastic knob covers make
this an impossibility. Also make sure you don’t have any doors that lock
accidentally, or Baby could be on one side of the bathroom door — with
the toilet, the soaps, and the tub — while you’re frantically trying to get
the entire knob off the door before she hurts herself. Babies can open
lever doors, so be careful if your home has these.
 Cabinets: Opening the cabinets is an easy task for Baby at this age. Keep
hazardous materials completely out of Baby’s reach, but if they’re in a
low cabinet, make sure it has child locks — and that the locks are
secure.
 Climbing tools: Baby may just be clever enough to learn to use one big
toy to climb up to reach a shelf or the TV at this age. Keep stools and big
stuffed animals away from dangerous areas.
 Windows: Make sure that windows are only opened from the top — for
now, and for years to come. Screens pop out easily, and aren’t intended
to protect your child from falling from a window.
 Gates: For rooms that aren’t baby-proofed, the gates should never come
down. Gates also need to remain at both ends of the stairs even after
Baby has learned to crawl up them.
Of course, nothing is a substitute for constant supervision — and every child
needs it. Even children who never show signs of wanting or needing their inde-
pendence should be kept within sight of their parents at this age. You just
never know what a 10-month-old may do. She’s physically capable of moving
from one end of the house to the other. She may understand the meaning of
“Don’t touch” in relation to the TV, for instance — but she doesn’t truly under-
stand that she could be seriously injured if she doesn’t comply with your
order. And she’s naturally curious. Up to this point, she may not have shown a
real interest in getting her hands on the television — but she just may decide
one day to check it out, up close and personal. If you’re not nearby to put the
kibosh on her plan, the results could be disastrous.
221
Chapter 15: The Tenth Month: Chatting Up Baby

The older Baby gets, the more careful you need to be with her safety, until she’s
old enough to understand the inherent dangers of certain activities (like climb-
ing on the windowsill or going outside by herself). And by old enough, we mean
well past the toddler years. Although you don’t need to keep Baby chained to
your hip until she goes off to college, she’ll continue to need supervision right
through preschool (though less than she requires right now).
Staying safe in the great outdoors
When Baby was a tiny infant, you bundled her up, put her in her stroller, and
took her out for some fresh air. There wasn’t much more to her safety than
making sure she was dressed appropriately and buckled into her carriage.
Now that she’s on the move, you need to consider many things, starting with
where you take her.
If the two of you are off for an afternoon at the park, scout out the area care-
fully before you let her loose. Make sure the play area is well-maintained, that
the baby swings aren’t cracked or otherwise falling apart, and that there isn’t
a lot of trash on the ground for Baby to put in her mouth. Let her crawl to her
heart’s content — yes, she’s dirty, but it’s all part of her education about the
world. How will she know what it feels like to crawl in the grass or what it
sounds like to rustle through the leaves if she doesn’t do it?
When visiting the park with Baby, make sure to pack some extra wipes. Even
if you manage to keep her out of the mud, her hands are going to get dirty
elsewhere — and if she’s clamoring for a snack, you want to know that the
only thing she’s eating is the cracker you hand her.
She’s old enough to explore the climbing areas of playground play sets — as
long as you’re right behind her. These sets are usually intended for older chil-
dren and may have high, wide openings. Baby may enjoy a ride down the
slide on your lap — or with you holding her hand if you prefer to send her
only halfway down.
Keep a constant eye on Baby when you’re outdoors. She’s going to be testing
her newfound sense of freedom at this point.
You may notice that she crawls away from you and then looks back to see
where you are, what you have to say, and whether you’re following. This is
her way of testing her autonomy. She’s her own person, under her own con-
trol (or so she thinks), and if she chooses to crawl back to you, she will.
Otherwise, she’s just waiting to see what you do. Don’t be surprised if you
call her back to you and she moves in the opposite direction. It’s just her
innate sense of freedom (and joy) calling her.
222
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Water safety
If you live near a beach or swimming pool and you’re planning on taking the
plunge, call ahead to ask what type of floatation devices are allowed. (Some
swimming areas only allow children to wear floatation vests.) Though Baby
won’t be diving into the deep water just yet, she should always have some
sort of floating device whenever she’s near the water — even if you’re hold-
ing her. If she slips out of your arms for some reason while you’re swimming
at the lake, you’ll know exactly where she is — as long as you’ve made sure
she’s buoyant.
Floatation devices are meant to be used in conjunction with constant adult
supervision. Babies — and children — should never be allowed to play in or
around water without a parent or another adult nearby. An adult should
always be close enough to reach out and grab a child in the water on a
moment’s notice — or, even better, have one hand on the child at all times.
If you have a pool or frequently visit someone who does, you may wonder
whether swimming lessons are a good idea for Baby. We’ve all seen pictures
of tiny little infants learning to swim — but are they really swimming or are
they just doing something that’s little more than a reflexive action? And are
they safer in the water than other kids?
There’s nothing wrong with taking your child in the water and even enrolling
her in a “baby swim” class — in fact, if she’s always loved her bath and is a
very active child, she may love having the chance to splash away. Very young
children can learn to swim short distances (even underwater!), but most
pediatricians recommend waiting until a child is 4 years old before introduc-
ing her to formal swim classes. At that age, she’ll be physically ready to learn
the movements — and dangers — associated with swimming.
A child who is given formal swim lessons during the toddler years may not
develop a healthy fear of the water — something that every child should
have.
Swimming with your child may be a soothing or stimulating experience for
both of you — and something you just love to do. The problem with allowing
young babies to take swim classes is that parents sometimes get a false sense
of security concerning the child and water. That is, because their baby can
paddle underwater a short distance, some parents assume that even if their
child were to fall into a pool, she wouldn’t drown. That’s just not so. No child
is ever completely safe from drowning. No matter how old your children are
or whether they’ve had formal training to swim, you should always keep the
gate around your pool locked up tight and use a pool alarm (one that sounds
if anything or anyone falls into the water).
223
Chapter 15: The Tenth Month: Chatting Up Baby

Feeling the effects of Baby’s mobility
Chasing after a child while simultaneously being on the lookout for danger is
exhausting. It’s also a challenge to your sanity, because you find yourself
looking for hazards everywhere you go. As Baby moves toward becoming a
toddler, this is simply what life brings. You’ll probably move toward a place
of acceptance — looking for and removing hidden hazards from Baby’s reach
just becomes a normal part of your day — but you’ll definitely be doing more
of it in the next few years and beyond.
After you have a child, you will never again look at the world in the same way.
You’ve always loved the beach, but now you see that the ocean is dangerous —
to your child. You love a good hike in the woods, but now you worry about
wild animals and the weather — and how these things will affect your child.
Parents start to see — actually envision, as though they were real — the worst-
case scenarios in any given setting.
It’s easy to give into these fears, to throw your hands up and say, “Well, that’s
it. We can’t go anywhere. The world is unsafe.” But you’d be doing your entire
family a huge disservice, and Baby will lose out on a lot of exciting new expe-
riences if she’s never allowed to leave home. Realize that yes, dangers are out
there — but you can minimize them, at the very least, and even eliminate
them in many cases. For more on getting out of the house with Baby, see
Chapter 3.
Keeping the very active child 
safe without losing your mind
All of this advice is little comfort to the parent of an incredibly active almost-
10-month-old — the child who has already learned to hoist himself up on the
kitchen chairs in order to gain access to whatever goodies may be laid out for
him on the table; the child who has already mastered the art of walking and
spends his days wandering around the house and yard, making it necessary
for you to follow behind (and simultaneously making it impossible for you to
get anything done); the child who hates (and does his best to fight) being
confined to a car seat or a crib and who certainly won’t agree to being placed
in his playpen anymore. The parents of this child may be beyond exhausted.
They may just be on the verge of burnout. Day after day of doing nothing but
following after an active almost-toddler does that to a person.
An active child needs to have a safe area of the house to play in — an area
that is set up for him to jump and climb to his heart’s content without the
risk of injury. Consider using old couch cushions or even bringing a small
224
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

jungle gym into the house to amuse your little gymnast — and to prevent him
from exploring less safe options (like climbing on your bookshelves). You can
also buy gymnastics mats that fold up for storage.
If your child needs to be on the go-go-go all the time, look for a playgroup or 
a baby exercise class for the two of you. Because your child is a natural-born
explorer, Baby may benefit immensely from the interaction with other kids
(whom he will probably find incredibly interesting), and you’ll benefit from
talking with other parents of tireless, active children (and there’s bound to 
be at least one other child in the group whose energy level meets your kid’s).
You may even see a new side of your child’s personality come to life, as he
starts showing affection to his little playmates.
A playgroup or a Baby exercise class is also a nice change of scenery from
being at home all day. Baby will have the chance to explore new territory,
which may have two benefits: It may be just the thing to tire him out, and it
may make him less apt to get into trouble at home, where he’s become so
comfortable and used to his surroundings that his curiosity drives him to
explore even more (which is a good thing, of course, except when he’s driving
you crazy in the process).
Harnessing the Power of “No”
Baby may start telling you “no” at about this point, and you may not find this
development entirely pleasing. It may be cute the way Baby has taken your
phrase of admonishment and made it his own; you may be secretly proud
that he’s smart enough to turn the tables on you, but you may also be a bit
worried that he’s developing a bit of a stubborn streak. How should you
handle a 10-month-old who loves to say “no” to you?
You may be saying “no” more often than you realize, and really, it’s only nat-
ural at this point. Baby is becoming more active, and her curious bent leads
her into more and more situations that aren’t safe or appropriate for her.
Suddenly, you’re faced with teaching her right from wrong, safe from unsafe,
and the easiest way to do this is to stop an inappropriate activity when you
see it happening — by saying, “No, no.”
Cutting back on “no”
You don’t want Baby to grow up constantly hearing what she isn’t allowed to
do. Put yourself in her tiny little shoes for a minute and pretend you’re a curi-
ous little imp who’s constantly being commanded to stop whatever you’re
doing. It’s far more pleasant to hear (and therefore to learn) what is allowed.

Here are some ways to minimize your use of the word “no:”
 Offer Baby praise when she’s doing something that you approve of.
Whether she’s playing nicely, or eating her finger foods without throwing
them on the floor, positive reinforcement is a powerful teaching tool.
 Physically remove or distract her from an activity instead of just using
the word “no.” Is she wearing your glasses? Take them out of her hand
and give her a toy that she can play with.
 Eliminate the need for “no” — at least in some instances. If you don’t
want her playing with your glasses, for example, don’t leave them where
she can find them.
 Reserve “no” for the most important and/or dangerous situations. A
child who hears “no” all day long becomes immune to its meaning. She
learns to go about her business while ignoring your “no,” even when you
really mean it.
 Don’t say “no” in a singsong voice, like you don’t really mean it. “No”
means “no” and it should be stated firmly when you need to use it.
Of course, you can’t remove “no” from your vocabulary. You have limits in
your household, and rightly so. Baby needs to hear “no” from time to time to
know that she can’t do anything and everything that she wants to. “No”
means that you are looking out for her, that you are on top of things, that her
safety is your number one concern.
Defusing stubbornness
Baby needs to know that she is a little person worthy of praise and acco-
lades — and not just someone who is constantly involved in things that she
shouldn’t be doing. Although children this age can often get themselves
involved in less-than-admirable activities (learning to remove a full diaper
certainly qualifies as one of these activities, as does licking the floor), parents
have to remember that these behaviors arise from simple curiosity — at least
in the beginning.
But back up for just for a minute. Throughout this chapter, we’ve been dis-
cussing Baby’s increasing sense of self — her autonomy. This is the reason
she’s comfortable doing more and more on her own: Because she can. Though
it’s not very common for children this age to become locked in a power strug-
gle with their parents, it does happen from time to time. The more you say
“no” to a child who is bound and determined to do her own thing, the more
likely she is to continue doing it. (You don’t like removal of the dirty diaper?
Well, that just makes it all the more appealing — or funny — to her.)
226
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Using diversionary tactics is a great way to distract a child who uses her own
“no” as a way of testing her power with you. By responding to her with anger,
you either scare her half to death or ensure that the behavior will continue —
and both of you lose in the end. Next time she’s pulling at the tabs of her
diaper, consider that perhaps she finds a dirty diaper very uncomfortable.
Change her — and don’t put it off. If it turns out that she’s removing the
diaper just because it’s amusing, make it impossible for her to do so by dress-
ing her in one-piece outfits.
Find the source of the power struggle and eliminate it right away — and you
may find that you’re eliminating a lot of your “no’s” throughout the day, as
well.
Making “no” really count
When it is necessary for you to use a firm “no” with Baby — for example,
when he’s managed to climb on the couch and is about to dump the cup of
coffee you left on the table there — follow through with a teaching lesson 
so that he understands that you aren’t angry, but that you are concerned
about his well-being.
In the case of the child who is about to reach for a cup of coffee:
1. Stop him in his tracks with a loud, stern warning.
2. Remove the cup from his reach.
3. Take the time to teach him two important concepts: “hot” and “burn.”
(Or “ouch” or whatever word you feel fits best here.) Take his index
finger and lightly touch it to the side of your coffee cup to teach him
“hot.”
Don’t do this if the coffee is scalding hot — lukewarm is safest. You don’t
want to teach him about burns by accidentally giving him one.
Consider the difference between simply telling him “no” and teaching him the
reasoning behind the “no.” In one case, he’s been saved from a burn — this
time. In the other, he’s learning not to touch Mom’s coffee cups because he
could get hurt. (Of course, you should keep those cups completely out of his
reach anyway.) He’s also learning the meaning behind the word “hot.” You
can transfer this concept to teaching him to keep away from the stove and
teaching him not to touch the faucet in the bathtub.
227
Chapter 15: The Tenth Month: Chatting Up Baby

Feeding Your 10-Month-Old
By now, Baby has sampled a veritable buffet of solids. Because he likely has a
couple of teeth at this age, you may be tempted to give him harder-to-chew
foods, like pieces of apple or chunks of meat. Remember that he is still rely-
ing on his gums to do the work, so keep his foods semi-soft and small enough
to prevent choking.
Foods that you should avoid feeding to Baby at this age include:
 Honey (which may contain botulinum — spores which can cause 
botulism)
 Cow’s milk (which can cause a milk allergy or inflammation of the gas-
trointestinal tract if introduced during the first year)
 Egg whites (some children show a severe reaction to the whites at 
this age)
 Strawberries
 Shellfish, which can cause severe allergic reactions
 Peanuts — peanuts and any peanut-containing products should 
actually be avoided for two years according to current allergist 
recommendations
Chapters 11 and 18 discuss food allergies in more detail.
Otherwise, Baby’s meals are probably starting to be similar to your own —
although his foods are minced, mashed, or pureed versions of what you and
the rest of the family are eating. Baby is still consuming about four 6-ounce
servings of formula or breast milk at this age (including whatever his cereal is
being mixed with). His schedule may look something like this:
 Breakfast: Baby will be starting the day off with a serving of iron-
fortified cereal, and topping that off with a nursing session or a bottle 
of formula.
 Midmorning snack: Half a jar of fruit or a handful of cereal, perhaps.
 Lunch: May consist of half a jar of prepared baby food along with some
finger foods and 1⁄2 cup of fruit juice.
 Snack when he wakes up from his nap: A bit of cheese, yogurt, or a
bagel along with a bottle.
228
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

 Dinner: He’s probably having whatever you’ve made for everyone else
in smaller, mashed or minced portions. Offer him a balanced meal of
meat, starch (bread or pasta), and vegetables and allow him to eat as
much or as little as he wants.
 Bedtime feeding: He’s ready to nurse or suck down a bottle. He tops off
the day with another serving of cereal.
Basically, you want to strive for a healthy balance of foods at this age as well
as a good variety. A 10-month-old needs about 2 to 4 tablespoons of protein
foods a day (most meats provide a good amount of protein, as do legumes,
fish, cheese, and egg yolk). His iron-fortified cereal prevents anemia.
By and large, babies know when to say when, and when to continue chowing
down. However, if you’re worried that Baby isn’t eating enough, or that he’s
eating far too much, make sure to ask your pediatrician for his take on the
matter. He can assess Baby’s weight and growth patterns and let you know
whether you’re right to be concerned.
Baby should continue on his normal growth pattern, falling roughly in the
same percentiles for height and weight at each checkup. If he’s falling behind
and he never wants to eat, your pediatrician may want you to cut back on
Baby’s formula or nursing sessions. If Baby is still hovering around the same
percentile for his height but his weight percentile takes a huge leap, your
pediatrician may want to know what, exactly, your child has been eating.
Continue to offer Baby new foods one at a time — and allow four to five days
between introducing foods. This way you can watch for any adverse reactions
(a rash, cramps, diarrhea, itchy or watery eyes) and know exactly which food
has caused it. Providing Baby with a variety of new tastes at this age will hope-
fully translate into healthy eating habits when he’s a toddler — and less likely
to comply with your mealtime wishes. (If he’s been eating carrots all along,
he’s less likely to balk at them a year from now.)
Avoiding food fights
Some kids aren’t big eaters — or eager eaters. Ideally, introducing Baby to
new foods during the second half of the first year creates enough of a novelty
that he’s just excited to sit in his highchair and taste the culinary delights
you’ve prepared for him. Sometimes, a 9- or 10-month-old is just too busy to
be bothered with much of a meal. Rarely, a child this age may show a definite
preference for certain foods — and an abhorrence for others.
229
Chapter 15: The Tenth Month: Chatting Up Baby

There are two things that you can do to prevent “food fights” between you
and your baby. First, keep the sweets and junk foods to a minimum. Think
about it: Why do older kids and adults love chips, doughnuts, and candy?
Because they taste good — and, as far as most of us are concerned — they
taste much better than, say, carrots. Don’t encourage Baby to develop a taste
for candy and grease. If your child is already hooked on a diet loaded with
sugar and fat, you’re going to have a heck of a time convincing him that a
sweet potato is delicious. (If you’re wondering if you need to deprive Baby 
of sweets altogether, the answer is no. Fruits are a wonderful, healthy choice
for dessert, not only during the first year, but throughout childhood and
beyond.)
Secondly, don’t ever force your child to eat. He should be his own regulator
where food is concerned. You may want to teach him that “dinner” is a spe-
cial block of time when you all sit down together as a family. That’s fine —
just keep in mind that Baby may be far more interested in getting back to his
blocks than in eating the chicken you’ve minced for him. Have realistic expec-
tations of the child. If he’s not interested in eating, don’t make him sit for 30
minutes while you and your spouse catch up on your respective days. And
realize that he’s a fickle little thing. He may just love carrots this week only 
to refuse them next week. Offer him something that he finds palatable at this
point in time and work those carrots back into his food repertoire in a couple
of weeks.
Don’t make Baby stay in his highchair until he’s eaten the food you’ve laid out
before him. This is a fight you shouldn’t even start. Forcing your child to eat
even when he clearly isn’t hungry ebbs away part of his autonomy. Because
every person has an internal feeling that tells us when we’ve had enough, it’s
risky to try and judge when someone else is full. Allowing Baby to decide how
much he’s going to eat in one sitting allows him to get used to that “I’m full”
signal that tells him when he doesn’t need any more. Forcing him to eat more
than he can comfortably stomach may lead to him ignoring that signal, putting
him at risk for becoming overweight or developing life-long issues with food.
Sit him in his highchair for 10 to 15 minutes for the meal, and then let him
down if he’s done. Don’t have books and toys at the table. Concentrate on 
the meal, and then let him go play. Try not to have him in his highchair while
preparing the meal — he’ll already be tired of being in the chair when it’s 
time to eat.
Combating childhood obesity
Several decades ago, a child in elementary school could name the overweight
kids in the school — because there weren’t that many. Today, parents walk
into their kids’ schools and notice that the children seem, well, larger than
the kids from the 1970s and 1980s.
230
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

One of the biggest problems facing kids today is childhood obesity. And
although it’s perfectly normal — and healthy — for Baby to be a little butter-
ball during his first year, the eating habits he establishes now could very well
determine whether he ends up being plump throughout his school days and
beyond. It’s not up to Baby to decide which foods he’s given at meals and
during snack times. It’s your responsibility to make those choices for him —
and to make the healthiest selections possible.
All foods aren’t created equally, healthwise. A banana is a much healthier
snack than a cookie, for example, even though they may have the same
amount of calories. The cookie provides Baby with little more than a sugar
rush; the banana is providing him with potassium and fiber, two essential
nutrients for a growing child.
In theory, kids should be able to burn off that excess weight as they grow taller
and become more active. The problem in today’s world is that kids just aren’t
very active. Twenty years ago, children came home and played outside after
school. Today’s kids play video games for hours on end. They chat online with
each other. They watch a lot of TV. There’s not a lot of opportunity for these
children to burn off any excess weight they’re dragging around. The earlier
they put on weight, the harder it may be for them to lose it, because eating
habits can be incredibly difficult for a child to change — plus, the more weight
kids gain, the harder it is for them to do anything about it.
Childhood obesity can lead to a myriad of problems, among them:
 Low self-esteem
 Diabetes
 Sleep apnea
 Knee and hip problems
And we’re not talking about these problems surfacing in adulthood. These
are issues that overweight kids deal with as children.
On the other hand, Baby needs to eat as much as he wants at this age, so cut-
ting back on the amount of food he’s given isn’t a good idea. Remember, he has
a built-in shut-off switch to tell him when he’s full. Don’t mess with that. Allow
Baby to eat to his heart’s content so that he can recognize the feeling of being
full. Kids who aren’t allowed to make this determination on their own (whose
parents either stuff them or dole out scanty portions of food to their hungry
children) are more likely to develop weight problems later in childhood, when
Mom and Dad aren’t there to watch every morsel that passes the kid’s lips.
These kids simply aren’t able to recognize when they need to eat, or how much
food is enough, and they’re prone to overeating for these reasons.
231
Chapter 15: The Tenth Month: Chatting Up Baby

Help your child develop healthy eating patterns that will benefit him for a life-
time by doing the following:
 Be a good example. Don’t expect your child to sit down to a healthy
meal of minced grilled chicken breast and pureed veggies if you’ve
served yourself a heaping plate of fried chicken and French fries.
Prepare your own meals at home as much as possible. Fast food and
many frozen prepared meals are loaded with fat and sodium.
 Look for ways to cut the fat. Preparing low-fat meals for the entire family
has never been easier. There are so many organic and low-fat products in
the supermarket these days that all it takes to make the switch is to reach
for the fat-free mayo instead of the heavy-duty stuff. Getting used to the
low-fat taste may take some time, but after you do, you never want to go
back to regular.
 Eliminate sugary drinks. Although it’s all right to give Baby diluted fruit
juice once in a while, he shouldn’t be drinking an entire jug of it daily.
Soda should be outlawed in your home. It’s one of the leading causes of
obesity and tooth decay in children.
 Turn off the tube. Get baby outside as much as possible — or, if you
happen to be snowbound for months on end, get him to an indoor play-
group as often as you can. At the very least, set up a safe area in your
home where Baby can be as active as he needs to be. Allowing him to
become hooked on TV at this age may set a dangerous precedent for 
his entire lifetime (he’s less likely to get any exercise and more likely 
to mindlessly consume snacks in front of the tube in years to come).
 Don’t use food for comfort or as a reward or diversion. If Baby bumps
his elbow, he doesn’t need a brownie to make it all better. You don’t
need to distract him from pounding on the piano by offering him a
cookie. He should be learning to associate food with hunger, not with
other behaviors.
 Don’t deny food. On the other hand, don’t withhold food as punishment.
If Baby is throwing food from his tray, you have every right to take him
out of his highchair until he’s ready to eat nicely. But when he’s a toddler
and he smacks your mother, don’t send him to his room without dinner.
He needs his nourishment. Meals are not a negotiable part of childhood.
Eating healthfully is a commitment that the entire family needs to make
together — and it doesn’t have to include a promise to never ingest another
piece of candy in your collective lifetime. Just grilling your meat instead of
frying it is a healthy change. Allowing Baby to have one treat instead of three
is another. Live by the motto “Everything in moderation” where food is con-
cerned, and you’ll find that making the changes to healthier eating habits
isn’t as difficult — or as overwhelming — as it may seem.

here has the time gone? The first year flies by in what seems like a
nanosecond, and before you know it, your little one is running out of
your reach, exploring new things by himself, saying a few words, and becom-
ing his own person.
Changes are in store for you at this point, too. As your child becomes more
and more independent, you may miss those days not so long ago where he
would stay in your arms until you put him down. Baby’s becoming quite the
active little person these days, and he may seem to be changing and growing
as you watch. Read on to find out what’s in store for both of you during this
time of transformation.
Checking In with Baby
Most pediatricians don’t schedule a well-baby checkup this month, so Baby’s
off the hook for another month. As he becomes more and more active (and
possibly injury-prone), though, and is exposed to germs through daycare or
playgroups, you may find yourself in the doctor’s office anyway.
If you do have to make an unscheduled trip to the doctor’s office, make sure
you ask your pediatrician any questions you may have about Baby’s injury or
illness. When the doctor is giving you advice or instructions, have a pen and

pad handy to write them down. Caring for a sick child can be confusing at
times, especially if you’re losing sleep and not quite as sharp as you normally
are. Writing down the information and repeating it back to the doctor or
nurse ensures that you’ve gotten it right.
Of course, if you feel as though you missed something, or new issues with an
illness or injury pop up, call your doctor’s office. Always choose to be safe
instead of sorry.
Milestones this month
What kind of milestones does Baby hit by the end of this month?
 She’s able to stand on her own, either for a short time or for several 
minutes.
 Baby cruises (“walks” by hanging onto furniture or other sturdy objects)
like a champ.
 She may be taking her first tentative steps or may even be able to walk
well (by the end of the month).
 Roll a ball to her, and she’s able to roll it back to you.
 She can feed herself finger foods and drink from a cup independently.
 Baby can now pick up very small objects.
 Baby is able to follow simple instructions (“Come here,” “Don’t touch,”
and so on).
 She can say “Mama” or “Dada” with meaning.
 May be able to say at least one or two other words.
 Can indicate her wants either by pointing or by grunting or using her own
made-up words. (She may even talk to herself in her own language at this
age, which she understands completely, although you probably won’t.)
 Mimics expressions and movements of others.
 May love to drop things so you’ll pick them up (which is indicative of a
growing sense of object permanence — and a little sense of humor).
 Engages in parallel play with others. (Baby plays next to other kids, but
not with them yet.)
 Understands the word “no.”
234
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Planning ahead
An interesting thing happens to babies in the last few months of the first year:
Their brains kick into overdrive, and they’re able to figure out how to get what
they want by planning ahead, which means you may see the gears turning in
your child’s little head sometimes as she thinks, “Hmm . . . If I want to see Mom
during my naptime, all I have to do is climb out of this crib.” Or she may pick
up a long, skinny toy to reach something that’s up on a shelf. She may lead you
to something she wants, like to the refrigerator for a drink, or to the front door
to go outside to play. (Yes, you have a little smarty on your hands!)
With this ability to think logically comes the potential for Baby to get herself
into some trouble (climbers at this age aren’t thinking first and foremost about
their own safety, for example). Keeping one step ahead of the clever almost-
toddler takes some planning of your own, something we discuss in the next
section.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
Although a baby this age is capable of some rudimentary reasoning, he’s not
old enough to fully appreciate the consequences of his actions. As your
seemingly fearless child becomes more and more active, you may find that
the best investment you can make is in a good pair of running shoes, because
chasing after Baby seems to take up the bulk of each day. Even the most mild-
mannered babies (those who are content to sit right on the blanket they were
placed on, playing nicely with their toys) can sometimes surprise their care-
givers by engaging in a dangerous activity (exploring the back of the TV, for
example).
The differences among children become more pronounced at this age. Some
just can’t sit still; others never need to venture any further than where they’re
placed by Mom. The most important thing to remember about an active child
is that he’s simply programmed to be this way. He isn’t naughty, and he isn’t
trying to drive you crazy. He’s simply exploring his world the only way he
knows how: by doing. (Hey, you’re getting some exercise by chasing him, and
he’s learning new things every day, so there are definite benefits to having a
busy kid.)
Double-check your past baby-proofing efforts and make sure they’re toddler-
proof. Look for things Baby can reach while standing and for tools he can use
to reach even higher.
235
Chapter 16: The Eleventh Month: Walking the Walk

Curbing crib climbers
Naptime can become a real battle when Baby decides she’d rather scale the
side of the crib than sleep in it. She’s less than 1 year old, so she isn’t ready
to give up her daytime rest yet, but active children sometimes have a tough
time settling down for a nap.
If you have a child who finds it difficult to switch gears and go from playtime
to rest time just because it’s one o’clock, stop playtime 15 minutes before her
nap and institute some transition time:
 Read a story with her.
 Turn on soothing music in her play area, where she can listen to it and
relax a bit before turning in.
 Put away the noisiest toys.
 Steer clear of activity that may rile her up — no chasing the cat or tickle
sessions with Dad.
By the time you put her in her crib, she may just decide that climbing out
isn’t worth it, now that she’s had a head start on her rest time.
If Baby still doesn’t settle down, she may be feeling frightened in her crib all
by herself. You can try a small stuffed animal or another comfort measure.
Rub her back for a minute before leaving her, or turn on some soft music, if
that helps. If she’s climbing out of her crib because she simply doesn’t want
to be there, though, or because she thinks it’s fun (notice the big grin on her
face when she appears in the doorway of the kitchen?), a stuffed animal isn’t
going to help matters.
If she’s still determined to get out of that crib, take a look at her sleeping set-
up to determine whether escape is just too easy. Just because she’s capable
of climbing out of the crib right now doesn’t mean that you can’t make it a bit
more difficult: Make sure the mattress is moved to its lowest level. Check to
see that the rails are at their highest level. Is she using a crib toy or bumper
pad to climb on? Get rid of them.
Don’t move her to a toddler bed just yet. She’s not quite ready for that kind 
of independence (and neither are you). Invest in a tentlike attachment for the
top of her crib. (See Figure 16-1.) They’re made specifically for this purpose.
Baby will be hopping mad when you put her in there, especially if she’s really
been enjoying her liberty at naptime, but remember: She’s probably not
ready to give up her nap, and this is the safest way to corral her.
236
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Reining in roaming babies
A baby closing in on 11 months is a very curious creature: He wants to know
more, see more, do more. By extension, he’s highly distractible, especially in
new or interesting situations. He may not see the steps going down to the
yard as he chases a butterfly. He may not realize how far toward your prop-
erty line he’s wandered in pursuit of a squirrel.
Fortunately, wandering off doesn’t become a real issue for most children until
the toddler years (which, by the way, are right around the corner) — because
parents are so vigilant with little ones. Also, most children under 1 year tend
to stick pretty close to their caregivers; they’re still leery of strangers, and
they like the security of having Mom or Dad nearby. Still, a few nearly-1-year-
olds pull the disappearing act in the house or in the yard, making their par-
ents prematurely gray.
Children this age, whether they’re very active and constantly on the move 
or content to be by your side, need constant adult supervision. Don’t ever
assume your job is done when it comes to baby-proofing. Check and recheck
your baby-proofing measures (see Chapter 20) to make sure nothing has
changed or come undone. (Did someone uncover an outlet and forget about
it? Are the drapery cords up high, out of Baby’s reach? Has someone dropped
loose change where Baby can pop it into his mouth?) Because Baby has the
capacity to climb (or will very soon), make sure that all furniture and over-
head items are secure.

237
Chapter 16: The Eleventh Month: Walking the Walk

Got a real climber or jumper on your hands? Create a safe space for your
little acrobat. Use old couch cushions or a foam interlocking floor. Your main
goal is to let this child expend his energy without hurting himself.
Paranoia? Perhaps. But a teeny dose of paranoia and overprotectiveness can
go a long way toward preventing injury to your child. Going to the extreme —
managing every move he makes, hovering over him as he explores the great
outdoors — isn’t healthy, for him or for you. Vigilance and common sense are
the keys to keeping Baby safe while giving him a bit of freedom.
Weaning Baby off the Bottle or Breast
Before you know what’s happened, Baby’s first birthday is coming down the
tracks like a speeding train. This is about the time when your pediatrician
will probably recommend weaning Baby from the breast or bottle. Not only
does Baby need nutrition from other sources at this age, but weaning him at
close to 1 year will be much easier than attempting to remove his bottle (or
your breasts) from his grasp during the toddler years. Tips for making this
process easier on both of you are included in this section, along with a look
at how a nursing mom’s body may change during and after weaning. For a
more complete look at breastfeeding and weaning, check out Breastfeeding
For Dummies by Sharon Perkins and Carol Vannais (Wiley).
Don’t try to wean Baby from his bottle (or cut him off the breast cold turkey)
the same week you’re moving into a new house, or right after you’ve switched
his day care or nanny. It may seem logical to throw him two curveballs at once
and get it all over with (thinking that maybe he’ll even forget about his bottle
when he’s in this new situation). That’s probably not going to be the case. A
change in his normal routine is a big deal to the 11-month-old, even if he seems
complacent about it. More likely than not, he’s going to need some extra com-
forting measures during a major change in his life, and if he gets it from his
bottle, then so be it. Wait until he’s made the adjustment before attempting to
make the bottle disappear for good.
Doctors recommend weaning Baby from breast and/or bottle when he’s
about 1 year old to prevent the possibility of baby bottle mouth: Breast milk
and formula contain enough sugar to create cavities in Baby’s developing
teeth, which could cause him a lifetime of dental problems. (For more on
baby bottle mouth, see Chapter 11.)
Stopping breastfeeding
When Baby can scarcely spare time out of his busy daytime activity schedule
to nurse, and/or when you start to view nursing him as more of a chore and
238
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

less of a special bonding time between the two of you (perhaps because he’s
so fidgety and reluctant to nurse), you should think about weaning the child.
Many doctors recommend weaning at about the 1-year mark, citing Baby’s
need for increased independence and the decreasing benefits of mother’s
milk. Some moms find that their children self-wean, little by little, as they
become more interested in the world around them (leaving little time for 
cuddling with Mom); some mothers find that after a year of nursing and 
the nine months of pregnancy preceding Baby’s arrival they just want their
bodies back.
Weaning can be a time of intense emotional upheaval, even if you know that
Baby isn’t all that interested in nursing anymore. Letting go of nursing entails
breaking a bond between yourself and your child, and even if you’re mostly
ready for it, the break can still be a little sad. Weaning ushers in a whole new
era, one where Baby isn’t physically dependent on you. Even though you’re
excited by every one of his newest accomplishments, each one takes him fur-
ther out of babyhood.
Don’t wean an older baby from the breast to the bottle. You’re just creating
another habit to break him of. If he’s old enough to hold a cup, wean him
directly to it.
Taking a gradual approach
Most moms and their babies are able to gradually cut back on nursing —
over a period of weeks or even months — and do it naturally, as the child’s
demand (or lack of demand) for nursing dictates. Daytime feedings are usu-
ally the first to go, one by one, little by little. You may notice that Baby is
most eager to nurse before his nap and before bedtime. Because sucking
soothes him and settles him down for a long rest, these feedings are usually
the last vestments of what used to be a round-the-clock nursing schedule.
These feedings may gradually decrease in length, until Baby’s only sucking
for a few minutes before he’s ready to turn in. This is a good indication that
he may be ready to give it up all together and only cuddle with you before
settling into his crib.
Putting Baby into her crib without nursing her for the first time may seem
strange. Rest assured, she’ll suffer no long-term effects being weaned from
the breast. It’s a natural step in her life — and in yours, too — no matter how
sad it seems to you right now.
Don’t stop nursing cold turkey. Not only can this upset your child, it can also
cause you considerable discomfort and increase your risk of developing a
breast infection or clogged milk ducts. Abruptly weaning your child from the
breast could cause a significant hormonal crash for you. A sudden decrease
239
Chapter 16: The Eleventh Month: Walking the Walk

in prolactin (a hormone that stimulates milk production and lifts your mood)
can seriously affect your mood, especially when coupled with the mild anxi-
ety and sadness that often accompany the weaning process. If you’re prone
to depression, wean your breastfed child as gradually as possible. This will
give your body plenty of time to adjust to the decreasing levels of prolactin
and will help to prevent a major mood plunge.
If you’re ready to give up nursing at night and you’re not opposed to paci-
fiers, offer one to Baby at these times. Combined with a good snuggling ses-
sion, this may be all she needs to prepare herself for sleep at this point.
Remember that the sugar from breast milk will stay on baby’s teeth all night
and can cause tooth decay. If you nurse to sleep, wipe baby’s teeth with a wet
washcloth before putting her to bed for the night.
Don’t panic if Baby shows no signs of giving up these final nursing sessions.
Although many doctors suggest weaning Baby around the age of 1 year, most
won’t bat an eye at your comforting your child in this way before she drifts
off. If she’s not ready at 12 months, she may be ready at 13 or 14 months; pay
attention to her signals. If she doesn’t cut the nursing back on her own, do it
for her. Keep track of how long she nurses before her naps and subtract a
minute every few days. Then do the same thing with her nighttime nursing.
Decreasing your discomfort
The discomfort you experience during weaning won’t even come close to
what you went through when your milk came in. Your breasts may be a bit
sore and engorged at times, but this varies from woman to woman, and also
depends on how gradual your weaning schedule is. The discomfort may be
more significant for the mom who is actively cutting out one feeding every
few days than for the mom who has been slowly tapering off Baby’s feedings
for several weeks.
Here are some tips to help you alleviate the discomfort of weaning:
 Take a pain reliever, like acetaminophen.
 Express some milk if you need to. Engorged, sore breasts are more
likely to become infected or develop clogged ducts. Try not to express
any more milk than you absolutely must: If you pump regularly (and con-
tinue the demand), the supply will continue.
 Cut back on the sodium. Salty foods encourage fluid retention, and
you’ll notice it most in your breasts right now. Remember, too, that if
you haven’t had your period the entire time you’ve been nursing, it’ll be
returning soon. If you’re prone to bloating during your menses, you have
all the more motivation to cut back on the salt.
240
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Although you should decrease your sodium while weaning your child to
prevent water retention, don’t cut back on your fluid intake. Dehydrating
yourself isn’t going to do you or Baby much good, and it’s not a very
effective way to slow milk production, anyway.
 Step into a warm shower. The heat will soothe sore breasts and you can
also express a bit of milk as you bathe.
 Wear a supportive bra, but make sure it’s not too tight. Have your
nursing pads on hand, because you may leak.
 Try drinking sage tea, which contains an ingredient that some wean-
ing moms swear helps to dry up breast milk. Two to three cups a day,
one about every six hours, is the recommended dosage.
 Wrap your breasts in raw, cold cabbage leaves. This home remedy has
been passed along for generations, though no scientific explanation
exists to explain why it helps to alleviate the engorgement associated
with weaning. You need a fresh head of green cabbage. Wash the leaves,
dry them, and put them in your fridge. After they’re cool, wrap one leaf
around each breast, positioning them so that they’re comfortable and
soothing. Leave them on all day if they help, but change them when they
start drooping (the leaves, not your breasts).
Don’t bind your breasts when you’re weaning. This just isn’t done anymore.
Binding lactating breasts can lead to serious side effects, like infections and
clogged milk ducts. Plus, it hurts.
241
Chapter 16: The Eleventh Month: Walking the Walk
Getting acquainted with your new breasts
So, after you wean your baby off the breast,
you’re going to have a pair of perky, pre-
pregnancy breasts again, right? Hate to tell you
this but . . . probably not. Your breasts may be
very different, so don’t break out those old bras
just yet. When you’re finished weaning your
child, you may notice that your breasts look
saggy and possibly much smaller than you recall.
This is completely normal. Remember, you’ve not
only been through a year of nursing but also
almost a year of pregnancy. Those physical and
hormonal changes have resulted in some
changes in your breasts, and your genetics are
coming into play here, too: Some women have
remarkably elastic skin, which allows those
breasts to pop right back into shape after months
of nursing, and others . . . don’t.
Most women find that their breasts fill out and
perk up again, at least somewhat, in about six
months, though some never do return to their
previous cup size or shape. There’s just no way
to determine what each individual woman’s
experience will be, so prepare yourself for any
eventuality — and tell yourself that it was all for
the greatest cause.

Packing the bottle away
Whether you weaned Baby months ago from the breast to a bottle or Baby
has always been bottlefed, now’s the time to kiss that bottle goodbye. We
know of several reasons for breaking the bottle habit at this age, most
notably the risk of baby bottle mouth (tooth decay), and the fact that a child
who’s toting a beloved bottle around may not be very interested in solid
foods (for more on baby bottle mouth, see Chapter 11). At this age, Baby
needs nutrients from all of the major food groups.
Putting the bottle away for good seems like an easy enough task, but if your
little one is really attached to his bottle, having it disappear in the span of
one day isn’t the best plan of action. The cold-turkey method of bottle wean-
ing should be used only when it’s clear Baby has absolutely no intention of
giving up the bottle after you’ve tried to ease him off it gradually.
Some tips for bottle weaning:
 Offer a sippy cup to him instead of his bottle at mealtimes, removing the
bottle from one feeding at a time. To do this, add the cup to (and remove
the bottle from) one mealtime a week, until he’s eventually taking the
cup at all meals.
If Baby is just starting on the cup, find one that he can comfortably
handle (and one that doesn’t leak).
 When trying to break the bedtime bottle habit, shake up the nighttime
routine. If you normally snuggle up with him and his bottle in your
family room, try reading to him in his bedroom. Doing things differently
will encourage him to give up that last bottle of the day.
 Make sure you offer Baby lots of extra cuddling and attention during this
time, especially if he was extremely attached to his bottle.
 Don’t leave bottles (or bottle parts) around. Out of sight, out of mind. In
fact, pack away all of the bottles and only use one, if possible, to show
Baby that the endless supply of bottles has come to an end.
 Stick to your plan. Don’t insist that he use the cup one day and then
allow him to have the bottle the next. After you’ve weaned him from 
the bottle at a particular feeding, the bottle is gone from that feeding 
forever.
 After the bottle is gone from all feedings for good, don’t bring it out to
comfort a sick or crying child. This will only confuse him and force you
to start the process all over — only this time, it may be harder, because
Baby knows that bottle is somewhere.
242
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

 Many babies balk at the taste of cow’s milk, but it’s an essential part of
building healthy bones. Introduce it into Baby’s diet only after he’s 12
months old, and do so gradually, using a 1:1 ratio of milk and formula.
This will not only make the milk more palatable, but will allow you to
watch for any signs of a milk allergy. (For more on food allergies, see
Chapters 11 and 18.) If Baby liked his formula warm, he may reject cold
milk. Warm the milk at first and gradually warm it less and less until
Baby takes it straight out of the fridge.
 Expect those nighttime and naptime bottles to be the last ones to go.
These are the bottles that are most likely to contribute to tooth decay,
so it’s important to wean Baby from them by the time he’s around 1 year
old. Read to him, rock him for an extra minute or two before he goes in
for the night, and make sure he has any security objects he hangs onto
during the day.
It can be as sad to wean Baby from the bottle as it is for a nursing mom to wean
her child from the breast. Another sign that he’s not an infant anymore. Tell
yourself that weaning is the right thing to do, that it’s best for his development
(after he’s off the bottle, he may become more interested in new foods and
activities), and that it’s easier to do this now than it will be in a year.
If Baby cries for that bottle while he’s in bed, give him a bottle filled with plain
water (make it warm if he’s used to having a warm bottle of formula at night).
It’s hard to do, but stand firm on this rule. The longer he takes a bottle of for-
mula, breast milk, or cow’s milk to bed, the better his chances of developing
tooth decay from the sugars contained in these drinks.
Bye-bye, binkie
With all this talk of weaning, you may be wondering how pacifiers fit into the
picture.
One thing at a time. Remember, Baby derives a lot of comfort from sucking —
that’s just the nature of small children. So although you may be anxious to
move on to the next phase of your child’s life — the phase where you’re no
longer hunting for bottles and pacifiers at naptime — just keep in mind that
taking all of her comfort measures away at once may unsettle her.
If you have a child who wants that pacifier in her mouth around the clock,
you must start easing her off it, for many of the same reasons babies are
weaned from the bottle: Constant use of a pacifier can affect her attempts at
speech, her interest in food, and, if the dependence is long-term enough, the
development of her permanent teeth.
243
Chapter 16: The Eleventh Month: Walking the Walk

Easing Baby’s need for the pacifier during the day is easier if you have some-
thing that will (at least temporarily) take the place of this habit — if she’s sit-
ting there on her blanket, just like she does every morning, looking for that
binkie, you can be sure she’s going to cry for it. But if you break her out of
her routine for a week or two — by taking her out of the house, or by engag-
ing in playtime in another room of the house — she may just forget what
she’s missing.
Shoot for cutting the pacifier use down to only naptime and bedtime, and
then decide where to go from there. Some kids carry that sucking impulse
with them right into the preschool years, and taking the pacifier away may
only encourage her to suck her finger or thumb, which can be a very hard
habit to break (and if this habit stays with her into her school-aged years, 
the orthodontist is going to love you).
She’s almost 1 year old: Too old for you to take her pacifier away cold turkey,
and too young to express her distress at not having it anymore. If you’re cut-
ting the pacifier use back to bedtime and she seems to really need it, leave the
weaning until she’s old enough to understand a reward system for giving it up.
Will this be harder to do in a year? Maybe; but she may still really need it. This
is something you have to determine on your own, keeping in mind that some
children do need to suck to relieve tension. In any event, most dentists recom-
mend that the pacifier go in the garbage can by 18 months.
Tucking Baby In Now
At this age, Baby should have a good bedtime routine going. If your child is
still rather unpredictable in this area, you can — and should — take control
and encourage a nightly schedule as soon as possible. Baby needs adequate
sleep for many reasons — most importantly for his growth and development
(kids really do grow while they sleep, for one thing, and for another, a tired
and crabby child isn’t likely to be interested in exploring his world).
Good bedtime habits
Helping Baby settle down at roughly the same time every evening is benefi-
cial to everyone in the household, even if you personally abhor schedules.
You need to know when this child is going to drop off so that you can have
some time to yourself, or time to catch up on the things you’re just not able
to do during the day. And Baby needs to know what’s going to happen each
night.
244
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Children thrive on repetition. It makes them feel safe and secure.
Even if it was darn near impossible to get your child on a schedule during the
first half of his first year, you should be able to do so now. He’s eating more
during the day, he’s much more active (and should be good and tired when
nighttime rolls around), and he’s able to comfort himself with a security
object or two.
What kind of activities promote a sedate settling down every evening? We’re
glad you asked. Here are some good ideas:
 A bath: Schedule a nice, warm bath for early in the evening as a way of
heralding that bedtime is approaching.
 A snack: Make it something small — applesauce, a cracker, some yogurt,
or cheese. Just enough to tide Baby over till the morning.
 Brush those teeth: Before Baby gets very sleepy, clean those pearly
whites. Making it a habit now will alert Baby to the fact that bedtime is
drawing near and, as a bonus, ensure that Baby always thinks of his
teeth right before bed.
 Snuggle time: Obviously, you have to be involved in bedtime — but you
really need to get into the routine with Baby to achieve maximum sleepy
results. Sit and read with him, sing some lullabies, or just rock together
for a while.
 Routine: Make sure Baby has his favorite blanket when you put him into
his crib. You may want prayer to be a part of his routine; if so, start now.
He probably won’t be able to memorize anything just yet, but he’ll come
to accept this as part of his nighttime ritual.
If Baby’s having trouble winding down for bedtime (or staying asleep during
the night), take a look at how much and how long he’s sleeping during the
day, and cut his naps back — little by little — accordingly. At this age, most
children sleep between 12 and 14 hours per day. So if he’s taking a 2-hour nap
in the afternoon, he should sleep at least 10 to 12 hours at night.
Baby should be awake when he goes to bed so that he falls asleep on his own.
If you always rock or comfort him until he’s asleep, he’ll come to depend on
you to perform this service. He needs to find his own ways to usher himself
off to Dreamland; otherwise, it’s more likely that he’ll need your help to fall
back to sleep in the middle of the night and at naptime, too.
Most kids wake up once or twice in the middle of the night. Baby should be
able to comfort himself and put himself back to sleep at this age. If he’s still
crying for you at two and three in the morning, give yourself a few minutes
before responding to him — and then a few minutes more, and then a few
minutes more. Rushing to his side is only depriving both of you of sleep, and
this will continue right into his toddler years if you don’t stop it now.
245
Chapter 16: The Eleventh Month: Walking the Walk

Baby trusts that you’ll come to him when he needs you. It’s up to you to sep-
arate his needs from his wants. Although you should avoid the urge to rush to
Baby every time he whimpers in his crib (because he merely wants to see
you), your motherly instincts will tell you when something’s really wrong. If
he’s screaming in pain or out of fear (babies can have bad dreams), he needs
you, and of course you should comfort him.
Not-so-good bedtime habits
So now we know what kinds of activities help kids settle in for the night.
What kinds of activities are counterproductive?
 Roughhousing: Can you have a tickling session, roll around on the floor,
chase your spouse around the house . . . and then settle down to sleep?
Neither can Baby.
 General noisiness: Your child may be sensitive to loud sounds. Turn
down your rock and roll music when bedtime rolls around.
 TV as a pacifier: Allowing Baby to zone out while watching a video is a
bad idea. He’s not learning to accept sleep as it comes to him; he’s not
actually engaging in the process of falling asleep at all. Instead, he’s
probably fighting sleep to stay awake and watch TV — and he’ll become
dependent on the TV to put him to sleep.
 Rocking him to sleep: Again, he’s not learning to comfort himself and
accept sleep as a normal part of the day, and he’s more likely to want
more rocking in the middle of the night.
 Varied bedtimes: It can be very difficult for working parents to leave a
rigid office routine and come home to a rigid bedtime routine, but it’s
best for Baby to establish these nighttime rituals. Even though you may
be hankering to keep him awake so that you can all watch the late show
together, he needs to have a pattern of going to bed at roughly the same
times every day and night.
A child who hasn’t followed any sort of a nighttime schedule up to this point
will need some time to adjust. That’s perfectly fine, but establish the routine
and stick to it. He needs it, and so do you. He shouldn’t need you to come in
and calm him (or feed him) in the middle of the night, every night. He’s physi-
cally capable of having a normal sleep pattern now — and you’re long over-
due in returning to yours.

S
o you and Baby made it — she’s turning 1 year old at the end of the month.
The past year has been pretty amazing. Why, 12 months ago, you didn’t
even know each other, and now you probably know exactly what makes this
child tick (and run, and scream, and giggle). After the first birthday, children
are officially in the toddler years, so you’ll see that word pop up in this chapter
from time to time.
The last month of the first year is very exciting. You’ve reached a huge mile-
stone in parenting (and although it would be nice to say that the hardest times
are behind you, they’re really out there looming in the teen years). Let’s just
say you came, you saw, you lost sleep, and you prevailed as an amazing parent
to an incredible child. Celebrate this accomplishment along with Baby’s first
birthday!
It can be a bit melancholy to watch her first year come to an end (so quickly!),
but realize that it doesn’t mean that she’s not your baby any more. You know
how your mother tells you that you’re still her baby? Now it all makes perfect
sense.
Checking In with Baby
Gone are the days when Baby was in the doctor’s office almost every month
for a well-baby visit. After the 1-year visit, things slow down considerably.

During the second year, you can expect to pop into the pediatrician’s office
for just two or three well-baby visits; otherwise, you’ll only be seeing the
doctor when Baby is sick or hurt. (You’ve spent so much time with him and
his office staff this past year, you’re really going to miss them!) The goal now
becomes to stay out of the pediatrician’s office, because going in usually
means Baby’s not feeling well.
The 1-year checkup
This month, your doctor continues to monitor Baby’s growth and develop-
ment, keeping in mind that this child is actually close to becoming a toddler.
In Chapter 6, we discuss the significance of height and weight charts (and
you can take a look at the charts at www.cdc.gov/growthcharts). Your
doctor is largely concerned with whether Baby regularly falls into the same
percentiles. In other words, don’t worry if your child is either large or small,
worry if he’s much larger than other babies at one checkup and much smaller
at another. You want his growth to on the same general scale.
248
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 
Keeping in touch with Doc
Just because you won’t be having regular visits
with the doctor doesn’t mean that he doesn’t
ever want to hear from you. Questions about
raising a child don’t just stop when Baby blows
out her first birthday candle. Many offices have
a phone hour — a set time each day when the
doctor takes calls from parents. (Baby’s been
throwing major temper tantrums and you want
to know whether this is normal? Call during the
phone hour and the doctor will answer your
questions.) In their off hours, doctors have
answering services that relay urgent messages
to your pediatrician. (Baby has a fever of 103
degrees and you’re not sure what to do? Leave
a message with the service, and the doctor will
call you at home.)
Parents sometimes hem and haw about whether
they should call their pediatrician about an issue.
If it’s a medical thing and Baby is sick, call. You
can’t be expected to know everything about
every illness and how serious it is or could be.
Put your own mind at ease and get the answers
you need. But do remember that your doctor is at
home with her family and try to save after-hours
calls for emergencies, not routine questions or
medication refills.
If it’s a behavioral thing, use your best judgment —
and call during office hours (unless it’s a radical
and disturbing change in behavior, like nonstop
crying, which could signal an acute illness). You
don’t need to call the doctor to ask him if it’s
normal for Baby to rub his face on his blanket
before he goes to sleep. It’s adorable, yes, and
quite normal. If Baby is banging his head into the
wall in order to fall asleep, however, you should
really run that past the doctor and get his opinion
on why your child is doing this.

Questions your pediatrician will probably ask during the 1-year checkup
include:
 What is Baby’s sleeping pattern like? How much is he sleeping now?
Does he sleep through the night? How many naps during the day?
 Is Baby talking? How many words does he say?
 Can Baby indicate what he wants by pointing?
 What is he eating? How much?
 Is he standing, cruising, or walking?
 How many teeth has he cut so far?
 Is he a sociable baby? Does he make eye contact, appear to listen when
you speak directly to him, engage in playtime with you?
 Does Baby appear to hear and see normally?
 Is he able to stack blocks or manipulate his toys? (This is an evaluation
of his fine motor skills.)
The doctor will also want to know whether you have any areas of concern.
You won’t be back for another well-baby visit until your child is 15 months
old, so don’t be shy — lay your questions on the doctor.
Immunizations
Baby’s due for several shots this month. These shots come complete with a
series of confusing initials. Don’t worry, we break all this down in Chapter 18
for you, where we tell you exactly what the initials mean and how the shots
themselves protect your child. The following vaccines can be given between
12 and 15 months:
 MMR
 Hib #4
 PCV #4
 Varicella
Your child may also receive DTaP #3 and/or HBV #3, which can be given
between the ages of 12 and 18 months. It just depends on Baby’s immuniza-
tion schedule.
As always, remember to ask the doctor or nurse about the common and pos-
sible side effects of each vaccine, including comfort measures and which side
effects warrant a call to the office.
249
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

Milestones this month
During the twelfth month, Baby seems to be learning new tricks every day —
there’s just no end to what she can do! Here’s what you can expect by the end
of the month:
 She can sit well and pull herself up on things.
 Baby is probably able to stand on her own at this point.
 She can probably also walk, either holding onto your hand or by herself.
Many babies don’t walk well until the thirteenth or fourteenth month, so
don’t panic if she’s not quite up and running just yet.
 Baby is at least trying to use a spoon and cup.
 She may try to assist you with dressing her — by holding out her foot
for a sock, for example.
 She may be an expert climber at this point, which means that you need a
baby-proofed house (see Chapter 20). You also need to keep a constant
eye on her.
 She can probably stack blocks or stack cups with success.
 Baby can probably roll a ball back to you.
 Baby is talking, probably using at least two words with meaning. She
may be creating her own little language, in which she mimics voice
inflections of the adults around her, but doesn’t say anything that you
can understand.
 She probably points to things she wants or lets you know what she
wants without crying.
 Baby can follow simple directions, like “Come here,” or “Put that down.”
 She enjoys showing affection to others.
 She’s still too young to play with other kids, but will play near them (par-
allel play).
 Baby recognizes herself in the mirror now and may love to watch 
herself.
Marking the milestones
Go ahead: Look back on the last year and revel in how far Baby has come! In
the past year, she has doubled her height, tripled her birth weight, gained
mobility and independence, and learned to communicate with others. Her
achievements are nothing short of incredible.
250
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Not all children reach milestones at the same rate. Some milestones, such as
speech, are particularly variable. Some kids start chatting away soon after
they turn 1 year old, while others may not start to communicate effectively
until they’re 2 or 3. Your doctor will be more concerned with Baby’s progres-
sion toward the milestone (is Baby at least attempting to talk?) than with
reaching the milestone by a given date.
If your doctor shares your concerns about Baby’s development, keep in mind
that early intervention is often key to nipping certain developmental delays
in the bud.
Keeping Baby Safe and Sound
With the advent of the toddler years comes new parenting territory. Your
child is learning more and more about the world every day, and that knowl-
edge can sometimes create fear. Think about Baby’s position: He’s sur-
rounded by all of these things that he’s beginning to take note of and that
he’s very curious about . . . but he doesn’t truly understand them.
On the flip side of this coin, some parents have children who seem to have a
major fear deficiency. Things that should scare these kids (a barking dog, a
honking horn) don’t, and their parents worry themselves sick with the thought
of what kind of trouble their offspring may end up in.
Facing new fears
Where does the water go when you pull the plug in the tub — and why wouldn’t
it also pull Baby down the drain? That’s a terrifying thought for a child. Come
to think of it, it’s a terrifying thought, period — but as adults, parents under-
stand how the world works and that certain things are just not going to
happen, or are very unlikely to happen, or are completely out of our control
and not really worth worrying about. Baby doesn’t have that kind of life expe-
rience or the ability to reason with himself to allay his own fears.
New fears are considered a very normal part of a child’s development and are
quite common in the toddler years. You may be able to pinpoint an event that
made Baby fearful of something — perhaps a dog snapped at him or he slipped
under the water in the bathtub — or he may develop a fear out of (seemingly)
nowhere. And although you may have a child who has only one fear, some kids
have a generally fearful disposition, either because this is simply the way they
are or because they have a parent who is also very fearful and the child picks
up on Mom or Dad’s heightened anxiety level.
251
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

Sometimes, you simply can’t predict what’s going to scare the wits right out
of your child, but there are some fears that are more common among the tod-
dler set, among them:
 Loud noises
 Animals
 Water
 Darkness
 Separation from parents
These last two fears often go hand-in-hand: Baby is put to bed in a dark room
without his parents. The resulting drama can be pretty hard to take.
Periods of major change or stress in Baby’s life (a move, a new baby in the
house, a new caregiver or day-care situation) can result in his developing
new fears — or the worsening of an already-existing fear.
So what can you do to help your child deal with his fears? Several things,
actually:
 Acknowledge the fear and don’t belittle it. Don’t try to make your 
child pet your neighbor’s dog when the kid is screaming in a blind panic.
Whether the fear is justified or not, your child’s feelings are very real. 
If you force him into a scary situation, you’re going to confuse him. 
(He thinks you love him, so why are you doing this?)
 On the other hand, don’t play up the fear too much. All right, so he
doesn’t have to pet the neighbor’s dog. Don’t talk about the “bad dog”
all day long. React when the situation presents itself and then drop it.
Giving it your undivided attention to the fear for hours on end only rein-
forces it.
 Resist the urge to protect him from everything. In order to overcome
his fears, your child has to be exposed to them little by little and see
that these objects or situations really are safe. This can be hard, espe-
cially if you have a child who’s afraid of (seemingly) everything. Stay
nearby and support him when you see fear on the horizon, but don’t
shelter him altogether.
 Look for obvious solutions. If your child is afraid of the dark, buy him a
nightlight. If your neighbor’s dog really is nasty, keep Baby far away from
the animal. If Baby’s afraid of the tub, hold his hand while he’s in there,
and make sure the water doesn’t run down his face when you wash his
hair. A little adjustment could make all the difference and help him over-
come his fear altogether.

Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Children often develop fears of things that never bothered them before. Your
little one may suddenly scream in terror when your husband turns on the
lawn mower, when he wasn’t scared of the noise at all a month ago. Again,
this is normal behavior for kids this age.
Most kids outgrow these fears, though some may hang on to remnants of
them for years to come. Fear isn’t really a major concern unless the fears
turn into real phobias — where your child is completely paralyzed by his
fears, and they prevent him from developing physically or socially. This is
more common in older children and unlikely to happen to your 1-year-old,
but if you have some concerns about his fearful temperament, talk to your
pediatrician.
Your fearless little crusader
Parents of burgeoning toddlers who seem to lack the fear chromosome are
often left shaking in their own boots. Good heavens, how can a child get her-
self into so many perilous situations day after day?
Again, this is just part of her disposition. She’s curious. She’s active. She sees
no reason not to explore her options, even if that includes climbing on the
front of the TV or standing on the back of the toilet. It’s just good fun, as far
as she’s concerned, and you’re way overreacting, Mom and Dad.
Of course, you’re not really overreacting. Every parent’s main mission is to
keep his children safe. Parents of fearless 1-year-old children simply have a
harder job than the parents of more sedate kids. 
253
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?
Paging Dr. Scary
You’re sitting in your pediatrician’s waiting room
and all you can hear is a child screaming in one
of the examination rooms. Is the doctor torturing
this poor kid? It’s possible that the crying is due
to a shot, or an illness — or another common fear
that children around this age develop: Fear of the
doctor and/or nurse. If co-author Dr. Gaylord sees
a child wide-eyed with fear when he enters the
examination room, he examines the child on the
parent’s lap. Don’t be afraid to ask your pediatri-
cian to do the same. No one wants a child to fear
the doctor’s office any more than he has to
(because of shots or memories of unpleasant ill-
nesses) — and especially not because of the
doctor himself.

Here are some tips to help you keep Baby safe:
 Make things as easy on yourself as possible. You’ve seen what she’s
capable of. She’s not going to stop her explorations simply because you
want her to. Keep the bathroom door closed. Limit her to areas where
she can’t get into trouble.
 Get creative. Become the child. Think of the most dangerous thing she
could get into in each room she has access to, and beat her to it.
Remove or rearrange whatever she can get herself into trouble with in
the house. This is a step beyond basic baby-proofing, as you may be
forced to remove ottomans, move chairs and stools out of her reach,
and block off areas like your entertainment center (where she tries to
pull herself up on the shelves). Your mantra: Whatever it takes to make
home safe.
 Say “no.” When she’s jumping on the couch and teetering on the edge,
make her stop. Don’t allow her to stand up in her highchair.
 Don’t trust her. She’s still so young, and yet so active, and so not going
to listen to your explicit instructions to stay out of the dryer. You still
need to keep her in your sights at all times.
Create a safe haven for Baby to be active in. Get creative using padded mate-
rials for jumping on and providing her with appropriate climbing materials (a
baby jungle gym, for example).
When you leave a fearless child with a sitter, whether it’s a relative or a
teenager from the neighborhood, make sure the person understands that your
child is very active (it’s actually best to have a sitter come several days before
you’re going to leave her with Baby so that she can see your child in action).
Some folks have really never had any experience with children like this, and
you want to educate them so that Baby is being left in capable hands.
Last words here: Get used to this. Her activity level will probably only
increase throughout the second year, though in time she may calm down.
And if she doesn’t, she’ll probably make a great gymnast or an amazing
trapeze artist.
Happy, Happy Birthday, Baby: 
Planning the Party
Keeping Baby’s first birthday in perspective can be difficult — especially if
you love to throw a good party. Kids’ parties these days are nothing like the
parties children had a generation ago — caterers and wildly expensive enter-
tainment are de riguer these days, so why should you keep your child’s first
birthday on the down-low?
254
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Well, because it’s a party for your child, and his enjoyment should be your
top priority. Ask yourself what would make the day extra-special for your
child and move in that direction. Chances are, he’s not going to give a hoot
about booking the hottest band in town, but he’d probably love a cake and
spending some time with his friends, cousins, and grandparents.
It can be hard to rein yourself in on the first birthday party, but Baby is going
to have lots of other birthdays — and in the future, he’ll actually understand
what all the fuss is about. You’re better off scaling things down for now and
saving the extravagant stuff for subsequent birthdays.
Consider the following elements to make sure your party is kid-friendly:
 Other kids: Invite the littlest relatives, and if Baby has a little friend or
two, invite them also.
 Size: Some people would advise having only an intimate gathering for
Baby’s first birthday, but if you have a large family, he’s already used to
crowds (and they wouldn’t miss this for the world, anyway). Don’t over-
whelm him with strangers or a huge number of guests if he isn’t accus-
tomed to being around a lot of people, though.
 Finger foods: You don’t want to be feeding sliced bananas to your in-
laws, but make sure you have some treats on hand for Baby and the
other kids.
 Activities for the kids: Have some games planned for your smaller
guests (and prizes on hand). If weather permits, consider having the
party outdoors, where the kids will be free to run.
 Timing: Don’t plan an all-day affair, and do plan the party around Baby’s
naptime. He’s not going to care who came to wish him a happy birthday
if greeting these people means he’s going to miss his afternoon snooze.
 The cake: Give him his own small cake, or a piece of the larger cake, and
let him dive in.
Allow Baby to open his presents in front of his guests if he’s interested in
doing so. If he’s just too busy running around with his pals, don’t force it. You
can open them later and make a list of who gave him what. (You and Baby
will be busy with those thank you notes later in the week!)
Choosing Toys for Your Child
Now that you’re starting to pack away some of the baby toys, make sure that
Baby is prepared to move into and through her second year with interesting,
entertaining, and educational play things. 
255
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

You want to make sure that Baby has toys that are safe and that actually
encourage her development, like:
 Musical toys: The more noise it makes, the better. Drums, baby pianos,
rattles — whatever you can find.
 Shape sorters: Children this age also love to put things inside of other
things. Not only will Baby be putting all the shapes inside of the container,
but after she gets the hang of sorting those shapes, her fine motor skills
will also be employed. And she’ll clean up after herself! Picking up toys
and putting them in the toy box can also be a fun activity.
 Stacking blocks or nesting cups: Toddlers love to stack them up and
knock them down. Kids this age also enjoy putting things in and taking
things out, which is why they also love nesting cups.
 Push toys: These large, sturdy toys help Baby become steadier on her
feet.
 Pull toys: As Baby becomes an expert walker, she’ll enjoy pulling a toy
duck or dog along behind her.
 Puzzles: She’ll become better and better with her motor and cognitive
skills over the course of the next year. Puzzles with just several large
pieces are a thrill for toddlers to complete.
 Activity tables: They deliver on their promise — they’re chock-full of
activities. Many have flashing lights and music, too.
 Bath toys: Baby needs a friend or two in the bath. Nowadays, you can
find waterproof versions of stuffed animals. You may also be interested
in supplying her with foam rubber letters and numbers that stick to the
side of the tub when they’re wet. Boats and toys that shoot water are big
hits.
 Crayons and a workspace: For the child who loves to draw at the tender
age of 1, drawing materials and a kid-sized table to work at can be a
dream come true.
 Books: Continue to look for books with colorful, interesting pictures and
sturdy pages. Avoid books that are too long or that have too many
words at this point. Books with pop-up pages or flaps to turn are an
incredible source of amusement for toddlers.
 Pop-up toys: Baby pulls a lever or presses a button, and a little head
pops up.
 Activity tables: Baby hits a button and something happens — the button
lights up, music plays, something spins, and so on.
 Music: You know what kind of music she likes. Buy her a CD, just for her
room.
256
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

 Playhouses: Little kids love little houses. If you have the room, set one
up for her. Tents are fun too.
 Play sets: Toy kitchens are a big favorite among the toddler set, as they
offer countless activities for a child to get involved in.
 Car seat toys: Do you sense boredom in the back seat? She may enjoy a
toy steering wheel, complete with a squeaky horn.
Although Baby may be interested in a TV show or two already, try not to load
her down with videos for her first birthday. Toddlers should be spending the
bulk of their day exploring and learning from doing — things they aren’t
going to engage in if they’re sitting in front of the TV.
Of course, these are only suggestions. You know your child best, and you
know what kinds of activities she best enjoys. Just remember to buy her toys
that are appropriate for her age and activity level. You may be dying to buy
her first real guitar, but she’s not going to be able to do much with it at this
point.
Don’t be surprised if Baby is more interested in pots and pans than in actual
toys: They’re shiny, they’re loud, and Baby can fit lots of stuff inside of them.
Safety concerns
Baby should continue to have age-appropriate toys to play with. When pur-
chasing toys, read the labels. Most will have an age range on the package.
Don’t buy toys that are intended for older children. For instance, don’t give
your almost-1-year-old child a toy that’s meant for a 6-year-old, even if it
catches his eye and he just loves it.
Choking is the number one toy-related risk to small children. Toys that are
intended for older kids often contain small pieces that can break off and pose
a threat to Baby’s airways: wheels, googly eyes, buttons, chunks of foam
rubber. All of these materials (and many, many more) may be contained in
older kids’ toys and may present a choking hazard to Baby.
Toys and gender
Most toys for children of this age are made for boys and girls. It’s when chil-
dren get a bit older that gender comes into play (and into marketing) where
toys are concerned. If you’ve tried hard to keep your child’s playthings
gender neutral, you may be surprised to find your 2-year-old daughter wants
nothing except the items in the pink aisle of the toy store or your son bites
his toast into the shape of a gun.
257
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

Although little people of both sexes seem very similar at this age, each sex
has very different hormones running through their veins. These potent chem-
icals are at least partially responsible for your little girl’s nurturing her
stuffed toys or your little boy’s throwing them.
Now, there’s nothing wrong with offering your almost-1-year-old son a play
kitchen or your daughter a set of trucks. They’ll probably like them, in fact —
at least until friends come into the picture, and TV commercials start affect-
ing their vision of life. Some kids are able to shut out these messages; others
just truly enjoy playing with the stereotypical toys for their own gender and
aren’t interested in those meant for the opposite sex.
So when choosing playthings, keep a few things in mind:
 Respect your child’s choices in playthings. Don’t force toys on your child
that he or she doesn’t want to play with. If your little boy has no interest
in playing with a dollhouse, you can’t make him become interested.
 You can raise a caring, kind, politically correct child even if he or 
she isn’t accepting of toys that are commonly purchased for the oppo-
site sex.
 Your overall outlook and points of view on issues will carry much
more weight in developing Baby’s attitudes toward life than any toy
will. If you constantly tell your little girl that she’s strong and smart,
expect her to view herself that way.
Bringing Up Brainiac
There’s a push in our society to have our children stand out from the 
masses — and to make sure that if a child doesn’t demonstrate exceptional
258
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 
Going with the flow
Should you accept that your child may strongly
exhibit the stereotypical mannerisms of his or
her gender (if your little boy is incredibly active,
for example, or your little girl is fairly subdued)?
Of course. But within reason. You shouldn’t try
to force a child into a different personality alto-
gether, but you can and should step in to teach
him or her what’s appropriate and what isn’t.
Yes, boys will be boys, but a little guy who’s con-
stantly beating on other little guys should be
reined in. (Natural instincts are one thing; unac-
ceptable behavior is quite another.) If your little
girl, on the other hand, is constantly the victim of
other toddlers taking things from her, you’re well
within your rights (and responsibilities) as a
parent to teach her to stand up for herself.

abilities on his own, we find her gifts and cultivate them for and with her. 
Not that there’s anything wrong with expecting a child to live up to her 
potential — indeed, talents should be nurtured and encouraged. The truth 
is, every child has her own unique talents and abilities, and whether a child 
is labeled as being gifted or not, she should be allowed to explore her own
possibilities.
Even if your child doesn’t show an aptitude for books and vocabulary, she
may be an amazing budding athlete (those climbing kids) or a blossoming
musician (the kids who can seriously pick out a little tune on the piano when
they’re very small). Every child should be supported and encouraged in
whatever strengths she has — and as long as you recognize your own child’s
interests and abilities, she’ll develop into a capable person down the line.
259
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?
Is Baby gifted?
“Gifted” is one of those loaded terms — some
children are held up as shining examples while
others are labeled as merely “normal.” When we
hear the word “gifted,” we tend to think of a bril-
liant Baby, one whose mind works levels above
our own, a child whom we may never really
understand, but who may just grow up to change
the world. There are some signs that may indi-
cate — even at this early age — that you’ve got
an extremely bright youngster on your hands.
They include:
 A tendency to hit milestones early and with
bravado. This child not only pulled up at 6
months, he walked at 9 months. Now he’s
running. His motor skills (fine and gross), in
general, may be advanced.
 The ability to notice similarities or dis-
crepancies in his world. He sees a man
with brown curly hair in the park and says,
“Dada,” because his father’s hair looks like
this. Or if you suddenly stop wearing your
glasses, favoring contacts, he’ll bring you
whatever he can find (maybe your sun-
glasses) to put on your eyeballs.
 He may have a great sense of humor
because he recognizes discrepancies as
being funny. But he could also swing to the
opposite end of the spectrum and be a very
serious little person because he’s just so
busy observing everyone and everything.
 He really pays attention to things. He loves
to look at books or have stories read to him,
he “sings” along to his favorite music.
 His comprehension is advanced for his age.
At this age, he may understand the concept
of “up” and “down,” for example, or of “in”
and “out,” or “off” and “on.” He also demon-
strates a comprehension for language. Sure,
he understands what you’re saying to him,
but he also understands people who don’t
necessarily talk to him like he’s a baby.
 He has mastered all of the toys meant for
his age group and needs advanced stimu-
lation. At the age of almost 1 year, he may
be able to solve a puzzle meant for a child
six months older without any hesitation.
As Baby moves through the second year, he may
continue on this course — he may be a kid who
can memorize an entire book upon hearing it
once, know his alphabet by the age of 2, or count
to 100 by the time he’s 21⁄2. Children who exhibit
these skills often tend to read and write much
earlier than their peers — and often teach them-
selves these skills.

You can encourage Baby’s intellect, but remember that he’s a small child. He
needs nurturing more than anything else. In other words, follow his lead and
resist the urge to push him to accelerate too much. He’ll let you know what
he’s ready for. Here’s how you can encourage his burgeoning intellect without
going overboard:
 Provide him with level-appropriate toys. If he’s able to put a simple
puzzle together, find one that’s a little more difficult. But be careful not
to go overboard to the point where you’ve made playtime so difficult or
serious that his own toys overwhelm him. And always check carefully, 
of course, for choking hazards.
 Allow him lots of opportunities for seeing the world. You don’t have 
to hop a flight to far-flung locales; just take him on lots of outings (to 
the park; to the zoo; to the children’s museum; to outdoor concerts or
shows — anywhere he can see or do something new) and let him take
his time exploring.
 Talk to him. This also gives him the opportunity to expand his vocabu-
lary — and you can bet that he will.
 Continue encouraging whatever it is that he’s interested in. Reading.
Music. Puzzles. You can try to diversify your child’s interests, too, but
stick with his main areas of attention. If you can clearly see that this
child has an aptitude for spatial relationships (he’s able to actually build
with his blocks instead of simply piling them on top of each other), let
him go with it. But don’t label him as the next Frank Lloyd Wright just
yet. He may have other amazing talents, too. Do your best to uncover
them while keeping him interested in the blocks.
Raising a Nice Kid
The toddler years are coming and along with them come increasing indepen-
dence and assertiveness on your child’s part. This is a good thing, really — it
shows that she’s developing her own opinions and ideas, even though she
may be driving you a tad bit nutty in the process of expressing herself.
At this point, you become not just a caregiver but also a disciplinarian, and
the change in roles may be difficult for both you and your child. Figuring out
how to stop the behaviors you don’t want and encourage the ones you do
takes some trial and error but pays big rewards in the long run. For a more
complete look at parenting beyond the first year, read Parenting For Dummies
by Sandra Hardin Gookin and Dan Gookin (Wiley).
260
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

Your goal in disciplining your child is to not only let her know that there are
limits and boundaries in your house, but also to help her make the right deci-
sions in the future.
Using age-appropriate discipline
The average 1-year-old has very little understanding of “good” and “bad”
behaviors. There’s only what feels right, what’s fun, and what isn’t so fun. So
if your daughter has, for the third time today, thrown her meal on the floor,
she’s most likely doing it because it’s fun, at least as far as she’s concerned.
She’s not considering that you have to clean this mess, nor is she thinking
about the time and effort you put into preparing her dinner, which the dog 
is now thoroughly enjoying.
Keep Baby’s point of view in mind, and monitor your own expectations of 
her behavior. Babies are babies — and toddlers are really just older babies.
It’s unfair and unrealistic to hold them to rigid behavioral standards meant
for older kids. This doesn’t mean that your child should be allowed to run
roughshod through your home and the homes of your friends.
Keep in mind that it’s far easier to introduce her to your minimum expecta-
tions now rather than a year from now, when she’ll be going through the terri-
ble twos (a normal phase of childhood where Baby discovers that she has
very strong opinions that are often contrary to her parents’).
Every parent has her own style, but you should steer away from being either
way too lax or far too strict. Boundaries are actually comforting to small chil-
dren, who are faced with a great big world filled with possibilities. Not having
anyone to rein them in once in a while means that anything can happen —
and that’s a scary thought for a little person. It’s an old adage, but it’s so true:
Kids need to know that they have limits, especially as they move into the tod-
dler years.
By having almost no discipline in your own home, you could also set your
child up for future social failures, in school or at a playmate’s home, where
she’ll suddenly be faced with a set of rules for acceptable behavior that she’s
never encountered before.
Conversely, adapting a very strict, regimented style of discipline for your
small child could have the effect of making her a very scared, timid person
who’s afraid to explore her world the way she should.
261
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

The following guidelines are tried and true for disciplining toddlers:
 Choose your battles wisely. Decide which behaviors are important and
let the others go. She isn’t allowed to draw on the wall. That’s a huge
issue, and rightly so. Breaking this rule warrants a stronger response
than a rule that isn’t as important to you (say, making a mess with her
blocks).
 Stop certain behaviors before they even start. If you see her headed for
the wall with a crayon, stop her before she realizes that she’s a great
muralist. Distract her from this activity, and it may never become an
issue.
 Stick to your guns and follow through. Don’t stop her from drawing on
the wall one day and allow her to do so the next day. Your response to a
particular activity should be the same each time it happens, as in the
case of Baby tossing her dinner across the room. Switching responses —
from very stern one day to not-so-stern the next — only serves to con-
fuse her.
 Use an appropriate level of response. If she’s committed a first offense by
drawing on the wall, your reaction should reflect that. Take the crayons
away, give her a stern “no,” and hand her a cloth so she can “help” wash it
off. If she’s done this many times over the course of several weeks, your
reaction is more stern: The crayons go away, for one thing, and she may
have a short time out, which at this age consists of you sitting her down
for one minute — don’t expect her to stay put by herself. She’ll probably
react strongly to this confinement, and that’s the point. You’re teaching
her that negative behavior has negative consequences — in this case,
she’s not free to move about as she pleases (which is everything to a child
this age). After the one-minute mark, she can “help” to clean the crayon
off the wall.
Baby’s brain is very different from yours — and it takes time for her to get
the message that a particular behavior is unacceptable. She may very well
continue to do something you’ve told her not to do ten times, but as long as
you’re consistent in your message and you follow through in your response,
she will eventually understand right from wrong.
Offer your child alternatives to the forbidden behavior. All right, so she can’t
draw on the wall, but she can draw on paper. Don’t just tell her what isn’t
acceptable — show her the right way to do things.
Here are some things to avoid when disciplining a child this age:
 Telling her she’s a bad kid. She’s far too young to appreciate the differ-
ence between a little angel and a bad seed.
262
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 

 Yelling. Again, she’s too young for this. When a parent really yells at a
child this age, the child gets scared. She cries. You’ll probably end up
comforting her, realizing that you lost it for a second there. The lesson
she was supposed to be learning about her behavior is gone. A seriously
raised voice should be reserved for only the most dangerous behaviors.
 Making everything into an issue. You’re trying to instill important
lessons here about what’s acceptable in your house and in society 
in general — don’t dilute your message by correcting everything she 
does. Let some things slide — at least for now.
 Spanking. Spanking should be used in only the most extreme — and
dangerous —situations. Check out the upcoming “To spank or not to
spank?” section for more.
In the end, you have to decide which behaviors are acceptable in your home
and which aren’t. Just remember that children are naturally curious and that
they need guidance first and foremost. (Baby wasn’t born with an internal
gauge for determining right from wrong.) Punishment (in the form of time
outs at this age) should be reserved for the most important issues so that it
doesn’t lose its impact.
Tackling tantrums
A 12-month-old who throws himself on the ground and screams because he’s
displeased with something in his little life is about a year ahead of schedule.
You thought you had another year before you had to deal with the horrors of
the terrible twos — and now you’re scared to death of what your tantrum-
throwing child will be like 12 months from now.
The main culprits for throwing little people into big tailspins include:
 Fatigue or hunger: If Baby seems to be unhappy at certain times of the
day, he may just need a snack or a nap. Try keeping track of his grumpy
times while observing him. Is he angry and looking beat? Put him in his
crib for a while. Or, if it’s been hours since he had lunch, offer him some
fruit or cereal. His mood may change drastically (and for the better).
 Frustration: Not being able to accomplish a task or communicate your
needs is incredibly frustrating. Try helping Baby out or temporarily
removing a toy that’s upsetting him.
 Not feeling well: If he’s had a cold or virus lately and is really feeling out
of sorts, he may just need some extra comfort from Mom or Dad. He may
also need extra rest.
 Not understanding why he can’t have what he wants now: Baby’s still-
developing brain can’t quite handle the concept of delayed gratification.
Not much you can do about this except ride out the storm.
263
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

The best tactic for dealing with a 1-year-old’s tantrum is to simply ignore it.
Easier said than done, sure, but chances are if you don’t pay too much atten-
tion to his fit, he’ll stop in a relatively short time. You can then act as though
it never happened, instead of chastising him for this behavior, which isn’t
going to help at this age. He won’t understand why you’re angry with him,
and he’ll either be frightened by your tone of voice or he’ll ignore it alto-
gether. (Either way, he’s not learning anything from your lecture.) Just avoid
the urge to give into this behavior, if Baby is having a tantrum over some-
thing you’ve taken away from him, for example. If he learns that all he has to
do in order to get his way is to throw himself on the floor and scream, you’ll
be dealing with these tactics for years to come. (Charming, it ain’t.)
Before you ignore a tantrum, however, assess the situation. If Baby is already
a hitter or a thrower, make sure he doesn’t have anything around him that he
could harm or that could harm him (a window, for example) if he decides to
pull out all the stops. He’s probably not strong enough to do too much
damage at this point, but it’s better not to take the chance.
To spank or not to spank?
You were raised in a house where a little spanking went a long way, and so
you see nothing wrong with a well-timed smack to Baby’s bottom when she
needs it.
264
Part V: Keeping Up with Baby 
Temperament, temperament: 
Hypersensitivity and tantrums
Kids who suffered through colic may be more
prone to throwing tantrums as toddlers. Re-
search suggests that these kids may simply be
hypersensitive to the world around them. Things
that wouldn’t bother other kids their age —
bunched-up socks or a funny smelling dinner —
can set off kids whose senses are set to a “high”
level. For more on this subject, see Chapter 8.
Before you label this child as “difficult” or
“unhappy,” realize that sensitivity is just part of
his make-up; this is simply who he is. He can no
more change his level of sensitivity than you
can — and right now, he’s too young to tone
down his reaction to certain things.
A little prevention can go a long way with a child
like this: Make sure his clothes are comfortable,
that his beloved blanket is in his crib at naptime,
and that his schedule doesn’t go through any
major upheavals if at all possible. These are
things that any 1-year-old would be miffed over;
the highly sensitive kid may just be pushed over
the edge into a tantrum, and if you can stop it
before it happens, both of you will be happier.

Most child-rearing experts disagree with this point of view — but there are
plenty of parents who feel that spanking, when used correctly, is an effective
form of discipline. This is a debate that has been going on for years and
another one of those parenting issues that divides its advocates and critics
into clearly delineated camps.
Experts shun spanking for several reasons:
 Spanking may stop the child from doing whatever he’s doing, but it 
doesn’t teach the child an appropriate action in its place.
 Spanking a child may damage his self-esteem, as he’s often left feeling
confused, embarrassed, and angry.
 Kids who are spanked seem to get better at not getting caught, but don’t
necessarily stop the offensive behavior.
Proponents of spanking, on the other hand, point out that toddler-aged chil-
dren can’t be reasoned with, and they feel that spanking is an appropriate
measure for teaching children what’s acceptable and what isn’t. Many par-
ents (and even some of the experts) feel that spanking should be used spar-
ingly and only in situations where Baby has placed herself in danger so that
she’ll get the immediate message not to repeat the behavior. When she’s
older and capable of understanding why she can’t play in the road, you can
explain the danger to her.
Try one of these alternatives to spanking:
 Physically remove your child from a situation. If it’s time to leave a
play date, for example, and your child refuses to comply with your order
to come along with you, pick him up and put him in the car. That’s the
beauty of being the bigger person in this relationship.
 Use a series of distractions or diversions. Helping him switch gears
(and move from jumping on the couch to playing nicely on the floor with
toys) may stop the behavior and give him an acceptable alternative.
 Put yourself on his level. For serious or dangerous infractions, like
reaching up toward a hot stove, get down to his eye level, hold his
hands, and sternly tell him no. He’ll realize by the tone of your voice that
you’re serious.
 Make sure you don’t set him up for failure. He’s a kid. He needs super-
vision. Your house needs to be kid-proofed. Leaving your priceless
antique teacups on the coffee table and spanking him when he shatters
them just isn’t fair. Do your part to prevent putting him in situations
where he can’t win.
265
Chapter 17: The Twelfth Month: Who's This Toddler?

Your job is to teach your child right from wrong. Using spanking as your only
form of discipline is a far cry from getting involved and showing him what
kinds of behaviors are acceptable, and could have serious, long-lasting
effects on his self-esteem. You also run the risk of damaging the relationship
between yourself and your child and of having a kid who learns to hit others
as the main way of resolving conflict.

W
hen Baby first arrives, her immune system is still maturing.
Breastfeeding boosts her immunities to some things (she’s protected
from certain allergies, for example, and she’s less likely to suffer from ear
infections and certain skin disorders), but unfortunately, there’s no magic
supplement to keep her germ-free for life. She’ll eventually catch her first
cold, and you’ll suffer right along with her, feeling her misery. This chapter
will explain some of the most common first-year ailments and how to treat
them.
Preventing Illness with Immunizations
During the first year, most of Baby’s checkups will often include at least one
shot. If you’ve never been a big fan of needles, you can’t stand to see Baby
cry, or you’ve been reading some information that suggests that immuniza-
tions can do more harm than good, you may be thinking about opting Baby
out of his shots.
Don’t.
Though serious adverse reactions to immunizations do occur, they’re very
rare. The chances of Baby becoming ill because he missed out on his shots
are far greater. If you’re feeling as though immunizing Baby is akin to gam-
bling with his life, the opposite is actually true.

Times have changed since you were a kid, and the newest vaccines provide
protection from illnesses that were fairly common not too long ago (measles,
chickenpox, ear infections). You may wonder, then, whether modern medi-
cine has gone too far — are doctors immunizing children too much? Not
when you consider the potential hazards of these illnesses. Measles and
chronic ear infections, for example, can lead to hearing loss, and chickenpox
can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Mumps can
cause male sterility. Pneumococcal meningitis can cause permanent hearing
loss or death.
Side effects of immunizations are rarely severe, and most often include pain,
redness, and swelling at the injection site; fever; sleepiness; and crankiness.
Your doctor or nurse will advise you on pain relief measures and more seri-
ous side effects to watch for.
Baby has a whole slew of shots in her near future. Table 18-1 contains a list of
the common immunizations and what they protect against.

One more vaccine for you: Because complications from the flu can be very
serious, especially in young children, pediatricians strongly recommend the
flu vaccine for children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. If Baby is
younger than 6 months when flu season hits, doctors recommend that the
rest of the family be immunized to prevent any flu in the house.
Outlining the First-Year Ailments
Baby wakes up one morning with a stuffy nose and cough. Before the week is
out, she’s crabby and has a fever. What’s going on with her, and what can you
do to help her feel better? Despite your very best efforts, you can count on
the fact that your child is going to get sick from time to time. Infants are also
prone to skin conditions that will have you scratching your head trying to
figure out what’s going on. This section gives you information on the most
common first-year sicknesses and rashes, how to treat symptoms, and when
to call the doctor.
You can’t keep Baby isolated from every ailment, but you can prevent some
of them by practicing good hygiene. Keep in mind that germs lurk on your
hands and in your nose! Handwashing is the key to stopping the spread of
germs.
271
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

Recognizing common illnesses
During her first year, Baby will be exposed to a host of brand new (to her,
anyway) germs. She’ll be able to fight some of them off, but others will take
hold and leave her feeling down and out. The following sections list some
common first-year illnesses, their symptoms, how to treat them, and when to
call the doctor.
Common cold
 Symptoms: Runny or stuffy nose, cough, low-grade fever during the first
48 hours (100 or below), loss of appetite, sleepiness. Contagious.
 Treatment: Symptomatic. Treat runny or stuffy nose, cough, and fever
with over-the-counter cold medicine (call your doctor for recommenda-
tions and dosage information). A cool-mist humidifier may be helpful in
Baby’s bedroom to keep his nasal passages moist (and free from further
irritation).
 Call the doctor: If fever is above 100.5 degrees and baby is younger than
three months, if fever in an older baby is 101 degrees for 3 days, if cough
becomes constant, if loss of appetite continues or increases (may be
signs of infection). Most common secondary infection is otitis media
(see the “Otitis media” section).
Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye)
 Symptoms: Crusty, oozing, itchy, bloodshot eye(s). Very contagious from
person-to-person and from eye-to-eye.
 Treatment: Warm eye soaks (a clean wash cloth soaked in lukewarm
water) will clean the eye and alleviate irritation.
 Call the doctor: Pinkeye is usually short-lived and resolves itself.
However, it often needs treatment with antibiotic eye drops or ointment
(available only by prescription, which means a doctor visit) so that a
child can return to day care.
Croup
 Symptoms: Barking cough, hoarseness, wheezing, difficulty breathing,
fever. Croup is a virus that narrows baby’s airway. It tends to strike at
night, panicking parents and children alike. Croup is contagious.
 Treatment: Turn on the hot water and let your bathroom steam up.
Steam or cold night air work wonders for opening up Baby’s airway. (If
one isn’t working, try the other without delay.) Keep baby calm. Anxiety
tends to worsen the situation. Use a humidifier in Baby’s room until
croup clears up.
272
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

 Call the doctor: Immediately if Baby is clearly struggling for breath, if his
lips are blue, or if steam/cold air treatments aren’t working within sev-
eral minutes. You may be advised to take Baby to the emergency room.
Gastroenteritis
 Symptoms: Fever, nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea.
 Treatment: Continue feeding Baby normally (is he’s breastfed, keep
nursing; if he’s on solids, he may not have much interest in food, but
offer it to him anyway). Increase his fluids to prevent dehydration.
Frequent, small amounts of fluid are best. If Baby doesn’t urinate often,
call the doctor immediately.
 Call the doctor: If Baby appears to be dehydrated (shows signs of exces-
sive thirst, dry mouth and tongue, irritability, dry diapers for hours on
end, sunken soft spot or eyes, restlessness or lethargy), call your pedia-
trician immediately.
Hand-foot-mouth disease (Coxsackie virus)
 Symptoms: Fever, possibly sore throat, loss of appetite. Tiny blisters
appear on Baby’s palms, soles, and/or the inside of his mouth (also may
appear on his bottom or on other parts of his body). The mouth lesions
are very painful. Contagious.
 Treatment: Symptomatic for babies with mouth lesions. Pain reliever
may help. For the older baby on solid foods, keep his diet cold and soft.
 Call the doctor: You can call to describe Baby’s symptoms and rule out
other illnesses.
Influenza (Flu)
 Symptoms: Sudden onset of fever, chills, lethargy, cough. Baby looks ill.
(His eyes are glazed and have circles underneath them; he’s pale; he has
little energy.) May be clingy and/or miserable. Contagious.
 Treatment: Symptomatic. Increase fluids, as babies tend to dehydrate
quickly.
 Call the doctor: Baby should be seen if he looks and/or acts terribly ill
(he’s either inconsolable or completely lacking energy). Your pediatri-
cian will want to evaluate Baby and test him for influenza. (This is done
to rule out sepsis, meningitis, or pneumonia, all of which can produce
symptoms similar to those of influenza.)
Otitis media (Ear infection)
 Symptoms: Usually follows or coincides with a cold or allergy conges-
tion. Baby has a fever, is having difficulty sleeping. May refuse to nurse
or take his bottle due to pain. Bacterial infection; not contagious.
273
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

 Treatment: Pain reliever and antibiotic. A warm compress may help alle-
viate the pain and pressure until Baby is feeling better. Wrap a moist,
warm washcloth in a plastic baggie, wrap that in a thin towel, and lay
Baby on affected side.
 Call the doctor: Call if Baby has symptoms and has recently had a cold.
Pneumonia
 Symptoms: Baby starts out with a cold, which gets worse. He has a fever.
Cough is persistent and productive. He may be wheezing. There are two
types of pneumonia: viral, which is contagious, and bacterial, which is
not.
 Treatment: Symptomatic for fever and aches. Over-the-counter 
pain reliever is recommended for both. Call your doctor for dosing 
information.
 Call the doctor: Call for breathing difficulty, rapid breathing, or wheez-
ing. Check with doctor before giving a cough suppressant (you may be
advised to use it only at night). Increase fluids. Doctor may prescribe an
antibiotic.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection
 Symptoms: Cold symptoms, cough (lasting more than two weeks in
some cases), labored or rapid breathing. Infants may be irritable or
lethargic. Decrease in appetite. Symptoms can last from a few days to a
few weeks. Very common and very contagious. Premature babies and
babies who have chronic lung disease are at risk for developing serious
(even life-threatening) complications from RSV.
 Treatment: Symptomatic. Your focus is on making sure Baby can breathe
easily. To that end, eliminate any irritants (smoke, cold air, and so on)
and consider using a vaporizer in his bedroom.
 Call the doctor: Call your pediatrician if you suspect RSV, because the
virus can occasionally cause significant respiratory distress, which may
require specific therapy (such as bronchodilator meds) or monitoring 
in the hospital. Your pediatrician can also test for RSV to confirm the
diagnosis.
Roseola infantum
 Symptoms: Baby just doesn’t feel well. Fever, runny nose, loss of
appetite. He seems to be feeling better, and suddenly, he’s got spots!
They’re pink, and they’re everywhere. Contagious when the fever is pre-
sent; once spots appear, no longer contagious.
 Treatment: Symptomatic, until the spots appear. After he’s got the rash,
he’s probably feeling better, anyway.
274
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

 Call the doctor: Call to describe symptoms and rash, to confirm the
diagnosis. Also call if fever persists, or if Baby doesn’t seem to be feeling
better.
There are, of course, other illnesses lurking out there (on the handle of the
grocery cart, in the air at the doctor’s office, on the table of your very own
home). Don’t feel silly about calling your pediatrician when Baby is sick, even
if it turns out to be a mild illness in the end. Your doctor will realize that
you’re a mom, and he won’t think any less of you for having your child’s best
interest at heart.
Your baby’s doctor won’t prescribe an antibiotic unless Baby has a bacterial
infection. This is sometimes a complication of a virus (as in the case of an ear
infection — Baby initially gets sick from a virus, and the congestion leads to a
bacterial infection in his ear), but they’re two separate entities. An antibiotic
won’t cure a viral infection; it has to run its course. Overuse (or misuse) of
antibiotics leads to new antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. The bottom
line here: If Baby doesn’t have some sort of bacterial infection, your doctor
won’t (and shouldn’t) give him an antibiotic.
Chafing, itching, and scratching
As though the runny noses and the fevers aren’t enough, every now and then,
Baby may turn up with strange skin issues. Moms often learn through trial
and error that treating a rash incorrectly can make matters worse — and
sometimes the only treatment is no treatment (as in the case of infant acne).
In this section, we go over common infant skin problems and the best ways
to care for them.
Cradle cap
 Appearance: Flaky or crusty patches of dry skin on Baby’s head. Can be
quite thick. Not contagious, just unpleasant to look at. May also be itchy.
 Treatment: For mild cases, try mineral oil or petroleum jelly (and a
comb) to loosen the scales while bathing baby. Tougher cases may
require the use of special shampoos and/or ointments, especially if
cradle cap has spread to Baby’s face and neck. For more on treating
cradle cap, see Chapter 6.
Diaper rash
 Appearance: Raised or flat red patches on Baby’s bottom. If it occurs on
the buttocks or labia, it’s called contact dermatitis; diaper rash that
appears as small pink or red dots around the edges of the rash in the
creases of the skin is candida (yeast infection).
 Treatment: For contact dermatitis, protect Baby’s skin with diaper oint-
ment. Use antifungal cream (available over the counter) on candida.
275
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

Eczema
 Appearance: Itchy, red, bumpy, oozing or weeping, crusty, painful, tiny
red bumps. Usually appears on Baby’s chin or cheeks and in a family
with a history of eczema.
 Treatment: Consult doctor for persistent cases of eczema. Treatment
may consist of applying unscented skin cream, changing your laundry
detergent, limiting baths, changing Baby’s diet, and/or using a topical
steroid ointment.
Heat rash
 Appearance: Bright red rash around neck, armpits, or diaper.
 Treatment: Cool Baby off by removing a layer of clothing or giving a cool
bath.
Hives
 Appearance: Itchy, raised welts on the skin. May be red and widespread.
 Treatment: Hives are sometimes due to an allergy; sometimes they have
no apparent cause. Call your pediatrician to rule out allergic reaction.
Calamine lotion helps to soothe itchiness.
Impetigo
 Appearance: Yellowish crusty blisters that break; weeping skin under-
neath. Very contagious if not treated properly.
 Treatment: Call your doctor if you suspect impetigo. Antibiotic skin oint-
ment will be prescribed. Change and wash any bedding or clothing that
may have been exposed to the blisters.
Milia
 Appearance: Teeny white or yellow dots on Baby’s face. Usually pops up
in the first two weeks of life (if at all).
 Treatment: None. Goes away on its own.
Neonatal acne
 Appearance: Tiny pimples on Baby’s face. Usually appears between 2
weeks and 6 months.
 Treatment: None. Even if you can’t stand to look at it, leave it alone. It
will clear up on its own. Scrubbing the pimples with soap won’t get rid of
them, and may make them worse.
276
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

Taking Baby’s Temperature
Sooner or later, you have to pull out the thermometer you got at your baby
shower and use it on your baby. You have two options when taking an infant’s
temperature: You can take it rectally or under the armpit (which your doctor
will call an axillary temperature).
A rectal temp is the most accurate because it actually measures Baby’s tem-
perature from inside her body. Axillary temps can be off by half a degree or
more, depending on the temperature taker’s skills. For a baby 3 months old
or younger, rectal temps are usually recommended. You can take Baby’s temp
in the armpit after this age, but always make sure you tell your pediatrician
how you took the temperature. He’ll decide how to evaluate it.
Generally speaking, a doctor will subtract a degree from a rectal temp and
add a degree to an axillary temp. Doing this will usually get you in the ball-
park range of Baby’s true temperature.
So how do you take a rectal temperature? First, be calm. Baby’s not feeling
well, and she needs a cool, collected parent to reassure her that everything’s
just fine. For obvious reasons, mark this thermometer for rectal use only. To
take the temp:
1. Wash off the tip of the thermometer and lubricate the end.
2. Lay Baby on her side on a safe surface.
3. Insert the thermometer in about 1⁄2 inch. Never force the thermometer
in, and don’t insert it any further than 1⁄2 inch.
4. When the thermometer beeps, remove it. Read the temperature.
To take an axillary temp, again make sure Baby is quiet and calm. Here’s what
to do:
1. Lay her down and remove her shirt.
2. Put the thermometer in the center of her armpit and then hold her
arm to her side. It’s important to get a good “seal” in her armpit in order
to get the most accurate reading.
3. Hold her in this position for several minutes (usually four to five min-
utes, depending on the brand you use). The thermometer will beep
before that; ignore it and do anything you can think of to amuse this
child so that you won’t have to start all over again.
4. When the time is up, remove the thermometer and read the 
temperature.
277
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

Babies aren’t old enough to have their temperatures taken orally (in the
mouth). Remember, taking a temperature requires cooperation. Your infant
just isn’t capable of sitting still and keeping the thermometer under her
tongue right now.
If you need to actually go out and buy a thermometer, you’ll be faced with
several choices. Obviously, if you need to take Baby’s temperature, you don’t
want to fool around with thermometers that won’t do the job correctly.
Here’s the lowdown on what you’ll find:
 Digital thermometers: Best during Baby’s first year. Very, very easy to
use, and generally pretty reliable. Find a reputable brand (B-D is a good
one), and have two or three on hand. Label one for rectal use only.
 Ear thermometers: Very popular these days, and very easy to use.
However, a child has to be able to sit still in order to get an accurate
reading, and a baby’s ear canal may be too short and too flexible for an
accurate reading. For these reasons, ear thermometers shouldn’t be
used during baby’s first year.
 Mercury (glass) thermometers: Generally discouraged by doctors nowa-
days, because there are so many other safer choices. There’s a risk of
mercury poisoning if the glass breaks (not to mention the risks involved
with broken glass).
 Forehead strips: Not all that reliable, and so not all that recommendable.
 Pacifier thermometers: The problem here is that taking an infant’s tem-
perature requires cooperation. If you have a baby who is screaming in
pain from an ear infection, she’s probably not going to take that pacifier
(because the sucking will only hurt her ear more).
Sneezing and Wheezing: When Allergies
or Asthma Enter the Picture
If you’re a sneezer or wheezer (or your baby’s other parent happens to be
one), be on the lookout for allergies and asthma in your child, particularly if
your allergies developed in childhood. Some of these conditions are thought
to have a hereditary link. The good news is that children often outgrow aller-
gies and asthma; the not-so-good news is that they can cause misery while
they’re around. This section will tell you what to look for and what you can
expect from Baby’s allergies or asthma.
278
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

Environmental allergies
Baby’s been sniffling for weeks on end. Does he have a cold, or is it a sea-
sonal or indoor allergy? Even when you’re the one experiencing the symp-
toms, it can be hard to differentiate between the two. Generally speaking,
though, some telltale signs of allergies are:
 Duration: A cold will usually clear up in 10 to 14 days; allergies linger,
sometimes throughout a season (if it’s a seasonal allergy) and some-
times even longer (if the culprit is a pet or household dust).
 Sneezing: Nasal irritation is really common with allergies.
 Thin, clear drainage from his nose: Nasal discharge from a cold tends
to be yellow or green, and thick.
 Dark circles under the eyes: Also, redness and itchiness in and around
the eyes.
 Itchy nose: May be indicated by Baby rubbing his nose with his hand or
rubbing it on something.
 Dry cough: Due to postnasal drip.
 Rash: Indicates a sensitivity to an allergen.
 A tendency to breathe through the mouth: Because Baby’s poor little
nose is stuffy.
The predisposition for allergies is inherited in many cases. Because allergies
develop over a period of many months (and repeated exposure), environmen-
tal allergies are not as common in babies as food allergies are.
If you suspect Baby has an allergy and can’t find any obvious cause, call your
pediatrician. He may recommend taking Baby to an allergist for testing.
Finding food allergies
Introducing food to Baby is an exciting step during the first year, but remain
aware of food allergies and the types of symptoms they can cause. The most
common allergy-causing foods are cow’s milk, strawberries, egg whites, wheat,
and soy. Shellfish and peanuts can also cause allergies, triggering severe (even
life-threatening) reactions in some cases, and most doctors recommend that
you avoid feeding these to Baby during his first year of life. For more informa-
tion on food allergies, see Chapter 11.
279
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

Common reactions that indicate a food allergy include:
 A rash
 Itchy mouth
 Gastrointestinal distress (cramps, diarrhea, vomiting)
 Wheezing
 Hives
 Runny nose
 Abnormal crying
A more severe reaction called anaphylactic shock involves some of the above
symptoms (cramping, hives, a tingly feeling in the mouth, especially if the
allergen is a nut) as well as difficulty breathing, a loss of consciousness, and
possibly death. If you notice that your child is reacting severely to a food, get
him to the hospital without delay.
Studies suggest that introducing solids to infants before their digestive sys-
tems can handle it (before 4 to 6 months) may actually cause certain food
allergies. In any event, try to introduce one food at a time, waiting several
days before introducing another new food so that if a reaction does occur,
you can easily pinpoint the cause.
Identifying asthma
Baby may wheeze for all sorts of reasons, and not all of them indicate that
she is asthmatic. Many viruses can further narrow an infant’s already-small
airway and cause her to wheeze. However, asthma (a lung condition in which
overly-sensitive airways constrict in reaction to an irritant) is definitely on
the rise in this country, and whether it’s because of an increase in environ-
mental causes (such as pollution) or because it’s being diagnosed earlier and
better than in past generations, the fact is it’s the most-diagnosed chronic
condition in children.
Because infants’ lung capacity can’t be measured effectively, it’s difficult to
diagnose asthma until a child is a bit older and able to cooperate in lung func-
tion testing. Wheezing is a common symptom. Rapid breathing, and overuse
of the chest and neck muscles while inhaling are other asthma indicators.
Many doctors take a family history into consideration when determining an
infant’s symptoms: Do the child’s parents have asthma? Does this child have
other allergies? These conditions make asthma more likely.
280
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

Treatment for infants with asthma usually entails using a nebulizer, a machine
that vaporizes asthma medicine so that the child can easily inhale it.
Be aware that infants may wheeze for reasons other than asthma. Babies
have smaller airways than older children, and a bout with an upper respira-
tory virus may be enough to make Baby sound like he’s whistling while he
breathes. Nevertheless, call your pediatrician if Baby is wheezing; the doctor
can make the determination as to the cause.
Correcting Crossed or Lazy Eyes
During Baby’s regular checkups, she’ll be screened for the most common infant
vision problems, strabismus (crossed eyes) and amblyopia (sometimes called
“lazy eye”). (For an example of what strabismus looks like, see Figure 18-1.)
Figure 18-1:
Strabismus
in an infant.
281
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy
The mayhem milk may cause
There’s sometimes a bit of confusion between
milk allergy and lactose intolerance. A milk
allergy is actually caused by the body’s immune
system reacting adversely to the proteins in milk;
lactose intolerance, on the other hand, occurs
when the body is missing an enzyme needed to
digest the sugar in cow’s milk or in formula. If
Baby is allergic to milk, he may develop hives,
eczema, bloating, diarrhea, blood in the stool,
nausea, and vomiting. Lactose intolerance tends
to cause the gastrointestinal upset without the
skin reactions. The good news is that most chil-
dren will outgrow a milk allergy by about 
18 months. Lactose intolerance, however, may
persist.

Parents sometimes notice that something seems amiss with Baby’s eyes.
Maybe one is crossing, or one is slower to track an object than the other eye
is. If you’re concerned about Baby’s vision, make sure to mention it to your
pediatrician during your next visit. Depending on Baby’s age and how severe
your doctor judges the problem to be, he may recommend sending Baby to
an ophthalmologist right away, where a more in-depth exam of the eyes can
be done.
The good news is that when these conditions are diagnosed early, they’re very
treatable with glasses, surgery, or a combination of both. (Allowing them to 
go untreated, on the other hand, may result in the loss of vision in one eye).
Family history tends to play a part in the diagnosis of these particular vision
problems.
Loving Your Special Needs Child
Some parents go into the delivery room knowing that there’s a problem with
the pregnancy and that their child will be born with an abnormality; for
others, a birth defect or premature labor comes as a complete shock. Either
way, accepting the reality of having a sick child can be extremely difficult. In
fact, it’s every parent’s worst fear come true.
Regardless of whether you had forewarning about Baby’s condition, you can’t
truly prepare yourself for this experience. You may feel devastated, terrified,
angry, or guilty, thinking that you could have done something to prevent this
from happening. Accept your feelings. Allow yourself to be angry or sad —
but don’t try to handle overpowering emotions on your own. Look for sup-
port — from your partner, from family members, from a support group, or
from a therapist or counselor.
Keep in mind during this difficult time that becoming a parent can be an over-
whelming experience, even when a child is completely healthy. Knowing that
your child — for whom you feel completely responsible — may have to
endure even a short period of illness and/or discomfort can make you feel
like the entire world is crashing down around you. This isn’t what you
expected. It isn’t fair. You’d change places with Baby in a nanosecond if you
could.
Get information on your child’s condition. Knowing what to expect can help
ease your mind — often, what you fear may happen to your child is worse
than coming to terms with the reality of his condition. The March of Dimes
provides parents with pertinent information on birth defects; there are also
national groups presenting information on specific conditions — the Spina
282
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

Bifida Association of America, for example. You can ask your doctor or NICU
staff for the names of groups they recommend. Also check out your local
library and the Internet, if you have a connection.
After the initial shock and fear subside, you’ll feel that bond between parent
and child begin to grow — don’t let fear stop you from holding, talking to,
and most importantly, loving Baby. No matter what his prognosis is, he’s your
child, and this is your parenting experience. There’s no point in comparing it
to what you expected (even parents of healthy newborns have to let go of
predelivery fantasies). Cherish him for who he is — your precious child.
Birth defects
Many birth defects can be prevented. Folic acid is an incredibly effective pre-
ventive measure — some estimates state that as many as 75 percent of neural
tube defects (including spina bifida) can be prevented by adequate intake of
folic acid during pregnancy. Other recommendations include:
 Wait to get pregnant until any underlying medical conditions (such as
diabetes or seizures) are under control.
 Avoid alcohol and tobacco in the months prior to and during pregnancy.
 Avoid illicit drugs (you hate to think it, but many people think marijuana
is no big deal).
 Lead a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy. Eat well, get plenty of rest,
and follow an exercise plan.
 Talk to your obstetrician before taking any prescription or over-the-
counter drugs during pregnancy.
But, of course, not every birth defect is preventable. If your child is born with
an abnormality, your may want to curl up and disappear — but you must deal
with what’s happening. Although your child is in good hands with the hospi-
tal staff, you’re his number one advocate. You need to find out what can be
done to minimize the effects of his condition.
Depending on your child’s specific condition, he may need the intervention of
several specialists, including medical specialists and physical, speech, or
occupational therapists. Providing him with early care can have a profound
effect on the quality of his life. A child who is born with clubfoot, for example,
may benefit most by being treated as early as possible, even in his earliest
weeks and months. Left untreated, the foot may not grow properly; the child
will be limited in his activities; and his emotional state may suffer because
he’s different from his peers.
283
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

Other birth defects are obviously more severe and their long-term effects can
be far more devastating, as in severe cases of spina bifida. But many children
can be taught to care for themselves to a large degree — and the earlier
they’re taught, the more successful they’re bound to be. The level of self-care
a child is able to undertake also affects his level of self-esteem by giving him
a measure of control.
Premature births
A child born three or more weeks before her due date is considered prema-
ture (often called a preemie). There are differing degrees of prematurity, of
course, and a child who is born at 35 weeks gestation is going to suffer far
fewer short- and long-term effects than a child who is born at 30 weeks.
Simply put, the longer Baby stays in the womb, the more time she has to
finish the business of developing her internal organs and nervous system —
the areas that are most often seriously affected by premature birth.
A premature child’s weight is measured in grams instead of pounds; preemies
can fall anywhere between 500 grams (about 1 pound) and 2,500 grams
(about 51⁄2 pounds). The more a preemie weighs at birth, the better. One prob-
lem that’s common to premature infants is their lack of body fat — something
we all need for insulation. Premature babies just can’t regulate their body
heat, even if they’re wrapped up in a nice, warm blanket. This is why you see
preemies in incubators or radiant warmers.
Feeding difficulties are another common issue with preemies. A child who is
born prior to 32 to 34 weeks hasn’t developed the sucking reflex necessary
for breast- or bottlefeeding. Because preemies also have immature digestive
systems and are at risk for an infection of the intestine, they often need to be
fed through a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach.
A baby born prior to her due date will be catching up on those weeks for
some time to come. Take a look at a child who has been born two months
early: The parents of this child would subtract two months from their child’s
age to determine where she is developmentally. For example, at 4 months,
she’ll be doing what a typical 2-month-old can do. Children catch up at differ-
ent times, depending on the severity of their conditions. Some catch up
within the first couple of years; some will always lag behind a bit.
Getting to know the NICU
Most new parents don’t expect to spend Baby’s first few days or weeks in 
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) — but it happens in cases of serious
284
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

birth defects and premature births. With all the life-saving equipment, high-
tech gadgets, and medical jargon whirring all around you, you may feel over-
whelmed. Babies in the NICU are often hooked up to monitors and feeding
tubes, and are sometimes placed in incubators. In some cases, holding your
newborn may be impossible because of health concerns. Your doctors will
explain exactly how much contact is allowed between you and your baby.
Although all new parents have many questions for their doctors and nurses,
the parents of a child who is in the NICU may feel too stunned to speak — or
too scared to ask anything of anyone. The staff in the NICU will help your
entire family through this experience; they know how difficult and frightening
it is to have a sick newborn. They will welcome your questions and do their
best to answer them, so don’t be afraid to ask. If you do run across someone
who doesn’t seem inclined to answer your questions, ask someone else. Keep
asking until you get a satisfactory answer. Remember: You are your child’s
number one advocate, and you have every right to know what’s going on with
her condition.
The good news is that medical science continues to forge new paths in the
treatment of birth defects and premature births. In the past decade, the age of
a viable premature fetus has dropped from 27 weeks to 23, and new advances
in the study and management of birth defects are being made all the time. Your
baby is in a safe place with a very competent and caring staff.
Your neonatologist is a pediatrician who has spent four years in med school,
three years in a pediatric residency, and another three years studying neona-
tology, the care of sick newborns and infants. Most large NICUs have a team
of neonatologists working around the clock, along with dozens of well-trained
nurses, several respiratory and physical therapists, and a nutritionist. Your
child will be well-assessed and receive all the care that she needs.
Most NICUs allow parents to visit 24 hours a day, but may have restrictions
on other family members, particularly small children. Check the visitation
policy before bringing a younger sibling by to see the baby.
Forging the connection
Parents of children who are born with birth defects often feel left out of the
“new baby scene,” because their children tend to have developmental delays.
Your parenting experience will differ from the average mom and dad on the
street; in addition, you may be faced with difficult personal situations. You’re
not alone. This section addresses some of the things you may be experienc-
ing at this time and suggests ways to move through them.
285
Chapter 18: Keeping Baby Healthy

By this time, you’ve probably accepted and have figured out how to cope
with your child’s specific health problems and special needs. If you haven’t,
though, or if each day is bringing you only sadness or depression, you must
seek professional help in the form of a therapist, counselor, or support group.
No one is going to chide you for feeling the way you do, but you need to
move toward acceptance — for your sake as well as your child’s.
It’s easy for parents of special needs kids to get overwhelmed (and stay that
way); it’s normal to feel angry or sad from time to time; you may even ques-
tion whether you love this child as much as you would have if he had been
born without any problems.
It can be extremely difficult to let go of the images you formed while you were
pregnant: You had the perfect baby in the perfect home, and everyone was
happy, happy, happy. Realize that this was just a fantasy (because even par-
ents of comparatively healthy children sometimes have a very difficult time
settling into life as parents) and discover how to live in the here and now.
You’ve been dealt this hand of cards: What are you going to do with it?
Depression is a common reaction, especially if your child needs constant
medical care (or intermittent testing or surgery). Recognize what you can
handle on your own, and when it may be time to seek out professional
advice. And then do it. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain in the
process.
Don’t know where to find a good therapist or counselor? You can start by
asking your primary physician or your child’s pediatrician. You may also
begin by calling your health insurance company for a list of providers and
then ask your doctor for his recommendations based on the names on that
list. Your pediatrician may be able to lead you in the general direction of a
support group.
Keeping your relationship with your mate together also becomes a major
issue when dealing with a child who has special needs, especially if one or
both of you are the primary caregiver to a child who needs constant care.
Look for ways to help one another, accept outside offers of assistance, talk to
each other about how you’re feeling, and look for a couples’ therapist if you
need to. You can work this and get past these feelings of doubt and sadness,
and you can do so together.
Dealing with the public
“What’s wrong with your baby?” Kind of makes your stomach churn and your
hair stand up on end, doesn’t it? Although this may be nothing new to you at
this point, especially if your child’s birth defect or special needs are physi-
cally apparent, as time goes on, the developmental differences between your
child and other kids may become more pronounced. You’ll no doubt be faced
286
Part VI: Protecting Baby's Health and Safety 

with answering this question at some point — and the questioner may not be
a complete clod, which will probably only upset you more — you wonder
how anyone who seems like a decent enough person could be so insensitive.
(Because, in fact, you know there’s nothing wrong with your child — he has
health issues that most kids don’t have. That simply makes him different.)
So how do you answer this question? It depends on a few things:
 Who’s asking: Obviously, you’re obliged to be a bit more open with
family members and close friends than with total strangers. First, you
know that your loved ones are asking because they are truly interested
in your child; you also know that they’re going to accept what you’re
telling them.
 How much you feel like disclosing: A stranger doesn’t need to know all
the details of your child’s condition — unless you feel like getting into
the whole story, and this person happens to be truly interested. Be
aware that this person could be asking about your child to be polite —
don’t overload her with a two-hour tale.
 Your level of tolerance for this discussion: You’re never obligated to
disclose any details to anyone, but be aware that the less you’re willing
to say, the more people are going to assume. It’s perfectly all right to
give the person just the basic facts and to say no more.
This is all fine and well when you’re dealing with someone who is sensitive —
what do you say to someone who asks what you (or your spouse) did to
cause your child’s condition? Or, in the case of adoption, how should you
answer someone who asks why you would have ever brought a child with
such problems into your home?
In these cases, you’re well within your rights to tell the other person the
truth — that despite your child’s problems, and perhaps because of them
(after all, this is a part of who he is), you love him. Depending on the situa-
tion, you may strive to give this person a brief tutorial — separating the facts
from fictitious fears — regarding your child’s condition (if this happens to be
a family member who’ll be in your child’s life on a regular basis), or you may
choose to walk away (if you hardly know this person anyway and/or you
know there’s nothing you can do to impress upon him that your child is the
love of your life).
Walking away is just fine, by the way. Though informing people goes a long
way toward quelling fear and misunderstanding of birth defects in many
instances, some misguided people spend their days judging not only your
child, but everyone else. See that attitude for what it is and let it go. It’s their
loss, not yours.

Making It All Better: When Baby
Has a Boo-Boo
In This Chapter
 Staying calm when faced with an injury
 Stocking the first-aid kit
 Evaluating cuts, scrapes, bumps, and bruises
 Treating stings and bites
 Soothing a burn
P
arents seldom want to read about potential injuries (the thought of Baby
bleeding is just too much to bear), so if you’re leafing through this sec-
tion, chances are you need help either determining the severity of an injury
or dealing with the reality of one. We give you an overview of common
mishaps and what to do about them.
This chapter is not a replacement for your intuition as a parent. If Baby has
suffered a fall or other injury and is crying uncontrollably, is unusually
groggy, or is otherwise showing signs of distress, call your pediatrician with-
out delay. Some injuries can have internal effects that may not be obvious.
Playing the Part of the Calm Parent
Remaining calm when your child is hurting can be very difficult. You can
almost feel Baby’s pain, and her fearful reaction is hard to watch. That’s
exactly why it’s so important to put your own fears on hold and to soothe her.

She learns almost everything by watching you. Her immediate reaction to a
cut finger may be to cry — it hurts, after all. Your reaction may determine how
long she cries, and how she reacts to future injuries, as well. Imagine two sce-
narios: In the first, you calmly pick her up, sing to her as you wash out the cut,
dry it, and bandage it. Depending on Baby’s temperament, she may continue
to cry, or she may be satisfied by your no-big-deal attitude that this injury is,
in fact, not the end of the world. Either way, you have demonstrated through
your actions that you believe she is going to be just fine.
In the second scenario, you see your child’s blood and freak out. You’re call-
ing for your partner, neighbor, mother, mailman — anyone available to help
you wash out a cut and apply a bandage to it. Baby sees the look of pure
panic on your face and decides that this is a bad situation — it’s very, very
bad. She wails in terror, and becomes inconsolable.
No one is going to blame a parent for reacting strongly to her child’s injury —
but concealing those emotions (at least temporarily) is often best. As time
goes on, you figure out which injuries are serious (dangling limbs, profuse
and uncontrollable bleeding) and which aren’t (scrapes and minor bruises).
You also discover how to save your emotional energy for when it’s most
needed (say, for soothing a child who has taken a serious tumble versus icing
and elevating every tiny bump). Otherwise, especially if you have a very
active child, you wear yourself out.
Calm reaction to injury is also important because Baby is learning — and she
needs the space and confidence to trust her new abilities, or else she may be
so fearful of every little fall that she won’t try anything new. This isn’t to say
that you shouldn’t protect your precious child from dangerous situations: If
Baby is pulling herself up using a rickety table, you’re right to make a dra-
matic save. But if you insist on holding her every time she tries to take a step
on her own, she’s not going to learn much about the physics of walking.
Stocking Your First-Aid Kit
Every home should have a first-aid kit stocked and ready for action. A kit dif-
fers from what you most likely already have on hand in your medicine cabi-
net (thermometer, medicine spoons, and the like), and should be in its own
mobile container (something like a tackle box — with dividers and drawers).
Your first-aid kit needs to be accessible and portable. Take it along on day
trips or vacations. 
Make sure you include:
 Bandages in all sizes
 Antibiotic ointment or cream
290
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

 Sterile gauze (roll and pads)
 First-aid adhesive tape (to secure gauze)
 Sharp scissors (to cut the tape)
 Liquid soap (to wash out wounds)
 Alcohol wipes (you may be without water for cleansing a wound)
 Tweezers (for removing splinters, gravel, thorns, and such)
 Pain reliever (acetaminophen or ibuprofen — not aspirin)
 Sunscreen
 One percent hydrocortisone cream (comes in handy for soothing bug
bites, sunburn, and even inflamed diaper rash)
 Benzocaine (for sudden teething attacks)
 Insect repellent
 Benadryl (diphenhydramine) for allergic reactions
 Your doctor’s phone number
You can buy prepared kits in most drug stores. Before you purchase one,
make sure it includes everything on this list — and add your pediatrician’s
number immediately.
Playing Dr. Mom
Bumps, cuts, and scrapes are common injuries babies encounter in the first
year, especially when they start moving. Rolling, crawling, pulling up, and
walking are major milestones — but each one comes with an inherent risk of
injury. Most such injuries are fairly mild and nothing for you to lose any sleep
over. Some, though, will leave you wondering whether Baby should be
whisked off to the emergency room. This section covers the ins and outs of
treating mild injuries and helps you to determine what kinds of injuries qual-
ify as emergencies.
Caring for scrapes, cuts, and bruises
As Baby becomes more independent, he may also become more injury-prone.
Knowing how to judge the severity of an injury becomes incredibly important.
Not every injury, of course, is life-threatening — but not all serious injuries
291
Chapter 19: Making It All Better: When Baby Has a Boo-Boo

present themselves as such immediately. In other words, what seems to be a
not-so-serious hurt may be worse than you think. Fortunately, most children
make it through the physical trials and tribulations of early childhood no
worse for the wear.
Scrapes
Scrapes are usually fairly mild injuries, even though they’re sometimes awful
to look at. Wash out a scrape as soon as you can. This will probably sting, so
the best way to do this is by using warm, soapy water and distracting Baby
by singing or talking to him. And of course, be very gentle. Take as much time
as Baby will allow, wash out as much debris as you can, apply an antibiotic
ointment, and bandage the scrape.
If Baby has fallen on gravel or dirt, you may have to remove tiny rocks or
other foreign objects from the wound. If you’re at home (or when you return
home), let him soak in the bath to remove any rocks or dirt you weren’t able
to get at. (You can use tweezers if Baby will allow you to.) If you’re not at
home, find a clean water source (a sink is good; a puddle is not) and wash out
the scrape as much as possible, as soon as possible.
Cuts
You can’t always tell how deep cuts are. Wash a cut out with warm, soapy
water. If it’s a minor bleeding laceration, bandage it and send Baby on his
way. Make sure to change a bandage at least daily, and more often if it gets
dirty. If a bandage is sticking to Baby’s skin like glue, rub it with some mineral
oil. This should loosen its grip on Baby within a few minutes. As soon as a cut
forms a scab, it doesn’t need a bandage anymore. If a cut becomes red,
swollen, or otherwise infected-looking, call your pediatrician. Most cuts will
heal on their own with no need for medical intervention (other than a kiss
from Dr. Mom).
Minor cuts don’t always need a bandage; in fact, some cuts heal more quickly
if they’re exposed to the air.
If a cut is bleeding profusely, elevate it (hold it up so it’s above Baby’s heart),
if possible, and apply pressure with a clean paper towel or sterile gauze, if
you have some handy (See Figure 19-1). For example, if Baby has cut his hand,
raise it up over his head while you gently press down on the injury. If his foot
is bleeding, lie him down and raise his foot above his chest level. Applying
pressure should stop bleeding within ten minutes. If Baby’s cut is still going
strong after this time, call your doctor right away. Baby may need stitches.
292
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Never use a tourniquet on a baby! Tourniquets can do more harm than good,
and should be used only in the most extreme cases where nothing else will
stop the hemorrhaging. Firm pressure will stop the bleeding in almost any
wound.
The following signs let you know that a wound needs to be stitched up:
 Leaves a gaping wound. Those edges won’t close themselves, leaving
the wound open to infections and scarring.
 Is more than 1⁄4-inch deep. That’s too deep for the edges to close on
their own.
 Has jagged edges. Clean cuts are more likely to close and heal without
scarring.
 Is significant and located on the face. You can’t rush Baby in every 
time he scratches himself on the cheek, but deep facial cuts are likely to
leave scars.
 Is significant and located in an area unlikely to promote healing.
Chins. Knees. Fingers. Places where the skin is not going to stay closed
without a little help.
Puncture wounds
Because puncture wounds are difficult to clean, infection is a concern. Wash
the wound with warm, soapy water for several minutes and evaluate any
Figure 19-1:
Elevate a
cut that
bleeds
profusely.
293
Chapter 19: Making It All Better: When Baby Has a Boo-Boo

bleeding. Profuse bleeding that doesn’t stop with elevation and direct pres-
sure (applied for ten minutes) is cause for concern. Call your doctor’s office
right away to determine whether Baby needs to be seen (and stitched up) in
the office.
If the offender was a neighbor’s pet, you need to make sure — and see in 
writing — that this animal is up to date on his shots, and in any event, call
your pediatrician. If Baby cut herself on a rusty nail or something equally
unsanitary, call your pediatrician right away. Watch for foreign bodies in the
puncture wound (cat/dog teeth, pieces of a thorn). If left in the wound, these
will cause infection. Baby may need antibiotics.
Bruises
Bruises usually don’t need any special treatment. Basically, as kids learn to
stand and walk, they take their tumbles. And after they perfect their walking,
the bruises will probably be even more plentiful, because they can do even
more. Black-and-blue marks are most often just a sign that Baby is a busy guy. 
Bruises that come on suddenly with the onset of a fever, however, should be
evaluated by Baby’s doctor.
Handling head injuries
Cuts to the head bleed a lot. The head is chock-full of blood vessels, which is
what often makes these cuts seem worse than they really are. You may think
Baby is losing every ounce of blood he has, and then you realize that the cut
is actually pretty minor. Same rule of thumb applies here as to cuts elsewhere
on the body: Apply firm pressure. Evaluate the bleeding after ten minutes.
Anything jagged or deep or both or located on Baby’s face needs further eval-
uation by your doctor.
Bumps to the head are common injuries sustained by babies everywhere —
and the resulting anxiety over these bumps is shared by their parents.
Watching your child fall and hit his head is traumatic. If he pops right back 
up and seems fine — and continues to behave normally — he’s probably 
all right, even if he has a “goose egg” where he hit his head. These huge
bumps are evidence of the injury sustained to the blood vessels in your
child’s head — a goose egg (horrible looking as it is) doesn’t indicate any
injury to Baby’s brain. Put an ice pack on it for 20 minutes to help alleviate
the swelling.
An accelerated head injury (falling off the counter, into the wall, or down the
stairs, especially in a walker, which holds an infant in an upright position) is
more likely to cause a concussion or serious brain injury than falling from a
standing position onto the floor. (These latter types of falls rarely cause sig-
nificant brain injury.)
294
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

A concussion is an injury to Baby’s brain and is a serious matter. If Baby has
sustained a knock to his head, keep an eye out for the warning signs of con-
cussion for the next 24 hours and contact your pediatrician immediately if
your child exhibits any of the following symptoms:
 Loss of consciousness
 Unusual pallor
 Dilated or large pupils (one pupil may look larger or not react when a
flashlight is shined into the eye)
 Irritability (included prolonged crying) or lethargy
 Vomiting
 Loss of physical coordination (unable to crawl, walk, or move as he did
before he bumped his head)
 Discharge from ears (bloody or watery), which could be a sign of a skull
fracture
If Baby bumps his head in the evening, he can go to bed, but do check on him
frequently throughout the night — at least once every two hours. Make sure
his breathing is normal, he isn’t in any sort of distress, that you can wake him,
and he appears to recognize you.
Dealing with mouth injuries
Mouth injuries, like head injuries, tend to bleed a lot. Fortunately, when an
injury in the mouth is a cut or an abrasion, stemming the flow of blood is
pretty easy. An ice cube is usually sufficient to stop any bleeding.
Occasionally, though, teeth get involved in the act. Baby may fall and chip a
tooth on the coffee table — or she may knock it out completely. And after
baby teeth are out, they’re out for good. Your main concern is an infection in
the gums (which appear red and swollen or are oozing pus) or, in the case of
a badly chipped tooth, Baby’s appearance.
If Baby has sustained a major injury to her teeth and gums, call your pediatri-
cian during normal office hours. You want to make sure that Baby’s teeth
haven’t been knocked completely out of line and you also want to make sure
she hasn’t injured any of the surrounding teeth. Your doctor can tell you
whether Baby needs to see a dentist. A tooth that has turned brown or gray
may have sustained a sufficient injury to kill the root. If you notice this, go
ahead and call your dentist yourself.
295
Chapter 19: Making It All Better: When Baby Has a Boo-Boo

Surviving sprains and fractures
Although a baby’s bones are more flexible than an adult’s (making actual
breaks rare), those little bones contain growth plates that are easily damaged
by trauma. Baby’s long bones can sustain what’s called a greenstick fracture.
(Picture trying to break a fresh branch. It doesn’t snap cleanly; it just kind of
separates.)
If Baby sustains a major fall or injury, he can suffer a sprain (a torn or stretched
ligament) or a fracture (a break or crack in a bone). The two injuries have
some of the same symptoms, including:
 Bruising
 Swelling
 Extreme pain
 Inability to use an arm or leg or to bear weight on it
A fracture also has the following symptoms:
 Crookedness or deformity of the limb or extremity (including a protru-
sion of the bone)
 Increase in pain with movement of affected area
Ice and elevate a suspected sprain or fracture and call your pediatrician right
away. Any injury that causes pain and swelling of a bone needs to be evaluated
as soon as possible. Your pediatrician may ask you to feel around the injured
area to locate any obvious areas of pain. Tell your doctor if there is a cut or
open wound over the area of concern — this could be an open fracture and
needs antibiotics to prevent infection.
296
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 
Nursemaid’s elbow
Dads, especially, love to swing their children
’round and ’round, holding them by the hands or
wrists. This can lead to a common problem
called nursemaid’s elbow (official name: radial
head sublaxation). When a child’s extended arm
is pulled in this way, it may lead to discomfort or
flat-out refusal to use the arm. (Your child may,
for example, reach for a toy and hold her arm
bent at the elbow and across her chest.) The
injury can also be caused by pulling up on the
arm of a child who is just learning to walk.
Fortunately, this is usually easily remedied with
a painless procedure in the pediatrician’s office
in which the elbow is popped back into place.

Caring for Stings and Bites
You and Baby are lying on a blanket in the grass, loving the lazy summer
afternoon, when suddenly — without warning or provocation — Baby howls
in pain. Her first sting. Ouch. If your child is very upset, distract her with a
treat or a TV show (this is one of the only times when it’s okay to use the
boob tube to calm your child).
Then use the blunt edge of something — your nail, a butter knife, a stiff piece
of paper to remove the stinger. Don’t use tweezers, and don’t try to pinch the
stinger between your nails, because this could release more venom into
Baby’s skin. Scrape the stinger out of the wound, wash the area with soapy
water, and apply an ice pack. However, the stinger will usually leave with the
offending insect right away.
Applying a paste of baking soda and water to a bee sting is an age-old 
remedy — and one that really seems to help reduce swelling and itching.
Another popular home remedy involves rubbing meat tenderizer on the 
sting. You may want to try these, or you may try calamine lotion.
Stings carry the risk of severe allergic reaction in some children. These kids
will usually show signs of being hypersensitive before they develop the actual
allergy to an insect bite, which indicates that they are developing an allergy
to the venom — and any future bites could be deadly. Because the signs of
hypersensitivity are not always severe (and because your child may be stung
when you’re not with her), there’s always the possibility of missing the signs
of hypersensitivity — in which case, you won’t even know that your child is
at risk for a major allergic reaction to her next sting. What this means, in a
nutshell, is this: Your child can be stung several times and appear to be okay.
If she has a hypersensitivity to the venom, her next sting could send her into
a severe allergic reaction — even though she’s never had one before. If you
didn’t notice the signs of hypersensitivity, you won’t see the allergic reaction
coming.
If your child is short of breath or has extreme pain or swelling following an
insect bite, call your doctor immediately. These are signs of hypersensitivity.
Baby may enter anaphylactic shock (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction),
which could result in death. If your child exhibits any of the following symp-
toms after being stung by any insect, seek medical attention without delay:
 Hives
 Nausea and/or vomiting
 Hoarseness and/or coughing
297
Chapter 19: Making It All Better: When Baby Has a Boo-Boo

 Difficulty breathing (including wheezing)
 Swelling of the face, tongue, lips, ears, eyelids, palms, soles, or mucous
membranes
 Headache, dizziness, or fainting
A child who is diagnosed with a hypersensitivity to stings may be prescribed
an emergency syringe of epinephrine, which you’ll need to keep on hand
whenever you go outdoors. This medicine temporarily counteracts the effects
of the venom and prevents your child from going into anaphylactic shock.
Ticks
Deer ticks can carry and transmit Lyme disease, which is caused by a toxin
that can be transmitted from a deer tick to a human. Long-term effects may
include stiff joints, rashes, and flulike symptoms.
If Baby has a tick, smother it with petroleum jelly to kill it and then try to
remove it with tweezers (the petroleum jelly should ease its removal, as
well). Get as close to the tick’s head as possible, and pull it up and straight
out. Don’t try to pick at it, or to remove it by twisting it. Also, don’t try to
remove the tick by using the head of an extinguished match or applying
kerosene to kill it. You’re putting your child at risk by using these potentially
harmful agents.
You need to get as much of the tick as possible out from under the skin.
Leaving bits and pieces behind defeats the purpose and puts Baby at risk for
developing Lyme disease
After you remove the tick, kill it, save it in a plastic sandwich bag, and call
your pediatrician. He’ll determine whether this is a deer tick, for starters, and
then decide if treatment is necessary. Some doctors are very proactive and
will prescribe antibiotics for any child who has had a tick removed, but many
are more laid-back, opting instead to wait and see if the child develops the
tell-tale bull’s-eye rash (a rash that forms around the bite site and looks
exactly like it sounds) before prescribing treatment.
Prevention is key with Lyme disease. Though it’s most prevalent in the
Northeastern United States, there have been cases reported across the coun-
try. If you’re headed into the woods or Baby is playing in the grass, cover her
as much as possible. Tuck those pant legs into her socks, and give her long
sleeves to wear. Do a thorough tick check when you return home, especially
focusing on Baby’s head.
Remove a tick as soon as you spot it. It takes a tick at least 24 hours to
“share” enough of his bacteria to cause Lyme disease in a human host.

Treating Burns
Burns can blister and lead to infection, so it’s important to evaluate and care
for a burn properly. Ideally, it’s best to prevent burns altogether, of course.
Chapter 20 provides tips for keeping Baby burn-free. This section will give
you an overview of what burns may look like, how to soothe them, and when
to call the doctor.
Thermal burns
When most people think of burns, they think of thermal burns — burns from
fire, scalding, or contact with a hot object. These burns are classified by how
many layers of skin have been affected. The signs of each are listed in Table
19-1 (first- and second-degree symptoms are also used to classify sunburns).
Table 19-1 
Classification of Burns and Their Symptoms
Burn
Symptoms
First degree or 
The top layer of the skin is involved. Expect the area to 
superficial burn
be dry, pink or red, and somewhat painful. No blistering 
is involved.
Second degree 
Burn goes into the deeper layers of skin. Dark red, 
or partial 
swollen, quite painful, blistered. Skin may “weep” or 
thickness burn
appear moist due to exposed underlying tissue.
Third degree or full 
All layers of skin affected. Skin may appear pearly white 
thickness burn
or charred; painless (nerve endings destroyed).
If Baby suffers a relatively mild thermal burn at home, remove clothing from
the area and cool the skin. If he has burned his hand, fill a large bowl with
cold water and stick his hand in it (or put him in a cool bath — whatever will
work better) for 20 minutes. If he has burned his face, apply a wet, cool com-
press. Burns to the hands or face should always be evaluated by Baby’s doctor.
Don’t use any home remedies that advise applying butter or oil to burns.
These materials hold heat inside the skin, making the burn even worse.
Increase Baby’s fluids, and give him acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate
any pain. Cover any blisters with an antibiotic ointment and a loose bandage.
Don’t break the blisters! Not only does this put the wound at risk for infection,
299
Chapter 19: Making It All Better: When Baby Has a Boo-Boo

it also disrupts the healing process. Call the doctor for further evaluation for
all but the most minor burns. There is a risk of shock (the body shutting
down its major systems) involved with some burns.
If Baby shows signs of third degree burns (charred or pearly skin) get him to
the hospital immediately.
Sunburns
Nowadays, everyone knows that exposing bare skin to the sun is a bad idea.
Ideally, children younger than 1 year old should be kept out of the sun; their
skin is just too sensitive. We know, though, that sometimes babies are out 
in sun, so we offer some tips for keeping her burn free. And if you’re only
reading this after allowing Baby to play outside on a hot, sunny day, or if
Baby’s sunscreen didn’t do its job, this section will tell you how to care 
for Baby’s burn.
Here are some tips for keeping Baby sunburn-free:
 Protect children older than 6 months with sunscreen of at least 30 SPF.
 Use sunscreen liberally, and apply it at least 20 minutes before your child
goes outside to give it time to absorb into her skin. Reapply according to
label instructions (every couple of hours and after swimming).
 No matter what the label says, though, if your child is looking red and
burned — even though she’s wearing 45 SPF — she’s getting red and
burned. Get her inside and keep her there.
 Get Baby a sun hat — and do everything you can to keep it on her head.
For best results, look for something with a wide brim so that it will
shade her face and the back of her neck. (Boys’ hats also come with
wide brims and/or “tails” that hang down from the back of a baseball hat.)
Don’t use sunscreen on babies younger than 6 months. Kids this age tend to
have their hands in their mouths all the time, and because they’re not really
mobile, it’s easy enough to keep them out of the sun and/or in long clothing,
which is your safest option.
If Baby does get sunburned, she’ll be very unhappy. You can expect her skin
to be red and hot. Help her feel better by:
 Increasing her fluid intake to prevent dehydration
 Dipping her into a cool bath
 Giving her pain reliever (acetaminophen or ibuprofen)
300
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

 Using a lotion or cream that contains aloe, which soothes the skin and
feels cool as it evaporates
Avoiding regular skin cream, as this only “traps” the heat and makes
things worse
 Keeping her completely out of the sun
Don’t pop any sunburn blisters — this can lead to infection. Leave them
alone, and call your pediatrician. They may be signs of a second-degree burn.
Also call your pediatrician if your child develops any signs of heat stroke
(vomiting or loss of consciousness).
Chemical and electrical burns
Household cleansers can also cause serious burns to the skin and mucous
membranes. If Baby has somehow managed to get under the kitchen sink,
remove her, brush off any powdery substances, and give her a thorough wash-
ing. If you know which cleanser she’s been into, read the label; often, it will
include instructions about what to do if the cleanser has gotten on the skin
or in the eyes. (Poison Control will also have this information; the number 
is listed on the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book.) Follow these instruc-
tions and call your pediatrician right away. It’s safest to keep all poisons and
cleansers where Baby has absolutely no chance of getting into them — up
high or out in the garage, for example.
If Baby suffers an electrical burn (from exposure to an outlet or a wire), seek
medical attention immediately. Although these burns can appear mild, they
carry the risk of electrical shock.

P
arents often fall into one of two camps when it comes to potential 
hazards in the home:
 Everything is a deathtrap.
 It’ll never happen to us.
Each of these mindsets comes with its own unique set of issues. For example,
viewing the entire world as a place that can only harm your child may lead
you to become way overprotective of your tyke, not just in these early years,
but for the rest of time. Your child will have no choice but to take one of two
roads: She’ll either become a person who’s almost paralyzed by fear, or she’ll
rebel against you with everything she’s got. Either way . . . not such a healthy
relationship to have with your child.
Thinking that nothing bad will ever happen to your child (reasoning that
there are millions of little kids in this country, and most of don’t ever sustain
serious injuries) is just living your life in the dark. There are real hazards out
there. It’s your job to scout them out and prevent Baby from innocently wan-
dering into them. Failing to do so may either ensure that Baby will, indeed,
get hurt, or may possibly leave her feeling as though she’s pretty much on
her own and can do whatever the heck she wants — which, to a child, is a
frightening thing.

The key is to find some kind of middle ground here, one that’s dictated by the
very real possibilities of what could happen if Baby’s environment is not
properly safeguarded — but one that is also tempered by common sense.
Babies are curious, they’re quick, and no parent can prevent every single
mishap — but you can prevent the most serious, life-threatening injuries.
Take a proactive stance and evaluate the dangers within your home before
Baby has a chance to snoop them out for herself. Get down on your hands
and knees and look at life from an infant’s perspective. You may be surprised
by what you see.
Making Home Sweet Home a Safe Haven
Making your home baby-safe is no small task; within the first year, your infant
will change from a helpless little angel to a holy living terror — at least as far
as your most precious possessions are concerned. Baby won’t discriminate
between your grandmother’s teacups and your pots and pans; after all, both
make lots of fun noise when dropped on the floor.
Protecting your collectibles is one concern; a much larger concern, of course,
is protecting Baby from the inherent dangers of, say, smashing a tea cup, or
discovering that certain things actually fit inside an electrical outlet, or find-
ing that a tablecloth is something to pull herself up on (and pull things down
on top of her head simultaneously).
When you bring a child home, you have to make certain accommodations for
his safety. That’s part of the deal. No one wants to decorate with cabinet
locks and fireplace gates, but these devices are only temporary additions to
your household. Before you know what happened, your baby will be replaced
by a big kid, and not only will he not want to play in the garbage can under
the sink anymore, he won’t want to touch it at all (especially when you ask
him to take out the trash).
Baby-proofing your home is like redecorating — certain things must go, and
certain things need to be added. Nowadays, you can buy just about every-
thing you need to make your home a secure place for your child. Each baby-
proofing product is out there for a reason: some kid, somewhere, got into
something, and a particular product was born to prevent other children from
doing the same thing. If you can remember to keep that bathroom door
closed, for example, you may not need the toilet seat lock — but would it
really hurt to install it just in case Baby finds his way into the bathroom?
(Your baby-proofing motto: Better safe than sorry.)
304
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Making the house completely safe may feel like an overwhelming task at first,
but chances are, after you get into the job, obvious hazards will start popping
out at you.
Getting a jump on safety
Don’t wait until Baby is crawling around your house to start baby-proofing.
Get going as early as possible — even while you’re in your last trimester of
pregnancy, or as soon as you bring your infant home. Make safety a priority.
Even though you may feel like you have lots of time before Baby will be any-
where near independent, she’ll be rolling around before you know it, and
you’ll be in a cold sweat, blocking those outlets, padding the fireplace, gating
the stairs — and trying to keep an eye on Baby at the same time. Make the
necessary changes before you’re chasing Little Miss Mobile ’round and
’round the house.
Never assume your house is safe enough. Keeping your home a safe haven for
your child is a neverending process. After you make your preliminary sweep
through the house, blocking access to some hazards and removing others, sit
back and observe Baby’s movements. You may have overlooked a potential
hazard or two (and with so many potential dangers out there, it’s really quite
easy to miss something). Remember, as Baby progresses into each new devel-
opmental stage, your safety plan needs re-evaluation.
Baby-proofing, step by step
Everything needs to be baby-proofed. More specifically, anything that poses
any sort of potential harm to Baby, and anything that Baby can get into with-
out your instantaneous knowledge needs to be made as safe as it can possi-
bly be. This means anything on the floor, anything that Baby can reach or pull
herself up on, and anything Baby can climb onto needs to be safeguarded.
The floor
Get down on the floor and take a look at what an inexperienced roller or
crawler may get into. Be sure to:
 Remove all small objects that Baby can choke on.
 Place plants, which can be toxic, up high where Baby can’t get to them.
 Move litter boxes to the basement or any other area where Baby has
absolutely no access, to prevent Baby from playing in them.
305
Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

 Block access to low-slung furniture that Baby can get stuck under.
 Install a fireplace gate or a bumper cushion around a raised hearth. Gate
off a fireplace so that Baby can’t get into ashes.
 Gate or block off wood stoves completely, or don’t use them at all. Wood
stoves can cause serious burns on contact.
 Remove or pad any furniture that has sharp edges.
 Gate stairways but never use a pressure gate at the top of stairs — it can
pop out if Baby pushes on it and cause a serious tumble. Only use a gate
that can be screwed into the wall.
 If you have a landing at the top of your stairway surrounded by railings,
purchase a clear guard to prevent falls through the railings.
 Tack down any loose carpeting to prevent a novice walker from tripping
or slipping.
Around the house
Consider what Baby will be able reach. She’ll have easy access to electrical
outlets and cords. Cabinet doors and drawers open to reveal hidden hazards.
The list goes on and on. 
Keep Baby safe by doing the following:
 Purchase and install electrical outlet faceplates. Choose those with
covers that automatically close over open outlets or purchase plastic
outlet covers. Pop them in outlets everywhere.
 Tuck electrical cords behind furniture when able.
 Install cabinet, drawer, and toilet locks.
 Check tables and chairs to see which tip easily or are top-heavy. Baby
may pull these over on herself if she tries to pull herself up on them.
 Remove tablecloths or anything else dangling from a table. Baby won’t
be able to pull herself up with a tablecloth, but she may well be able to
bring your centerpiece crashing down.
 Bolt large, top-heavy furniture, like bookcases, entertainment centers,
baker’s racks, and dressers into the wall. Baby will use anything that’s
the right height to try to pull herself up. Save her from herself (and a
barrage of books) by making sure these items are secure.
 Remove doorstops with small rubber stoppers and replace with a
larger rubber doorstop. Small coiled doorstops with rubber tips are
choking hazards.
306
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

 Install finger-pinch protectors on doors.
 Cut Venetian blind cords so that they no longer form a single loop (a
choking hazard) and so that they’re completely out of Baby’s reach.
Or wrap the tails on a holder on the wall so they won’t dangle down.
 Turn your water heater down to 120 degrees to prevent scalding.
 Purchase a rubber faucet guard for the bathtub so that Baby won’t
hurt his head.
 TVs are extremely top-heavy and should be kept well out of Baby’s
reach, and not on a shelf or table.
 Don’t hold Baby in one hand and a hot cup of coffee in the other. In
fact, keep all hot beverages far from your child. She can swat and grab at
a mug, causing serious burns to herself (and you).
 Don’t hold your baby while cooking — let her cry!
Special concerns
Some babies are strong enough (and clever enough) to open up a refrigerator,
oven, dishwasher, washer, dryer, and so on. A child trapped in a refrigerator
can suffocate; ovens may be hot; dishwashers may have sharp objects inside;
children can become trapped in front-loading washers and dryers. 
Babies learn to climb and grab during the first year — be ready to protect
Baby from herself by taking the following precautions:
 Purchase and install appliance locks, which are used to keep Baby out
of the oven and refrigerator.
 Safeguard your stove by purchasing covers for the burners, and kid-
proof knob covers to prevent curious would-be cooks from turning on
the heat.
 Remove all furniture from underneath windows. Children may peer
out too far, jump on furniture, and fall out the window, or use the furni-
ture as a ladder to open a window.
 Open windows from the top. Screens can pop out with very little force
and are intended to keep flies out of your house (they’re not intended to
save your child from a fall).
 Make sure your automatic garage door has a self-acting “bounce up”
feature (the door opens if it hits anything on its way down). Older
doors don’t, and a child can be crushed if he’s under the door when it
closes. Test your door to make sure it’s working properly by setting a
307
Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

garbage can in its path and closing it. It should bounce up without
making a dent in the can.
 If you’ve been thinking about installing a home security system (or
you have one already), make sure you choose one with an option to
sound an alarm whenever windows and doors are opened. Leave this
feature on even when you’re home. You’ll know for certain that Baby
isn’t slipping out into the back yard while you’re preparing his lunch.
Environmental hazards
You’re not quite finished yet. Don’t forget that chemicals you have closed up
in your cabinets may be dangerous and that you need to be very proactive in
making sure your smoke detectors have batteries. 
Make a list of what needs to be done, and make sure it includes the following:
 Move any poisonous or hazardous chemicals completely out of the
house. Keep them in the garage in a locked cabinet.
 Install smoke detectors. Have at least one on every floor of your home.
Change the batteries every year even if they still work.
 Install carbon monoxide detectors. Place one near your furnace and
one near your bedrooms.
 Make sure the paint in your older home is lead-free. Chips of paint
containing lead can cause brain damage if Baby eats them. (Check 
out the section “Get the lead out: Addressing harmful paint” for more
information.)
 Consider keeping all your toiletries completely out of reach.
Toothpaste is hazardous in large quantities, as are the medicines com-
monly kept in bathroom medicine cabinets. These things will be more
difficult for Baby to reach if they’re in a linen closet on the highest shelf.
Get the lead out: Addressing harmful paint
Now that Baby is rolling all over the house, sticking his hands in his mouth,
and preparing to become even more of an explorer, you need to think about
his exposure to lead. It’s not paint itself that poses a threat — it’s the dust.
Children who inhale lead dust are at risk for developing severe neurological
defects that may affect them for the rest of their lives. These defects may
include an inability to concentrate, hyperactivity, developmental delays
(including slow weight gain), and brain damage. Adults aren’t immune to the
effects of inhaling lead dust, but children are particularly susceptible to irre-
versible damage because their brains are in the process of developing.
308
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Most experts agree that it’s far more dangerous to try to sand the paint off
the wall than to leave it alone: You’re going to create far more dust by remov-
ing the paint than by maintaining it. Your best bet is to make sure that the
paint isn’t chipping and to immediately clean up any paint dust in high-friction
areas like windowsills and underneath doors. You should also keep your
child from playing in those areas. Keeping your home clean and in good
repair goes a long way toward preventing lead poisoning in your child.
You can find many kits on the market that test for lead in the home. The
health department may be able to do more extensive testing.
Remember that your home isn’t the only source of lead-based paint expo-
sure. A few years back, certain window blinds were found to contain lead.
Toys manufactured in some foreign countries may contain high levels of
leaded paint.
If your home was built after 1978, the year that lead-based paint was banned,
there’s almost no chance of the paint in your home containing lead. This is
not to say that a home built in 1970 is lead-laden; some paint manufacturers
started to lose the lead from their products as early as the 1950s.
I recommend a lead test (a simple finger prick that’s screened for high levels
of lead) at one year for every child, regardless of your home’s potential for
containing lead.
Checking for Choking Hazards
Because babies love to stick everything in their mouths, choking is a major
concern of parents everywhere. When kids reach the oral stage, they’re really
exploring the world through their mouths, discovering textures, shapes, and
tastes by using their oral cavity. (Remember, a small baby isn’t all that good
with his hands; it’s much easier for him to grasp something and shove it in
the general direction of his face than it is for him to actually grasp and feel it
with his fingers.) This goes on into the second year and sometimes even into
the third. Removing small items from Baby’s reach is a good start; doing a
thorough exam of the floor each and every time you put Baby down on her
blanket is also a good idea. But this is another area where constant vigilance
is needed, because children most often choke on toys and food — the very
things that are given to them by their parents. In this section, we give you
tips on how to avoid a choking child. We also go over the basics of the
Heimlich maneuver for babies and infant CPR. We also recommend that you
take a class to find out more about these techniques.
309
Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

Safe snacking
You can cut down the risk of choking just by knowing which foods are safe
for babies and toddlers and which aren’t. The following foods are known
choking hazards:
 Hot dogs
 Grapes
 Raisins
 Nuts
 Chunks of firm food (vegetables, cheese, meat, or fruit, for example)
 Thick, sticky foods like peanut butter or marshmallows, which can 
actually clog Baby’s throat
 Hard candies (including lollipops)
 Popcorn
Beyond sticking to safe foods, you can take further steps to help prevent
your child from choking on her food:
 Make sure Baby is sitting up and not giggling or talking while she eats.
 Cut any firm foods into tiny pieces that can’t get stuck in Baby’s airway.
 Cut any round foods (grapes, hot dogs, carrots) into small pieces or
strips before feeding them to Baby.
 Don’t allow her to stuff her mouth full of food.
 Avoid sticky or hard foods (like nuts or sticky or hard candies) alto-
gether. Baby doesn’t need them anyway.
It’s also important to know the Heimlich maneuver and infant CPR — just in
case. See the sections on these techniques for more information.
The Heimlich maneuver
If Baby is choking, have someone call 911. But knowing the Heimlich maneu-
ver may save your baby’s life.
310
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Here’s how to do it:
1. Place her face-down on your forearm, supporting her neck with your
hand. For a visual, take a look at Figure 20-1A.
2. Give five solid blows with the heel of your hand to her upper back,
between the shoulder blades. For a visual, take a look at Figure 20-1B.
3. If this doesn’t work, turn her over and center your index and middle
fingers right between the nipples. For a visual, take a look at Figure
20-1C.
4. Give five chest thrusts with your index and middle finger. For a visual,
take a look at Figure 20-1D.
5. Repeat above steps.

Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

Infant CPR
If Baby is unconscious and not breathing, have someone call 911. Lay her on
a flat surface. Tilt her head back and look into her mouth. If you can see the
object, crook your index finger and try to “sweep” the object out of her mouth.
If she still isn’t breathing or you don’t see the object, begin infant CPR.
1. Lay Baby on a flat surface.
2. Tilt her chin and head back to open her airway.
3. Cover her mouth and nose with your mouth. Give her two gentle
breaths (about two seconds each). Her chest should rise each time.
4. Place your index and middle finger in the middle of her chest about
an inch below the nipple line. Give five quick, gentle compressions,
pressing down half an inch to an inch.
5. Repeat steps, using one breath and five compressions until Baby
rouses or help arrives.
Eradicating other hazards
Because an active, crawling Baby will try to slip just about anything into his
mouth, keeping your home free and clear of choking hazards is a full-time
operation. Before you let Baby play in any room, do a thorough sweep of the
floor, the tables, the couch cushions, and anyplace else Baby has access to
(check underneath the recliner, for example, to make sure no one has
dropped any loose change).
Choking hazards to be on the lookout for include:
 Coins
 Buttons
 Small, round batteries (used for watches, remote car locks, hearing aids,
and similar items)
 Bottle caps
 Marker or pen caps
 Thumbtacks
 Paper clips
 Small toys that compress and expand (like foam balls or balloons)
 Raisins, peanuts, snack foods
 Toys with small pieces (wheels from toy cars are especially hazardous,
as are plastic eyeballs)
312
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

The previous list is only a starting point, because so many small items in any
given household could pose a choking hazard to your child. Always be on the
lookout for pieces of larger toys or common items that could come loose in
Baby’s mouth. It may seem safe enough, for example, to let Baby chew the
top of a soda bottle — but that cap can twist off in his mouth and create a
life-threatening situation.
Two rules of thumb about choking:
 If a toy fits into the center of a cardboard paper towel tube, it’s too
small for Baby to play with. The opening of the tube is roughly the size
of Baby’s airway.
 Don’t think that because something will taste bad (like a penny) or
feel sharp (like a tack) that Baby won’t pop it in his mouth anyway. His
main concern is exploring the world through his oral cavity, so make
sure you’re providing him with safe options to this end — and doing
everything you can to keep the unsafe options out of his reach.
Playing It Safe with Your Pets
Bringing Baby into a home already occupied by a beloved family pet can spark
intense jealousy from your dog or cat. Your pet may act strange — depressed,
hyper, nasty — and you may wonder whether it’s safe to have him in the
same room as your child.
You’re right to worry. Pets are often as special to their owners as children are
(or at least it seems that way until you actually have a child), and although
you love and trust your animal completely, all bets are off when an infant
comes into the house. Your previously docile animal may exhibit behavior
you didn’t know he was capable of.
The bottom line on pets is this: Never trust an animal around your baby.
Always physically put yourself between the two. To an animal, your infant is
just a smaller animal who makes strange noises. Even if you would trust your
pet to save your life (and even though he very well may pull you from a burn-
ing building), Baby is a stranger to him, and he may not particularly like
strangers — particularly small ones who cry, smell strange, and take all of
your attention.
Even when your child is older, don’t leave him alone with an animal. Children
are often known to pull fur, bite, and pet too hard. Your pet may not respond
by running and hiding — instead, he may decide to teach Baby a lesson by
biting back.

Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

Keeping Your Little Sleepyhead Safe
Putting Baby to bed sometimes feels as though you’re removing him from the
perils of the world, tucking him in where he can’t get hurt. But in order for
you to get a good night’s sleep, you have to know beyond the shadow of a
doubt that Baby’s bed and bedroom are a safe haven. Make sure everyone is
going to have a secure rest by giving the nursery a good once-over.
Crib notes
The crib can be a safe, secure spot for sleeping or an accident waiting to
happen. Make sure yours is in tip-top shape and perfectly safe by following
these guidelines:
 Use only newer cribs. Those built before 1992 don’t meet current safety
standards and shouldn’t be used.
 Make sure the crib is sturdy. If a crib’s been taken apart 12 times and
passed around the family, make sure the screws are still holding every-
thing together as they should. Never use tie-wraps (plastic strips that
are sometimes used used in lieu of screws) to secure various pieces of
the crib.
 Measure the distance between the slats. If slats are more than 2 3⁄8
inches apart, Baby could get her head caught in between them.
 Buy a firm mattress that fits snugly in the crib. If you can fit more than
one finger between the mattress and the sides of the crib, it’s too small;
buy a larger one. Baby could get stuck in the side.
 Put the crib in a safe spot. Venetian blind cords pose a strangulation
risk to your child; keep them as far from the crib as possible, and cut
them so they don’t form a loop.
 Hang mobiles out of Baby’s reach, and remove them as soon as Baby
starts pulling up on the sides of the crib.
 Remove the bumper pad as soon as Baby pulls up so that it isn’t used
as a stepping stool to the outside world.
 If you paint or stain a crib, make sure you use a product that’s safe for
Baby. Your child will be up and mouthing the side of that crib soon
enough; you don’t want him ingesting any hazardous substances. Check
the rails often after Baby is pulling up and teething; look for any rough
surfaces that could cut Baby’s mouth or pose a choking hazard.
 Don’t use a crib with corner posts. They pose a strangulation hazard if
Baby’s clothing gets caught on them. The same goes for pretty cutouts
in a crib’s headboard: Clothing can get caught in them, and so can
Baby’s head. Choose a plain crib instead.

Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Babies should be put to sleep on their backs to reduce the risk of SIDS
(sudden infant death syndrome, for more on this see the following section).
Also, keep the crib clear except for Baby. He doesn’t need pillows, stuffed ani-
mals, or heavy blankets in his bed, and they pose a suffocation hazard.
Bumper pads are cute, but not necessary. Be sure to remove them by 6
months so baby doesn’t use them to climb. Keep the mattress at the lowest
level possible to prevent falls from leaning over the edge when baby begins
to pull up.
Preventing Sudden Infant 
Death Syndrome (SIDS)
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the term used to describe the death
of a baby who seemed to be completely healthy. At one time called crib death,
SIDS typically occurs in children under the age of 6 months during naptimes
or in the overnight hours. There are some measures you can take to minimize
your child’s risk of SIDS, including:
 Use a firm mattress and the lightest blankets. Soft, plush bedding and
coverings increase the chance of your baby’s face becoming covered by
or snuggled into material that will cut off her oxygen. Doctors think that
soft mattresses simply don’t give a Baby enough support. Imagine you
were a weak little thing lying on your back on a waterbed, for example. 
It would be much easier for you to breathe if you were lying on some-
thing firmer.
 Lay Baby on her back. This doesn’t eliminate the need for a firm mattress.
 Keep Baby’s room and clothing cool enough. Overheating the room
and/or bundling Baby up too much for naps or bedtime may be con-
tributing factors in SIDS. Keep your thermostat set at a reasonable tem-
perature (not a balmy 80 degrees). One layer of clothing and a light
blanket are sufficient coverings in the crib.
 No smoking! Second-hand smoke may be a contributing factor in SIDS.
 Breastfeed, if at all possible. Breastfeeding provides Baby some protec-
tion against respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, sicknesses that
seem to coincide with some SIDS cases.
Some babies are at an increased risk for SIDS, including those with a sibling
that has died of SIDS, babies who have been exposed to drugs in the womb,
low birth-weight babies, and babies who have already had an episode of res-
piratory distress in the crib. Your pediatrician will assess your child’s risk
factors; if it’s determined that your baby is at a higher risk of SIDS than her
peers, you may be advised to use a monitor that evaluates Baby’s breathing
and heart rate.

Pajama-rama
Not so very long ago, all children’s sleepwear had to conform to governmental
safety regulations. Every pair of infant and kid jammies had to be made from
flame-retardant material. This rule has eased up in the last few years, and the
recommendation now is for children over the age of 9 months to wear close-
fitting pajamas made from either flame retardant fabric or natural fiber.
The theory is that close-fitting clothing doesn’t provide the oxygen fire needs
to spread. Children under the age of 9 months don’t move around enough to
whip up mass amounts of oxygen, and are considered less at risk for inadver-
tently fanning any flames on their pajamas.
Baby’s pjs should be snug, but not tight. Loose-fitting pajamas carry a risk in
case of fire and are also a strangulation hazard for an older child (if a loose
neckline gets caught on something in the crib, Baby could be at serious risk).
Sleeping tight
When Baby starts making regular escapes from his crib, you may think you
need to move him to a bed. Resist the urge to buy a toddler bed for your
baby. Most kids stay in their cribs for at least the first year, and well into the
second, so don’t rush things. Cribs are safe, confined spaces — you know
where Baby is, and you know what he can and can’t get into. When you put
him into a bed, all bets are off. He’s too young at this point to be left unat-
tended and completely free to explore every corner of his bedroom (which
may well happen during the middle of the night or during naptime). Keep him
safe and keep him in the crib for now.
Instead of buying a new bed, try placing the mattress down at its lowest point
and hitch those rails up to their highest point — you may just make the climb
difficult enough so that Baby gives up on it, at least for a while.
If he insists on scaling the walls of his bed, the safest option is to purchase a
tentlike attachment for the top of his crib. These tents are designed to keep
little escape artists safe in their beds. Refer to Chapter 16 to see what they
look like.
Don’t let Baby sleep in a regular-sized bed, even if it has side rails. Beds are
fraught with peril for babies: Infants can roll off, get their heads caught under
side rails, or become stuck between a wall and the bed. If you’re visiting
Grandma and there’s no crib available, it’s much safer to let Baby nap in his
stroller or on a clean blanket on the floor while you sit close by. Baby should
also be kept out of the parents’ bed to prevent suffocation (by someone
rolling over on him or by pulling the blankets over his head). Waterbeds are
too soft and are unsafe for infant use.
316
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Water Safety and Your Baby
Your baby can drown in less than a minute and in only 1 inch of water. Keeping
Baby safe when water is nearby requires constant vigilance. Bathtubs and
pools are danger areas for small children, as are ponds, hot tubs, wading
pools, ice chests, and drainage ditches. In addition, some very real drowning
hazards — like toilets and buckets — don’t seem hazardous at all.
Your safest bet when you’re aware of a water hazard is to maintain close and
constant physical contact between you and your child. This is easy enough
with an infant — but it becomes even more important as your child becomes
more independent.
Tips to prevent drowning:
 Empty all buckets, ice chests, or other containers filled with water as
soon as possible and put them away. (Containers filled with rainwater
are a hazard to Baby, too.)
 Never allow an older child to supervise Baby in the tub or pool. Not
only is a child easily distracted, but she may not be able to save Baby in
case of an emergency.
 Keep your small child away from the ocean. Large waves can surprise
even the most seasoned beachcombers; Baby is too small to fight a
strong tide.
 Never leave Baby alone in the tub — not for a minute, not for any
reason. If you have to answer the door or phone, wrap him up and take
him with you. Otherwise, let the bell or phone ring.
 Leave toilet lids down, and/or install toilet lid locks.
 Always cover and lock a hot tub or spa.
 Purchase an alarm for your pool that will sound if anything (or
anyone) falls in.
 Don’t count on floating devices to safeguard Baby. Floating devices —
even those designed specifically for babies — aren’t intended to be a
substitute for adult supervision. Baby can flip himself upside down
under water very quickly, and if you’re not right there to flip him right-
side up, he could drown.
 Learn infant CPR.
Bathtubs pose another safety hazard — scalding. Make sure your hot water
heater is turned down to 120 degrees and always feel the bath water before
putting Baby in the tub. Never allow older babies or toddlers to play with the
faucets — they may accidentally turn on the hot water full-force.
317
Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

Hazards on the Go
You can’t put Baby in a bubble to protect her from every hazard (wouldn’t
that make your life easy?), but you can take care to prevent some of the most
common injuries, like those sustained in car accidents and with ride-on toys.
And no, you can’t slap a helmet on her head to protect her, either — they
don’t come in teeny infant sizes. Diligent observation is the only solution.
Keeping safe in the car
The first trip in the car with Baby along for the ride is sometimes a transfor-
mative experience: Previously wild drivers suddenly hit the brakes, driving
with the care of an elderly soul behind the wheel. It’s normal to feel this way;
after all, your child’s life is in your hands. There’s more to keeping Baby safe
in the car than driving at a turtle’s pace, though. This section offers some tips
on making sure everyone arrives at your destination safe and sound.
If you’re at a complete loss as to how to install Baby’s seat in your car, find a
car-seat safety checkpoint. Call your local police station, hospital, automobile
club, or pediatrician to find out when and where the next safety check will be.
(And don’t feel like a ding-dong: Some reports suggest that many, many, many
car seats are installed improperly. You’re just making sure your child is safe.)
A car seat is only as good as it’s allowed to be. Everyone needs to be
strapped into a seat when the car is moving, including Mom and Dad, so
make sure you’re setting a good example by buckling up every time you set
out on a trip to the grocery store, the park, or on vacation.
Baby should be kept in a rear-facing car seat until she’s 20 pounds and 1 year
old (she must meet both qualifications before her seat gets turned toward 
the front). Studies have shown that infants under the age of 1 year lack the
neck strength to survive a significant impact of this manner if they are facing
forward — even if they’re belted into a car seat. They’re safest situated in the
back seat (the middle rear seat is safest for protecting Baby in side collisions),
facing the rear of the car.
Never put Baby in the front seat of a car, especially one with a passenger-side
airbag. These cars have warnings on the passenger-side visor advising of the
risk of injury and death to an infant riding in this seat. The airbag deployment
is so swift and violent in nature that your child’s car seat can’t protect her
from the force of it — in fact, the car seat itself could actually be a lethal
318
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

weapon, even in a low-speed impact. No excuses, no one-time exceptions:
Baby is a backseat rider 100 percent of the time.
Concentrate on driving. Sometimes things just happen while you’re behind
the wheel — Baby starts to cry, or whine, or scream — and there’s not a
whole lot you can do but try to tune it out until you reach your destination
(assuming you’re headed to the corner store and not across the country). If
you find yourself becoming flustered or irritated, take ten deep breaths and
tell yourself that Baby is going to be fine for the next few minutes. Don’t try
to grab the pacifier from the diaper bag on the passenger side floor or mix a
bottle of formula while you’re driving. This is just pure insanity, and a surefire
way to make sure you run a red light or rear-end another driver. If using a
mirror to watch your back seat baby, don’t look in it too much; watch your
rear-view mirror for cars instead!
Keep a tape of Baby’s favorite music in the car for times like these. Make sure
she has her comfort objects when you buckle her into her seat. Give Baby
her pacifier, her blanket, her bottle — whatever makes her happy and lets
you keep your eyes on the road.
When putting Baby in the car, adjust the harness straps in her car seat,
making sure they’re tight enough to hold her snugly in position in the event
of an accident.
Walking with Baby
Driveways, sidewalks, and parking lots can be as dangerous as roadways —
after all, it only takes one car to cause major injury to your older, mobile
baby or child. Follow these tips to ensure his safety:
 If you’re leaving the house without your child, always walk around
the back of your car to make sure he isn’t behind your vehicle.
 Always hold your child’s hand when crossing a parking lot. Drivers
tend to become distracted when they’re looking for a spot, and a small
child is hard to see.
 Keep your child next to you in a crosswalk. Even though drivers
should stop in both directions, they don’t always. You don’t want your
child running ahead of you into harm’s way.
Teach Baby from the earliest age to stop, look, and listen before he crosses
the street — and make sure he does it (along with you) every single time.

Chapter 20: Preventing Injuries at Home

Baby on wheels: Ride-on toys and walkers
Wheels make Baby more independent — and increase your blood pressure
substantially. Ride-on toys are a blast for older babies, and walkers are still in
vogue in some households. How safe are these vehicles?
Pediatricians generally discourage the use of walkers (seats and trays on
wheels) these days. They’re just too fast, too unpredictable, and they can
cause serious injuries. Baby can scoot her way out of the kitchen and down
the basement steps before you even know she’s gone anywhere. Put her in an
exercise ring or saucer (seats that rock and turn but don’t actually go any-
where) instead. You know exactly where she is and what she’s doing, and she
can’t hurt herself, no matter how much she rocks and spins.
A baby who can’t stay on a ride-on toy shouldn’t be on it at all. He’ll just slip
off and bump his head. Used indoors, these toys are as dangerous as walkers;
outdoors, they should be used only with constant supervision (to prevent
Baby from rolling into the street). Check the wheels regularly to make sure
they’re securely attached.
The mobile child
When baby starts walking, and then running, toward more independence,
your job as his bodyguard has officially begun. Your child wants to do more,
see more, know more — but he has an inconvenient lack of fear and precious
little understanding of what’s harmful and what isn’t.
The mobile child requires constant supervision, especially outdoors. You can
be fairly sure that Baby is secure while he’s playing in the family room, but
after you leave the safe haven you’ve created, you just don’t know what haz-
ards will pop up. Leaving him alone in the yard for just a couple of minutes —
even if the yard is fenced — is risky. Remember, to your child, a poisonous
mushroom may seem like a tasty treat, and a piece of glass may seem like an
appropriate plaything.
As Baby moves toward his toddler years, he’ll only become more curious and
perhaps even less fearful, which means you have to become more vigilant.
(No one told you this when you were pregnant, huh?) Trying to see the world
through his eyes can be helpful if only to assess the dangers of any environ-
ment you happen to be in. For example, in the future when you see monkey
bars, you may automatically envision your child climbing to the very highest
point and hanging there. Just keep in mind that the hazards you don’t think
of are often the most dangerous — so be very creative in your thinking.
320
Part VI: Protecting Baby’s Health and Safety 

Never Shake a Baby!
Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) happens when an infant or young child is shaken
violently and intentionally. Baby’s brain and spinal cord can be severely and
permanently damaged. SBS most often occurs when a caregiver has reached
the point of maximum frustration with a child’s behavior (usually crying),
and loses his temper (shakers tend to be male).
Never shake a baby. The frustration that comes along with caring for a
screaming child who never seems to sleep is understandable — but taking it
out on your child isn’t. Remember, part of parenting is learning to draw on
your reserves of patience and understanding. Another part of parenting (and
one that isn’t discussed enough) is knowing that sometimes it’s best for you
and your child to give yourself a break.
If Baby is destroying your very last nerve with her crying and you feel like
you’re losing it, put her somewhere safe — in her crib or playpen — and
leave her for a few minutes. Don’t go far; just find a corner of the house
where the crying is quieter and give yourself time to calm down. Get yourself
some nourishment. Call your mom or your best friend if venting to them will
help. When you’re feeling ready to deal with Baby, it’s safe to go get her. She
may not be any happier than when you left her, but you’ll be in a better state
of mind, and in this case, that makes all the difference.
Never leave Baby with a sitter or relative who’s known to have a short fuse.
You love your child unconditionally, and even then, her screaming can drive
you up the wall — think about how someone who isn’t her mother may react
to constant crying. Baby’s safety comes first. If your choice is to leave her
with your high-strung brother or to bring her along on your errands, bundle
her up and take her with you.

Recognizing the risks of roughhousing
Grandpa loves to bounce Baby on his knee.
Uncle Bob likes to toss Baby in the air and catch
her. You’re a nervous wreck. Where’s the line
when it comes to playing with Baby?
Generally speaking, playing rough with an infant
or toddler is a no-no. Their necks can’t handle
powerful movements (such as those involved
with being thrown up in the air and caught), and
it’s best not to take the chance. Furthermore,
when Baby is tossed up in the air, there isn’t a
100 percent guarantee that she’s going to land
safely in her uncle’s arms — so tell Bob to cool
it. Grandpa’s bouncing, on the other hand, is
probably a safe activity, as long as he’s being
gentle.

S
ettling into the first few weeks with Baby may be the very best experi-
ence you’ve ever had. Or it may be the stuff of nightmares — because no
one ever told you that you were going to feel so lousy after delivery, plus
your hormones are up and down, your breasts are throbbing, you’re tired,
and your baby doesn’t believe in sleeping when it’s dark outside.
Most women don’t want to admit that bringing a baby into the home can be 
a really difficult adjustment. The best thing you can do during this time is 
be kind to yourself. This chapter offers advice on how to make the first few
weeks easier for you (and therefore for your child and your mate, as well). It
doesn’t offer advice on loving and cuddling your child, because you’re going
to do that instinctively anyway. This chapter is all about taking care of you.
Listen to Your Body
What have you just been through? Labor, delivery, post-delivery repair (if you
had a C-section or an episiotomy) — oh, and nine months of pregnancy. Your
body is different now. Your body is doing things you never knew it was capa-
ble of doing, like producing milk whenever your baby cries. Your body is
tired. Make a real effort to get some rest whenever you can. Don’t look upon
naps as laziness; they’re as necessary to you as food is right now. If you can’t
sleep, at least lie down when your baby is quiet.

Send Spot to Camp
You love your pet, but you really don’t need to be dealing with walking the
dog, caring for your episiotomy, and breastfeeding your newborn all at once.
Unless you have a pup that is happy to do nothing but sleep all day long (and
who won’t require any attention until your partner is available to help), send
him to the kennel the week you come home from the hospital. Sure, you’ll feel
a little guilty about it, until you realize that you’re able to lie down and rest
when Baby falls asleep (instead of listening to the dog bark at cats and squir-
rels that happen to be passing by the window). If you have a pet that just
can’t be boarded, think about sending the animal to a friend’s house for a
couple of days — and don’t leave your baby alone with your pet.
Steal a Shower when You Can
Nothing makes you feel less human — and by extension, less like getting 
on with the day — than realizing that you stink of breast milk, spit-up, and
your baby’s diaper. When your partner comes home at the end of the day or
when your mother stops by on her lunch hour, take the opportunity to pamper
yourself with a shower (funny how basic hygiene suddenly turns into a luxury
after you have a baby). It’ll invigorate you and make you feel like your old 
self — or almost.
Order Take-Out
Maybe you’re really into health food, or you’re opposed to paying top dollar
for prepared foods. Put those opinions aside for the moment and realize that
when you bring a new baby into your home, you’re going to spend almost
every moment concentrating on her — and when you’re not completely
absorbed in caring for her or thinking about her, you may just be thinking
about yourself and/or your partner and how tired you are, how your life has
changed in just a matter of days, and what tomorrow will bring. Note that 
you will most likely not be concentrating on what you’re going to prepare 
for dinner. (At least not until things settle down a bit and all of you fall into
something of a routine.) Have your partner swing by the drive-through on 
the way home.
326
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Make a Deal with the Dust
You don’t bother it, and it won’t bother you. You have much better things to
worry about than whether you could write your name in the dust on your
bookshelves. Let it be. When Baby has settled in a bit and you’re starting to
feel like you’re ready to take on the deep-down house cleaning again, make a
promise to yourself to do it only once a week, and preferably on a day when
your mate can lend a hand. If you can’t stand to look at the mess, let your
mom tackle the dirt, or hire a cleaning lady or a high school student to do 
it for you.
Take the Phone off the Hook
Is there anyone you really need to talk to that you haven’t already called?
Think about this: You’re on maternity (or family) leave. You need your rest.
You don’t need to be fielding calls from telemarketers and friends who mean
well but have no concept of what it means to be up four times during the
night breastfeeding a little one. When you’re resting during the day, silence
the phone. If you want your spouse or your mom to be able to call, tell them
to dial your cell phone — and leave it on vibrate mode.
Accept Offers of Help
Normally, you’d never dream of allowing your mother to fold your husband’s
boxer shorts, nor would you let your father-in-law wash the dishes in your
sink. In the weeks after Baby comes home, however, you may be inundated
with offers of assistance from some very unlikely sources. Roll with it. Let
these kind souls ease your burden while you get your strength back and con-
nect with your new child. Make it very clear to these good Samaritans that
you don’t need help taking care of Baby; you need help with the household
chores. Soon enough, you’ll be the one doing the dirty work while your par-
ents and in-laws visit with Baby.
327
Chapter 21: Ten Tips for Surviving the First Few Weeks

Be Assertive
On the other hand, don’t be afraid to say when enough’s enough. You do
need your rest, and Baby needs his. Anyone who’s had a baby anytime within
recent memory will realize that sometimes the most helpful thing they can do
is to leave you alone. But some folks either forget what it’s like to have a baby
in the house, or they’ve never been through the experience. Don’t be afraid
to tell people that although you really appreciate their help, you and Baby
need some peace and quiet. And if your in-laws are the problem, let your
partner deal with them.
Give Yourself Credit
Sure, you’re happy to be home with your baby, but you may feel like you
should be doing more, particularly if you’re used to being at work. You could
take a conference call. You could catch up on your e-mail. You could take a
sneak peek at the project that’s on hiatus. Stop. Let the work go and give
yourself credit for what you’re doing. Parenting really is the hardest job in
the world and it requires all your attention right now. If you have the luxury
of being able to be home for at least several weeks after Baby is born, savor
every minute of it without feeling as though you’re not doing enough.
Don’t Expect Perfection
You’ve noticed a disturbing trend on your television set: Women in these
shows give birth without ever looking bloated afterward or appearing as
though they’re about to drop from exhaustion. Their homes look perfect;
they seem insanely happy; their babies seem to sleep all day; their bodies
have returned to normal within a week. Real life just can’t compete with that
level of insane happiness, and you’re left feeling as though something has
gone awry in your own birthing experience. Realize that it takes time for
Baby to settle into a schedule, for your body to adjust to breastfeeding
and/or to return to a somewhat normal state — realize, too, that you may
never again see your pre-pregnancy body. There will be times when you feel
like bursting into tears because you’re so tired and your hormones are all out
of whack. Let yourself feel however you’re really feeling.

Ten Tips for Daddy Survival
In This Chapter
 Understanding your new role
 Doing your part to ensure family harmony
 Making time for your Baby and your lady
 Cutting yourself some slack
S
eems that everyone loves to focus on what happens to a new mother
when Baby enters the picture. Dad is supposed to be in the picture as
much or as little as Mom (or Grandma) wants or allows him to be (this goes
for married couples as well as couples who aren’t living under the same
roof), and somehow, he’s expected to glean enough information by his
peripheral involvement in Baby’s care to snag Father of the Year.
Although plenty of fathers throw themselves into Baby’s first year with every-
thing they’ve got, just as many are completely unsure of what they’re supposed
to be doing. This chapter offers advice for new dads who may be feeling a
little out of the loop.
Accept Your New Role
You have been given the greatest gift in the world. The daddy-child bond is
priceless, and something every child needs. Don’t spend your days thinking
about how great life was when you had no responsibilities, or how you’d love
to go buy that new car but can’t — because that money is earmarked for
Baby’s college fund. Life changes completely when Baby comes on the scene.
Accept that your child and family must come first from here on out, and that
your own needs and wants come second. Fighting this reality makes life very
difficult and depressing for a dad, and you’ll find very little support from
friends and family if you choose to look out for yourself before you tend to
the needs of your child and partner.

Help Mom
There’s an old saying: If Mom’s not happy, nobody’s happy. Truer words were
never spoken, especially when you’re talking about life during Baby’s first
year. Your partner is learning to care for a child while simultaneously caring
for a home — and regardless of which century we’re living in, these tasks
tend to fall to the woman of the household. Whether she’s working outside of
the home or not, there’s a lot of work to be done around the house, so pitch
in. Make dinner. Sweep the floor. Fold some laundry. Find something that will
make her day a little easier — and don’t wait for her to ask you to do it.
Don’t Shy Away from the Dirty Work
Dirty diapers. Middle-of-the-night feedings. Soothing a colicky baby. As
unpleasant as these things seem when you’re dealing with them day after day
and night after night, the truth is that this time flies by. Before you know it,
your child will be out of diapers and on the school bus. Becoming a hands-on
dad right from the start can make the transition from being a childless man to
becoming a parent much more natural than, say, waiting until Baby is 1 year
old before you make your way over to the changing table. In order to truly
establish a bond with your child, you’ve got to get in the trenches — and the
earlier, the better.
Catch the Highlights at 11
Sitting and watching a game on the tube while your partner is soothing a
crying Baby doesn’t win you any fans. Even if you can’t really do anything,
making an effort is sometimes all your partner really wants. So turn off that
TV and pay attention to the family. You can ensure that you won’t be getting
the silent treatment for the next several days.
Talk the Talk
First-time parents — especially dads — sometimes feel silly talking to their
babies. Spend some time alone with your child and talk to her in a sing-songy
voice. You may feel ridiculous at first, but you won’t believe how natural it
starts to feel after you let yourself go. A young infant prefers soft, high voices
330
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

(probably because she’s so used to hearing her mother’s voice in the womb),
so she’s much more likely to focus on you if you make the effort to speak to
her in a tone of voice that she’s comfortable with. And after she sets her
sights on you, you’re a goner. You’re wrapped around her little finger for the
rest of time.
Cut the Calendar back
You’ve seen it happen a hundred times: A guy’s wife has a baby, and the rest
of the guys never see him again. You’ve sworn that this won’t happen to you.
You can balance family and fun, right? Well, sadly, you really can’t. Not when
you have a baby in the house. Your partner needs your help, a baby needs
his dad, and disregarding your family’s needs in a quest for fun is going to
land you in the doghouse. Big time. (Plus, it’s a vicious cycle: You go out with
the guys, you come home late, you’re tired the next day, and unable to help
your partner the way you should.) Scale back your social life after Baby
makes his appearance — maybe not forever, but at least for now.
Take a Breather
Know when to put your child down in his crib and take a breather. Dealing
with a colicky infant or a cranky, teething baby isn’t easy. The crying can go
on and on and on, and can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you’ve done
everything you can think of to comfort your child and he’s still miserable.
Sometimes, you just have to put him in his crib or playpen and take a couple
of minutes to calm yourself. Baby will be fine for a few minutes by himself and
you’ll feel better knowing that you’ve collected yourself enough to try again.
And of course, you should never, ever strike or shake a baby. Even one shake
can hurt an infant.
Let the Family in
Maybe your parents are a pain. Maybe your in-laws are a pain. When Baby
comes home, everyone wants to see her — but you may not want to see
everybody. Realize that these people are your child’s family now, too.
Regardless of your feelings about them, you don’t want to deny Baby the joy
of having grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins around. Unless they’re
331
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Daddy Survival

felons, put aside your family differences for the sake of your child. The
upside is this: You may be surprised at how nice it is to have some help 
from your family during Baby’s first year.
Take Care of Your Relationship
Make sure you take time to nurture your relationship with your partner.
Baby’s first year is a time of adjustment — your wife is so wrapped up in 
the baby that you’ve been put on the back burner. You’re both so tired, 
sex is the last thing on either of your minds. And your wife doesn’t trust
anyone to watch the baby, so the two of you can never go out for an adult
evening on the town. The danger is that your relationship will dwindle to
little more than roommate status if this goes on for too long — so take the
reins and get creative. If your partner doesn’t want to go out, plan to have a
nice dinner at home after Baby has settled down for the night (and don’t
make your spouse cook it!). Make the effort to talk about something other
than the baby. Remind her every so often that although Baby is the apple of
your eye, your wife is the love of your life. This can mean the difference
between feeling safe and secure in your relationship and feeling like a ship
lost at sea.
Go Easy on Yourself
Keep in mind that no one is born a father. It’s a learning process, just like
everything else in life. There will be days when you feel like you have no idea
what you’re doing (when you put Baby’s diaper on backwards for instance),
and you can’t believe that anyone would allow you to raise a child. You’re
responsible for your child from the day she’s born — but really feeling like a
parent (and not just a caregiver) may take some time. Don’t feel guilty about
it. Before long, you won’t remember what it was like not to be a parent.

Ten Reasons to Call 
Your Pediatrician
In This Chapter

 Differentiating between the real deal and a false alarm
 Taking the signs of trouble seriously
D
etermining what warrants a call to the pediatrician can be tricky, espe-
cially during the first year when Baby is unable to tell you if something
hurts — and particularly if this is your first child (because you have no previ-
ous experience to base your decisions on). This chapter covers some of the
more urgent matters that may arise during the first year. For more detailed
information on Baby’s health, take a look at Part VI of this book.
If you have any lingering doubt about whether to call the doctor or to let
something go, call. It’s always better to know for sure that Baby is okay.
Fever
You needn’t freak out over a fever; it’s just a sign of illness, and usually isn’t
dangerous. You can call the doctor during regular office hours to make an
appointment for Baby to be seen; meanwhile, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen
to keep the fever down. For information on how to take Baby’s temperature,
see Chapter 20.
Call the doctor when:
 Your baby is 3 months old or younger and has a temperature (taken rec-
tally) over 100.5 degrees — unless she has had a DTaP shot in the previ-
ous 24 hours. A fever is sometimes a side effect of immunizations.
 Your child has a fever over 105 and is listless (to the point of being
unable to rouse him) or has a seizure (and he’s never had one in the past).

 Baby has a fever with a stiff neck (Baby screams in pain when you try to
move his chin toward his chest); this can be a sign of meningitis.
 Baby has a fever in conjunction with signs of dehydration (covered in
more detail later in this chapter).
Respiratory Problems
A lot of viruses can cause a wheezing sound when Baby breathes. This isn’t
always a sign of serious illness, though it may be if it’s heard in conjunction
with other symptoms. If he is wheezing and showing serious signs of not
being able to catch his breath — you can see his skin drawing in between his
ribs or in the pit of his chest, or his color looks off (he’s pale or his lip are
appear to be bluish) call your doctor right away. Also look for respiratory
rates greater than 60 (count for a minute!). Take a look at Chapter 20 for more
information on various ailments Baby may have.
Vomiting
Babies spit up all the time. Normal spit-up looks a lot like the milk that just
went into Baby’s mouth, although it may be a bit thicker and/or stringy with
mucous (yes, it’s pretty gross). If your infant is projectile vomiting — shooting
it halfway across the room — or the vomit is dark in color, call your doctor
right away. Your baby may have a bowel obstruction.
Dehydration
Your nursing newborn may be experiencing dehydration if she isn’t getting
enough to eat. An older baby may become dehydrated if she has had diar-
rhea or has been vomiting. In either case, be on the lookout for signs of dehy-
dration, which include:
 Fewer wet diapers (she should be wetting at least every six to 
eight hours)
 No tears when she cries
 Sunken eyes
 Crankiness
 Dry mouth
 A decrease in an older baby’s activity level
334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Call your pediatrician immediately if Baby is exhibiting these symptoms.
Dehydration can cause serious electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to
organ failure.
Long-Term Cough or Stuffy Head
Kids catch a lot of colds. Baby doesn’t need to be rushed to the doctor for
every single virus. However, if he has a productive cough that just won’t go
away after ten days to two weeks or that seems to be getting worse, he
should be evaluated in the doctor’s office to make sure that the cough hasn’t
turned into a respiratory infection. Same thing with a stuffy head — if it
hasn’t cleared up after a couple of weeks and Baby is showing signs of feeling
lousy (irritable, sleepy, not eating well), schedule an appointment to rule out
a sinus infection.
Head Injuries
Not every bump to the head requires a doctor’s visit. But if Baby lost con-
sciousness after hitting his head or is showing signs of a concussion (unusual
pallor, loss of motor skills, extreme irritability or lethargy, vomiting, or dilated
or uneven pupils) or skull fracture (discharge from ears), call your doctor or
take Baby to the emergency room for evaluation. For more information on
head injuries, see Chapter 19.
Deep Cuts
An older, active baby will likely suffer his fair share of cuts — most will be
small and easy-to-care for. Call the doctor if:
 The bleeding is profuse.
 You aren’t able to at least slow the bleeding after applying direct pres-
sure for ten minutes.
 The cut is a puncture wound (from a nail or another sharp, thin object,
or from an animal bite).
 The cut has jagged edges (which are unlikely to close by themselves).
 The cut is deep and on his face, or if it’s in an area where it’s simply
unlikely to stay closed (on a knee or an elbow, for example).
Baby may need a stitch or two to mend the wound. For more information on
cuts, see Chapter 19.
335
Chapter 23: Ten Reasons to Call Your Pediatrician

Extreme Changes of Behavior
A radical difference in Baby’s behavior may indicate that something is going
on inside her body, whether it’s an illness or injury. Call the doctor right away
if your child:
 Is difficult to rouse
 Cries inconsolably
 Isn’t able to do the things she usually does (she’s been crawling well for
weeks, and suddenly she’s unable to hoist herself up off the ground)
Rashes
Children are prone to all kinds of rashes. Some of them are contagious; many
aren’t; some are symptoms of a virus or other illness. Most are uncomfort-
able for Baby. If your child breaks out in spots, or has a rash that is spreading
or is itchy, call your doctor to confirm a diagnosis and to get advice on how to
care for it. Diaper rash is usually not cause for concern, however. Most often,
it can be cleared up with ointment. If a diaper rash starts to look red, swollen,
and meaty (you’ll know when you see it), it may be a yeast infection (even in
a little boy). Call the doctor for diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. For more
on rashes, see Chapter 18.
Seizures
A seizure is one of the most frightening things for a parent to see: Your child
is on the floor or in the crib, body tensed up, eyes rolled back — and there’s
nothing you can do to help except to lay him on his side to prevent choking
on spit-up or saliva, and to clear the area around him so that he doesn’t hurt
himself. If your child has been diagnosed with a seizure disorder (he has
seizures when he has a fever, for example), you will already have been given
instructions on when to call the doctor. If your child has never had a seizure
before, call right away.

lthough you need to know when to call the doctor, you also need to
know when not to call — or when to simply wait until the morning.
Sometimes, the best cure is Mom’s love. Other times, you have to take a 
wait-and-see attitude, particularly with mild illnesses like a cold. Sometimes,
you just have to sit back and let nature take its course.
Please remember that although your doctor is on call, she is with her family,
helping with homework, bathing kids, putting them to bed, and trying to get a
good night’s sleep herself. Please call for emergencies, not routine questions!
For more information on Baby’s health, see Part VI of this book.
Low-Grade Fever
Although any fever should be evaluated in an infant who is less than 3 months
old, a temperature in an older baby that’s slightly over normal (98.6 degrees)
but below 101 degrees isn’t usually serious. After 3 months, almost all fevers
can wait a day or two before being evaluated by the doctor, especially if Baby
has no other symptoms (like a cough, a decrease in appetite, difficulty breath-
ing, or pulling or swatting at the ears). Call during regular office hours for advice
on pain reliever dosages. The fever may subside on its own; if it doesn’t after
several days, make an appointment with your pediatrician. For information
on when to take a fever more seriously, flip to Chapter 23.

A fever is sometimes a side effect of immunizations. In lieu of other, serious
symptoms (difficulty breathing, unusual and severe listlessness), a fever fol-
lowing a shot is not cause for concern at any age. For information on how to
take Baby’s temperature, see Chapter 18.
Manageable Crankiness
Babies who don’t feel well sometimes show their discomfort by being very
disagreeable. If your child is easily soothed (by being rocked or simply be
being held), she’s probably just not feeling tip-top. If nothing comforts her for
over one hour and she cries continuously for that period of time, call your
pediatrician.
Runny Nose
A simple cold doesn’t need to be evaluated by the doctor. If Baby has a runny
and/or stuffy nose and a little cough and no fever, let the virus run its course.
A cold that just won’t go away after a couple of weeks, a severe cough, wheez-
ing, or difficulty breathing, the development of a worrisome fever, and/or
extreme, inconsolable irritability are symptoms that warrant a call to the
doctor’s office.
Just a Little Lethargy
If Baby is feeling a little under the weather, expect him to be less active.
Worrisome lethargy means that you aren’t able to wake him, or that he’s com-
pletely out of it. If he simply isn’t bouncing off the walls when he has a cold,
that’s normal.
You don’t want to do your normal activities with the same energy and excite-
ment when you’re sick either (although you do them because your name is
Mommy).
Loss of Appetite
A breastfed infant shouldn’t go more than three to four hours between feed-
ings; bottlefed babies go slightly longer sometimes. When Baby is becoming
more active (learning to move, finding that he can manipulate toys, exploring
338
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

the kitchen cabinets), it’s normal for his appetite to drop. He simply has
other things to do. If he seems healthy and happy and he’s just not eating as
much as he normally does, his loss of interest in eating and/or nursing is
probably just due to his increased interest in the rest of the world.
Babies experience a loss of appetite when sick, just like you do. As long as
she wets her diaper every 8 to 12 hours, she’s okay.
Increase in Appetite
As Baby grows, he needs to eat more to keep his energy levels up. Don’t be
surprised — and resist the urge to cut him off — if he suddenly wants to
nurse more at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months. Babies typically go through a
growth spurt at these ages. When he’s on solids, let him determine how much
he wants to eat. He’ll know when he’s full.
Constipation
Its normal for babies to poop less often as they get older, even skipping one
to three days between stools. It’s also normal for Baby to grunt, push, and have
a red face when pooping. (You try pooping while you’re lying down — it ain’t
easy!) If baby hasn’t pooped for several days and seems uncomfortable —
she’s drawing her legs up, she’s crying, and has a decreased appetite, try a
pediatric glycerin suppository, or try taking a rectal temperature to stimulate
a bowel movement. This usually does the trick. You can call the doctor’s
office during regular office hours to find out how to keep this from happening
repeatedly.
Teething
There’s nothing your pediatrician can do for Baby’s sore gums except offer
you the same advice you’ll find in most baby books: Pain relievers. Teething
rings. Extra attention. And patience.
Scrapes, Bruises, Bumps
Most injuries that children sustain aren’t serious. Wash a scrape out. Put ice
on a bump. Bandage an open cut. You don’t need to call the doctor for these
339
Chapter 24: Ten Reasons Not to Run to Your Pediatrician

minor wounds. However, if bleeding is profuse or a cut is deep or jagged, or if
Baby has bumped his head and is showing signs of having a serious head
injury (loss of consciousness, vomiting, large or uneven pupils, loss of motor
function), call your doctor right away. For more on treating minor injuries,
see Chapter 19.
Mild Allergic Reactions
Unless your child is showing signs of a moderate to severe allergic reaction
to something (a rash that covers her body, swelling of the eyes and lips, diffi-
culty breathing), removal of the offensive agent is usually enough to stop the
reaction. If you’ve washed Baby’s clothes with regular detergent and she
develops a little rash on her stomach, discontinue its use. If you’re trying out
a new veggie and her cheeks turn pink, stop feeding it to her. If Baby does
develop symptoms of a serious reaction, call your doctor immediately. For
more information on allergic reactions, turn to Chapter 18.
