ABSTRACT
This book provides beginners in computer graphics and related ﬁelds a guide to the concepts,
models, and technologies for realistic rendering of material appearance. It provides a complete
and thorough overview of reﬂectance models and acquisition setups, along with providing a se-
lection of the available tools to explore, visualize, and render the reﬂectance data. Reﬂectance
models are under continuous development, since there is still no straightforward solution for
general material representations. Every reﬂectance model is speciﬁc to a class of materials.
Hence, each has strengths and weaknesses, which the book highlights in order to help the reader
choose the most suitable model for any purpose. The overview of the acquisition setups will pro-
vide guidance to a reader who needs to acquire virtual materials and will help them to understand
which measurement setup can be useful for a particular purpose, while taking into account the
performance and the expected cost derived from the required components. The book also de-
scribes several recent open source software solutions, useful for visualizing and manipulating a
wide variety of reﬂectance models and data.

Preface
The quest for photorealism drives research toward new developments in Computer Graphics and
related ﬁelds, with the aim of ﬁnally conquering the uncanny valley and making the virtual world
indistinguishable from the real one. Achieving a photorealistic virtual representation of the real-
world involves several factors, among which is a faithful reproduction of material appearance.
Human perception of the appearance of an object depends on the way its surface reﬂects the
incident light, since the reﬂection provides important visual cues about material properties, such
as glossiness and color, used to identify the type of material (plastic, metal, rubber, ceramic,
fabric, etc.) and additional information, for instance dry/wet or smooth/rough textures. Visual
properties are related to physical characteristics like the diﬀuse and specular albedo, the index of
refraction of the material (as well as that of the physical media in which it is placed, such as air
or water), its surface roughness, and so on. The interaction between an opaque, homogeneous
surface and the lighting incident on it can be described by the radiometric Bidirectional Re-
ﬂection Distribution Function (BRDF). A huge body of computer graphics research has been
carried out in order to derive compact and accurate models for BRDFs.
Selecting a suitable reﬂectance model to render a virtual material is not a straightforward
task, since each reﬂectance model often aims to represent speciﬁc (subsets of) properties, with
the result that a given model can describe plastic very well but not metals, and so on. Not all the
BRDF models have become widespread in software packages, and the most common ones can
be implemented diﬀerently in diﬀerent renderers, leading to a slightly diﬀerent rendered image.
Hence, in this book we will focus on the theory rather than in the implementation. The reader
will ﬁnd accurate information about BRDF models, their taxonomy and characteristics, and
the setup used to acquire the BRDF data, which range from low-to-high cost and low-to-high
accuracy.

Introduction
The visual appearance of an object is a complex phenomenon, and to describe it properly it is
important to understand how a material interacts with the light. For this purpose, many re-
ﬂectance functions have been investigated, not only in computer graphics, where it is an active
research ﬁeld aiming to obtain photorealistic renderings, but many other disciplines like physics,
optical engineering, computer science, and psychology, where considerable time and resources
are being invested in the acquisition and representation of reﬂectance functions. In fact, material
appearance plays an important role in many areas of science and industry:
• Computer Vision (e.g., in object recognition applications)
• Aerospace (e.g., for optimal deﬁnition of satellite mirrors reﬂectance and scattering prop-
erties)
• Optical Engineering, Remote-Sensing (e.g., land cover classiﬁcation, correction of view
and illumination angle eﬀects, cloud detection, and atmospheric correction)
• Medical Applications (e.g., diagnostics)
• Art (e.g., 3D printing)
• Applied Spectroscopy (e.g., physical condition of a surface)
• Film, Games, Virtual Reality, Marketing, etc.
The world of technology is evolving and oﬀering new, innovative technology that al-
lows the “synthetic world” to look more and more realistic: as a consequence, digital reproduc-
tion of real-world material is growing rapidly. These results are driven by the combined eﬀort
of researchers, engineers and artists. However, despite the number of material reproduction
techniques, material modeling is still a popular topic in research and industry since there is no
straightforward way to digitize materials, and often the acquired data is not consistently reusable.
As mentioned, a challenge in computer graphics is how to handle visual appearance ac-
curately measuring and representing material characteristics from the real-world in order to
replicate a material behavior and its interaction with the light. Several models and acquisition
techniques suggested by researchers in recent years are often aimed at a particular subset of ma-
terial properties. Ultimately, this limits the applicability of a method only to a speciﬁc class of
materials. In fact, many methods and setups can properly deal with only a few classes of materials

1. INTRODUCTION
(e.g., leather, fabric, car paint, wood, plastic, rubber, mirrored surfaces, etc.) and unfortunately
there is no universal way to acquire and represent all classes. If we look at the material represen-
tation side, it could be challenging to choose which a model. On the other hand, digital artists
have been provided with applications that include material models with intuitive control, but
generally they oﬀer only few material models clearly identiﬁable with a known analytic formula
in the scientiﬁc literature. Wider choice of material models is also available in physically based
renderers, but those might be diﬃcult to use and far from intuitive. An additional challenge is
that the same material rendered in diﬀerent applications might appear diﬀerently due to light
tracing algorithms and other implementation choices. The cost of the material digitization could
be high or low, where a high cost is not necessarily better. On the material acquisition side, time
and costs often represent additional constraints, since they vary enormously across the available
measurement devices, and high acquisition time and cost do not necessarily mean “better” (or
worse, for that matter).
1.1
CHALLENGES
A major challenge in computer graphics is how to simply and accurately measure the appear-
ance of material characteristics from real-world objects and implement practical editable syn-
thetic materials accurately matching the appearance of the original. Currently, no up-to-date
universal material model that can represent leather, fabric, car paint, wood, plastic, rubber, mir-
rored surfaces, etc. exists [SDSG13]. A variety of rendering algorithms are used in the software
pipeline, resulting in a need for optimized material representations, which requires both a ﬂexi-
ble acquisition process and representation methods. Unfortunately, the following challenges still
persist:
• there is no widely adopted solution;
• few solutions acquire material models that are good enough for a wide range of commercial
applications without signiﬁcant lor and money;
• there is no standardized material model formats from acquisition setups;
• there is little standardization across renderers, with diﬀerent renderers supporting subsets
of material properties;
• material models are hard to edit by artists;
• acquired material models have a high memory footprint which limits applicability;
• it is not easy to assess the accuracy of a material model or a measurement setup.

SCOPE OF THE BOOK
This book provides an overview of reﬂection functions, the state-of-the-art material models
and reﬂection acquisition setups, and could be seen as a beginner’s guide providing existing
techniques for material representation and acquisition in computer graphics, aimed to help
in selecting the most appropriate reﬂectance models and measurement technique for a spe-
ciﬁc problem. The focus is mainly on current Bidirectional Reﬂectance Distribution Function
(BRDF) representations and acquisition setups, although diﬀerent reﬂectance functions will be
described where appropriate. For better understanding of the reﬂectance topic, we begin with a
brief overview of the existing reﬂectance functions, provided in Chapter 2.
Selecting a suitable reﬂectance model to render a virtual material is not a straightforward
task since each reﬂectance model often aims to represent a speciﬁc (subset of) properties, with
the result that a given model can describe plastic very well but not metals and so on; BRDF
models are described in Chapter 3, where we also describe some tools for BRDF visualization
and ﬁtting. In this book we also present diﬀerent acquisition setups, ranging from low to high
cost, each with a varying degree of accuracy. Reﬂectance acquisition setups are described in
Chapter 4, where we guide the reader through available techniques, providing pros and cons of
each setup.
For relevant background in mathematics we suggest some additional readings, such as
Ström et al. [SAA15]; as for the physics background the reader can ﬁnd more details in [Gla94].

Reﬂectance Functions
Human perception of a material depends on how the light that reﬂected, transmitted, absorbed
by an object and reaches the viewer [DR05]. Hence, the appearance of materials may vary signif-
icantly depending on a wide range of properties such as color, smoothness, geometry, roughness,
reﬂectance and angle from which the material is viewed and lighting directions.
Clearly not all materials interact with light in the same way: some let part of the light go
through the surface, even to the extent of being transparent or semi-transparent; some scatter the
light back, toward the light source itself; others show a mirror-like behavior. A ray of light can hit
a surface at particular point of an object surface and possibly “travel” under its surface in diﬀerent
directions before leaving the surface in a diﬀerent spot, after some time, with a totally diﬀerent
direction than initially. The most general reﬂectance function hence would need to take into
account a number of variables (namely 16), which includes the wavelength of the incident ray
of light (1 variable) and its direction (2 variables), the time when the ray of light hits the surface
(1 variable) and the location on the surface (3 variables), the wavelength (1 variable) and direction
(2 variables) of the ray of light leaving the surface at a (possibly) diﬀerent location on the surface
(3 variables) after some time (1 variable), and it must also account for the transmittance direction
though the surface (2 variables). These parameters and the parametrization of such a general
reﬂectance function RF are summarized in the following Table 2.1 and Equation 2.1:
RF .i; i; i; xi; yi; zi; ti; r; r; r; xr; yr; zr; tr; t; t; / :
(2.1)
The reﬂectance function RF needs to be measured for each wavelength in the visible spectrum
or, at the very least, for the color channels of the RGB color space. Such a reﬂectance function,
schematized in Figure 2.1, can fully describe a material appearance; however, due to its high
dimensionality it is currently unfeasible to measure and would produce a vast amount of data,
which cannot be handled by current computer graphics and virtual reality applications, consid-
ering also that the most general deﬁnition of a RF includes the dependence on the polarization
state of the incident and reﬂected light.
For these reasons, in computer graphics and related ﬁelds it is customary to rely on several
classes of simpliﬁed reﬂectance functions, obtained by discarding some dimensions, more suited
for a practical use; in Figure 2.2 we report the taxonomy of the reﬂectance functions introduced
in this section, along with their parameterizations.
The aforementioned simpliﬁcations are obtained by assuming the radiance to be constant
along the rays of light, which allows discarding the z coordinate of the points on the surface un-

der consideration. By dropping the dependency on the time (ti and to, hence assuming that the
light transport does not take a measurable time), on the wavelength (i and o), thus assuming
that the interaction with the surface does not change the wavelength of the light and restrict-
ing our attention to the RGB color bands) and assuming no transmittance (t D t D 0), we
obtain the Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reﬂectance Distribution Function (BSSRDF), the most
complex reported in Figure 2.2, which has 8 dimensions. The BSSRDF is able to represent a
ray of light incident at a point on the surface, traveling under the surface where it gets scattered
in diﬀerent directions before leaving the surface from a diﬀerent point and in a diﬀerent di-
rection. Many common translucent materials like milk, skin and alabaster are characterized by

their subsurface scattering behavior that smooth the appearance of surface details, with the light
shining through them. Thanks to its properties the BSSRDF is able to describe phenomena like
translucency, self shadowing, self occlusions and inter-reﬂections. Unfortunately, it is still a very
complex function to measure and often simpler representations are preferred over it.
If we assume that the ray o light leaves the surface at the same location where it was
incident (hence xi D xr D x, yi D yr D y), we obtain the Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF),
a 6-dimensional representation able to describe not only the local variations in reﬂectance but
also the mesoscopic eﬀects due to small-scale geometry, like self-shadowing, self-occlusions
and inter-reﬂections: BTF.x; y; i; i; r; r/. The term BTF was ﬁrst introduced by Dana et
al. [DVGNK99] as an image-based representation that can describe the ﬁne-scale appearance of
a rough surface. The mesoscopic eﬀects are diﬃcult to quantify and separate from the measured
data, hence BTF acquisition generally needs a large number of samples of the surface as well
as high-end hardware support due to lengthy acquisition times and storage demands [HF13].
Nevertheless, there exist low cost acquisition setups, like the kaleidoscopic device by Han and
Perlin [HP03] or the more recent mechanical gantry with rotating arms by Filip et al. [FVK14],
built using a toy construction set. BTFs generally result in very realistic material appearance. The
ﬁrst BTF database, described in [DVGNK99], contains 61 real-world surfaces, each observed
under 205 diﬀerent combinations of lighting and viewing illuminations (plus 205 additional
measurements for anisotropic surfaces), consisting of over 14.000 images.
A similar parameterizations is used to represent the Spatially Varying Bidirectional Re-
ﬂectance Distribution Function (SVBRDF), used to describe opaque, smooth materials that can
have diﬀerent reﬂectance at each point of the surface (non-homogeneous materials) [HF13].
The SVBRDF parameterization hence must takes into account the location over the surface:

2. REFLECTANCE FUNCTIONS
SVBRDF.x; y; i; i; r; r/. Capturing the SVBRDF sometimes requires long measurements
and processing times as well as large, specialized and expensive hardware rigs, although under
certain assumptions approximate measurements can be performed even with cellphone or tablet
cameras [AWL15, RPG15]. The SVBRDF cannot describe subsurface scattering and meso-
scopic eﬀects.
For a homogeneous material that can reﬂect light but also transmit it through its sur-
face we need to reintroduce the transmittance angles (t; t/, thus obtaining the Bidirectional
Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF), comprising scattering eﬀects for both reﬂection and
transmission: BSDF.i; i; r; r; t; t/. The BSDF can describe both transparent and opaque
materials.
If we take into account only the transmittance of homogeneous material it is possible to
describe it with the Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function (BTDF), suitable to model
how the light passes through transparent or semi-transparent surfaces [WMLT07], [HF13]:
BTDF.i; i; t; t/.
An opaque, smooth, homogeneous material can be represented with the Bidirectional Re-
ﬂectance Distribution Function (BRDF): BRDF.i; i; r; r/. By looking at Figure 2.2 it is pos-
sible to note how the BRDF can be considered a special case of the more complex functions
described above [ASMS01]. In fact, the BRDF can be considered as a special case of the BTF
and the SVBRDF when the position on the sample surface is ﬁxed; any BTF datasets can be
approximated as a sparse linear combination of rotated analytical BRDFs [WDR11] and the
SVBRDF parameterization includes extra parameters with respect to the BRDF simply to take
into account the location over the surface, but it must fulﬁll the BRDF reciprocity and energy
conservation properties, which will be described in the next sections. Finally, a BSDF can be
modeled as a sum of a BRDF (for the reﬂection component) and a BTDF (for the transmittance
component).

As discussed in the previous section, one of the possible ways to represent the way an opaque,
homogeneous material interacts with the light is through the BRDF (Bidirectional Reﬂectance
Distribution Function), a radiometric function currently used to varying levels of accuracy in
photorealistic rendering systems. It describes, in the general case, how incident energy redirects
in all directions across a hemisphere above the surface. Historically, the BRDF was deﬁned and
suggested over the more generalized BSSRDF (Bidirectional Scattering Surface Reﬂectance
Distribution function) [JMLH01] by Nicodemus [NRH77], as a simpliﬁed reﬂectance rep-
resentation for opaque surfaces: the BRDF assumes that light entering a material leaves the
material at the same position, whereas the BSSRDF can describe light transport between any
two incident rays on a surface. Many common translucent materials like milk, skin and al-
abaster cannot be represented by a BRDF since they are characterized by their subsurface scat-
tering behavior that smooths the surface details, with the light shining through them [GLL04].

These materials are expensive to measure and render. However many techniques have been pro-
posed [JMLH01], [DS03], [HBV03], [DWd08], [DI11], [KRP15].
Before deﬁning the reﬂectance we provide a brief introduction to some important radio-
metric terms. Radiant Energy, the basic unit of energy, is measured in Joules ŒJ  and indicated
with the symbol Q:
Q D hc

ŒJ ;
(2.2)
where h is the Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum and  is the wavelength of
the incident photon. The energy ﬂowing through a surface per unit time is called Radiant Flux,
indicated with ˆ and measured in Watts [W]:
ˆ D dQ
dt
ŒJ=s D W:
(2.3)
The ﬂux ﬂowing per unit of surface area is called radiant ﬂux area density, measured [W/m2] and
indicated by u:
u D dˆ
dA
ŒW/m2:
(2.4)
Two diﬀerent terms are used in order to distinguish the ﬂow of energy toward a surface from
the ﬂow leaving a surface: in the ﬁrst case we refer to irradiance (E); in the second one the term
used is radiosity (B). If instead of referring to the ratio of ﬂux per unit of surface area we take
into account a solid angle, we can deﬁne the intensity I, the radiant energy leaving a point in
the direction ˆ per unit solid angle, measured in [W/sr]:
I D dˆ
d !
!
ŒW/sr:
(2.5)
Finally, the radiant ﬂux per unit solid angle and per unit projected area is called radiance:
L D
d 2ˆ
d!dA cos 

W
sr  m2

:
(2.6)
In the following we indicate the radiance arriving at a surface with Li and the radiance leaving
a surface with Lr.
We are now ready to deﬁne the BRDF as the ratio of the reﬂected radiance Lr to incident
irradiance E:
fr .vi; vr/ D dLr .vr/
dEi .vi/ ;
(2.7)
where vi and vr are vectors describing the incident .i/ and exitant .r/ directions. By taking
into account the incident radiance Li instead of Ei, thus considering the solid angle around the
incident lighting direction and the cosine of the angle between the latter and the surface normal,

10
2. REFLECTANCE FUNCTIONS
we can write the Equation (2.7) in a diﬀerent form, which allows understanding how the units
of a BRDF are inverse steradian Œ1=sr:
fr .vi; vr/ D
dLr .vr/
Li .vi/ cos id!i
:
(2.8)
Researchers have measured hundreds of BRDFs, suggested implementation techniques
and utilized user input to edit and enhance materials. Recent implementations have expanded
material libraries but have not improved signiﬁcantly upon material representation eﬃciency.
However, the uptake of acquired models has not been widespread across rendering packages
due to their data and storage requirements.
To understand the way the BRDF is parameterized, let’s take into consideration a point p
on a surface and the surface normal n at that speciﬁc location on the surface; on the plane tangent
to the surface in p we ﬁx a reference direction t, called tangent direction, and its perpendicular
direction b on the plane: n  t  b deﬁnes a local reference frame. Once we set the incoming
light direction and the outgoing direction (viewing direction), the angle between the surface
normal and the viewing direction is called i; similarly the angle between the surface normal
and the outgoing direction is called r. If we take the projection of the viewing direction on
the tangent plane, the angles between the tangent direction and the projection of the incoming
direction are called respectively i, and r.
Figure 2.3 shows the geometry of the BRDF and the vectors used for parameterizations:
• n is the normal at a speciﬁc point p on the surface.
• t is the tangent vector. It is perpendicular to the normal n and hence it is tangent to the
surface at p.
• b is the bi-tangent vector, deﬁned as b D n  t. In literature it is also named as binormal
vector.
• h is the halfway vector [Rus98], deﬁned as: h D .viCvr/
kviCvrk.
Another very common way to parameterize the BRDF is the halfway h vector shown
in Figure 2.4, deﬁned by the normalized vector sum of the incoming and outgoing directions.
In this case we are taking into account the angle between the surface normal n and the halfway
vector h. This has important implications in the way the measured data can be stored, compressed
and can speed up computation of speciﬁc models. The use of the halfway vector enables another
possibility to deﬁne a local reference frame, in which one of the axes is aligned with h and the
other two are given by b’ D .nh/
knhk and t’ D b’  h.
There exist other coordinate systems and parameterizations especially suited for dimen-
sionality reduction of some isotropic BRDF models, for instance the barycentric coordinate
system with respect to a triangular support proposed by Stark et al. [SAS05], or the hybrid
model described by Barla et al. which could lead to a better repartition of samples to cover most
of the eﬀects of materials [BBP15].

BASIC BRDF MODELS
There are many reﬂectance models that are simpliﬁed subsets of the BRDF function. One of
the simplest reﬂectance models is the Lambertian model, which represents the perfect diﬀuse
reﬂectance and is often used in many interactive applications, since it requires no recalculation
with the change of viewing direction. The model simply assumes that the surface reﬂects light
uniformly in all directions with the same radiance (see Figure 2.5, in yellow), constant with vr,
unlike other BRDF models: fr .vi; vr/ D d=, where d is the diﬀuse albedo.
In the case of a pure specular BRDF all the light is reﬂected in a single direction for a
given incident direction (see Figure 2.5, in light blue). In fact, light that is incident within a dif-
ferential solid angle d!i from direction .i; i/ is reﬂected in a diﬀerential solid angle !r in di-
rection .i; i C /, hence the pure specular BRDF can be formalized with a double Dirac delta
function: fr .vi; vr/ D sı .i   r/ ı .i C    r/, where s D Lr=Li is the specular albedo.
Perfect specularity is valid only for highly polished mirrors and metals.
Surfaces not perfectly smooth, which have some roughness at the micro-geometry level,
have a glossy appearance and show broader highlights, other than specular reﬂections (see Fig-
ure 2.5).
Some materials, like the surface of the moon or some biological tissues, show a phe-
nomenon called retro-reﬂection in which light is scattered not only in the forward direction but

also in the direction of the illuminant. Real material tends to display a mixture of the aforemen-
tioned basic reﬂectance types, giving rise to very complex reﬂection properties.
BRDFs can be classiﬁed by taking into account the characteristics of the reﬂection,
whether they change by rotating the surface around its normal direction:
• Isotropic BRDFs are able to represent materials whose reﬂection does not depend on the
orientation of the surface, since the reﬂectance properties are invariant to rotations of the
surface around n.
• Anisotropic BRDFs can describe materials whose reﬂection changes with respect to rotation
of the surface around n; this class includes materials like brushed metal, satin, velvet and
hair.
The Fresnel eﬀect predicts the fraction of power that is reﬂected and transmitted and has
a great impact on the appearance (Figure 2.7). Many basic BRDF models have lost importance
in the context of physically based modeling because they do not account for a Fresnel term.
For conductive materials, like metals, the fraction of light reﬂected by pure specular reﬂection is
roughly constant for all angles of incidence, whereas for non-conductive materials (dielectrics),
the amount of light reﬂected increases at grazing angles; see Figure 2.6 for a comparative ex-
ample of the behavior of metals and dielectrics. The fraction of light reﬂected is called Fresnel
reﬂectance, which can be obtained from the solution of Maxwell’s equations and depends also
on the polarization state of the incident light. For unpolarized light, the Fresnel reﬂectance F

(2.10)
where F.0/ is the Fresnel reﬂectance at normal incidence; in the following chapters we will
generally use the symbol F to refer either to the exact Fresnel reﬂectance or one of its approxi-
mations.
A BRDF should respect some basic physical properties, namely non-negativity, reciprocity
and energy conservation:
• non-negativity: the BRDF is a non-negative function, hence for any pair of incident and
outgoing direction fr .vr; vi/  0;
• the Helmholtz reciprocity principle states that the light path is reversible for any pair
of incident and outgoing direction: fr .vi; vr/ D fr .vr; vi/. This principle holds only for
corresponding states of polarization for incident and emerging ﬂuxes, whereas large dis-
crepancies might occur for non-corresponding states of polarization [CP85]. In designing
a rendering system possible non-reciprocity should be taken into account [Vea97].

Models of BRDF
In the last 40 years many material models have been proposed and some BRDFs are able to de-
scribe a wide subset of a material properties we have mentioned. Generally they can be classiﬁed
into three big families that have diﬀerent purposes and diﬀerent ways of calculating interaction
with light:
• Phenomenological
• Physically based
• Data driven
Phenomenological models, also known as Empirical models, are entirely based on re-
ﬂectance data, which is ﬁtted to analytical formulas, thus approximating the reﬂectance and
reproducing characteristics of real world materials, but they will not necessarily appear realistic
unless placed in an accurately simulated environment for such a model.
Physically based models are based on Physics and Optics, with the assumption that the
surface is rough at a ﬁne scale, therefore described by a collection of micro facets with some
distribution D of size and direction; these models are also referred to as “ﬁrst principle” models.
Usually they are represented by accurate and adjustable formulae; however the most common
mathematical model has the form:
fr .vi; vr/ D D  G  F
4 cos ir
(3.1)
which also takes into account the Fresnel term F . Eﬀects like masking and self-shadowing
(see Figure 3.1) [AMHH08] depend on the projected area of the microfacets and hence on
the distribution D, generally described by the geometrical attenuation term G; for a review of
common masking functions and a derivation of the exact form of the masking function from the
microsurface proﬁle, see the work by Heitz [Hei14]. This class of models can represent unique
properties of the material and may include subsurface structure, generally resulting in complex
calculations due to the interaction of the light with the surface structure.
Data-Driven models approximates measured BRDFs with a suitable function space, for
example, spherical harmonics or wavelets, weighted sum of separable functions or product of
functions. Measured BRDF data, produced by most of the setups described in Chapter 4, can
be stored in a table or a grid and then interpolated to produce a large look-up table when data
is needed. This method is simple but ineﬃcient in terms of storage. Moreover, the measured

raw data is often noisy, hence the noise is likely to appear in the rendered material. A measured
BRDF can be ﬁtted to analytic models and employed to reconstruct the BRDF, thus signiﬁ-
cantly reducing storage size. The downside of this strategy is related to the inﬂexibility of many
models, which are hard to edit and able to represent only limited classes of materials. A dif-
ferent solution is to approximate measured BRDFs with a suitable function space, for example,
spherical harmonics or wavelets, weighted sum of separable functions, or product of functions.
We refer to this class of models as Data-Driven models, described in Section 3.3.
Many media, such as hair, fur, cloth, and knitwear are diﬃcult to describe by a surface
model. These materials, and objects with highly complex boundaries, are better described by vol-
umetric appearance models [KK89, PH89, XCL01], in particular for closer viewing distance,
whereas BRDFs can be used from farther away, as demonstrated by Guarnera et al. [GHCG17]
in their technique for fast reverse engineering of woven fabrics at a yarn level, suitable for rapid
acquisition of woven cloth structure and making use of a surface-based representation. Jakob
et al. [JAM10] introduced a generalization to anisotropic scattering structures, exploited also
for volumes acquired by CT scans [ZJMB11]. More recently, collections of individual ﬁbers
have been used for fabric representation [KSZ15]. In this book we focus on representation and
acquisition of surface reﬂectance, hence we do not further discuss volumetric representation.
A very important aspect is the practicality of a model in a rendering system, which re-
quires a suitable technique for importance sampling. When calculating the radiance direction
of a surface in a scene, accounting for the contribution of light from all possible directions is
expensive to compute. Therefore Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the values with
fewer samples [Hai91], based on a stochastic process. However, the number of samples should
be suﬃcient to produce consistent estimations; otherwise the results will vary signiﬁcantly. Im-

17
portance sampling can be used to reduce sample variance [LRR04] by distributing samples ac-
cording to the known elements, either taking into account the reﬂection model in use or the
incident light [CJAMJ05].
Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 summarize the characteristics of the reﬂectance models detailed
in the following sections, selected to widely cover as many possible unique models proposed in
the computer graphics and Vision literature, suitable for a broad range of materials. Figure 3.2
reports the taxonomy of reﬂectance models, depicted more in detail in Figures 3.3, 3.8, and 3.15.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODELS
3.1.1
PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODELS FOR ISOTROPIC MATERIALS
One of the simplest BRDF models was proposed by Phong [Pho75] to describe the reﬂectance
of isotropic materials with a slightly rough surface. The specular reﬂection is modeled by means
of a specular constant, the dot product between the viewing direction and the mirror direction of
the incoming light, and an exponent n that controls the width of the specular lobe (higher values
of n give narrower lobes and a more specular appearance): fr .vi; vr/ D ks.vr  rvi/n, where ks is
a specular constant in the range Œ0; 1, rvi is the direction of vi after being perfectly reﬂected,
and the exponent n controls the shape of the specular highlight. This model does not take into
account energy conservation or reciprocity. Moreover, it does not capture the reﬂection behavior
of real surfaces at grazing angles, since it does not account for the Fresnel eﬀect. A set of render-
ings for increasing values of n are reported in Figure 3.4. Some normalization factors for cosine
lobes have been proposed, either based on double-axis moments [Arv95] or with the simpler
option of a power series in .n  h/ with a suitable sequence of exponents [Lew94].
Blinn [Bli77] suggested a correction to the Phong model. It is still based on the cosine
lobe model. However the dot product is calculated between the surface normal and the halfway
vector. In those years it was costly to calculate the mirror direction of the incoming light, which
needs to be calculated at each position of the scene; thanks to the modiﬁcation proposed by
Blinn, when an orthographic camera is used, and hence the halfway vector can be approximately
considered to be constant across the scene, the computational cost is greatly reduced. Although
it has been used as the default shading model for OpenGL and Direct3D until recent times
(mostly because of the aforementioned reduction in the computational cost), it shares the same
limitations of the Phong model, being physically not plausible: it does not fulﬁll reciprocity nor
energy conservation and it does not account for the Fresnel eﬀect.

n, under environment map lighting; from left to right: n D 30; 60; 100; 1000. The bottom row

Since it follows the cosine function, if n goes to inﬁnity the reﬂected radiance and the albedo
converges to zero toward grazing angles.
Nishino and Lombardi [NL11] proposed a model in which the surface reﬂectance
is described by multiple lobes, whose optimal number k is automatically computed by an
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A BRDF is treated as a statistical distribution on a unit
hemisphere, allowing to model an isotropic BRDF with a mixture of low-dimensional direc-
tional statistics distributions over the hemisphere. Such low-dimensional directional statistics
distributions are called Hemispherical Exponential Power Distribution (Hemi-EPD), probabil-
ity density functions that take in input a direction for vi and return a distribution of directions for
vi. The Hemi-EPD constitutes a basis for the entire BRDF, which can be modeled as mixtures
of Hemi-EPDs, one for each of its 2D slices. The BRDF is parameterized using the halfway
vector and diﬀerence angle; thanks to the isotropy the dependence on h can be dropped. The
expression for the Hemi-EPDs, given the parameters ‚ D ;  and the normalization factor C,
is p.hjd; ‚/ D C.‚/.e cos h   1/. Energy conservation is guaranteed when the condition

Genetic programming can be used to learn new analytical BRDF models, as demon-
strated by Brady et al. [BLPW14]. The training set consists of eight isotropic materials from
the MERL dataset [MPBM03a], whereas the starting seeds are a few simple BRDF models.
The algorithm applies symbolic transformations to the seeds, and the ﬁtness function calcu-
lates the residual error of each variant after ﬁtting the free parameters to the training set. The
random search is heuristic-based, trying to adapt the starting models to the measured ground
truth data. The algorithm tends to produce a large set of candidate expressions, and to allow a
better exploration of the search space, some suboptimal variations that increase the error are al-
lowed, together with an island model genetic algorithm, which sporadically allows interactions
between sub-populations. The grammar does not guarantee that the resulting models respect
energy conservation and reciprocity, hence these properties need to be taken into account by the
ﬁtness function; a table with variants for which energy conservation and reciprocity have been
numerically veriﬁed is reported in [BLPW14].
3.1.2
PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODELS FOR ANISOTROPIC
MATERIALS
The Ward reﬂectance model [War92] is able to represent both isotropic and anisotropic re-
ﬂection, and an eﬃcient for Monte Carlo sampling strategy can be derived for the model; it
combines specular and diﬀuse components of reﬂectance, representing specular peaks through
Gaussian distributions. It was speciﬁcally designed to easily ﬁt measured BRDFs, which have
been used for its validation. The Ward model has four parameters, which can be set indepen-
dently; therefore it can be ﬁtted to a large class of measured data. The anisotropic model makes
use of the two parameters ˛x and ˛y to control the width of the Gaussian lobe in the two prin-
cipal directions of anisotropy:

(3.3)
where s controls the magnitude of the lobe and 4˛2 is a normalization factor; the isotropic
version of the model is obtained by setting ˛x D ˛y. In Figure 3.5 we report the shape of the
isotropic Ward specular lobe for three diﬀerent values of surface roughness ˛x D ˛y.
The model does not obey the principle of energy conservation at grazing angles; this be-
havior has been further investigated in later work such as [NNSK99], [Dür06], [GMD10]. In
particular, a diﬀerent normalization factor has been proposed in [Dür06] to prevent numeri-
cal instabilities and to correct the loss of energy at ﬂat angles, speciﬁcally .4 cos .i/ cos .r//

. However it shares the problem of diverging to inﬁnity with
the original Ward model. A new physically plausible version of the model has been proposed
in [GMD10] (see Figure 3.6), which meets the energy conservation principle even at grazing

Gaussian distributions corresponding to the lobes have been normalized in order to have the

The Lafortune [LFTG97] model is a ﬂexible, empirical model designed to ﬁt measure-
ments from real surfaces and compactly represent them [WLT04]. The model is a generalization
of the cosine lobe model with multiple steerable lobes, based on the Phong model. The primi-
tive functions obey the Energy Conservation and Reciprocity principles. This model allows lobe
speciﬁcation on the surface in terms of shape and direction by simply setting up to three param-
eters and an exponent:

 Cx;lvi xvr x C Cy;lviyvry C Cz;lvi zvr z

(3.5)
where N is the number of lobes, and Cx, Cy, Cz are parameters that absorb the specular albedo
and control retro-reﬂections (by setting Cx, Cy and Cz to positive values), anisotropy (with Cx ¤
Cy) and oﬀ-specular peaks (if Cz is smaller than  Cx D  Cy). Lafortune’s reﬂection model can
represent generalized diﬀuse reﬂectance as the model is able to reﬂect radiance evenly in all
directions by setting Cx D Cy D 0; the Lambertian model can be obtained by setting N D 0.
A comparative study shows that the Lafortune model performs better than the Phong, Ward,
and He et al. models in representing measured BRDFs like white paper, rough plastic, rough
aluminium, and metal [WLT04].

Neumann et al. [NNSK99] proposed some modiﬁcations and correction factors for the
reciprocal Phong [Pho75], [LW94], Blinn [Bli77] and Ward [War92] models. The correction
factors can be seen as shadowing and masking terms to make the models physically plausible.
Moreover the modiﬁed models can be used to render metals and other specular objects and for
each of them an importance sampling procedure is described.
The Ashikhmin-Shirley model (see Figure 3.7) makes use of Phong-like exponents in or-
der to control the shape of the specular lobe and provides a Fresnel-dependent expression for

both diﬀuse and specular reﬂections [AS00]; the reﬂectance of the model changes with the view-
point, hence at grazing angles the reﬂectance is specular and at normal angles the reﬂectance is
diﬀuse. This model assumes microfacets with various angles and sizes [OKBG08] by generaliz-
ing the types of microfacets and allows the expression of arbitrary angles.
The specular component of the BRDF is expressed by:

where F .vi  h/ is the Schlick’s approximation of the Fresnel term [Sch94]. D.h/ is the distri-
bution function of the microfacets, controlled by the parameters ex and ey; the axes of an ellipse
that orientates the halfway vector h of the microfacets, respectively, along the X and Y and thus

In order to preserve energy conservation and to model the behavior of the surface’s diﬀuse color
near the grazing angle, which disappears due to the increase in specular reﬂectance, instead
of a Lambertian diﬀuse term, an angle-dependent form of the diﬀuse component is reported.
The expression is based on the consideration that the amount of energy for diﬀuse scattering is
dependent on the Fresnel reﬂectance at normal incidence:
fr;d .vi; vr/ D .1   F.0// g.vi; vr; n/.28d/=.23/;
(3.8)
where F.0/ is the Fresnel reﬂectance at normal incidence (see Equation (2.10)) and g.vi; vr; n/ D
Œ1   .1   .n  vi/ =2/5Œ1   .1   .n  vr/ =2/5. The model is able to describe anisotropic reﬂec-
tions of two layered materials, such as varnished wood for example, and it is physically plausible.
A sampling method for Monte Carlo rendering is also provided, based on D.h/: it gives the
probability density function p.vr/ D D.h/=4.vi  h/.
Edwards et al. proposed a framework for transforming the halfway vector h into diﬀerent
domains to enforce energy conservation but compromising reciprocity [EBJ06]. By writing
Equation (2.11) in terms of 8vr and assuming that it satisﬁes an equality instead of an inequality,
the function
Q.vi/ D fr.vi; vr/.vi  n/
(3.9)
can be seen as a probability density function (PDF) over the set of incident directions vi on
the hemisphere C. Since the PDF Q.vi/ is related to a PDF q.h/ over halfway vectors by
the formula Q.vi/ D q.h/=.4vi  h/, from Equation (3.9) the following expression for fr.vi; vr/,
which conserves energy, can be derived:
fr.vi; vr/ D Œq.h/ = Œ4.vi  n/.vi  h/ :
(3.10)
In the space of incident directions vi it is diﬃcult to formulate a PDF to describe oﬀ-specular
reﬂection and other phenomena. As for the halfway vector domain, near grazing angles the set of
allowable halfway vectors changes in a complicated way. If a new domain Dh is deﬁned, together
with a PDF p.l/ and a bijection f .h/ D l between the set of halfway vectors h 2 C and the set
of points l 2 Dh, by equating the diﬀerential probabilities between Dh and C, the following
can be derived from Equation (3.10):
fr.vi; vr/ D Œp.l/d.l/ = Œ.4vi  h/d!h ;
(3.11)

28
3. MODELS OF BRDF
where d is the diﬀerential measure over Dh and p.l/d.l/ D q.h/d!h. With this framework,
a new domain can be deﬁned given vr, by translating C so that the center of its base lies at the
tip of vr. In this way, every point on the translated hemisphere corresponds to an unnormalized
halfway vector hu D vi C vr. The ﬁnal step is the transformation of the vectors hu to points l
on the base of the hemisphere; if the local orientation of the surface is given by the orthogonal
vectors u and v, a point on the disk can be deﬁned by the .u; v/ coordinates, hence the PDF
p.l/ is two-dimensional. A possibility is to scale the halfway vector until its tip lies in the base
of the hemisphere, and the resulting energy-conserving BRDF is:
fr.vi; vr/ D
p.l/.vr  n/2
4.vi  n/.vi  h/.h  n/3
(3.12)
since l D .vrn/
.hun/hu. This transform allows describing retro-reﬂective materials by deﬁning a PDF
with high values near the center of the disk, which corresponds to a halfway vector in the retro-
reﬂective direction; to specify shiny BRDFs it is enough to deﬁne a PDF with high values near
the origin of the .u; v/ space, which corresponds to n and gives pure specular reﬂection. To
importance sample the BRDF to obtain h it is enough to generate a point l on the disk accord-
ing to p.l/ and normalize. Alternatively, the orthogonal projection maps hu to the disk along
the direction of n: l D hu   .vi  n/n; it leads to a BRDF with narrower lobes, centered on the
direction of perfect reﬂection. The resulting BRDF, suitable for data ﬁtting, is given by:
fr.vi; vr/ D Œ1=.4.vi  h/2/p.l/ k vi C vr k2 :
(3.13)
To importance sample the BRDF, once a sample l is generated according to p.l/, the unnormal-
ized halfway vector is obtained from the expression hu D l C .vi  n/n. Within the same frame-
work, two additional BRDF models are described: an empirical, energy-preserving BRDF with
limited number of parameters and a BRDF model useful for data ﬁtting, which does not preserve
energy.
The Ashikhmin-Premoze model [AP07], or d-BRDF, follows [TS67] and [CT82] mi-
crofacet theory and is based on the earlier [AS00] model, with a simpliﬁed process of ﬁt-
ting BRDF models to measured data; an eﬃcient sampling technique is also suggested. The
Ashikhmin-Premoze model combines an analytic model with a data-driven distribution and
also discusses how to ﬁt backscattering measurements to the model [GHP08]. The model al-
lows the use of an arbitrary normalized function p.h/, hence specular highlights can be easily
adjusted since their shape depends directly on the distribution. The max term in Equation (3.6),
which causes color-banding artifacts as observed in [AP07], is replaced with a smoother term
.vi  n/ C .vr  n/   .vi  n/.vr  n/. An additional modiﬁcation is to exclude the .h  vr/ term to
improve the appearance matching with real-world materials. The resulting expression for the
specular term, which is reciprocal and non-negative for any non-negative p.h/, can be written
as:
fr;s .vi; vr/ D
F .vi  h/ p.h/ks

where ks is a scaling constant that needs to be chosen in order to fulﬁll energy conservation. The
d-BRDF model improves representation of material reﬂectance at grazing angles and enables
more realistic material appearance. However some eﬀects like retro-reﬂection cannot be modeled
properly. The values of the Fresnel parameters can lie outside the actual range for a given materia,
hence they do not have a physical meaning.

PHYSICALLY BASED MODELS FOR ISOTROPIC MATERIALS
The Cook-Torrance model [CT82] takes into account both specular and diﬀuse reﬂections, the
latter modeled as Lambertian reﬂections. As for the specular component, the model assumes that
only the fraction of the facets oriented in the direction of h contributes to the ﬁnal reﬂection;
moreover it accounts for how many facets are visible from diﬀerent view angles and how they
reﬂect light [WLL09]. These factors are modeled respectively through the functions D, G, and

model can properly model metals, plastic with varying roughness, and view-dependent changes
in color, although it does not follow the energy conservation principle in the entire hemisphere;
additional drawbacks are the not-intuitive parameters.

Beckmann distribution. The ﬁrst two images from the left are rendered under environment map
lighting; the last two images on the right under a point light illumination. The surface roughness
values are reported in brackets.
The He et al. model [HTSG91] accounts for polarization and masking/shadowing eﬀects,
includes specular reﬂection when the surface roughness is low, and takes into account the nature
of light as an electromagnetic wave to model diﬀraction and interference, thus resulting in a very
complex BRDF model. The model is able to represent metal, non-metal and plastic with smooth
and rough surfaces, and all parameters are physically based. The contribution to the reﬂection is
given by three components, namely the specular term for mirror-like reﬂections, the directional
diﬀuse, and the uniform diﬀuse. The specular term describes mirror-like reﬂections from the
mean plane of the surface:

of reﬂection, and d!i is the incident solid angle. The function of the surface roughness g .; / is
given by the expression g .; / D ...2/=/.cos.i/ C cos.r///2. For a smooth surface S ! 1
and g ! 0, hence the expression of the specular term becomes the specular reﬂectivity of a
specular surface. As for the diﬀuse directional term, it describes diﬀraction and interference
eﬀects, which spread out the reﬂected ﬁeld over the hemisphere, with a possible directional and
non-uniform shape of the light intensity distribution:

The directional diﬀuse reﬂection depends on surface roughness  and on the autocorrelation
length . The other parameters are the bisecting unit vector b, the incident polarization state
vector p and the wave vector change wv. For very smooth surfaces, fr;dd decreases to zero, and
for slightly rough surfaces the maximal values are aligned with the specular direction. As the
roughness is increased, the maximal values progressively move from oﬀ-specular angles to graz-
ing angles for very rough surfaces. The uniform diﬀuse term is approximated with a Lambertian
model and denoted by fr;ud .vi; vr/ D a ./. An experimental analysis reported in [NDM05] in-
dicates that when polarization and spectral dependencies are omitted, the He et al. model does
not produce noticeably better visual results than the Cook-Torrance model [CT82]. The model
does not suggest a sampling method and does not describe anisotropic materials.
Oren-Nayar [ON94] enhanced the Lambertian model for rough diﬀuse surfaces to de-
scribe in a more realistic way the behavior of real-world materials like concrete, sand, and cloth,
which show increasing brightness as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction,
rather than being independent of the viewing direction. A rough diﬀuse surface is modeled as a
collection of long symmetric V-cavities, each of which consists of two microfacets with a Lam-
bertian reﬂectance; microfacets orientated toward the light source diﬀusely reﬂect some light
back to the light source (backscatter). The model takes into account masking, shadowing, and
inter-reﬂections. The expression is given by:

B D .0:45  2/=.2 C 0:09/. This model, widely
used in computer graphics, obeys the reciprocity principle and reduces to the Lambertian model
when  D 0. In Figure 3.10 we report an example depicting a terracotta pot; notice the diﬀer-
ences around the edges (Figure 3.10c).
The multilayered model by Ershov et al. [EKM01] represents car paint and consists of
binder pigment particles, ﬂakes, and ﬂake coatings. The model approximates the BRDF of each
sub-layer and then merges sub-layers together and is able to produce a realistic appearance for
car paints and models their components (binder, pigment particles, ﬂakes). However, due to

the complexity of the layered model, the computational time is signiﬁcantly high. An updated
version of the model is simpliﬁed to a bi-layered model and presents a substrate layer as a solid
paint ﬁlm where the reﬂectance is Lambertian and a transparent binder layer with embedded
ﬂakes (see Figure 3.11). Flakes are considered as partially transparent colored mirrors, with the
assumption that the reﬂectance of ﬂakes does not depend on the incident direction and inter-
reﬂections between ﬂakes, so their interaction with light is modeled using constant reﬂectance
values [EDKM04]. A large number of parameters are required and not all of them can be directly
measured. This model is suitable for interactive design of automotive paints by solving through
optimization the problem of ﬁnding pigment composition of a paint from its BRDF.

The work by Smith [Smi67], which investigated the geometrical self-shadowing of a surface
described by Gaussian statistics, is also extended by deriving a shadowing function from any
microfacet distribution D; the BRDF component follows (3.1). The distribution D is diﬀerent
from previous models and has been developed to better ﬁt measured data; it is named GGX and

where ˛g2 is a width parameter and C.x/ is equal to one if x > 0 and zero if x  0. The
GGX distribution has a stronger tail than commonly used distributions, such as Beckmann and
Phong, and thus tends to have more shadowing; in [BSH12] it has been observed that the GGX
distribution is identical to the Trowbridge-Reitz distribution [TR75]. From D it is possible to
derive a simple sampling equation and the expression of G, which is given by:

As previously observed, the GGX distribution has a longer tail than other distributions (see Fig-

lights of highly polished surfaces like the chrome sample in the MERL database [MPBM03a],
with a narrow specular peak and a much wider specular tail [MHH12]. An anisotropic ex-
tension of the distribution, named Generalized-Trowbridge-Reitz, has been proposed by Bur-
ley [MHH12]; a symmetric extension of the GGX to the entire ellipsoid domain, suitable for
volumetric anisotropic materials, is described by Heitz et al. [HDCD15].

alytical BRDF and image-based BTF representation; the acquisition setup is described in Sec-
tion 4.4. The appearance of metallic car paint is separated into the homogeneous BRDF part,
which describes the reﬂection behavior of the base and the top layer of the paint, and the spa-
tially varying BTF part, which is caused by the aluminium ﬂakes. The homogeneous part is rep-
resented by a multi-lobe version of the Cook Torrance model [CT82]. In order to account for
the characteristics of pearlescent paint, which show view-dependent oﬀ-specular color changes,
the model includes a spectral view and light-dependent part. The BRDF parameters are derived
from the BTF measurements by means of a ﬁtting procedure; the BRDF is calculated for every
pixel and subtracted in the RGB space from the captured images. The resulting images contain
only ﬂakes data and are used for a copy-and-paste synthesis approach.
Kurt et al. [KSKK10] proposed a BRDF model based on the halfway vector represen-
tation and Beckmann distribution. The model is physically plausible, can represent anisotropic
materials, can accurately ﬁt data, and suggests an eﬃcient importance sampling method, based
on the strategy proposed by Ward et al. but with a diﬀerent weighting function, which makes
it particularly suitable for Monte Carlo Rendering algorithms. The basic BRDF model they
propose is the sum of a pure Lambertian term and a single specular lobe, which can be readily

where N is the number of lobes, kd is the diﬀuse albedo, ksl is the specular reﬂectivity per lobe,
Fl is a per-lobe Fresnel term, Dl a per-lobe normalized microfacet distribution, and ˛l is a set
of parameters that needs to be chosen carefully to enforce energy conservation.
Bagher et al. suggested a function of tan2 h
 p for the distribution D, where p depends
on the model [BSH12], in order to enhance data ﬁtting for single-layered materials like metals,
metallic paints, and shiny plastics. Otherwise it is very diﬃcult to ﬁt with commonly used dis-
tributions and generally requires several lobes due to the shape of the decrease in their BRDFs,
close to exponential at large angles but sharper at small angles. The model presented is the Cook–
Torrance [CT82], in which the microfacets distribution is designed to eﬃciently and accurately
approximate measured data. The distribution resulting from the suggested slope is called SGD

From the SGD it is possible to derive the shadowing function G and a sampling method.
Low et al. [LKYU12] proposed two isotropic models for glossy surfaces, based ei-
ther on the Rayleigh-Rice light scattering theory (smooth surface BRDF) or the micro-
facet theory (microfacet BRDF). Both models make use of a modiﬁed version of the ABC
model [CTL90], [CT91], which was originally formulated to ﬁt the Power Spectral Density
(PSD) of some measured smooth surfaces. The PSD describes the surface statistics in terms of
the spacial frequencies fx and fy, which depend on the wavelength  of the incident light:

The ABC model [CTL90], [CT91] is able to model the inverse power law shape PSD of pol-
ished data, and it is given by:

ping of the new parameters to the original ABC is: a D A
0, b D B2, and c D .C C 1/=2; in
practice, narrower specular peaks are obtained by increasing b, whereas c controls the fall-oﬀ
rate of wide-angle scattering. The smooth surface BRDF has the following expression:

is the Fresnel term in Equation (3.15) with extinction coeﬃcient set to zero and aimed to ap-
proximate the reﬂectivity polarization factor, which depends on the surface material properties.
Dp is the projected deviation vector, deﬁned as Dp D vr;p   rvi;p, where vr;p is the projection of
vr on the surface tangent plane and rvip is the projection of the mirror direction of vi on the
surface tangent plane. To deal with unreliable data near grazing angles, the value suggested for
the obliquity factor O is 1 instead of the typical deﬁnition of O D cos i cos r. The microfacet
model is based on Cook–Torrance [CT82] and makes use of the modiﬁed ABC distribution:

where F and G are the same as in Equation (3.15), S is the modiﬁed ABC distribution, and kd
is again a scaling factor for the diﬀuse component; the parameter a of S is used as a scaling factor
for the specular term, hence the distribution is not normalized. The model is reciprocal but does
not obey energy conservation. Both models provide accurate ﬁts to measured data (see the blue
metallic paint in Figure 3.14), with the microfacet model showing lower errors, and accurately
represent scattering from glossy surfaces with sharp specular peaks and non-Lambertian wide
angle scattering. For both models an eﬃcient importance sampling strategy is suggested.
The discrete stochastic model by Jakob et al. [JHY14] extends the microfacet theory by
replacing the continuous distribution of microfacets in the Cook-Torrance model [CT82] with
a discrete one, thus assuming that a surface consists of a high but ﬁnite number of scattering par-
ticles. This assumption facilitates modeling a controllable, non-smooth spatially varying BRDF
appearance of a glittery surface, like mica ﬂakes, ice crystals, metallic car paint, and craft glitter
for decorations. The notion of multiscale BRDF is introduced, which takes into account ﬁnite
areas and solid angles rather than single points and directions:

1A and 1!h are the indicator functions of the sets A and !h, respectively. The indicator func-
tions control the appearance of the surface, since they determine which microfacets in A reﬂect
light into the solid angle !r around vr: a high number of participating facets gives a smoother
appearance than a low number, which gives instead a strongly glittery appearance. An eﬃcient
implementation of the model is discussed, together with an importance sampling strategy for
Monte Carlo renderers.
3.2.2
PHYSICALLY BASED MODELS FOR ANISOTROPIC MATERIALS
To simulate both smooth and rough multi-layered materials, Weidlich and Wilkie [WW07]
proposed to combine several microfacet based layers into a single physically plausible BRDF
model. Their model assumes that any microfacet is large in relation to the layer thickness, models
the absorption of part of the light when it travels inside a transparent material, and includes a
total reﬂection term, when light propagates at an angle of incidence greater than the critical
angle; the simplicity of the model does not allow reproducing eﬀects like iridescence.
Dupuy et al. [DHI15] proposed an approach to automatically convert an arbitrary
material to a microfacet BRDF. The facet distribution is obtained by solving an eigenvec-

38
3. MODELS OF BRDF
tor problem, based solely on backscattering samples and simplifying the Fresnel term to a
constant; once an eigenvector with all positive components is found with the power iteration
method, its values are linearly interpolated to build a continuous distribution. The Fresnel term
is then recovered by calculating for each color channel the average ratio between the input
and an ideal mirror microfacet BRDF with a constant Fresnel term equal to 1, in the form
fr.vi; vr/ D D.h/G.vi; vr/=.4 cos i cos r/. This method can ﬁt an anisotropic BRDF in a few
seconds (on an Intel 2.4 GHz Core i5 CPU, when the number of samples evaluated from the
material in the elevation and azimuthal directions is up to 4,096) and allows editing the proper-
ties of the roughness distribution. However its accuracy depends on the density of the measure-
ments in the backscattering direction, thus limiting the applicability to more complex anisotropic
BRDFs [FHV15].
3.3
DATA-DRIVEN MODELS
The general idea behind this class of models is to use the measured data to derive some ad hoc
model, generally based on the principle that a continuous function can be represented by a linear
combination of basis functions, and a mixture of basis functions can be used for interpolation:
for instance, in the Fourier basis, functions are expressed as a sum of sinusoidal and cosinusoidal
terms, whereas in the polynomial basis, a collection of quadratic polynomials are used with real
coeﬃcients.
A possible way to represent BRDFs is to project them onto an orthonormal ba-
sis [AMHH08], mapped onto a unit disc and projected on to a hemisphere. Spherical wavelets,
spherical harmonics, and Zernike polynomials are mathematically and computationally eﬃcient,
since they represent the shape of the BRDF as the sum of low and high frequency functions to
capture the shape of the BRDF. Wavelets [LF97, CPB03, CBP04] can represent large specular
peaks more eﬃciently than spherical harmonics [WAT92] and Zernike polynomials [Rus98].
The limitation of these methods is the signiﬁcant memory requirement even to obtain simple
BRDFs, since a large number of basis functions is generally required.
Separable decompositions of a high-dimensional function f can be used to approximate it
to arbitrary accuracy, using a sum of products of lower-dimensional functions. Four dimensional
BRDFs can be written as a sum of terms, each of which is the product of two-dimensional
functions g.; / and h.; /:

This representation directly approximates the fully tabulated BRDF over all directions, imple-
menting manageability of data for use in rendering systems, and it is also useful for the pur-
pose of importance sampling. If a good approximation can be found for a small N, a separable
decomposition is capable of high compression rates, thus resulting in a compact way to store

3.3. DATA-DRIVEN MODELS
39
large measured datasets while maintaining accurate representation. The parameterization of the
lower-dimensional functions can improve the performance of the decomposition and needs to
be wisely chosen in order to minimize the number of functions needed for BRDF representa-
tions. A common reparameterization makes use of the angle halfway between the incident and
exitant directions and the diﬀerence angle [Rus98] (see Figure 2.4):
fr.vi; vr/ 

kD1

where vh and vd arise from the reparameterization.
A common technique to obtain a separable representation is the Singular Value Decom-
position (SVD) [PFTV88]. Given a matrix M, its SVD is the factorization in the form M D
USWT , where S D diag.k/ is a diagonal matrix of singular values; the columns of U D Œuk
and W D Œwk are orthonormal. The matrix M can be written as:
M D USWT D
K

kD1
kukwT

(3.36)
where ukwT k is an outer product. In Fournier [Fou95] the SVD decomposition is used to ap-
proximate the Blinn-Phong BRDF using Ward’s measured data; the BRDF is approximated
with a sum of terms, each of which is the product of two functions, one of the incident and one
of the outgoing direction.

using the half-angle [Rus98], are discretized into 90  90  180 bins that are smoothed by re-
moving outliers. The linear dimensionality reduction used is the Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), which allows determination of a set of basis vectors that span the linear subspace on
which the BRDFs lie. The RGB color channels are assembled together and analyzed in the
log space in order to reduce the diﬀerence between specular and non-specular values. A linear
combination of a subset of the principal components is used for the reconstruction, and in most
cases 30–40 components give good results. As for the non-linear dimensionality reduction, the
charting algorithm [Bra02] has been used since it gives good results even with a small num-
ber of samples and at the same time reduces the noise in the data. The idea behind charting is
that data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the sample space and tries to ﬁnd
a kernel-based mixture of linear projections to smoothly map the samples on the coordinate
system while preserving local relationships between the sample points. Since each dimension
performs a noise suppression in a diﬀerent direction, the error does not decrease monotonically.
However, they found that the BRDF data lies in a 10D manifold, and a 15D manifold would
suﬃce to synthesize new BRDFs even over long distances. The advantages of such data-driven
BRDF models are the realistic appearance and meaningful parameterization.
Matusik et al. performed a wavelet analysis for all of the measured isotropic
BRDFs [MPBM03b] in order to ﬁnd the maximum required frequency to sample any arbitrary
BRDF correctly. For each BRDF a non-uniform wavelet transform is applied to determine the
highest coeﬃcients able to reconstruct the BRDF itself with high precision while setting to zero
the rest of the coeﬃcients. The union of the sets of non-zero wavelet coeﬃcients (about 69,000),
which show some degree of coherence among diﬀerent BRDFs, corresponds to a set of wavelet
functions called Common Wavelet Basis (CWB). The CWB allows reconstruction of a BRDF
by solving a system of linear equations. In the same work, a simple approach to represent a new
measured BRDF is presented, using a linear combination of the BRDFs in the dataset. Using
this data they construct an over-constrained system of equation in the form P  C  B, where
P is the matrix of the BRDFs in the dataset, C a vector of coeﬃcients, and B the new mea-
sured BRDF. A subset X of the rows of P is constructed in such a way the ratio between the
highest and lowest eigenvalue of the matrix XT X is small. Experimentally they have found that
800 samples are enough to represent a new BRDF.
Romeiro et al. [RVZ08] describe a method for inferring the reﬂectance of isotropic ma-
terials from images, assuming known curved surface with known natural illumination. To re-
duce the dimension of the BRDF domain, parameterized using the halfway vector and diﬀer-
ence angle [Rus98], thanks to the reciprocity assumption it is possible to apply the projection
d  d C ; for isotropic materials it is possible to apply the projection onto the domain
.h; d; d/, and in case of bilateral symmetry (i.e., if the reﬂectance of the material shows lit-
tle changes when vr is reﬂected about the incident plane), it is possible to apply the projection
d  d C =2. If a material is bivariate, in other words it satisﬁes a further generalization of
isotropy, bilateral symmetry and reciprocity, the projection onto the domain .h; d/ 2 Œ0; =2

is allowed. A bivariate representation is often suﬃcient to capture oﬀ-specular reﬂections, retro-
reﬂection, and Fresnel eﬀect. Under these assumptions, the resulting 2D domain is sampled
using the functions s.h; d/ D 2d= and t.h; d/ D
p
2h=pi, which allow to increase the
sampling density near specular reﬂections; since bivariate BRDFs vary slowly over a signiﬁcant
region of their domain, an optimization framework with a smoothness constraint is employed
to recover the BRDF:

retro-reﬂections, and grazing angles, which occur respectively at .h  0/, .d  0/ and .d 

where Px and Py are vector functions. In the following, the parameters of fsd;r are x D Px.vi; vr/

where g1 is a constant if Px.vi; vr/ is ﬁxed and scales the proﬁle h1, while SVD can produce
optimal approximations and minimizes the RMS error, it is expensive in terms of time and
space resources and can produce negative factors in the expansion; the ND algorithm does not
guarantee optimality but requires less memory than the SVD decomposition and is faster. The
lower-dimensional functions are stored into texture maps to allow multiplications being per-
formed by compositing or multitexturing.
McCool and Ahmad presented [MAA01] a decomposition algorithm for both isotropic
and anisotropic BRDFs. The algorithm is based on logarithmic homomorphism (Equa-
tion (3.43)) and is general enough to approximate BRDFs with an arbitrary number of positive
factors and degree of precision while satisfying the Helmholtz reciprocity but is limited to point
and directional light sources. The authors describe a simple parameterization (Equation (3.44))
and demonstrate that it is possible to limit the storage cost to just two texture maps, obtaining
good compression ratios:

rithmic transformation tends to disregard large peaks in the data and smoothes specular high-
lights, which may lead to high approximation errors.
Lawrence et al. [LRR04] presented an importance sampling algorithm for arbitrary
BRDFs based on reparameterizing the BRDFs using the half-angle or the incident angle, fol-
lowed by a non-negative matrix factorization, which is essential for sampling purposes:

The factored form (Equation (3.45)) allows for expressing the BRDF, multiplied by the cosine

2D function Fj dependent only on the outgoing direction and two 1D functions ujk; vjk depen-
dent on the angle chosen for the parameterization vp D .p; p/. The 1D functions are used to
interpret the factors as 1D probability distributions. The results are generally accurate and the
technique can be used for sampling BTFs and light ﬁelds but does not enforce reciprocity, and
the representation may present a discontinuity at the pole of the angle selected for the parame-
terization.

3.3. DATA-DRIVEN MODELS
43
In later work Lawrence et al. [LBAD06] presented an algorithm based on linear con-
straint least squares, capable of compact and accurate SVBRDF representation for rendering.
Under the assumption that BRDFs are blended linearly over the surface, the matrix factor-
ization algorithm provides an editable decomposition and can represent directional and spatial
reﬂectance behavior of a material. The described Inverse Shade Tree (IST) representation takes
as input a measured materials dataset and a user-supplied tree structure and ﬁlls in the leaves of
the tree. IST proceeds top-down at each stage, decomposing the current dataset according to
the type of node encountered in the tree. The leaves provide editability since they correspond
to pieces that are meaningful to the user. The Alternating Constrained Least Squares algorithm
(ACLS) decomposes the SVBRDF into basis BRDFs as 4D functions in tabular form, which
are then decomposed into 2D functions and further into 1D curves. The 1D curves represent
data simply and accurately for isotropic materials; for anisotropic materials the decomposition
ends into 2D functions. The advantage of ACLS is the possibility to easily add linear constraints,
thus allowing to enforce energy conservation, reciprocity, and monotonicity, other than sparsity
and non-negativity, but it requires building a regularly sampled data matrix for factorization.
Tensor representation has been previously used for interactive modiﬁcation of the material
properties and relighting by Sun et al. [SZC07]. Based on the observation that high-frequency
specular lobes generally require a large number of basis terms for reconstruction, thus precluding
interactive performance, the BRDFs are separated into a specular lobe fr;s and the remainder
fr;rm. The specular lobe fr;s is modeled as a sum of four Gaussians, with diﬀerent neighborhood
support (0ı for perfect mirror reﬂection, 7ı, 14ı, and 21ı for broader Gaussians). By removing
fr;s, the BRDF is left with mainly low frequency terms that can be modeled with a small basis
by tensor approximation.
When a non-linear function is used for BRDF data ﬁtting, there are several shortcomings,
due to the number of parameters that can be large depending on the model and the number of
lobes, and to the non-linear estimation process, which can be computationally expensive. Oz-
turk et al. [OKBG08] proposed a representation based on response surface models, deﬁned as
a polynomial function of order p in k variables, and expressing BRDFs as functions of the in-
coming and outgoing direction and transforming the variables of some non-linear reﬂectance
models (speciﬁcally Ward [War92], Lafortune [LFTG97], and Ashikhmin-Shirley [AS00],
described in Section 3.1.2) using Principal Component Analysis, thus obtaining a linear repre-
sentation. This reciprocal but not energy-preserving representation is general enough to model
both isotropic and anisotropic materials, diﬀuse and glossy.
Bilgili et al. [BÖK11] proposed to represent four-dimensional measured BRDFs data as a
function of tensor products, factorized using Tucker decomposition [Tuc66], a generalization of
higher order Principal Component Analysis. Tensors are a generalization of scalars and vectors
to higher orders, and their rank is deﬁned by the number of directions; for example, a scalar is a
zero-order tensor and a vector a ﬁrst-order tensor; the Tucker factorization decomposes a tensor
into a set of matrices and one small core tensor. The logarithmic transformation of a 4D BRDF

by setting all the Tucker parameters to 1:

where i D 1; : : : ; Nh, j D 1; : : : ; Nh, k D 1; : : : ; Nr, l D 1; : : : ; Nr, and Nh, Nh,Nr,Nr

f3.rk/, f4.rl/ are univariate tensor functions respectively evaluated at hi, hj, rk, and rl; the
logarithmic transformation eliminates the problem of estimated negative BRDF values. The er-
ror matrix e1 of this approximation can be written as B0 D B
0

B

sition on the error terms until a satisfactory level of accuracy is obtained; assuming that S is the

1 is the Tucker approximation of e1, e2 is the error term of the second,
and so on. This non-negative representation allows good compression ratios while being able to
represent Fresnel eﬀects and oﬀ-specularities but does not satisfy reciprocity and energy con-
servation. As for the importance sampling, to limit the sampled region for isotropic materials,
it has been shown that most of the total variation is due to two components that correspond
to univariate functions of h and r; a similar property is observed for the anisotropic material,
where the main components are univariate functions of h and h.
Pacanowski et al. [PSCS12] employ a subset of the halfway parameterization [Rus98] to
project measured BRDFs on the two-dimensional space .h; d/ and approximates the projec-
tion by using Rational Functions (RF), since they are able to properly approximate the typical
steep changes of specular lobes. An RF r of a ﬁnite dimensional vector x of real variables is
deﬁned as:
rn;m.x/ D
Pn
j D0 pj bj .x/
Pm
kD0 qkbk.x/;
(3.48)
where pj and qk are real numbers and bj .x/, bk.x/ are multivariate basic functions, for ex-
ample multinomials. Given t C 1 measured values bi located at a vector xi and contained in
the intervals Œb_i; bi, the data ﬁtting problem can be stated as ﬁnding an RF rn;m.x/ with the
smallest possible n C m to interpolate the t C 1 intervals with the additional constraints of non-
negativity, monotonicity, and symmetry: 8i D 0; : : : ; t
b_i rn;m.xi/  bi. The widths of the
interpolation intervals are chosen in such a way that the renderings are visually satisfactory while
keeping the number of coeﬃcients reasonably low; the solution is found by solving a quadratic
programming problem. Isotropic BRDF data are approximated with a single RF, called Rational
BRDF:

The anisotropic model is based on the observation that for some anisotropic materials, like
brushed metals, the variation of the reﬂected intensity, when the surface is rotated around the
normal n, consists of a scaling factor applied to an average isotropic lobe:
fr;s .vi; vr/  ra
n0;m0.h/ri
n;m.h; d/;
(3.50)
where ri
n;m.h; d/ is an isotropic Rational BRDF and ra
n0;m0.h/ is a scaling factor to model
anisotropic variations. The same approximation process applied to BRDFs can be applied to the
inverse Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and used for importance sampling; the use of
RF for BRDFs and CDFs allows obtaining a very small memory footprint.
More recently, tensor representation has been used in [WKB12, WKB14] to represent
anisotropic materials with no assumption on the reﬂectance and scattering behavior, which is
particularly useful in the presence of unusual scattering properties. The measured data is ﬁtted
to a series of radial basis functions in order to derive a continuous representation from the sparse
input 4-D measurements. The incident and reﬂected hemispheres are projected onto disks and
mapped over the unit square; the four dimensions given by the two squares deﬁne a rank-4
tensor, subdivided into a tensor tree for fast Monte Carlo sample generation. The tensor tree
representation adaptively subdivides sharp peaks of the BRDF in diﬀerent regions of the dis-
tribution, with an additional averaging step between incident and reﬂected direction to account
for Helmoltz reciprocity.

AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR BRDF DATA FITTING
AND VISUALISATION
Sources of publicly available measured materials are, other than the previously mentioned
MERL dataset [Mat03], the UTIA BTFs [HM12] and BRDFs [FV14] datasets, and the Bonn
UBO2003 [WGK14] and UBO2014 [WGK14]; as for architectural materials, the pab BME
BSDF gallery [AB14] provides measured data.
Measured BRDF data usually cannot be used directly for rendering due to the noise in the
measurement and needs to be interpolated or ﬁtted to some analytic model. The BRDF analysis
library ALTA [BCP15] provides a set of instructions to perform ﬁtting of the measured data
to an analytical form, statistical analysis of data, and oﬀers a wide range of formats to export
BRDF models. Additionally it provides functions to handle BRDF models, data to work with
BRDF measurements, and ﬁlters for ﬁtting algorithms. Dupuy et al. [DHI15] recently released
a C C C library to ﬁt a microfacet BRDF to an input material.
Open source graphical user interfaces for BRDF visualization and ﬁtting allow to display
and adjust the parameters of several BRDF models. Examples of open source interfaces include
BRDFLab [FPBP09] and BRDF Explorer [MHH12] proposed by Disney (see Figure 3.16
for an example of 2D and 3D visualization of BRDF lobes). These applications handle analytical
and measured reﬂectance models.

BRDF Explorer [MHH12] compares measured material models with existing analytic
models and allows interactive adjustment of a few parameters. BRDFLab allows ﬁtting mea-
sured data to analytical models and also combining diﬀerent reﬂectance models, for example the
Lafortune model and Blinn lobes. The software can also perform real-time optimization of the
models.
BRDF-Shop [FPBP09] is an interface developed to intuitively design arbitrary but physi-
cally plausible BRDFs based on the extended Ward BRDF model. The interface provides control
over the surface roughness and sets of brushes to add reﬂections and highlights. Finally, it is pos-
sible to adjust parameters and render the model under simulated lighting; a plug-in for Maya is
available to the community.
Currently the libraries of measured materials for rendering applications and the BRDF
models included in rendering systems, generally deﬁned as Shaders [Sta99], do not fulﬁll mod-
ern material representation requirements and are computationally expensive. Moreover there is

no universal BRDF model that can represent a wide range of materials, since most of them are
designed to represent a speciﬁc set of phenomena. There are BRDF databases developed for
specialized purposes, but to develop new material, a designer usually still needs to start from
scratch to display it properly.

Acquisition Setups
Measuring or calculating how a surface interacts with light is a time consuming and expensive
procedure, which generates a vast amount of data, but it is important for realistic appearance
of a material model. BRDF measurements are not only used in computer graphics to repro-
duce material reﬂectance, but also in many other ﬁelds such as Computer Vision (e.g., in object
recognition applications), Aerospace (e.g., for optimal deﬁnition of satellite mirrors’ reﬂectance
and scattering properties), Optical Engineering, Remote-Sensing (e.g., land cover classiﬁcation,
correction of view and illumination angle eﬀects, cloud detection, and atmospheric correction),
Medical applications (e.g., diagnostics), Art (e.g., 3D printing), and Applied Spectroscopy (e.g.,
physical condition of a surface).
The setup of a typical measurement device includes a light source to uniformly illumi-
nate a large area of a surface and a detector to measure a small area within the illuminated
region [ASMS01]. Various systems with diﬀerent degrees of accuracy and costs have been con-
structed to measure reﬂectance functions, ranging from gonioreﬂectometers to image-based
measurement systems; low cost setups have also been investigated [HP03, FHV15, RLCP].
By dropping the assumption that a material is homogeneous and opaque, many techniques
for BRDF measurement can be adapted for more complex reﬂectance functions (SVBRDFs,
BTFs, BSSRDFs). Under certain assumptions, setups used to acquire objects geometry through
the classical photometric stereo technique [Woo80], where the point of view is kept constant
between successive images while the direction of incident illumination varies, have been suc-
cessfully used to recover BRDF and SVBRDF of non-Lambertian surfaces [Geo03, GCHS05,
HS05, CGS06, ZREB06, AZK08, HLHZ08]. Some of these techniques are limited to mate-
rials with a single specular lobe [GCHS05] due to the use of optimization algorithms to recover
the parameters for the Ward isotropic BRDF [War92] or require the acquisition of reference
objects of known shape and with similar materials as the target [HS05]; to reduce the num-
ber of input pictures, have been assumed, bivariate BRDFs [AZK08] or spatial coherence of
reﬂectance, trading spatial for angular resolution [ZREB06]. The taxonomy of the acquisition
setups, detailed in the following sections, is reported in Figure 4.1.
To assess the quality of an acquisition setup, it is important to derive a standardized error
between the measured appearance model and the original object [GLS04]. The distance met-
ric E is particularly suitable to measure color diﬀerences; it is deﬁned in the CIE XYZ color
space [WS82], a perceptually uniform space that describes the chromatic response of a standard
human observer to the lighting stimulus, accounting for the incident spectral power distribution.

For digital image sensors, at the heart of image-based systems, the most common color space is
sRGB, which due to the characteristics of the Human Visual System is often prone to inaccura-
cies [Fai05]. Acquired RGB values could be translated into the CIE XYZ and post-processed for
white balancing [WEV02], although metamerism (i.e., spectra that appear identical to a human
observer under a certain light) would still represent a source of errors. A more robust solution
would make use of a carefully characterized acquisition device (e.g., a DSLR camera) to obtain
either a relative [KK08] or an absolute colorimetric estimation of the scene in cd/m2 [GBS14].
Numerical simulation [CMS87, WAT92, HK93, APS00, DWMG15] represents, for
some complex materials, a possible alternative to a measurement device. The material appear-
ance is described by the result of the simulation of the light interaction with the surface (and
sub-surface) structure. Given a geometry that can be ray-traced, Westin et al. in their seminal
work [WAT92] describe a method to simulate scattering hierarchically by using the result of the
simulation at a scale to generate the BRDF for a larger scale.
The measurements are always made with some uncertainty caused by technological limita-
tions of each measurement system component, hence estimating the BRDF of a sample material
with low uncertainty would be expensive.

GONIOREFLECTOMETERS
The gonioreﬂectometer measures the spectral reﬂectance of surfaces; it covers specular and dif-
fuse reﬂectance depending on the settings of the device. The construction of the device was
described by Nicodemus and used in the experimental development of the reﬂection models by
Torrance and Sparrow [TS67], Blinn [Bli77], He et al. [HTSG91], and many others.
The setup proposed by Hsia and Richmond [HR76] consists of a laser beam, an aluminium
sample holder painted with matte black paint and mounted on an arm attached to a turntable
that rotates around the vertical axis. The turntable is placed in front of a detector, which captures
data about light reﬂected from the sample. Two averaging spheres, with the inside part coated
with barium sulfate, are used to measure the incident light.
Foo [Foo97] designed a three-axis automated gonioreﬂectometer with two degrees of
freedom (see Figure 4.2). The measuring system, aimed to isotropic BRDFs, consists of a light
source moving around a sample, a stationary detector, and a folding mirror. The system can
also measure the reﬂection toward grazing angles (up to 86ı) and allows high-dynamic range
measurements, making it considerably accurate. Li et al. [LFTW06] described a similar setup.

Riviere et al. [RCH12] proposed an in-plane multispectral polarized reﬂectometer. The
lighting system makes use of three linearly polarized laser sources, coupled with a polarized
detection system that identiﬁes the polarizer’s axes using the Fresnel Equation (Figure 4.3). It
allows measurements at 0ı lighting and is fully calibrated for polarized and multispectral in-
plane BRDF measurements. Polarized measurements are used to distinguish the diﬀerent scat-
tering processes in BRDF directional components. Since the acquired data is limited to in-plane
measurements, the full BRDF is estimated by ﬁtting the data to the Li-Torrance model [LT05].

IMAGE-BASED MEASUREMENT
Image-based BRDF measurement setups aim to increase the speed of BRDF measurements and
reduce the cost by making use of a series of photographs of a surface and typically requiring only

general-purpose equipment. These photographs are used to estimate the light reﬂected from
various surface orientations; to measure the wavelength spectrum of the BRDF, more pictures,
and hence, time, are required [MD98].
Marschner et al. [MWL99] presented a rapid and accurate isotropic BRDF measure-
ment setup for a broad range of homogeneous materials, including human skin. It can achieve
high resolution and accuracy over a large range of illumination and reﬂection directions. A hand-
held digital camera, equipped with a standard CCD sensor with RGB color ﬁlter array, is used
to measure the BRDF. The camera needs to be characterized in terms of Optoelectronic Con-
version Function (OECF) in order to properly estimate the reﬂected radiance and the irradiance
due to the source. An industrial electronic ﬂash light is used as a light source (see Figure 4.4 for
a schematic representation). This setup allows measuring surfaces with simple analytical shapes,
for example, spherical and cylindrical objects; a 3D scanner is required for more complex ir-
regular shapes. The camera moves from near the light source, to measure near retro-reﬂections,
and to opposite the light source, in order to measure grazing-angle reﬂection. Some additional
photographs are taken by the secondary camera in order to infer the location of the light source
(by means of some machine-readable targets) and its intensity other than from camera and sam-
ple pose. About 30 images from diﬀerent positions are required to cover the three-dimensional
BRDF domain, and a typical measurement session takes about 30 min. Bundle adjustment is
used to estimate the relationship between the geometry of the sample and the positions of the
camera, light source, and sample; thanks to the estimated geometry of the scene, each pixel in
the images is used to derive one sample in the BRDF domain.
A few years later, Matusik et al. [MPBM03a] used a measurement setup similar to
Marschner et al. [MWL99] to capture isotropic BRDFs, stored in a tabular form and in-
terpolated linearly using a small number of basis functions to cover the entire space [OKBG08].
Matusik’s data-driven method is described in Section 3.3.1. The main diﬀerence with the ac-
quisition setup proposed by Marschner et al. is the use of a turntable, with an arm attached to
it holding the light source: this allows removing the secondary camera, since the position of the
light source is known and accurately controllable (Figure 4.5). This measurement setup has been
used to capture a dataset of 100 isotropic materials, which is to date still widely used in computer
graphics and other ﬁelds; Figure 4.6 reports some renderings of the BRDFs included in the data
set.
Ngan et al. [NDM05] presented an anisotropic BRDF acquisition setup for ﬂat and ﬂex-
ible samples wrapped around a cylinder of known size; the cylinder can be tilted by means of a
precision motor in order to account for the missing degree of freedom with respect to a sphere.
To deal with the anisotropy, strips of the samples at diﬀerent orientations are wrapped around
the cylinder (see Figure 4.7). A light source rotates around the cylinder while the target is cap-
tured by a ﬁxed camera, and for each light and target position a set of eight pictures with diﬀerent
exposures is taken to form an HDR image, enabling the capture of the full 4D BRDF. The sam-
pling density of the light and the cylinder tilting can be adjusted to increase the resolution of

the measured BRDF. The number of material strips that can be wrapped around the cylinder is
clearly limited and represents the main limitation in the resolution. The reﬂectance acquisition
setup proposed by Naik et al. [NZV11] exploits space-time images captured by a time-of-ﬂight
camera. Two diﬀerent setups are described, both based on indirect viewing with three-bounce
scattering and making use of two known Lambertian materials, respectively the source S and
the receiver R, while P is the patch to measure. In the ﬁrst setup, the laser illuminates S, and
the camera views R, thus measuring P indirectly. As for the second conﬁguration, it is based on
an around-the-corner viewing in which P is not directly visible to the camera, whereas S and R
are the same surface. The light is multiplexed along diﬀerent transport paths and some of them
might have the same length, hence the light can arrive along multiple paths at the same point at
the same time. For this reason the measurements of the material need to be decoded by solving
a sparse under-determined system; the system is solved by recovering the parameters with the
Ashikhmin-Premoze model [AP07] (see Section 3.1.2), using the halfway vector parameteriza-
tion. When the multiplexing does not cause ambiguities, in order to measure the parameters of
a material, it is enough to analyze the streak images to ﬁnd the specular peak. This setup enables
to taking many BRDF measurements simultaneously, but it requires an ultra-fast camera; more-
over it suﬀers from a low signal-to-noise ratio due to the multiple bounces; the size of patches

and the maximum sharpness of the reﬂectance function are limited by the hardware, and the
range of measurable incoming and outgoing directions is limited by the geometry of the setup.
4.3
CATADIOPTRIC MEASUREMENT SETUPS
Catadioptric optical systems measure both reﬂected and refracted light, thus reducing aberra-
tions. Setups in this category usually do not make use of moving parts and tend to be eﬃcient
image-based BRDF acquisition devices.
The imaging gonioreﬂectometer described by Ward [War92] is based on a half-silvered
hemisphere and a ﬁsheye lens. It captures the entire hemisphere of reﬂected and refracted direc-
tions at the same time and allows measuring anisotropic surfaces by repeating the measurement
process under various orientations (Figure 4.8). This device cannot measure sharp specular peaks
or take measurements at high grazing angles.
The Dana et al. [DVGNK99] measurement device consists of a robotic arm that holds
and rotates a sample, a halogen bulb with a Fresnel lens, and a video camera. The light position
is kept ﬁxed, while the camera moves to record measurements from seven diﬀerent locations

(Figure 4.9). To enable measurements of anisotropic materials, the sample is rotated around the
z-axis and the procedure is repeated. This system was designed for use in computer graphics,
and like Ward, includes reﬂection and refraction capture; however, there are issues with noise
since the sample patches are too large to measure ﬁne-scale texture variations.
Mukaigawa et al. [MSY07] built a measurement system for anisotropic BRDFs that uses
a projector as the light source placed at the focal point of an ellipsoidal mirror, a camera, and a
beam splitter, since the camera and the projector cannot be located at the same position (Fig-
ure 4.10). The number of acquired images depends on the desired sampling of lighting and

data are then ﬁtted to the Ward anisotropic reﬂection model (Section 3.1.2).
Ghosh et al. [GAHO07, GHAO10] developed a measurement device that consists of a
camera focusing on a zone of reﬂected directions, a light source with a beam splitter, a mir-
rored dome, and mirrored parabola (Figure 4.11). The focus of the illumination beam is on the
mirrored components that the beam reﬂects back to its origin. This setup allows BRDF mea-
surement over a continuous region with a specially designed orthonormal zonal basis function
illumination, allowing a very rapid BRDF acquisition and a better signal-to-noise ratio com-
pared to point-sampling the incident directions, as in [MSY07]. Measured data is then projected
into a spherical harmonics basis or ﬁtted to an analytical reﬂection model.

where L is the surface luminance at .u; v/; the local coordinates of the texture and .lu; lv/ are
the projection of the normalized light vector at that coordinate. PTMs facilitate good quality
rendering, in particular for almost diﬀuse samples.
A hemispherical device for anisotropic BRDF measurement, which does not require any
moving parts or cameras, was presented by Ben-Ezra et al. [BEWW08]. This work demon-
strates that an accurate radiometric and geometric calibration allows using LEDs both as light
sources and as detectors (Figure 4.13) with fast acquisition times. In their implementation
84 LEDs are used, pointing toward the center of the hemisphere. During the acquisition each
LED is switched on, in turn acting as an emitter, while all others measure the light reﬂected
from the sample. The signal-to-noise ratio tends to be low, but it can be increased by means of

multiplexed illumination; the use of diﬀerent colors for the LEDs allows acquiring multispectral
data. Since an LED cannot be used at the same time as an emitter and detector, this setup can-
not be used to measure retro-reﬂection and oﬀers a lower resolution compared to camera-based
setups.
The measurement device presented by Rump et al. [RMS08] consists of a hemispherical
gantry with 151 cameras uniformly distributed; the cameras ﬂashes are used as light sources, and
for each ﬂash all the cameras take a picture of the subject, giving a total of 151  151 D 22,801
pictures, which can be increased by taking HDR sequences. The gantry is capable of supporting
projectors in order to use structured light on the subject.
Ghosh et al. [GCP09] proposed three diﬀerent setups to estimate spatially varying
BRDFs for both isotropic and anisotropic materials, using up to nine polarized second-order
spherical gradient illumination patterns. For specular reﬂections, specular albedo, reﬂection vec-
tor, and specular roughness can be directly estimated from the 0th, 1st [MHP07], and 2nd
order [GCP09] statistics respectively. The ﬁrst setup, suitable for roughly specular objects of
any shape, is based on an LED sphere with 150 controllable lights linearly polarized, with the
subject placed at the center of the sphere. The second setup is suitable for ﬂat objects and uses

smaller coverage of incident direction but with a higher resolution than the LED sphere. The
third setup makes use of a roughly specular hemisphere that reﬂects the light emitted by a pro-

camera observes the subject from the apex of the hemisphere.

The analysis of the Stokes reﬂectance ﬁeld of circularly polarized spherical illumination
has been exploited by Ghosh et al. [GCP10] to estimate the specular and diﬀuse albedo, index
of refraction, and specular roughness for isotropic SVBRDFs, assuming known surface orienta-
tion. Three diﬀerent setups are used to demonstrate the technique, similar to the ones described
in [GCP09] but with the light sources covered with right circular polarizers. Four pictures
of the subject are required to measure the Stokes ﬁeld, three of them with diﬀerently oriented
linear polarizers in front of the camera and one with a circular polarizer.
The same framework based on the analysis of the Stokes reﬂectance ﬁeld has been fur-
ther exploited by Guarnera et al. [GPDG12] and is extended to also cover unpolarized illu-
mination to obtain a per-pixel estimate of the surface normal from the same input data as
in [GCP10]. The proposed setup makes use of an LED sphere with 346 controllable lights
unpolarized/circularly polarized; the surface normals estimation is also demonstrated with un-
controlled outdoors measurement under overcast sky (hence unpolarized lighting) by capturing
a reference dielectric sphere in the same environment as the object, which can be of arbitrary
shape (see Figure 4.14 ).

Tunwattanapong et al. [TFG13] proposed a spinning spherical reﬂectance acquisition
apparatus. A spinning semi-circular arc of 1 m diameter, with 105 LED focused toward the
center, rotates about the vertical axis at 1 rpm, sweeping out continuous spherical harmonic il-
lumination conditions (Figure 4.15). Thanks to the spherical harmonic illumination, 44 pictures,
taken by a ﬁve-camera array, are enough to estimate anisotropic SVBRDFs and the 3D geometry
of very specular or diﬀuse objects. The technique can be considered as a further generalization of
the approach by Ghosh et al. [GCP09], since it makes use of higher-order spherical harmonic
illumination (up to 5th order), which allows obtaining diﬀuse/specular separation without rely-
ing on polarization.

is a 50 cm long neon tube, which is translated horizontally over the surface of the subject and
moved in sync with the camera acquisitions. The reﬂectance model used to ﬁt the measured data
is the isotropic model by Ward [War92], given the camera and light source positions at each
frame. The laser projects a laser stripe, which is deformed by surface variations and used in order
to recover the geometry, together with two scans of the light source, in a diagonal direction. A
cabin light box, with two diﬀused cathode tubes, is used as a sample holder and to project an
even diﬀuse white light on the surface and allows measurement of the transmitted and reﬂected
light. Overall, the system allows recovery of the diﬀuse and specular colors, specular roughness,
surface normals, and per-pixel translucency for isotropic samples.
In Ren et al. [RWS11] a handheld linear light source device, together with a BRDF
chart, is employed to obtain spatially varying isotropic BRDFs from a video taken with a mobile
phone in LDR. The BRDF chart consists of 24 square ﬂat tiles with known BRDFs. The tiles are
made of specular materials, except one that is a diﬀuse standard for camera calibration (exposure
and white balance). The light source is a 40 cm ﬂorescent tube, slowly moved by hand over the
surface and the chart, which needs to be placed alongside. This approach requires solving a
number of issues, since the camera and the light source need to be placed close to the sample
and the light is moved manually. Consequently, the camera and light position are unknown, as
well as the SVBRDF of the sample. Saturated values from LDR acquisition are repaired using

the values in the neighborhood, and the reﬂectance responses are normalized and hence aligned
by a dynamic time-warping algorithm. Aligned samples are then used for BRDF reconstruction.
Chen et al. [CDP14] present a similar setup to Gardner et al. [GTHD03], scanning a
linear light source over a ﬂat sample but with the signiﬁcant advantage of capturing anisotropic
surface reﬂectance. The basic assumption is that a microfacet model can be used to model the
anisotropic surface reﬂectance. To observe the specular reﬂection, they modulate the illumina-
tion along the light source by means of a transparent mask. They propose two diﬀerent setups
that diﬀer in form factor and employ the same 35 cm CCFL lamp and DSLR camera. The
desktop form factor scanner scans a linear light source over the sample, observing the SVBRDF
by means of the camera; as for the handheld form factor scanner, the sample moves with respect
to the camera and the linear light source, which instead has a ﬁxed relative position. Finally a
cylindrical lens is employed to capture in a single picture a scanline of the sample. One constant
lighting pattern, together with two phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns, suﬃces to reconstruct the
surface reﬂectance.

LCD LIGHT SOURCE
Francken et al. [FCM08] make use of commodity hardware such as an LCD display and an
SLR camera to recover detailed normal maps of specular objects, based on the observation that
the normal of a specular pixel is the halfway vector between the light direction and the view
direction. To identify the light direction among n diﬀerent light sources, they make use of gray
code lighting patterns by taking O.log2 n/ pictures. The accuracy of the estimated normal map
depends on the number of sampled light sources.
In Aittala et al. [AWL13] a low cost capture setup for SVBRDFs is presented with a
similar setup as Francken et al. Their work relies on the design of the image formation model
and uses a Fourier basis for the measurements. Isotropic BRDFs are reconstructed through
Bayesian inference since the model is analytically integrable.
The capture setup by Wang et al. [WSM11] consists of a vision camera and a regular LCD
used as an area light source. It allows rapid measurement of a stationary, isotropic, glossy and
bumpy surface, describing its appearance with a dual-level model, which consists of the specular
and diﬀuse relative albedos, two surface roughness parameters, and a 1D power spectrum over
frequencies for visible surface bumps. Two images are required for calibration, since the LCD
radiance is dependent on the viewing angle. The ﬁrst one captures the surface reﬂection while
displaying a constant gray image on the LCD, and the second one is taken by attaching a mirror
to the surface. To establish the pose of the surface with respect to the camera, a target is placed
on the surface. At the microscale, the reﬂectance is characterized with the Cook-Torrance model
and the distribution D is assumed to be Gaussian, where the standard deviation represents the
roughness; similarly at the mesoscale level, roughness is approximated in terms of the standard
deviation. The eﬀect of the roughness at the microscale is assumed to be a blurring of perfect
mirror reﬂections, whereas at the mesoscale it determines a permutation of the pixels. The surface

is illuminated with a half-black, half-white image with a vertical edge, and the overall roughness
is estimated by ﬁtting a Gaussian ﬁlter that blurs the step-edge image to produce the observed
one. To separate the roughness for the two diﬀerent scales, all pixels are sorted by intensity and
reshaped back in column-major order, thus removing the permutation induced by the mesoscale
roughness; the slope of the segment obtained by averaging over the rows of the sorted image is
used to estimate the microscale roughness. This approach can produce visually plausible results
for highly glossy manmade indoor surfaces, including some paints, metals, and plastics.
Riviere et al. [RPG15] propose a mobile reﬂectometry solution based on a mobile device’s
LCD panel as an extended illumination source, statically mounted at a distance of 45 cm above
an isotropic planar material sample, at normal incidence, in a dimly lit room. The linear polariza-
tion of the LCD panel is exploited for diﬀuse/specular separation by taking two pictures of the
sample with a diﬀerently orientated plastic sheet linear polarizer in front of the device camera.
Albedo, surface normals, and specular roughness are estimated by illuminating the sample with
the same lighting patterns described in [GCP09]. Due to the limited size of the LCD panel
and the position of the front camera, this setup can only acquire a 5 cm  5 cm area of the sam-
ple; for larger samples, an appearance transfer approach that relies on additional measurements
under natural illumination is used.

Backscattering data can be used to extract an appropriate distribution for microfacets BRDF
models [AP07]. Based on this observation, mobile devices equipped with a ﬂash light, typically
near the back camera, represent near-coaxial setups particularly useful to capture the backscatter
surface reﬂectance to be ﬁtted in a microfacets BRDF model [RPG15].
Riviere et al. [RPG15] mobile ﬂash-based acquisition setup estimates the diﬀuse and
specular albedo, surface normal, and specular roughness of a planar material sample, with spa-
tially varying isotropic surface reﬂectance. The back camera and ﬂash light of a mobile device
are used for a handheld acquisition of a video in a dimly lit room, capturing data of the sample
from several directions over the upper hemisphere (Figure 4.16). For reﬂectance calibration, the
diﬀuse gray squares of an X-Rite ColorChecker are used. The top view of the sample at normal
incidence is used as a reference to register the other frames. To estimate the lighting and view
directions, the magnetometer/accelerometer sensors or 3D tracking can be used. The surface
normal of each point is computed as the weighted average of the brightest reﬂection direction;
the diﬀuse albedo is estimated as the trimmed median of the measured intensities, whereas
the specular albedo is estimated from the hemispherical integral of the diﬀuse subtracted mea-
surements. The specular roughness is obtained by ﬁtting the observed backscattering proﬁle to
the [WMLT07] model (see Section 3.2.1). Some blurring in the reﬂectance maps can be intro-
duced by misalignments and motion blur. The limited number of lighting directions suggests
use only for rough specular materials.

Aittala et al. [AWL15] mobile measurement setup for stationary materials consists of a
single mobile device with onboard ﬂash light (Figure 4.17). Given a ﬂash-no-ﬂash image pair
of a textured material of known characteristic size, a multistage reconstruction pipeline allows
capturing the full anisotropic SVBRDF. The input images are registered through a homogra-
phy, computed from manually speciﬁed points of correspondence. The ﬂash image provides an
approximate retro-reﬂective measurement for each pixel that combines the eﬀect of surface nor-
mal and BRDF, whereas the other image is used as a guide to identify points on the surface with
similar local reﬂectance. Since there is only one observation per pixel, it is assumed that multiple
points on the surface share the same reﬂectance properties and can be identiﬁed under ambi-
ent lighting to be combined together. The input is organized into regular tiles approximately
the same size of the repeating texture pattern, assumed to contain a random rearrangement of
the same BRDF values. A mastertile is selected for relighting, and lumitexels (i.e., data struc-
tures to store the geometric and photometric data of one point [LKG03]) are obtained for it.
The lumitextels are regularized using a preliminary SVBRDF ﬁt and augmented by transfer-
ring high-frequency detail from similarly lit tiles to reduce blurring. The augmented lumitexels
are used in a non-linear optimizer to ﬁt an analytic SVBRDF model and the solution is ﬁnally
reverse-propagated to the full image. This setup limits the input to the retro-reﬂective slice of
the BRDF, hence the Fresnel eﬀect; shadowing and masking are assumed to have typical be-
havior and modeled with the BRDF model A [BLPW14] (see Section 3.1.2). The camera ﬁeld
of view represents an upper limit on the width of the specular lobes that can be observed.
The idea that the variation of the reﬂectance over a target forms a low-dimensional mani-
fold is exploited by Dong et al. [DWT10] and describes a two-pass method to accelerate com-
plex reﬂectance capture, useful for both isotropic and anisotropic ﬂat samples. During the ﬁrst

phase a set of high-resolution representative single-point BRDFs is captured using a handheld
device that scans over the sample. The device consists of a pair of condenser lenses, a pinhole,
and a camera, aligned along the same optical axis by means of a lens tube. Six high-brightness
LEDs are used as light sources, with one light at the top and the remaining at the sides. The
pinhole is placed at the focal plane of the ocular condenser lens so the camera can image the light
ﬁeld of a single point on the surface, while the sample is placed at the focal plane of the ﬁeld con-
denser lens. For each light, a pair of 320  240 pixel pictures is taken, with diﬀerent exposures
in order to obtain a 240  240 HDR image, used for local reconstruction of BRDFs by con-
vex linear combination in a small neighborhood. The second phase captures a set of reﬂectance
measurements densely over the surface by means of a ﬁxed DSLR camera and a handheld light
source, about 1:5 m away from the sample and moved in a 2D plane opposite the sample itself;
a mirrored ball is used to sample the incident lighting. Up to 200 pictures are acquired and used
to map the manifold derived from the ﬁrst phase over the sample surface.
The measurement device presented in [HP03] is based on the principle of the kaleido-
scope and consists of a tapered tube whose inner walls are lined with front-surface mirrors. A
single camera captures the kaleidoscopic image, in which the sub-images represent the same
sample seen simultaneously from many diﬀerent viewpoints. The sample is illuminated by a
DLP projector, which shares the optical path with the camera by means of a 45ı beam splitter.
The properties of the sample are measured through a sequence of pictures with diﬀerent illumi-
nation images, which illuminate the sample from a known range of incoming directions due to
the unique sequence of reﬂections from the kaleidoscopic walls. The advantages of this setting,
suitable for BTFs and BSSRDFs, are the absence of moving parts, which enables quick mea-
surements and guarantee perfect registration of the measurements and the low cost; radiometric
and geometric calibration need to be performed only once.

Conclusion

CONCLUSION
We described the class or reﬂectance models, with a particular focus on surface scattering models
(BRDF) their representations, and acquisition setups. Each model is limited by the underlying
assumptions and the set of parameters to implement it, which result in the ability of the model
to represent a speciﬁc material group. Even generalized models cannot cover a broad range of
materials or all the variations of a material within one group.
Currently material modeling often involves a great deal of manual eﬀort, although avail-
able solutions range from completely manual creation of a material to fully automated acquired
material, the latter rarely suitable for a straightforward application in rendering. The broad range
of material models and complexity of the parameters requires from an artist a deep understand-
ing of the underlying representation and material’s micro/macrostructure.
There is no straightforward pipeline to measure and represent BRDF data, and not all the
materials can be captured with existing reﬂectance measurement setups due to their peculiarities
(some smart materials for instance), hence it might happen that a material needs to be rendered
before a robust measurement and representation are available. These materials cannot inherit
from the base materials available in the rendering tool, and existing model assets cannot be
reused. This raises the issue that a large number of materials still needs to be captured and
represented for the computer graphics community.
Some setups require samples of a speciﬁc size and shape, with many of them limited to
planar, simple spherical, and cylindrical samples; unfortunately it is not always possible to build
such samples. Some layered materials, like varnished wood, metallic, or iridescent car paint pose
additional issues both on the acquisition and representation side, since their structure contributes
to obtaining complex reﬂectance properties. Although attempts to generalize reﬂectance models
have been made by researchers, there is still no up-to-date universal material representation
model that can fulﬁll such criteria and make it possible to standardize material representation.
The development of the appropriate resources continues, and a physically accurate, consistent,
and intuitive material representation would be beneﬁcial for computer graphics and related ﬁelds.
