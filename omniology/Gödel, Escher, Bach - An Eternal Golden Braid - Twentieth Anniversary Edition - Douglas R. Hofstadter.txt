Preface to GEB's 
Twentieth-anniversary Edition 
SO WHAT IS this book, GOdel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid -
usually 
known by its acronym, "GEB" -
really all about? 
That question has hounded me ever since I was scribbling its first drafts 
in pen, way back in 1973. Friends would inquire, of course, what I was so 
gripped by, but I was hard pressed to explain it concisely. A few years later, 
in 1980, when GEB found itself for a while on the bestseller list of The New 
York Times, the obligatory one-sentence summary printed underneath the 
tide said the following, for several weeks running: "A scientist argues that 
reality is a system of interconnected braids." Mter I protested vehemently 
about this utter hogwash, they finally substituted something a little better, 
just barely accurate enough to keep me from howling again. 
Many people think the title tells it all: a book about a mathematician, 
an artist, and a musician. But the most casual look will show that these three 
individuals per se, august though they undeniably are, play but tiny roles in 
the book's content. There's no way the book is about those three people! 
Well, then, how about describing GEB as "a book that shows how math, 
art, and music are really all the same thing at their core"? Again, this is a 
million miles off -
and yet I've heard it over and over again, not only from 
nonreaders but also from readers, even very ardent readers, of the book. 
And in bookstores, I have run across GEB gracing the shelves of many 
diverse sections, including not only math, general.science, philosophy, and 
cognitive science (which are all fine), but also religion, the occult, and God 
knows what else. Why is it so hard to figure out what this book is about? 
Certainly it's not just its length. No, it must be in part that GEB delves, and 
not just superficially, into so many motley topics -
fugues and canons, logic 
and truth, geometry, recursion, syntactic structures, the nature of meaning, 
Zen Buddhism, paradoxes, brain and mind, reductionism and holism, ant 
colonies, concepts and mental representations, translation, computers and 
their languages, DNA, proteins, the genetic code, artificial intelligence, 
creativity, consciousness and free will -
sometimes even art and music, of 
all things! -
that many people find it impossible to locate the core focus. 
The Key Images and Ideas that Lie at the Core of GEB 
Needless to say, this widespread confusion has been quite frustrating to me 
over the years, since I felt sure I had spelled out my aims over and over in 
the text itself. 
Clearly, however, I didn't do it sufficiently often, or 
sufficiently clearly. But since now I've got the chance to do it once more -
and in a prominent spot in the book, to boot -
let me try one last time to 
say why I wrote this book, what it is about, and what its principal thesis is. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-l 

In a word, GEB is a very personal attempt to say how it is that animate 
beings can come out of inanimate matter. What is a self, and how can a self 
come out of stuff that is as selfless as a stone or a puddle? What is an "I", 
and why are such things found (at least so far) only in association with, as 
poet Russell Edson once wonderfully phrased it, "teetering bulbs of dread 
and dream" -
that is, only in association with certain kinds of gooey lumps 
encased in hard protective shells mounted atop mobile pedestals that roam 
the world on pairs of slightly fuzzy,jointed stilts? 
GEB approaches these questions by slowly building up an analogy that 
likens inanimate molecules to meaningless symbols, and further likens selves 
(or 'T"s or "souls", if you prefer -
whatever it is that distinguishes animate 
from inanimate matter) to certain special swirly, twisty, vortex-like, and 
meaningful patterns that arise only in particular types of systems of 
meaningless symbols. It is these strange, twisty patterns that the book 
spends so much time on, because they are little known, little appreciated, 
counterintuitive, and quite filled with mystery. And for reasons that should 
not be too difficult to fathom, I call such strange, loopy patterns "strange 
loops" throughout the book, although in later chapters, I also use the 
phrase "tangled hierarchies" to describe basically the same idea. 
This is in many ways why M. C. Escher -
or more precisely, his art -
is 
prominent in the "golden braid", because Escher, in his own special way, was 
just as fascinated as I am by strange loops, and in fact he drew them in a 
variety of contexts, all wonderfully disorienting and fascinating. When I was 
first working on my book, however, Escher was totally out of the picture (or 
out of the loop, as we now say); my working title was the rather mundane 
phrase "G6del's Theorem and the Human Brain", and I gave no thought to 
inserting paradoxical pictures, let alone playful dialogues. It's just that time 
and again, while writing about my notion of strange loops, I would catch 
fleeting glimpses of this or that Escher print flashing almost subliminally 
before my mind's eye, and finally one day I realized that these images were 
so connected in my own mind with the ideas that I was writing about that for 
me to deprive my readers of the connection that I myself felt so strongly 
would be nothing less than perverse. And so Escher's art was welcomed on 
board. As for Bach, I'll come back to his entry into my "metaphorical fugue 
on minds and machines" a little later. 
Back to strange loops, right now. GEB was inspired by my long-held 
conviction that the "strange loop" notion holds the key to unraveling the 
mystery that we conscious beings call "being" or "consciousness". I was first 
hit by this idea when, as a teen-ager, I found myself obsessedly pondering 
the quintessential strange loop that lies at the core of the proof of Kurt 
G6del's famous incompleteness theorem in mathematical logic -
a rather 
arcane place, one might well think, to stumble across the secret behind the 
nature of selves and "I''' s, and yet I practically heard it screaming up at me 
from the pages of Nagel and Newman that this was what it was all about. 
This preface is not the time and place to go into details -
indeed, that's 
why the tome you're holding was written, so it would be a bit presumptuous 
of me to think I could outdo its author in just these few pages! -
but one 
P-2 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

thing has to be said straight off: the G6delian strange loop that arises in 
formal systems in mathematics (i.e., collections of rules for churning out an 
endless series of mathematical truths solely by mechanical symbol-shunting 
without any regard to meanings or ideas hidden in the shapes being 
manipulated) is a loop that allows such a system to "perceive itself", to talk 
about itself, to become "self-aware", and in a sense it would not be going too 
far to say that by virtue of having such a loop, a formal system acquires a self. 
Meaningless Symbols Acquire Meaning Despite Themselves 
What is so weird in this is that the formal systems where these skeletal 
"selves" come to exist are built out of nothing but meaningless symbols. The 
self, such as it is, arises solely because of a special type of swirly, tangled 
pattern among the meaningless symbols. But now a confession: I am being a 
bit coy when I repeatedly type the phrase "meaningless symbols" (as at the 
ends of both of the previous sentences), because a crucial part of my book's 
argument rests on the idea that meaning cannot be kept out of formal 
systems when sufficiently complex isomorphisms arise. Meaning comes in 
despite one's best efforts to keep symbols meaningless! 
Let me rephrase these last couple of sentences without using the slightly 
technical term "isomorphism". When a system of "meaningless" symbols has 
patterns in it that accurately track, or mirror, various phenomena in the 
world, then that tracking or mirroring imbues the symbols with some degree 
of meaning -
indeed, such tracking or mirroring is no less and no more 
than what meaning is. Depending on how complex and subtle and reliable 
the tracking is, different degrees of meaningfulness arise. I won't go further 
into this here, for it's a thesis that is taken up quite often in the text, most of 
all in Chapters 2, 4, 6, 9, and II. 
Compared to a typical formal system, human language is unbelievably 
fluid and subtle in its patterns of tracking reality, and for that reason the 
symbols in formal systems can seem quite arid; indeed, without too much 
trouble, one can look at them as totally devoid of meaning. But then again, 
one can look at a newspaper written in an unfamiliar writing system, and the 
strange shapes seem like nothing more than wondrously intricate but totally 
meaningless patterns. Thus even human language, rich though it is, can be 
drained of its seeming significance. 
As a matter of fact, there are still quite a few philosophers, scientists, 
and so forth who believe that patterns of symbols per se (such as books or 
movies or libraries or CD-ROM's or computer programs, no matter how 
complex or dynamic) never have meaning on their own, but that meaning 
instead, in some most mysterious manner, springs only from the organic 
chemistry, or perhaps the quantum mechanics, of processes that take place 
in carbon-based biological brains. Although I have no patience with this 
parochial, bio-chauvinistic view, I nonetheless have a pretty clear sense of its 
intuitive appeal. Trying to don the hat of a believer in the primacy, indeed 
the uniqueness, of brains, I can see where such people are coming from. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-3 

Such people feel that some kind of "semantic magic" takes place only 
inside our "teetering bulbs", somewhere behind pairs of eyeballs, even 
though they can never quite put their finger on how or why this is so; 
moreover, they believe that this semantic magic is what is responsible for the 
existence of human selves, souls, consciousness, "I"'s. And I, as a matter of 
fact, quite agree with such thinkers that selves and semantics -
in other 
words, that me's and meanings -
do spring from one and the same source; 
where 1 take issue with these people is over their contention that such 
phenomena are due entirely to some special, though as yet undiscovered, 
properties of the microscopic hardware of brains. 
As 1 see it, the only way of overcoming this magical view of what "I" and 
consciousness are is to keep on reminding oneself, unpleasant though it 
may seem, that the "teetering bulb of dread and dream" that nestles safely 
inside one's own cranium is a purely physical object made up of completely 
sterile and inanimate components, all of which obey exactly the same laws as 
those that govern all the rest of the universe, such as pieces of text, or CD-
ROM's, or computers. Only if one keeps on bashing up against this 
disturbing fact can one slowly begin to develop a feel for the way out of the 
mystery of consciousness: that the key is not the stuffout of which brains are 
made, but the patterns that can come 1.0 exist inside the stuff of a brain. 
This is a liberating shift, because it allows one to move to a different 
level of considering what brains are: as media that support complex patterns 
that mirror, albeit far from perfectly, the world, of which, needless to say, 
those brains are themselves denizens -
and it is in the inevitable self-
mirroring that arises, however impartial or imperfect it may be, that the 
strange loops of consciousness start to swirl. 
Kurt Godel Smashes through Bertrand Russell's Maginot Line 
I've just claimed that the shift of focus from material components to abstract 
patterns allows the quasi-magical leap from inanimate to animate, from 
nonsemantic to semantic, from meaningless to meaningful, to take place. 
But how does this happen? Mter all, not all jumps from matter to pattern 
give rise to consciousness or soul or self, quite obviously: in a word, not all 
patterns are conscious. What kind of pattern is it, then, that is the telltale 
mark of a self? GEB's answer is: a strange loop. 
The irony is that the first strange loop ever found -
and my model for 
the concept in general -
was found in a system tailor-made to keep loopiness 
out. 1 speak of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead's famous 
treatise Principia Mathematica, a gigantic, forbidding work laced with dense, 
prickly symbolism filling up volume after volume, whose creation in the 
years 1910-1913 was sparked primarily by its first author's desperate quest 
for a way to circumvent paradoxes of self-reference in mathematics. 
At the heart of Principia Mathematica lay Russell's so-called "theory of 
types", which, much like the roughly contemporaneous Maginot line, was 
designed to keep "the enemy" out in a most staunch and watertight manner. 
P-4 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

For the French, the enemy was Germany; for Russell, it was self-reference. 
Russell believed that for a mathematical system to be able to talk about itself 
in any way whatsoever was the kiss of death, for self-reference would -
so he 
thought -
necessarily open the door to self-contradiction, and thereby send 
all of mathematics crashing to the ground. In order to forestall this dire 
fate, he invented an elaborate (and infinite) hierarchy of levels, all sealed 
off from each other in such a manner as to definitively -
so he thought -
block the dreaded virus of self-reference from infecting the fragile system. 
It took a couple of decades, but eventually the young Austrian logician 
Kurt G6del realized that Russell and Whitehead's mathematical Maginot 
Line against self-reference could be most deftly circumvented (just as the 
Germans in World War II would soon wind up deftly sidestepping the real 
Maginot Line), and that self-reference not only had lurked from Day One in 
Principia Mathematica, but in fact plagued poor PM in a totally unremovable 
manner. Moreover, as G6del made brutally clear, this thorough riddling of 
the system by self-reference was not due to some weakness in PM, but quite 
to the contrary, it was due to its strength. Any similar system would have 
exactly the same "defect". The reason it had taken so long for the world to 
realize this astonishing fact is that it depended on making a leap somewhat 
analogous to that from a brain to a self, that famous leap from inanimate 
constituents to animate patterns. 
For G6del, it all came into focus in 1930 or so, thanks to a simple but 
wonderfully rich discovery that came to be known as "G6del numbering" -
a mapping whereby the long linear arrangements of strings of symbols in 
any formal system are mirrored precisely by mathematical relationships 
among certain (usually astronomically large) whole numbers. Using his 
mapping between elaborate patterns of meaningless symbols (to use that 
dubious term once again) and huge numbers, G6del showed how a 
statement about any mathematical formal system (such as the assertion that 
Principia Mathematica is contradiction-free) can be translated into a 
mathematical statement inside number theory (the study of whole numbers). 
In other words, any metamathematical statement can be imported into 
mathematics, and in its new guise the statement simply asserts (as do all 
statements of number theory) that certain whole numbers have certain 
properties or relationships to each other. But on another level, it also has a 
vastly different meaning that, on its surface, seems as far removed from a 
statement of number theory as would be a sentence in a Dostoevsky novel. 
By means of G6del's mapping, any formal system designed to spew forth 
truths about "mere" numbers would also wind up spewing forth truths -
inadvertently but inexorably -
about its own properties, and would thereby 
become "self-aware", in a manner of speaking. And of all the clandestine 
instances of self-referentiality plaguing PM and brought to light by G6del, 
the most concentrated doses lurked in those sentences that talked about 
their own G6del numbers, and in particular said some very odd things about 
themselves, such as "I am not provable inside PM". And let me repeat: such 
twisting-back, such looping-around, such self-enfolding, far from being an 
eliminable defect, was an inevitable by-product of the system's vast power. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-5 

Not too surprisingly, revolutionary mathematical and philosophical 
consequences tumbled out of Godel's sudden revelation that self-reference 
abounded in the bosom of the bastion so carefully designed by Russell to 
keep it out at all costs; the most famous such consequence was the so-called 
"essential incompleteness" of formalized mathematics. That notion will be 
carefully covered in the chapters to come, and yet, fascinating though it is, 
incompleteness is not in itself central to GEB's thesis. For GEB, the most 
crucial aspect of Godel's work is its demonstration that a statement's 
meaning can have deep consequencc~s, even in a supposedly meaningless 
universe. Thus it is the meaning of Giidel's sentence G (the one that asserts 
"G is not provable inside PM") that guarantees that G is not provable inside 
PM (which is precisely what G itself claims). It is as if the sentence's hidden 
Godelian meaning had some kind of power over the vacuous symbol-
shunting, meaning-impervious rules of the system, preventing them from 
ever putting together a demonstration of G, no matter what they do. 
Upside-down Causality and the Emergence of an "I" 
This kind of effect gives one a sense of crazily twisted, or upside-down, 
causality. Mter all, shouldn't meanings that one chooses to read into strings 
of meaningless symbols be totally without consequence? Even stranger is 
that the only reason sentence G is not provable inside PM is its self-referential 
meaning; indeed, it would seem that G, being a true statement about whole 
numbers, ought to be provable, but -
thanks to its extra level of meaning as 
a statement about itself, asserting its own non provability -
it is not. 
Something very strange thus emerges from the Godelian loop: the 
revelation of the causal power of meaning in a rule-bound but meaning-free 
universe. And this is where my analogy to brains and selves comes back in, 
suggesting that the twisted loop of seifhood trapped inside an inanimate bulb 
called a "brain" also has causal power -
or, put another way, that a mere 
pattern called "I" can shove around inanimate particles in the brain no less 
than inanimate particles in the brain can shove around patterns. In short, 
an "I" comes about -
in my view, at least -
via a kind of vortex whereby 
patterns in a brain mirror the brain's mirroring of the world, and eventually 
mirror themselves, whereupon the vortex of "I" becomes a real, causal 
entity. For an imperfect but vivid concrete analogue to this curious abstract 
phenomenon, think of what happens when a 1V camera is pointed at a 1V 
screen so as to display the screen on itself (and that screen on itself, etc.) -
what in GEB I called a "self-engulfing television", and in my later writings I 
sometimes call a "level-crossing feedback loop". 
When and only when such a loop arises in a brain or in any other 
substrate, is a person -
a unique new "I" -
brought into being. Moreover, 
the more self-referentially rich such a loop is, the more conscious is the self 
to which it gives rise. Yes, shocking though this might sound, consciousness 
is not an on/off phenomenon, but admits of degrees, grades, shades. Or, to 
put it more bluntly, there are bigger souls and smaller souls. 
P-6 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

Small-souled Men, Beware! 
I can't help but recall, at this point, a horribly elitist but very droll remark by 
one of my favorite writers, the American "critic of the seven arts", James 
Huneker, in his scintillating biography of Frederic Chopin, on the subject of 
Chopin's etude Op. 25, No. 11 in A minor, which for me, and for Huneker, 
is one of the most stirring and most sublime pieces of music ever written: 
"Small-souled men, no matter how agile their fingers, should avoid it." 
"Small-souled men"?! Whew! Does that phrase ever run against the 
grain of American democracy! And yet, leaving aside its offensive, archaic 
sexism (a crime I, too, commit in GEB, to my great regret), I would suggest 
that it is only because we all tacitly do believe in something like Huneker's 
shocking distinction that most of us are willing to eat animals of one sort or 
another, to smash flies, swat mosquitos, fight bacteria with antibiotics, and 
so forth. We generally concur that "men" such as a cow, a turkey, a frog, 
and a fish all possess some spark of consciousness, some kind of primitive 
"soul", but by God, it's a good deal smaller than ours is -
and that, no more 
and no less, is why we "men" feel that we have the perfect right to extinguish 
the dim lights in the heads of these fractionally-souled beasts and to gobble 
down their once warm and wiggling, now chilled and stilled protoplasm with 
limitless gusto, and not to feel a trace of guilt while doing so. 
Enough sermonizing! The real point here is that not all strange loops 
give rise to souls as grand and glorious as yours and mine, dear reader. 
Thus, for example, I would not want you or anyone else to walk away from 
reading all or part of GEB, shake their head and say with sadness, 'That 
weird Hofstadter guy has convinced himself that Russell and Whitehead's 
Principia Mathematica is a conscious person with a soul!" Horsefeathers! 
Balderdash! Poppycock! G6del's strange loop, though it is my paragon for 
the concept, is nonetheless only the most bare-bones strange loop, and it 
resides in a system whose complexity is pathetic, relative to that of an 
organic brain. Moreover, a formal system is static; it doesn't change or grow 
over time. A formal system does not live in a society of other formal systems, 
mirroring them inside itself, and being mirrored in turn inside its "friends". 
Well, I retract that last remark, at least a bit: any formal system as powerful 
as PM does in fact contain models not just of itself but of an infinite number 
of other formal systems, some like it, some very much unlike it. That is 
essentially what G6del realized. But still, there is no counterpart to time, no 
counterpart to development, let alone to birth and death. 
And so whatever I say about "selves" coming to exist in mathematical 
formal systems has to be taken with the proper grain of salt. Strange loops 
are an abstract structure that crops up in various media and in varying 
degrees of richness. GEB is in essence a long proposal of strange loops as a 
metaphor for how selfhood originates, a metaphor by which to begin to 
grab a hold of just what it is that makes an "I" seem, at one and the same 
time, so terribly real and tangible to its own possessor, and yet also so vague, 
so impenetrable, so deeply elusive. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-7 

I personally cannot imagine that consciousness will be fully understood 
without reference to Godelian strange loops or level-crossing feedback 
loops. For that reason, I must say, I have been surprised and puzzled that 
the past few years' flurry of books trying to unravel the mysteries of 
consciousness almost never mention anything along these lines. Many of 
these books' authors have even read and savored GEB, yet nowhere is its 
core thesis echoed. It sometimes feels as if I had shouted a deeply cherished 
message out into an empty chasm and nobody heard me. 
The Earliest Seeds of GEB 
Why, one might wonder, if the author's aim was merely to propose a theory 
of strange loops as the crux of our consciousness and the source of our 
irrepressible "I "-feeling, did he wind up writing such a vast book with so 
many seeming digressions in it? Why on earth did he drag in fugues and 
canons? Why recursion? And Zen? And molecular biology? Et cetera ... 
The truth of the matter is, when I started out, I didn't have the foggiest 
idea that I would wind up talking about these kinds of things. Nor did I 
dream that my future book would include dialogues, let alone dialogues 
based on musical forms. The complex and ambitious nature of my project 
evolved only gradually. In broad strokes, it came about this way. 
I earlier alluded to my reading, as a teen-ager, of Ernest Nagel and 
James R. Newman's little book COde/'s Proof Well, that book just radiated 
excitement and depth to me, and it propelled me like an arrow straight into 
the study of symbolic logic. Thus, as an undergraduate math major at 
Stanford and a few years later, in my short-lived career as a graduate student 
in math at Berkeley, I took several advanced logic courses, but to my bitter 
disappointment, all of them were arcane, technical, and utterly devoid of 
the magic I'd known in Nagel and Newman. The upshot of my taking these 
highbrow courses was that my keen teen interest in Godel's wondrous proof 
and its "strange loopiness" was nearly killed off. Indeed, I was left with such 
a feeling of sterility that in late 1967, almost in desperation, I dropped out 
of math grad school in Berkeley and took up a new identity as physics grad 
student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where my once-ardent 
fascination with logic and metamathematics went into deep dormancy. 
Several years passed, and then one day in May of 1972, while browsing 
the math shelves in the University of Oregon bookstore, I stumbled across 
philosopher Howard DeLong's superb book A Profile of Mathematical Logic, 
took a chance on buying it, and within weeks, myoid love for the great 
Godelian mysteries and all they touch on was reawakened. Ideas started 
churning around like mad inside my teetering bulb of dread and dream. 
Despite this joy, I was very discouraged with the way my physics studies 
and my life in general were going, so in July I packed all my belongings into 
a dozen or so cardboard boxes and set out on an eastward trek across the 
vast American continent in Quicksilver, my faithful 1956 Mercury. Where I 
was headed, I wasn't sure. All I knew is that I was looking for a new life. 
P-8 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

Mter crossing the beautiful Cascades and eastern Oregon's desert, I 
wound up in Moscow, Idaho. Since Quicksilver had a little engine trouble 
and needed some repair, I took advantage of the spare time and went to the 
University of Idaho's library to look up some of the articles about Godel's 
proof in DeLong's annotated bibliography. I photocopied several of them, 
and in a day or so headed off toward Montana and Alberta. Each night I 
would stop and pitch my little tent, sometimes in a forest, sometimes by a 
lake, and then I would eagerly plunge by flashlight into these articles until I 
fell asleep in my sleeping bag. I was starting to understand many G6delian 
matters ever more clearly, and what I was learning was truly enthralling. 
From Letter to Pamphlet to Seminar 
Mter a few days in the Canadian Rockies, I headed south again and 
eventually reached Boulder, Colorado. There, one afternoon, a host of 
fresh ideas started gushing out in a spontaneous letter to myoId friend 
Robert Boeninger. Mter several hours of writing, I saw that although my 
letter was longer than I'd expected -
thirty handwritten pages or so -
I'd 
said only about half of what I'd wanted to say. This made me think that 
maybe I should write a pamphlet, not a letter, and to this day, Robert has 
never received my unfinished missive. 
From Boulder I headed further east, bouncing from one university town 
to another, and eventually, almost as if it had been beckoning me the whole 
time, New York City loomed as my ultimate goal. Indeed, I wound up 
spending several months in Manhattan, taking graduate courses at City 
College and teaching elementary physics to nurses at Hunter College, but as 
1973 rolled around, I faced the fact that despite loving New York in many 
ways, I was even more agitated than I had been in Eugene, and I decided it 
would be wiser to return to Oregon and to finish graduate school there. 
Although my hoped-for "new life" had failed to materialize, in certain 
respe~ts I was relieved to be back. For one thing, the U of 0 in those days 
had the enlightened policy that any community member could invent and 
teach a for-credit "SEARCH" course, as long as one or more departments 
approved it. And so I petitioned the philosophy and math departments to 
sponsor a spring-quarter SEARCH course centered on Godel's theorem, and 
my request was granted. Things were looking up. 
My intuition told me that my personal fascination with strange loops -
not only with their philosophical importance but also with their esthetic 
charm -
was not just some unique little neurotic obsession of mine, but 
could well be infectious, if only I could get across to my students that these 
notions were anything but dull and dry, as in those frigid, sterile logic 
courses I'd taken, but rather -
as Nagel and Newman had hinted -
were 
intimately related to a slew of profound and beautiful ideas in mathematics, 
physics, computer science, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and so on. 
I gave my course the half-dippy, half-romantic title 'The Mystery of the 
Undecidable" in the hopes that I might attract students from wildly diverse 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface

areas, and the trick worked. Twenty-five souls were snagged, and all were 
enthusiastic. I vividly remember the lovely blossoms I could see out the 
window each day as I lectured that spring, but even more vividly I remember 
David Justman, who was in art history, Scott Buresh, who was in political 
science, and Avril Greenberg, who was an art major. These three simply 
devoured the ideas, and we talked and talked endlessly about them. My 
course thus turned out very well, both for the snaggees and for the snagger. 
Sometime during the summer of 1973, I made a stab at sketching out a 
table of contents for my "pamphlet", and at that point, the ambitiousness of 
my project started dawning on me, but it still felt more like a pamphlet than 
a tome to me. It was only in the fall that I started writing in earnest. I had 
never written anything more than a few pages long, but I fearlessly plunged 
ahead, figuring it would take me just a few days -
maybe a week or two. I 
was slightly off, for in fact, the very first draft (done in pen, just like my letter 
to Robert, but with more cross-outs) took me about a month -
a month 
that overlapped in time with the "Yom Kippur war", which made a very deep 
impression on me. I realized this first draft was not the final product, but I 
felt I had done the major work and now it was just a question of revision. 
Experiments with Literary Form Start to Take Place 
As I was writing that draft, I certainly wasn't thinking about Escher pictures. 
Nor was I thinking about Bach's music. But one day I found myself on fire 
with ideas about mind, brain, and human identity, and so, shamelessly 
borrowing Lewis Carroll's odd couple of Achilles and the Tortoise, whose 
droll personalities amused me no end, I sat down and in absolute white heat 
dashed off a long, complex dialogue, all about a fictitious, unimaginably 
large book each of whose pages, on a one-by-one basis, contained exhaustive 
information on one specific neuron in Einstein's brain. As it happened, the 
dialogue featured a short section where the two characters imagined each 
other in another dialogue, and each of them said, "You might then say 
this ... to which I might well reply as follows ... and then you would go on ... " 
and so forth. Because of this unusual structural feature, after I'd finally put 
the final period on the final speech, I flipped back to the top of page one 
and there, on a whim, typed out the single word "FUGUE". 
My Einstein-book dialogue was not r~ally a fugue, of course -
not even 
close -
and yet it somehow reminded me'of one. From earliest childhood, 
I had been profoundly moved by the music ~f Bach, and this off-the-wall 
idea of marrying Bach-like contrapuntal for~ to lively dialogues with 
intellectually rich content grabbed me with a pa~n. Over the next few 
weeks, as I tossed the idea around in my head, I realized how much room 
for play there was along these lines, and I could imagine how voraciously I as 
a teen-ager might have consumed such dialogues. Thus I was led to the idea 
of inserting contrapuntal dialogues every so often, partly to break the 
tedium of the heavy ideas in my chapters, and partly to allow me to 
introduce lighter, more allegorical versions of all the abstruse concepts. 
P-IO 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

The long and the short of it is that I eventually decided -
but this took 
many months -
that the optimal structure would be a strict alternation 
between chapters and dialogues. Once that was clear, then I had the joyous 
task of trying to pinpoint the most crucial ideas that I wanted to get across to 
my readers and then somehow embodying them in both the form and the 
content of fanciful, often punning dialogues between Achilles and the 
Tortoise (plus a few new friends). 
CEB Is First Cooled off, Then Reheated 
In early 1974, I switched Ph.D. advisors for the fourth and final time, taking 
on a totally unfamiliar problem in solid-state physics that smelled very sweet 
though it threatened thorniness. My new advisor, Gregory Wannier, wanted 
me to plunge in deeply, and I knew in my gut that this time it was sink or 
swim for me in the world of physics. If I wanted a Ph.D. -
a precious but 
horribly elusive goal toward which I had been struggling for almost a decade 
by then -
it was now or never! And so, with great reluctance, I stowed my 
beloved manuscript in a desk drawer and told myself, "Hands off! And no 
peeking!" I even instituted food-deprivation punishments if I so much as 
opened the drawer and riffled through my book-in-the-making. Thinking 
GEB thoughts -
or rather, GTATHB thoughts -
was strictly verboten. 
Speaking of German, Wannier was scheduled to go to Germany for a 
six-month period in the fall of 1974, and since I had always loved Europe, I 
asked if there was any way I could go along. Very kindly, he arranged for me 
to be a wissenschaftlicher Assistent -
essentially a teaching assistant -
in 
physics at the Universitiit Regensburg, and so that's what I did for one 
semester spanning the end of 1974 and the start of 1975. It was then that I 
got most of the work done for my Ph.D. thesis. Since I had no close friends, 
my Regensburg days and nights were long and lonely. In a peculiar sense, 
my closest friend during that tough period was Frederic Chopin, since I 
tuned in to Radio Warsaw nearly every night at midnight and listened to 
various pianists playing many of his pieces that I knew and loved, and others 
that were new to me and that I came to love. 
That whole stretch was GEE-verboten time, and thus it continued until the 
end of 1975, when finally I closed the book on my thesis. Although that 
work was all about an exquisite visual structure (see Chapter 5 of this book) 
and seemed to offer a good launchpad for a career, I had suffered too many 
blows to my ego in graduate school to believe I would make a good physicist. 
On the other hand, the rekindling of old intellectual flames and especially 
the writing of GTATHB had breathed a new kind of self-confidence into me. 
Jobless but highly motivated, I moved to my home town of Stanford, and 
there, thanks to my parents' unquestioning and generous financial support 
("a two-year Hofstadter Fellowship", I jokingly called it), I set out to "retool 
myself" as an artificial-intelligence researcher. 
Even more important, 
though, was that I was able to resume my passionate love affair with the 
ideas that had so grabbed me a couple of years earlier. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-l1 

At Stanford, my erstwhile "pamphlet" bloomed. It was rewritten from 
start to finish, because I felt that my earlier drafts, though focused on the 
proper ideas, were immature and inconsistent in style. And I enjoyed the 
luxury of one of the world's earliest and best word-processing programs, my 
new friend Pentti KanelVa's tremendously flexible and user-friendly 1V-Edit. 
Thanks to that program, the new version just flowed out, and ever so 
smoothly. I just can't imagine how GEB could have been written without it. 
Only at this stage did the book's unusual stylistic hallmarks really 
emerge -
the sometimes-silly playing with words, the concocting of novel 
verbal structures that imitate musical forms, the wallowing in analogies of 
every sort, the spinning of stories whose very structures exemplify the points 
they are talking about, the mixing of oddball personalities in fantastic 
scenarios. As I was writing, I certainly knew that my book would be quite 
different from other books on related topics, and that I was violating quite a 
number of conventions. Nonetheless I blithely continued, because I felt 
confident that what I was doing simply had to be done, and that it had an 
intrinsic rightness to it. One of the key qualities that made me so believe in 
what I was doing is that this was a book in which form was being given equal 
billing with content -
and that was no accident, since GEB is in large part 
about how content is inseparable from form, how semantics is of a piece 
with syntax, how inextricable pattern and matter are from each other. 
Although I had always known of myself that, in many aspects of life, I 
was concerned as much with form as with content, I had never suspected 
how deeply I would get caught up, in the writing of my first book, in matters 
of visual appearance on all levels. Thus, thanks to the ease of using 1V-Edit, 
whatever I wrote underwent polishing to make it look better on the screen, 
and though such control would at one time have been considered a luxury 
for an author, I was very attached to it and loath to give it up. By the time I 
had a solid version of the manuscript ready to send out to publishers, visual 
design and conceptual structure were intimately bound up with each other. 
The Clarion Call 
I've oft been asked if I, an unknown author with an unorthodox manuscript 
and an off-the-wall title, had to struggle for years against the monolithic 
publishing industry's fear of taking risks. Well, perhaps I was just lucky, but 
my experience was far more pleasant than that. 
In mid-1977, I sent out a little sample to about fifteen high-quality 
publishers, just as a feeler, to which most replied politely that this was "not 
the type of thing" they dealt in. Fair enough. But three or four expressed 
interest in seeing more, and so, by turns, I let them take a look at the whole 
thing. Needless to say, I was disappointed when the first two turned it down 
(and in each case the vetting process took a few months, so the loss of time 
was frustrating), but on the other hand, I wasn't overly disheartened. Then 
near Christmastime, Martin Kessler, head of Basic Books, a publishing outfit 
I had always admired, gave me some hopeful though tentative signals. 
P-12 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

The winter of 1977-78 was so severe that Indiana University, where I was 
now a fledgling assistant professor, ran out of coal for heating, and in March 
the university was forced to close down for three weeks to wait for warmer 
weather. I decided to use this free time to drive to New York and points 
south to see old friends. Clear as a bell in my oft-blurry memory is my brief 
stop in some dingy little diner in the town of Clarion, Pennsylvania, where 
from a chilly phone booth I made a quick call to Martin Kessler in New York 
to see if he had a verdict yet. It was a great moment in my life when he said 
he would be "delighted" to work with me -
and it's almost eerie to think 
that this signal event occurred in that well-named hamlet, of all places ... 
Revenge of the Holey Rollers 
Now that I had found a publisher, there came the question of turning the 
manuscript from crude computer printout to a finely typeset book. It was a 
piece of true luck that Pentti, to enhance 1V-Edit, had just developed one of 
the world's first computer typesetting systems, and he strongly encouraged 
me to use it. Kessler, ever the adventurer, was also willing to give it a try-
partly, of course, because it would save Basic Books some money, but also 
because he was by nature a shrewd risk-taker. 
Do-it-yourself typesetting, though for me a great break, was hardly a 
piece of cake. Computing then was a lot more primitive than it is today, and 
to use Pentti's system, I had to insert into each chapter or dialogue literally 
thousands of cryptic typesetting commands, next chop each computer file 
into several small pieces -
five or six per file, usually -
each of which had 
to be run through a series of two computer programs, and then each of the 
resulting output files had to be punched out physically as a cryptic pattern 
of myriad holes on a long, thin roll of paper tape. I myself had to walk the 
200 yards to the building where the hole-puncher was located, load the 
paper tape, and sit there monitoring it carefully to make sure it didn't jam. 
Next, I would carry this batch of oily tapes another quarter-mile to the 
building where The Stanford Daily was printed, and if it was free, I would use 
their phototypesetting machine myself. Doing so was a long, elaborate 
operation involving cartridges of photosensitive paper, darkrooms, chemical 
baths with rollers through which the paper had to be passed to get all the 
developing chemicals off, and clotheslines on which all the five-foot long 
galleys with my text on them would be hung out to dry for a day or two. The 
process of actually seeing what my thousands of typesetting commands had 
wrought was thus enormously unwieldy and slow. Truth to tell, though, I 
didn't mind that; in fact, it was arcane, special, and kind of exciting. 
But one day, when nearly all the galleys had been printed -
two to 
three hundred of them -
and I thought I was home free, I made a 
horrendous discovery. I'd seen each one emerge with jet-black print from 
the developing baths, and yet on some of the more recently-<iried ones, the 
text looked brownish. What!? As I checked out others, slightly older, I saw 
light-brown print, and on yet older ones, it was orangy, or even pale yellow! 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-13 

I couldn't believe it. How in the world had this happened? The simple 
answer left me feeling so angry and helpless: the aging rollers, having worn 
unevenly, no longer wiped the galleys clean, so acid was day by day eating 
the black print away. For the Daily's purposes, this didn't matter -
they 
chucked their galleys in a matter of hours -
but for a book, it spelled 
disaster. No way could a book be printed from yellow galleys! And the 
photocopies r d made of them when they were newborn were sharp, but not 
sharp enough. What a nightmare! Untold labor had just gone up in smoke. 
I was filled with the despair of a football team that's just made a 99-yard 
downfield march only to be stopped dead on the opponent's one-yard line. 
r d spent almost all summer 1978 producing these galleys, but now 
summer was drawing to a close, and I had to go back to Indiana to teach 
courses. What on earth to do? How could I salvage GEB? The only solution 
I could see was, on my own money, to fly back to Stanford every weekend of 
the fall, and redo the whole thing from scratch. Luckily, I was teaching only 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and so each Thursday afternoon I would zoom 
from class, catch a plane, arrive at Stanford, work like a maniac until 
Monday afternoon, and then dash off to the airport to return to Indiana. I 
will never forget the worst of those weekends, when I somehow managed to 
work for forty hours straight without a wink of sleep. That's love for you! 
In this ordeal there was a saving grace, though, and it was this: I got to 
correct all the typesetting errors I'd made in the first batch of galleys. The 
original plan had been to use a bunch of correction galleys, which would 
have had to be sliced up into little pieces in Basic's New York offices and 
pasted in wherever there were glitches -
and in that first batch I'd made 
glitches galore, that's for sure. Such a process would probably have resulted 
in hundreds of errors in the layout. But thanks to my 99-yard drive having 
been halted at the one-yard line, I now had the chance to undo all these 
glitches, and produce a nearly pristine set of galleys. And thus, although the 
chemical catastrophe delayed the actual printing of GEB for a couple of 
months, it turned out, in retrospect, to have been a blessing in disguise. 
Oops ... 
There were of course many ideas that vied with each other for entry into the 
book taking shape during those years, and some made it in while others did 
not. One of the ironies is that the Einstein-book dialogue, which in its 
"fugality" was the inspiration for all dialogues to come, was chopped. 
There was another long and intricate dialogue, too, that was chopped, 
or more accurately, that wound up getting transmogrified nearly beyond 
recognition, and its curious story is connected with an intense debate that 
was raging inside my brain at that time. 
I had been made acutely aware, by some leaflets I'd read in the student 
union at Oregon in 1970, of sexist language and its insidious unconscious 
effects. My mind was awakened to the subtle ways that generic "he" and 
"man" (and a host of similar words and phrases) contribute to the shaping 
P-14 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

of one's sense of what is a "normal" human being and what is an 
"exception", and I welcomed this new perspective. But I was not a writer at 
that time -
I was a physics grad student -
and these issues didn't seem all 
that close to my own life. When I started writing dialogues, though, things 
changed. There came a point when it dawned on me that the characters in 
my dialogues -
Achilles, the Tortoise, the Crab, the Anteater, and a couple 
of others with cameo roles -
were without exception males. I was shocked 
at my own having fallen victim to the unconscious pressures pushing against 
the introduction of female characters. And yet, when I toyed with the idea 
of going back and performing a "sex-change operation" on one or more of 
these characters, that really rubbed me the wrong way. How come? 
Well, all I could tell myself was, "Bring in females and you wind up 
importing the whole confusing world of sexuality into what is essentially a 
purely abstract discussion, and that would distract attention from my book's 
main purposes." This nonsensical view of mine stemmed from and echoed 
many tacit assumptions of western civilization at that time (and still today). 
As I forced myself to grapple with my own ugly attitude, a real battle started 
up in my mind, with one side of me arguing for going back and making 
some characters female, and the other trying to maintain the status quo. 
Out of this internal battle suddenly came a long and rather amusing 
dialogue in which my various characters, having come to the realization that 
they are all males, discuss why this might be so, and decide that, despite 
their sense of having free will, they must in fact be merely characters in the 
mind of some sexist male author. One way or another, they manage to 
summon this Author character into their dialogue -
and what does he do 
when accused of sexism? He pleads innocent, claiming that what his brain 
does is out of his control- the blame for his sexism must instead fallon a 
sexist God. And the next thing you know, God poofs into the dialogue -
and guess what? She turns out to be female (ho ho ho). I don't remember 
the details of how it went on from there, but the point is, I was deeply tom, 
and I was grappling in my own way with these complex issues. 
To my regret -
that is to say, to the regret of the me of the years that 
followed -
the side that wound up winning this battle was the sexist side, 
with just a few concessions to the other side (e.g., the tower of Djinns in the 
dialogue "Little Harmonic Labyrinth", and Aunt Hillary in "Prelude ... Ant 
Fugue"). GEB remained a book with a deep sexist bias sewn into its fabric. 
Interestingly, it is a bias that very few readers, females or males, have 
commented on (which in tum supports my belief that these kinds of things 
are very subtle and insidious, and escape nearly everyone's perception). 
As for generic "man" and "he", I certainly disliked those usages at that 
time, and I tried to avoid them whenever I could (or rather, whenever it was 
easy), but on the other hand I wasn't particularly concerned about cleansing 
my prose of every last one of them, and as a consequence the book's pages 
are also marred, here and there, by that more obvious, more explicit form 
of sexism. Today, I cringe whenever I come across sentences in GEB that 
talk about the reader as "he", or that casually speak of "mankind" as if 
humanity were some huge abstract guy. One lives and learns, I guess. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-15 

And lastly, as for that soul-searching dialogue in which the Author and 
God are summoned up by Achilles and company to face the accusation of 
sexism, well, that was somehow transformed, in a series of many, many small 
changes, into the dialogue with which GEE concludes: "Six-part Ricercar". 
If you read it with its genesis in mind, you may find an extra level of interest. 
Mr. Tortoise, Meet Madame Tortue 
A few years later, a wholly unexpected chance came along to make amends, 
at least in part, for my sexist sin. That opportunity was afforded me by the 
challenge of translating GEB into various foreign languages. 
When I was writing the book, the idea that it might someday appear in 
other languages never crossed my mind. I don't know why, since I loved 
languages and loved translation, but somehow it just never occurred to me. 
However, as soon as the idea was proposed to me by my publisher, I was very 
excited about seeing my book in other languages, especially ones that I 
spoke to some extent -
most of all French, since that was a language that I 
spoke fluently and loved very deeply. 
There were a million issues to consider in any potential translation, 
since the book is rife not only with explicit wordplay but also with what Scott 
Kim dubbed "structural puns" -
passages where form and content echo or 
reinforce each other in some unexpected manner, and very often thanks to 
happy coincidences involving specific English words. Because of these 
intricate medium-message tangles, I painstakingly went through every last 
sentence of GEB, annotating a copy for translators into any language that 
might be targeted. This took me about a year of on-again, off-again toil, but 
finally it was done, and just in the nick of time, because contracts with 
foreign publishers started flowing thick and fast around 1982. I could write 
a short book -
a pamphlet? -
on the crazy, delightful, knotty puzzles and 
dilemmas that arose in translating GEE, but here I will mention just one-
how to render the simple-seeming phrase "Mr. Tortoise" in French. 
When in the spring of 1983, Jacqueline Henry and Bob French, the 
book's excellent translators into French, began to tackle the dialogues, they 
instantly ran headlong into the conflict between the feminine gender of the 
French noun tortue and the masculinity of my character, the Tortoise. By 
the way, I must ruefully mention that in the malVelous but little-known 
Lewis Carroll dialogue from which I borrowed these delightful characters 
(reprinted in GEB as 'Two-part Invention"), the Tortoise turns out, if you 
look carefully, never to have been attributed either gender. But when I first 
read it, the question never entered my mind. This was clearly a he-tortoise. 
Otherwise, I would have known not only that it was female but also why it was 
female. Mter all, an author only introduces a female character for some 
special reason, right? Whereas a male character in a "neutral" context (e.g., 
philosophy) needs no raison d'etre, a female does. And so, given no clue as 
to the Tortoise's sex, I unthinkingly and uncritically envisaged it as a male. 
Thus does sexism silently pervade well-meaning but susceptible brains. 
P-16 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

But let's not forget Jacqueline and Bob! Although they could simply 
have bludgeoned their way through the problem by inventing a "Monsieur 
Tortue" character, that route felt distinctly unnatural in French, to their 
taste, and so, in one of our many exchanges of letters, they rather gingerly 
asked me if I would ever consider letting them switch the Tortoise's sex to 
female. To them, of course, it probably seemed pretty far-fetched to 
imagine that the author would even give such a proposal the time of day, 
but as a matter of fact, the moment I read their idea, I seized upon it with 
great enthusiasm. And as a result, the French GEB's pages are graced 
throughout with the fresh, fantastic figure of Madame Tortue, who runs 
perverse intellectual circles around her male companion Achilles, erstwhile 
Greek warrior and amateur philosopher. 
There was something so delightful and gratifying to me about this new 
vision of "the Tortoise" that I was ecstatic with her. What particularly 
amused me were a few bilingual conversations that I had about the Tortoise, 
in which I would start out in English using the pronoun "he", then switch to 
French and to elle as well. Either pronoun felt perfectly natural, and I even 
felt I was referring to the selfsame "person" in both languages. In its own 
funny way, this seemed faithful to Carroll's tortoise's sexual neutrality. 
And then, redoubling my pleasure, the translators into Italian, another 
language that I adored and spoke quite well, chose to follow suit and to 
convert my "Mr. Tortoise" into "signorina Tartaruga". Of course these 
radical switches in no way affect the perceptions of GEB's purely anglophone 
readers, but in some small way, I feel, they help to make up for the 
lamentable outcome of my internal battle of a few years earlier. 
Zen Buddhism, John Cage, and My VogUish Irrationality 
The French translation was greeted, overall, very favorably. One specially 
gratifying moment for Bob, Jacqueline, and myself was when a truly glowing 
full-page review by Jacques Attali appeared in the most prestigious French 
newspaper, Le Monde, not just praising the book for its ideas and style, but 
also making a particular point of praising its translation. 
A few months later, I received a pair of reviews published in successive 
issues of Humanisme, an obscure journal put out by the Society of French 
Freemasons. Both had issued from the pen of one author, Alain Houlou, 
and I tackled them with interest. The first one was quite lengthy and, like 
that in Le Monde, glowed with praise; I was gratified and grateful. 
I then went on to the second review, which started out with the poetic 
phrase Apres les roses, les epines ... ("Mter roses, thorns ... "), and which then 
proceeded for several pages, to my amazement, to rip GEB apart as un pwge 
tres grave ("a very dangerous trap") in which the mindless bandwagon of Zen 
Buddhism was eagerly jumped on, and in which a rabidly antiscientific, 
beatnik-influenced, hippie-like irrationality typical of American physicists 
was embraced as the supreme path to enlightenment, with the iconoclastic 
Zen-influenced American composer John Cage as the patron saint of it all. 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-17 

All I could do was chuckle, and throw my hands up in bewilderment at 
these Tati-esque vacarmes de monsieur Houlou. Somehow, this reviewer saw 
me praising Cage to the skies ("Godel, Escher, Cage"?) and managed to 
read into my coy allusions to and minor borrowings from Zen an uncritical 
acceptance thereof, which in fact is not at all my stance. As I declare at the 
start of Chapter 9, I find Zen not only confusing and silly, but on a very deep 
level utterly inimical to my core beliefs. However, I also find Zen's silliness 
-
especially when it gets really silly -
quite amusing, even refreshing, and it 
was simply fun for me to sprinkle a bit of Eastern spice into my basically very 
Western casserole. However, my having sprinkled little traces of Zen here 
and there does not mean that I am a Zen monk in sheep's clothing. 
As for John Cage, for some odd reason I had felt very sure, up till 
reading Houlou's weird about-face, that in my "Canon by Intervallic 
Augmentation" and the chapter that follows it, I had unambiguously heaped 
scorn on Cage's music, albeit in a somewhat respectful manner. But wait, 
wait, wait -
isn't "heaping respectful scorn" not a contradiction in terms, 
indeed a patent impossibility? And doesn't such coy flirting with self-
contradiction and paradox demonstrate, exactly as Houlou claims, that I am, 
deep down, both antiscientific and pro-Zen, after all? Well, so be it. 
Even if I feel my book is as often misunderstood as understood, I 
certainly can't complain about the size or the enthusiasm of its readership 
around the world. The original English-language GEB was and continues to 
be very popular, and its translated selves hit the bestseller lists in (at least) 
France, Holland, and Japan. The German GEB, in fact, occupied the #1 
rank on the nonfiction list for something like five months during 1985, the 
300th birthyear of]. S. Bach. It seems a bit absurd to me. But who knows-
that anniversary, aided by the other Germanic names on the cover, may have 
crucially sparked GEB's popularity there. 
GEB has also been lovingly 
translated into Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Swedish, and Portuguese, and 
-
perhaps unexpectedly -
with great virtuosity into Chinese. There is also 
a fine Russian version all ready, just waiting in the wings until it finds a 
publisher. All of this far transcends anything I ever expected, even though I 
can't deny that as I was writing it, especially in those heady Stanford days, I 
had a growing inner feeling that GEB would make some sort of splash. 
My Subsequent Intellectual Path: Decade I 
Since sending GEB off to the printers two decades ago, I've somehow 
managed to keep myself pretty busy. Aside from striving, with a team of 
excellent graduate students, to develop computer models of the mental 
mechanisms that underlie analogy and creativity, I've also written several 
further books, each of which I'll comment on here, though only very briefly. 
The first of these, appearing in late 1981, was The Mind's I, an anthology 
co-edited with a new friend, philosopher Daniel Dennett. Our purpose, 
closely related to that of GEB, was to force our readers to confront, in the 
most vivid and even jolting manner, the fundamental conundrum of human 
P-18 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

existence: our deep and almost ineradicable sense of possessing a unique 
"I"-ness transcending our physical bodies and mysteriously enabling us to 
exercise something we call "free will", without ever quite knowing just what 
that is. 
Dan and I used stories and dialogues from a motley crew of 
excellent writers, and one of the pleasures for me was that I finally got to see 
my Einstein-book dialogue in print, after all. 
During the years 1981-1983, I had the opportunity to write a monthly 
column for Scientific American, which I called "Metamagical Themas" (an 
anagram of "Mathematical Games", the title of the wonderful column by 
Martin Gardner that had occupied the same slot in the magazine for the 
preceding 25 years). Although the topics I dealt with in my column were, 
on their surface, allover the map, in some sense they were unified by their 
incessant quest for "the essence of mind and pattern". I covered such things 
as pattern and poetry in the music of Chopin; the question of whether the 
genetic code is arbitrary or inevitable; strategies in the never-ending battle 
against pseudo-science; the boundary between sense and nonsense in 
literature; chaos and strange attractors in mathematics; game theory and the 
Prisoner's Dilemma; creative analogies involving simple number patterns; 
the insidious effects of sexist language; and many other topics. In addition, 
strange loops, self-reference, recursion, and a closely related phenomenon 
that I came to call "locking-in" were occasional themes in my columns. In 
that sense, as well as in their wandering through many disciplines, my 
"Metamagical Themas" essays echoed the flavor of GEB. 
Although I stopped writing my column in 1983, I spent the next year 
pulling together the essays I'd done and providing each of them with a 
substantial "Post Scriptum"; these 25 chapters, along with eight fresh ones, 
constituted my 1985 book Metama[Sical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind 
and Pattern. One of the new pieces was a rather zany Achilles-Tortoise 
dialogue called "Who Shoves Whom Around Inside the Careenium?", which 
I feel captures my personal views on self, soul, and the infamous "I "-word -
namely, "I"! -
perhaps better than anything else I've written -
maybe even 
better than GEB does, though that might be going too far. 
For several years during the 1980's, I was afllicted with a severe case of 
"ambigrammitis", which I caught from my friend Scott Kim, and out of 
which came my 1987 book Ambigrammi. An ambigram (or an "inversion", as 
Scott calls them in his own book, Inversions) is a calligraphic design that 
manages to squeeze two different readings into the selfsame set of curves. I 
found the idea charming and intellectually fascinating, and as I developed 
my own skill at this odd but elegant art form, I found that self-observation 
gave me many new insights into the nature of creativity, and so Ambigrammi, 
aside from showcasing some 200 of my ambigrams, also features a text -
in 
fact, a dialogue -
that is a long, wandering meditation on the creative act, 
centered on the making of ambigrams but branching out to include musical 
composition, scientific discovery, creative writing, and so on. For reasons 
not worth going into, Ambigrammi: Un microcosmo ideate per lo studio della 
creativittl was published only in Italian and by a tiny publisher called Hopeful 
Monster, and I regret to say that it is no longer available.

My Subsequent Intellectual Path: Decade II 
As I said above, writing, though crucial, was not my only intellectual focus; 
research into cognitive mechanisms was an equally important one. My early 
hunches about how to model analogy and creativity are actually set forth 
quite clearly in GEB's Chapter 19, in my discussion of Bongard problems, 
and although those were just the germs of an actual architecture, I feel it is 
fair to say that despite many years of refinement, most of those ideas can be 
found in one form or another in the models developed in my research 
group at Indiana University and the University of Michigan (where I spent 
the years 1984-1988, in the Psychology Department). 
Mter a decade and a half of development of computer models, the time 
seemed ripe for a book that would pull all the main threads together and 
describe the programs' principles and performance in clear and accessible 
language. Thus over several years, Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies took 
shape, and finally appeared in print in 1995. In it are presented a series of 
closely related computer programs -
Seek-Whence, Jumbo, Numbo, 
Copycat, Tabletop, and (still in progress) Metacat and Letter Spirit -
together with philosophical discussions that attempt to set them in context. 
Several of its chapters are co-authored by members of the Fluid Analogies 
Research Group, and indeed FARG gets its proper billing as my collective 
co-author. The book shares much with GEB, but perhaps most important of 
all is the basic philosophical article of faith that being an "I" -
in other 
words, possessing a sense of self so deep and ineradicable that it blurs into 
causality -
is an inevitable concomitant to, and ingredient of, the flexibility 
and power that are synonymous with intelligence, and that the latter is but 
another term for conceptual flexibility, which in tum means meaningful symbols. 
A very different strand of my intellectual life was my deep involvement 
in the translation of GEB into various languages, and this led me, perhaps 
inevitably, in retrospect, to the territory of verse translation. It all started in 
1987 with my attempt to mimic in English a beautiful French miniature by 
sixteenth-century French poet Clement Marot, but from there it spun off in 
many directions at once. To make a long story short, I wound up writing a 
complex and deeply personal book about translation in its most general and 
metaphorical sense, and while writing it, I experienced much the same 
feeling of exhilaration as I had twenty years earlier, when writing GEB. 
This book, Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language, winds 
through many diverse terrains, including what it means to "think in" a given 
language (or a blur of languages); how constraints can enhance creativity; 
how meaning germinates, buds, and flowers in minds and might someday 
do so in machines; how words, when put together into compounds, often 
melt together and lose some or all of their identity; how a language spoken 
on a neutron star might or might not resemble human languages; how 
poetry written hundreds of years ago should be rendered today; how 
translation is intimately related to analogy and to the fundamental human 
process of understanding one another; what kinds of passages, if any, are 
P-20 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

intrinsically untranslatable; what it means to translate nonsense passages 
from one language to another; the absurdity of supposing that today's 
mostly money-driven machine-translation gimmickry could handle even the 
simplest of poetry; and on and on. 
The two middle chapters of Le Ton beau de Marot are devoted to a work 
of fiction that I had recently fallen in love with: Alexander Pushkin's novel 
in verse, Eugene Onegin. I first came into contact with this work through a 
couple of English translations, and then read others, always fascinated by 
the translators' different philosophies and styles. From this first flame of 
excitement, I slowly was drawn into trying to read the original text, and then 
somehow, despite having a poor command of Russian, I could not prevent 
myself from trying to translate a stanza or two. Thus started a slippery slope 
that I soon slid down, eventually stunning myself by devoting a whole year to 
recreating the entire novel -
nearly 400 sparkling sonnets -
in English 
verse. Of course, during that time, my Russian improved by leaps and 
bounds, though it still is far from conversationally fluent. As I write, my 
Onegin has not yet come out, but it will be appearing at just about the same 
time in 1999 as the book you are holding -
the twentieth-anniversary 
version of Codel, Escher, Bach. And the year 1999 plays an equally important 
role in my EO's creation, being the 200th birthyear of Alexander Pushkin. 
Forward-looking and Backward-looking Books 
Le Ton beau de Marot is a bit longer than GEB, and on its first page, I go out 
on a limb and call it "probably the best book I will ever write". Some of my 
readers will maintain that GEB is superior, and I can see why they might do 
so. But it's so long since I wrote GEB that perhaps the magical feeling I had 
when writing it has faded, while the magic of LeTbM is still vivid. Still, 
there's no denying that, at least in the short run, LeTbM has had far less 
impact than GEB did, and I confess that that's disappointed me quite a bit. 
Permit me to speculate for a moment as to why this might be the case. 
In some sense, GEB was a "forward-looking" book, or at least on its surface it 
gave that appearance. Many hailed it as something like "the bible of 
artificial intelligence", which is of course ridiculous, but the fact is that many 
young students read it and caught the bug of my own fascination with the 
modeling of mind in all of its elusive aspects, including the evanescent goals 
of "I" and free will and consciousness. Although I am the furthest thing in 
the world from being a futurist, a science-fiction addict, or a technology 
guru, I was often pigeonholed in just that way, simply because I had written 
a long treatise that dealt quite a bit with computers and their vast potential 
(in the most philosophical of senses), and because my book was quite a hit 
among young people interested in computers. 
Well, by contrast, Le Ton beau de Marot might be seen as a "backward-
looking" book, not so much because it was inspired by a sixteenth-century 
poem and deals with many other authors of the past, such as Dante and 
Pushkin, but because there simply is nothing in the book's pages that could 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 
P-21 

be confused with glib technological glitz and surreal futuristic promises. 
Not that GEB had those either, but many people seemed to see something 
vaguely along those lines in it, whereas there's nothing of that sort to latch 
onto, in LeTbM. In fact, some might see it almost as technology-bashing, in 
that I take many artificial-intelligence researchers and machine-translation 
developers to task for wildly exaggerated claims. I am not an enemy of these 
fields, but I am against vast oversimplifications and underestimations of the 
challenges that they represent, for in the end, that amounts to a vast 
underestimation of the human spirit, for which I have the deepest respect. 
Anyone who has read GEB with any care should have seen this same 
"backward-looking" flavor permeating the book, perhaps most explicitly so 
in the key section ''Ten Questions and Speculations" (pp. 676-680), which is 
a very romantic way of looking at the depth of the human spirit. Although 
my prediction about chess-playing programs put forth there turned out to 
be embarrassingly wrong (as the world saw with Deep Blue versus Kasparov 
in 1997), those few pages nonetheless express a set of philosophical beliefs 
to which I am still committed in the sU'ongest sense. 
To Tamper, or to Leave Pristine? 
Given that I was quite wrong in a prediction made twenty years ago, why not 
rewrite the "Ten Questions and Speculations" section, updating it and 
talking about how I feel in light of Deep Blue? Well, of course, this brings 
up a much larger issue: that of revising the 1979 book from top to bottom, 
and coming out with a spanking new 1999 edition of GEB. What might 
militate for, and what might militate against, undertaking such a project? 
I don't deny that some delightful, if small, improvements were made in 
the translated versions. For example, my magistrally Bach-savvy friend 
Bernie Greenberg informed me that the "BACH goblet" I had invented out 
of whole cloth in my dialogue "Contracrostipunctus" actually exists! The 
real goblet is not (as in my dialogue) a piece of glass blown by Bach, but 
rather a gift from one of his prize st.udents; nonetheless, its key feature -
that of having the melody "BACH" etched into the glass itself -
is just as I 
said in the dialogue! This was such an amazing coincidence that I rewrote 
the dialogue for the French version to reflect the real goblet's existence, and 
insisted on having a photograph of the BACH goblet in the French GEB. 
Another delicious touch in the French GEB was the replacement of the 
very formal, character-less photo of Godel by a far more engaging snapshot 
in which he's in a spiffy white suit and is strolling with some old codger in a 
forest. The latter, decked out in a Hoppy hat and baggy pants held up by 
gawky suspenders, looks every inch the quintessential rube, so I rewrote the 
caption as Kurt COdel avec un paysan non identifie ("Kurt Godel with unknown 
peasant"). But as anyone who has lived in the twentieth century can see in a 
split second, the paysan non identifie is none other than A. Einstein. 
Why not, then, incorporate those amusing changes into a revised 
edition in English? On a more substantial level, why not talk a bit about the 
P-22 
Twentieth-anniversary Preface 

pioneering artificial-intelligence program Hearsay II, whose very subtle 
architecture started exerting, only a year or two after GEB came out, a vast 
impact on my own computer models, and about which I already knew 
something way back in 1976? Why not talk more about machine translation, 
and especially its weaknesses? Why not have a whole chapter about the most 
promising developments (and/or exaggerated claims) over the past two 
decades in artificial intelligence -
featuring my own research group as well 
as others? Or why not, as some have suggested, come out with a CD-ROM 
with Escher pictures and Bach music on it, as well as recordings of all of 
GEB's dialogues as performed by top-notch actors? 
Well, I can see the arguments for any of these, but unfortunately, I just 
don't buy them. The CD-ROM suggestion, the one most often made to me, 
is the simplest to dismiss. I intended GEB as a book, not as a multimedia 
circus, and book it shall remain -
end of story. As for the idea of revising 
the text, however, that is more complex. Where would one draw the line? 
What would be sacrosanct? What would survive, what would be tossed out? 
Were I to take that task on, I might well wind up rewriting every single 
sentence -
and, let's not forget, reverse-engineering old Mr. T ... 
Perhaps I'm just a crazy purist; perhaps I'm just a lazy lout; but stubborn 
no doubt, and wouldn't dream of changing my book's Urtext. That's out! 
Thus in my sternness, I won't allow myself to add the names of two people 
-
Donald Kennedy and Howard Edenberg -
to my ''Words of Thanks", 
despite the fact that for years, I've felt sad at having inadvertently left them 
out. I won't even correct the book's typos (and, to my chagrin, I did find, 
over the decades, that there are a few, aside from those listed explicitly 
under "typos" in the index)! Why on earth am I such a stick-in-the-mud? 
Why not bring Codel, Escher, Bach up to date and make it a book worthy of 
ushering in the twenty-first century -
indeed, the third millenium? 
Qurerendo Invenietis ... 
Well, the only answer I can give, other than that life is short, is that GEB was 
written in one sitting, so to speak. GEB was a clean and pure vision that was 
dreamed by someone else -
someone who, to be sure, was remarkably 
similar to yours truly, but someone who nonetheless had a slightly different 
perspective and a slightly different agenda. GEB was that person's labor of 
love, and as such -
at least so say I -
it should not be touched. 
Indeed, I somehow feel a strange inner confidence that the true author 
of GEB, when one fine day he finally reaches my ripe age, will tender to me 
the truest of thanks for not having tampered with the vessel into which he 
poured so much of his young and eager soul -
the work that he even went 
so far as to call, in what some might see as a cryptic or even naively romantic 
remark, "a statement of my religion". At least I know what he meant.

Overview 
Part I: GEB 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering. 
The book opens with the story of 
Bach's Musical Offering. Bach made an impromptu visit to King Frederick the 
Great of Prussia, and was requested to improvise upon a theme presented by the 
King. His improvisations formed the basis of that great work. The Musical 
Offering and its story form a theme upon which I "improvise" throughout the 
book, thus making a sort of "Metamusical Offering". Self-reference and the 
interplay between different levels in Bach are discussed; this leads to a discussion 
of parallel ideas in Escher's drawings and then Godel's Theorem. A briefpresen-
tation of the history of logic and paradoxes is given as background for Godel's 
Theorem. This leads to mechanical reasoning and computers, and the debate 
about whether Artificial Intelligence is possible. I close with an explanation of 
the origins of the book-particularly the why and wherefore of the Dialogues. 
Three-Part Invention. 
Bach wrote fifteen three-part inventions. In this three-part 
Dialogue, the Tortoise and Achilles-the main fictional protagonists in the 
Dialogues-are "invented" by Zeno (as in fact they were, to illustrate Zeno's 
paradoxes of motion). Very short, it simply gives the flavor of the Dialogues to 
come. 
Chapter I: The MU-puzzle. 
A simple formal system (the MIU-system) is pre-
sented, and the reader is urged to work out a puzzle to gain familiarity with 
formal systems in general. A number of fundamental notions are introduced: 
string, theorem, axiom, rule of inference, derivation, formal system, decision 
procedure, working inside/outside the system. 
Two-Part Invention. 
Bach also wrote fifteen two-part inventions. This two-part 
Dialogue was written not by me, but by Lewis Carroll in 1895. Carroll borrowed 
Achilles and the Tortoise from Zeno, and I in turn borrowed them from CarrolL 
The topic is the relation between reasoning, reasoning about reasoning, reason-
ing about reasoning about reasoning. and so on. It parallels, in a way, Zeno's 
paradoxes about the impossibility of motion, seeming to show, by using infinite 
regress, that reasoning is impossible. It is a beautiful paradox, and is referred to 
several times later in the book. 
Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics. 
A new formal system (the 
pq-system) is presented, even simpler than the MIU-system of Chapter I. Ap-
parently meaningless at first, its symbols are suddenly revealed to possess mean-
ing by virtue of the form of the theorems they appear in. This revelation is the 
first important insight into meaning: its deep connection to isomorphism. Vari-
ous issues related to meaning are then discussed, such as truth, proof, symbol 
manipulation, and the elusive concept, "form". 
Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles. 
A Dialogue which imitates the Bach Sonatas 
for unaccompanied violin. In particular, Achilles is the only speaker, since it is a 
transcript of one end of a telephone call, at the far end of which is the Tortoise. 
Their conversation concerns the concepts of "figure" and "ground" in various 
viii 
Overview 

contexts-e.g., Escher's art. The Dialogue itself forms an example of the distinc-
tion, since Achilles' lines form a "figure", and the Tortoise's lines-implicit in 
Achilles' lines-form a "ground". 
Chapter Ill: Figure and Ground. The distinction between figure and ground in 
art is compared to the distinction between theorems and nontheorems in formal 
systems. The question "Does a figure necessarily contain the same information as 
its ground?" leads to the distinction between recursively enumerable sets and 
recursive sets. 
Contracrostipunctus. 
This Dialogue is central to the book, for it contains a set of 
paraphrases of Godel's self-referential construction and of his Incompleteness 
Theorem. One of the the paraphrases of the Theorem says, "For each record 
player there is a record which it cannot play." The Dialogue's title is a cross 
between the word "acrostic" and the word "contrapunctus", a Latin word which 
Bach used to denote the many fugues and canons making up his Art of the Fugue. 
Some explicit references to the Art of the Fugue are made. The Dialogue itself 
conceals some acrostic tricks. 
Chapter IV: Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry. The preceding 
Dialogue is explicated to the extent it is possible at this stage. This leads back to 
the question of how and when symbols in a formal system acquire meaning. The 
history of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry is given, as an illustration of 
the elusive notion of "undefined terms". This leads to ideas about the consistency 
of different and possibly "rival" geometries. Through this discussion the notion 
of undefined terms is clarified, and the relation of undefined terms to perception 
and thought processes is considered. 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth. 
This is based on the Bach organ piece by the same 
name. It is a playful introduction to the notion of recursive-i.e., nested-
structures. It contains stories within stories. The frame story, instead of finishing 
as expected, is left open, so the reader is left dangling without resolution. One 
nested story concerns modulation in music-particularly an organ piece which 
ends in the wrong key, leaving the listener dangling without resolution. 
Chapter V: Recursive Structures and Processes. 
The idea of recursion is 
presented in many different contexts: musical patterns, linguistic patterns, 
geometric structures, mathematical functions, physical theories, computer pro-
grams, and others. 
Canon by Intervallic Augmentation. 
Achilles and the Tortoise try to resolve the 
question, "Which contains more information-a record, or the phonograph 
which plays it?" This odd question arises when the Tortoise describes a single 
record which, when played on a set of different phonographs, produces two 
quite different melodies: B-A-C-H and C-A-G-E. It turns out, however, that 
these melodies are "the same", in a peculiar sense. 
Chapter VI: The Location of Meaning. 
A broad discussion of how meaning is 
split among coded message, decoder, and receiver. Examples presented include 
strands of DNA, undeciphered inscriptions on ancient tablets, and phonograph 
records sailing out in space. The relationship of intelligence to "absolute" mean-
ing is postulated. 
Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud. 
A short Dialogue bearing hardly any resemblance, 
except in title, to Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue. It concerns the proper way 
to manipulate sentences so as to preserve truth-and in particular the question 
Overview 

of whether there exist rules for the usage of the word "and". This Dialogue has 
much in common with the Dialogue by Lewis Carroll. 
Chapter VII: The Propositional Calculus. It is suggested how words such as 
"and" can be governed by formal rules. Once again, the ideas of isomorphism 
and automatic acquisition of meaning by symbols in such a system are brought 
up. All the examples in this Chapter, incidentally, are "Zentences"-sentences 
taken from Zen k6ans. This is purposefully done, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, 
since Zen k6ans are deliberately illogical stories. 
Crab Canon. 
A Dialogue based on a piece by the same name from the Musical 
Offering. Both are so named because crabs (supposedly) walk backwards. The 
Crab makes his first appearance in this Dialogue. It is perhaps the densest 
Dialogue in the book in terms of formal trickery and level-play. Godel, Escher, 
and Bach are deeply intertwined in this very short Dialogue. 
Chapter Vlll: Typographical Number Theory. 
An extension of the Proposition-
al Calculus called "TNT" is presented. In TNT, number-theoretical reasoning 
can be done by rigid symbol manipulation. Differences between formal reason-
ing and human thought are considered. 
A Mu Offering. 
This Dialogue foreshadows several new topics in the book. 
Ostensibly concerned with Zen Buddhism and k6ans, it is actually a thinly veiled 
discussion of theoremhood and nontheoremhood, truth and falsity, of strings in 
number theory. There are fleeting references to molecular biology-particularly 
the Genetic Code. There is no close affinity to the Musical Offering, other than in 
the title and the playing of self-referential games. 
Chapter IX: Mumon and G6del. 
An attempt is made to talk about the strange 
ideas of Zen Buddhism. The Zen monk Mumon, who gave well known commen-
taries on many k6ans, is a central figure. In a way, Zen ideas bear a metaphorical 
resemblance to some contemporary ideas in the philosophy of mathematics. 
After this "Zennery", Godel's fundamental idea of Godel-numbering is intro-
duced, and a first pass through Godel's Theorem is made. 
Part 11: EGB 
Prelude. .. This Dialogue attaches to the next one. They are based on preludes 
and fugues from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Achilles and the Tortoise bring a 
present to the Crab, who has a guest: the Anteater. The present turns out to be a 
recording of the W.T.C.; it is immediately put on. As they listen to a prelude, 
they discuss the structure of preludes and fugues, which leads Achilles to ask 
how to hear a fugue: as a whole, or as a sum of parts? This is the debate between 
holism and reductionism, which is soon taken up in the Ant FUffUe. 
Chapter X: Levels of Description. and Computer Systems. 
Various levels of 
seeing pictures, chessboards, and computer systems are discussed. The last of 
these is then examined in detail. This involves describing machine languages, 
assembly languages, compiler languages, operating systems, and so forth. Then 
the discussion turns to composite systems of other types, such as sports teams, 
nuclei, atoms, the weather, and so forth. The question arises as to how many 
intermediate levels exist--or indeed whether any exist. 
x 
Overview 

· .. Ant Fugue. 
An imitation of a musical fugue: each voice enters with the same 
statement. The theme-holism versus reductionism-is introduced in a recur-
sive picture composed of words composed of smaller words, etc. The words 
which appear on the four levels of this strange picture are "HOLISM", "REDUC-
TIONISM", and "MU". The discussion veers off to a friend of the Anteater's-
Aunt Hillary, a conscious ant colony. The various levels of her thought processes 
are the topic of discussion. Many fugal tricks are ensconced in the Dialogue. As a 
hint to the reader, references are made to parallel tricks occurring in the fugue 
on the record to which the foursome is listening. At the end of the Ant Fugue, 
themes from the Prelude return, transformed considerably. 
Chapter Xl: Brains and Thoughts. "How can thoughts be supported by the 
hardware of the brain?" is the topic of the Chapter. An overview of the large-
scale and small-scale structure of the brain is first given. Then the relation 
between concepts and neural activity is speculatively discussed in some detail. 
English French German Suite. 
An interlude consisting of Lewis Carroll's non-
sense poem "Jabberwocky" together with two translations: one into French and 
one into German, both done last century. 
Chapter Xll: Minds and Thoughts. The preceding poems bring up in a forceful 
way the question of whether languages, or indeed minds, can be "mapped" onto 
each other. How is communication possible between two separate physical 
brains? What do all human brains have in common? A geographical analogy is 
used to suggest an answer. The question arises, "Can a brain be understood, in 
some objective sense, by an outsider?" 
Aria with Diverse Variations. 
A Dialogue whose form is based on Bach's Goldberg 
Variations, and whose content is related to number-theoretical problems such as 
the Goldbach conjecture. This hybrid has as its main purpose to show how 
number theory's subtlety stems from the fact that there are many diverse varia-
tions on the theme of searching through an infinite space. Some of them lead to 
infinite searches, some of them lead to finite searches, while some others hover in 
between. 
Chapter Xlll: BlooP and FlooP and GlooP. 
These are the names of three 
computer languages. BlooP programs can carry out only predictably finite 
searches, while FlooP programs can carry out unpredictable or even infinite 
searches. The purpose of this Chapter is to give an intuition for the notions of 
primitive recursive and general recursive functions in number theory, for they 
are essential in Godel's proof. 
Air on G's String. 
A Dialogue in which Godel's self-referential construction is 
mirrored in words. The idea is due to W. V. O. Quine. This Dialogue serves as a 
prototype for the next Chapter. 
Chapter XIV: On Formally Undecidable Propositions of TNT and Related 
Systems. This Chapter's title is an adaptation of the title of Gooel's 1931 
article, in which his Incompleteness Theorem was first published. The two major 
parts of Godel's proof are gone through carefully. It is shown how the assump-
tion of consistency of TNT forces one to conclude that TNT (or any similar 
system) is incomplete. Relations to Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry are 
discussed. Implications for the philosophy of mathematics are gone into with 
some care. 
Overview

Birthday Cantatatata . " 
In which Achilles cannot convince the wily and skeptical 
Tortoise that today is his (Achilles') birthday. His repeated but unsuccessful tries 
to do so foreshadow the repeatability of the Godel argument. 
Chapter XV: Jumping out of the System. The repeatability of Godel's argu-
ment is shown, with the implication that TNT is not only incomplete, but 
"essentially incomplete". The fairly notorious argument by J. R. Lucas, to the 
effect that Godel's Theorem demonstrates that human thought cannot in any 
sense be "mechanical", is analyzed and found to be wanting. 
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker. 
A Dialogue treating of many topics, with 
the thrust being problems connected with self-replication and self-reference. 
Television cameras filming television screens, and viruses and other subcellular 
entities which assemble themselves, are among the examples used. The title 
comes from a poem by J. S. Bach himself, which enters in a peculiar way. 
Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and Self-Rep. This Chapter is about the connection be-
tween self-reference in its various guises, and self-reproducing entities (e.g., 
computer programs or DNA molecules). The relations between a self-
reproducing entity and the mechanisms external to it which aid it in reproducing 
itself (e.g., a computer or proteins) are discussed-particularly the fuzziness of 
the distinction. How information travels between various levels of such systems is 
the central topic of this Chapter. 
The Magnificrab, Indeed. 
The title is a pun on Bach's Magnificat in D. The tale is 
about the Crab, who gives the appearance of having a magical power of distin-
guishing between true and false statements of number theory by reading them as 
musical pieces, playing them on his flute, and determining whether they are 
"beautiful" or not. 
Chapter XVII: Church, Turing, Tars ki , and Others. The fictional Crab .of the 
preceding Dialogue is replaced by various real people with amazing mathemati-
cal abilities. The Church-Turing Thesis, which relates mental activity to compu-
tation, is presented in several versions of differing strengths. All are analyzed, 
particularly in terms of their implications for simulating human thought 
mechanically, or programming into a machine an ability to sense or create 
beauty. The connection between brain activity and computation brings up some 
other topics: the halting problem of Turing, and Tarski's Truth Theorem. 
SHRDLU, Toy if Man's Designing. 
This Dialogue is lifted out of an article by 
Terry Winograd on his program SHRDLU; only a few names have been 
changed. In it, a program communicates with a person about the so-called 
"blocks world" in rather impressive English. The computer program appears to 
exhibit some real understanding-in its limited world. The Dialogue's title is 
based onjesu, joy of Man's Desiring, one movement of Bach's Cantata 147. 
Chapter XVlll: Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects. 
This Chapter opens with a 
discussion of the famous "Turing test"-a proposal by the computer pioneer 
Alan Turing for a way to detect the presence or absence of "thought" in a 
machine. From there, we go on to an abridged history of Artificial Intelligence. 
This covers programs that can-to some degree-play games, prove theorems, 
solve problems, compose music, do mathematics, and use "natural language" 
(e.g., English).

Overview 

Contrafactus. 
About how we unconsciously organize our thoughts so that we can 
imagine hypothetical variants on the real world all the time. Also about aberrant 
variants of this ability-such as possessed by the new character, the Sloth, an avid 
lover of French fries, and rabid hater of counterfactuals. 
Chapter XIX: Artificial Intelligence: Prospects. The preceding Dialogue trig-
gers a discussion of how knowledge is represented in layers of contexts. This 
leads to the modern AI idea of "frames". A frame-like way of handling a set of 
visual pattern puzzles is presented, for the purpose of concreteness. Then the 
deep issue of the interaction of concepts in general is discussed, which leads into 
some speculations on creativity. The Chapter concludes with a set of personal 
"Questions and Speculations" on AI and minds in general. 
Sloth Canon. 
A canon which imitates a Bach canon in which one voice plays the 
same melody as another, only upside down and twice as slowly, while a third 
voice is free. Here, the Sloth utters the same lines as the Tortoise does, only 
negated (in a liberal sense of the term) and twice as slowly, while Achilles is free. 
Chapter XX: Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies. 
A grand windup of 
many of,the ideas about hierarchical systems and self-reference. It is concerned 
with the snarls which arise when systems turn back on themselves-for example, 
science probing science, government investigating governmental wrongdoing, 
art violating the rules of art, and finally, humans thinking about their own brains 
and minds. Does Godel's Theorem have anything to say about this last "snarl"? 
Are free will and the sensation of consciousness connected to Godel's Theorem? 
The Chapter ends by tying Godel, Escher, and Bach together once again. 
Six-Part Ricercar. 
This Dialogue is an exuberant game played with many of the 
ideas which have permeated the book. It is a reenactment of the story of the 
Musical Offering, which began the book; it is simultaneously a "translation" into 
words of the most complex piece in the Musical Offering: the Six-Part Ricercar. 
This duality imbues the Dialogue with more levels of meaning than any other in 
the book. Frederick the Great is replaced by the Crab, pianos by computers, and 
so on. Many surprises arise. The Dialogue's content concerns problems of mind, 
consciousness, free will, Artificial Intelligence, the Turing test, and so forth, 
which have been introduced earlier. It concludes with an implicit reference to 
the beginning of the book, thus making the book into one big self-referential 
loop, symbolizing at once Bach's music, Escher's drawings, and Godel's Theorem.

Cover: A "GEB" and an "EGB" trip-let suspended in space, casting their 
symbolic shadows on three planes that meet at the corner of a room. 
("Trip-let" is the name which I have given to blocks shaped in such a way 
that their shadows in three orthogonal directions are three different 
letters. The trip-let idea came to me in a flash one evening as I was trying 
to think how best to symbolize the unity of G6del, Escher, and Bach by 
somehow fusing their names in a striking design. The two trip-lets shown 
on the cover were designed and made by me, using mainly a band saw, 
with an end mill for the holes; they are redwood, and are just under 4 
inches on a side.)

Words of Thanks 
This book was brewing in my mind over a period of probably nearly twenty 
years-ever since I was thirteen and thinking about how I thought in 
English and French. And even before that, there were clear signs of my 
main-line interest. I remember that at some early age, there was nothing 
more fascinating to me than the idea of taking three 3's: operating upon 3 
with itself! I was sure that this idea was so subtle that it was inconceivable to 
anyone else-but I dared ask my mother one day how big it was anyway, 
and she answered "Nine". I wasn't sure she knew what I meant, though. 
Later, my father initiated me into the mysteries of square roots, and i ... 
lowe more to my parents than to anyone else. They have been pillars 
of support I could rely on at all times. They have guided me, inspired me, 
encouraged me, and sustained me. Most of all, they have always believed in 
me. It is to them that this book is dedicated. 
To two friends of many years-Robert Boeninger, Peter Jones-lowe 
special thanks, for they helped mold a million ways of thought, and their 
influences and ideas are spread all around in this book. 
To Charles Brenner, I am much indebted for his having taught me to 
program when we were both young, and for his constant pushing and 
prodding-implicit praise-and occasional criticism. 
I am pleased to acknowledge the immense influence of Ernest Nagel, a 
long-time friend and mentor. I loved "Nagel and Newman", and I have 
learned much from many conversations, long ago in Vermont and more 
recently in New York. 
Howard DeLong, through his book, reawakened in me a long-
dormant love of the matters in this book. I truly owe him a great debt. 
David Jonathan Justman taught me what it is to be a Tortoise-an 
ingenious, persistent, and humorous being, with a fondness for paradox 
and contradiction. I hope that he will read and enjoy this book, which owes 
a great deal to him. 
Scott Kim has exerted a gigantic influence on me. Ever since we met 
some two and a half years ago, the resonance between the two of us has 
been incredible. Aside from his tangible contributions of art, music, 
humor, analogies, and so on-including much-appreciated volunteer labor 
at crucial times-Scott has contributed new perspectives and insights which 
have changed my own views of my endeavor as it has evolved. If anyone 
understands this book, it is Scott. 
For advice on matters of large scale or small, I have turned repeatedly 
to Don Byrd, who knows this book forwards and backwards and every 
which way ... He has an unerring sense for its overall goals and structure, 
and time and again has given me good ideas which I have delightedly 
incorporated. My only regret is that I won't be able to include all thefuture 
ideas Don will come up with, once the book is in print. And let me not 
Words of Thanks 
X'lX 

forget to thank Don for the man-elous flexib\lity-in-inflexibility of his 
music-printing program, SMUT. He spent many long days and arduous 
nights coaxing SMUT to sit up and do preposterous tricks. Some of his 
results are included as figures in this book. But Don's influence is spread 
throughout, which pleases me greatly. 
I could not possibly have written this book if it were not for the 
facilities of the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences, at 
Stanford University. Its director, Pat Suppes, is a long-time friend and he 
was extremely generous to me, in housing me in Ventura Hall, giving me 
access to an outstanding computer system, and in general an excellent 
working environment, for two whole years-and then some. 
This brings me to Pentti Kanerva, the author of the text-editing pro-
gram to which this book owes its existence. I have said to many people that 
it would have taken me twice as long to write my book if I hadn't been able 
to use "TV-Edit", that graceful program which is so simple in spirit that 
only Pentti could have written it. It is also thanks to Pentti that I was able to 
do something which very few authors have ever done: typeset my own 
book. He has been a major force in the development of computer typeset-
ting at the IMSSS. Equally important to me, however, is Pentti's rare 
quality: his sense of style. If my book looks good, to Pentti Kanerva is due 
much of the credit. 
It was in the ASSU Typesetting Shop that this book was actually born. I 
would like to offer many hearty words of thanks to its director, Beverly 
Hendricks, and to her crew, for help in times of dire need, and for 
consistently good spirits in the face of one disaster after another. I would 
also like to thank Cecille Taylor and Barbara Laddaga, who did most of the 
actual work of running off galleys. 
Over the years, my sister Laura Hofstadter has contributed much to 
my outlook on the world. Her influence is present in both the form and 
content of this book. 
I would like to thank my new and old friends Marie Anthony, Sydney 
Arkowitz, Bengt Olle Bengtsson, Felix Bloch, Francisco Claro, Persi 
Diaconis, Ncli-Hua Duc'lI1, John Ellis, Robin Freeman, Dan Friedman, 
Pranab Ghosh, Michael Goldhaber, Avril Greenberg, Eric Hamburg, 
Robert Herman, Ray Hyman, Dave Jennings, Dianne Kanerva, Lauri 
Kaner-va, Inga Karliner, Jonathan and Ellen King, Gayle Landt, Bill Lewis, 
Jos Marlowe, John McCarthy, Jim McDonald, Louis Mendelowitz, Mike 
Mueller, Rosemary Nelson, Steve Omohundro, Paul Oppenheimer, Peter 
E. Parks, David Policansky, Pete Rimbey, Kathy Rosser, Wilfried Sieg, Guy 
Steele, Larry Tesler, Fran~ois Vannucci, Phil Wadler, Terry Winograd, 
and Bob Wolf for "resonating" with me at crucial times in my life, and 
thereby contributing in various and sundry ways to this book. 
I wrote this book twice. After having written it once, I started all over 
again and rewrote it. The first go-round was when I was still a graduate 
student in physics at the University of Oregon, and four faculty members 
were mighty indulgent concerning my aberrant ways: Paul Csonka, Rudy 
Hwa, Mike Moravcsik, and Gregory Wannier. I appreciate their under-
xx

standing attitudes. In addition, Paul Csonka read an entire early version 
and made helpful comments. 
Thanks to E. O. Wilson for reading and commenting on an early 
version of my Prelude, Ant Fugue. 
Thanks to Marsha Meredith for being the meta-author of a droll koan. 
Thanks to Marvin Minsky for a memorable conversation one March 
day in his home, parts of which the reader will find reconstructed herein. 
Thanks to Bill Kaufmann for advice on publication, and to Jeremy 
Bernstein and Alex George for encouraging words when needed. 
Very warm thanks to Martin Kessler, Maureen Bischoff, Vincent 
Torre, Leon Dorin, and all the other people at Basic Books, for undertak-
ing this publishing venture which is unusual in quite a few ways. 
Thanks to Phoebe Hoss for doing well the difficult job of copy editing, 
and to Larry Breed for valuable last-minute proofreading. 
Thanks to my many Imlac-roommates, who took so many phone 
messages over the years; also to the Pine Hall crew, who developed and 
maintained much of the hardware and software that this book has so vitally 
depended on. 
Thanks to Dennis Davies of the Stanford Instructional Television 
Network for his help in setting up the "self-engulfing televisions" which I 
spent hours photographing. 
Thanks to Jerry Pryke, Bob Parks, Ted Bradshaw, and Vinnie Aveni 
of the machine shop in the High Energy Physics Laboratory at Stanford, 
for generously helping me make trip-lets. 
Thanks to my uncle and aunt, Jimmy and Betty Givan, for the Christ-
mas present they never knew would so delight me: a "Black Box" which 
had no other function than to turn itself off. 
Finally, I would like to give special thanks to my freshman English 
teacher, Brent Harold, who first spn;tng Zen on me; to Kees Gugelot, who 
gave me a record of the Musical Offering one sad November long ago; and 
to Otto Frisch, in whose office at Cambridge I first saw the magic of Escher. 
I have tried to remember all the people who have contributed to the 
development of this book, but I have undoubtedly failed to include all of 
them. 
In a way, this book is a statement of my religion. I hope that this will 
come through to my readers, and that my enthusiasm and reverence for 
certain ideas will infiltrate the hearts and minds of a few people. That is the 
best I could ask for.

Haussmann. 

Introduction: 
A Musico-Logical Offering 
Author: 
FREDERICK THE GREAT, King of Prussia, came to power in 1740. 
Although he is remembered in history books mostly for his military astute-
ness, he was also devoted to the life of the mind and the spirit. His court in 
Potsdam was one of the great centers of intellectual activity in Europe in 
the eighteenth century. The celebrated mathematician Leonhard Euler 
spent twenty-five years there. Many other mathematicians and scientists 
came, as well as philosophers-including Voltaire and La Mettrie, who 
wrote some of their most influential works while there. 
But music was Frederick's real love. He was an avid flutist and com-
poser. Some of his compositions are occasionally performed even to this 
day. Frederick was one of the first patrons of the arts to recognize the 
virtues of the newly developed "piano-forte" ("soft-loud"). The piano had 
been developed in the first half of the eighteenth century as a modification 
of the harpsichord. The problem with the harpsichord was that pieces 
could only be played at a rather uniform loudness-there was no way to 
strike one note more loudly than its neighbors. The "soft-loud", as its name 
implies, provided a remedy to this problem. From Italy, where Bartolom-
meo Cristofori had made the first one, the soft-loud idea had spread 
widely. Gottfried Silber mann, the foremost German organ builder of the 
day, was endeavoring to make a "perfect" piano-forte. Undoubtedly King 
Frederick was the greatest supporter of his efforts-it is said that the King 
owned as many as fifteen Silbermann pianos! 
Bach 
Frederick was an admirer not only of pianos, but also of an organist and 
composer by the name of J. S. Bach. This Bach's compositions were some-
what notorious. Some called them "turgid and confused", while others 
claimed they were incomparable masterpieces. But no one disputed Bach's 
ability to improvise on the organ. In those days, being an organist not only 
meant being able to play, but also to extemporize, and Bach was known far 
and wide for his remarkable extemporizations. (For some delightful anec-
dotes about Bach's extemporization, see The Bach Reader, by H. T. David 
and A. Mendel.) 
In 1747, Bach was sixty-two, and his fame, as well as one of his sons, 
had reached Potsdam; in fact, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was the 
Capellmeister (choirmaster) at the court of King Frederick. For years the 
King had let it be known, through gentle hints to Philipp Emanuel, how

pleased he would be to have the elder Bach come and pay him a visit; but 
this wish had never been realized. Frederick was particularly eager for 
Bach to tryout his new Silbermann pianos, which he (Frederick) correctly 
foresaw as the great new wave in music. 
It was Frederick's custom to have evening concerts of chamber music 
in his court. Often he himself would be the soloist in a concerto for flute. 
Here we have reproduced a painting of such an evening by the German 
painter Adolph von Menzel, who, in the 1800's, made a series of paintings 
illustrating the life of Frederick the Great. At the cembalo is C. P. E. Bach, 
and the figure furthest to the right is Joachim Quantz, the King's flute 
master-and the only person allowed to find fault with the King's flute 
playing. One May evening in 1747, an unexpected guest showed up. 
Johann Nikolaus Forkel, one of Bach's earliest biographers, tells the story 
as follows: 
4 
One evening, just as he was getting his Aute ready, and his musicians were 
assembled, an officer brought him a list of the strangers who had arrived. 
With his Aute in his hand he ran over the list, but immediately turned to the 
assembled musicians, and said, with a kind of agitation, "Gentlemen, old Bach 
is come." The Aute was now laid aside, and old Bach, who had alighted at his 
son's lodgings, was immediately summoned to the Palace. Wilhelm 
Friedemann, who accompanied his father, told me this story, and I must say 
that I still think with pleasure on the manner in which he related it. At that 
time it was the fashion to make rather prolix compliments. The first appear-
ance of J. S. Bach before so great a Kmg, who did not even give him time to 
change his traveling dress for a black chanter's gown, must necessarily be 
attended with many apologies. I will not here dwell on these apologies, but 
merely observe, that in Wilhelm Friedemann's mouth they made a formal 
Dialogue between the King and the Apologist. 
But what is more important than this is that the King gave up his Concert 
for this evening, and invited Bach, then already called the Old Bach, to try his 
fortepianos, made by Silbermann, which stood in several rooms of the palace. 
[Forkel here inserts this footnote: "The pianofortes manufactured by Silber-
mann, of Freyberg, pleased the King so much, that he resolved to buy them 
all up. He collected fifteen. I hear that they all now stand unfit for use in 
various corners of the Royal Palace."] The musicians went with him from 
room to room, and Bach was invited everywhere to try them and to play 
unpremeditated compositions. After he had gone on for some time, he asked 
the King to give him a subject for a Fugue, in order to execute it immediately 
without any preparation. The King admired the learned manner in which his 
subject was thus executed extempore; and, probably to see how far such art 
could be carried, expressed a wish to hear a Fugue with six Obligato parts. 
But as it is not every subject that is fit for such full harmony, Bach chose one 
himself, and immediately executed it to the astonishment of all present in the 
same magnificent and learned manner as he had done that of the King. His 
Majesty desired also to hear his performance on the organ. The next day 
therefore Bach was taken to all the ol'gans in Potsdam, as he had before been 
to Silbermann's fortepianos. After his return to Leipzig, he composed the 
subject, which he had received from the King, in three and six parts, added 
several artificial passages in strict canon to it, and had it engraved, under the 
title of "Musikalisches Opfer" [MUJicai Offering], and dedicated it to the 
inventor.1

When Bach sent a copy of his Musical Offering to the King, he included 
a dedicatory letter, which is of interest for its prose style if nothing else-
rather submissive and flattersome. From a modern perspective it seems 
comical. Also, it probably gives something of the flavor of Bach's apology 
for his appearance. 2 
MOST GRACIOUS KING! 
In deepest humility I dedicate herewith to Your Majesty a musical offering, 
the noblest part of which derives from Your Majesty's own august hand. With 
awesome pleasure I still remember the very special Royal grace when, some 
time ago, during my visit in Potsdam, Your Majesty's Self deigned to play to 
me a theme for a fugue upon the clavier, and at the same time charged me 
most graciously to carry it out in Your Majesty's most august presence. To 
obey Your Majesty's command was my most humble duty. I noticed very soon, 
however, that, for lack of necessary preparation, the execution of the task did 
not fare as well as such an excellent theme demanded. I resolved therefore 
and promptly pledged myself to work out this right Royal theme more fully, 
and then make it known to the world. This resolve has now been carried out 
as well as possible, and it has none other than this irreproachable intent, to 
glorify, if only in a small point, the fame of a monarch whose greatness and 
power, as in all the sciences of war and peace, so especially in music, everyone 
must admire and revere. I make bold to add this most humble request: may 
Your Majesty deign to dignify the present modest labor with a gracious 
acceptance, and continue to grant Your Majesty's most august Royal grace to

THE AUTHOR 
Some twenty-seven years later, when Bach had been dead for twenty-
four years, a Baron named Gottfried van Swieten-to whom, incidentally, 
Forkel dedicated his biography of Bach, and Beethoven dedicated his First 
Symphony-had a conversation with King Frederick, which he reported as 
follows: 
6 
He [Frederick] spoke to me, among other things, of music, and of a great 
organist named Bach, who has been for a while in Berlin. This artist [Wilhelm 
Friedemann Bach] is endowed with a talent superior, in depth of harmonic 
knowledge and power of execution, to any I have heard or can imagine, while 
those who knew his father claim that he, in turn, was even greater. The King 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 

is of this opinion, and to prove it to me he sang aloud a chromatic fugue 
subject which he had given this old Bach, who on the spot had made of it a 
fugue in four parts, then in five parts, and finally in eight parts. 3 
Of course there is no way of knowing whether it was King Frederick or 
Baron van Swieten who magnified the story into larger-than-life propor-
tions. But it shows how powerful Bach's legend had become by that time. 
To give an idea of how extraordinary a six-part fugue is, in the entire 
Well-Tempered Clavier by Bach, containing forty-eight Preludes and Fugues, 
only two have as many as five parts, and nowhere is there a six-part fugue! 
One could probably liken the task of improvising a six-part fugue to the 
playing of sixty simultaneous blindfold games of chess, and winning them 
all. To improvise an eight-part fugue is really beyond human capability. 
In the copy which Bach sent to King Frederick, on the page preceding 
the first sheet of music, was the following inscription: 
FIGURE 4. 
("At the King's Command, the Song and the Remainder Resolved with 
Canonic Art.") Here Bach is punning on the word "canonic", since it means 
not only "with canons" but also "in the best possible way". The initials of 
this inscription are 
RICERCAR 
-an Italian word, meaning "to seek". And certainly there is a great deal to 
seek in the Musical Offering. It consists of one three-part fugue, one six-part 
fugue, ten canons, and a trio sonata. Musical scholars have concluded that 
the three-part fugue must be, in essence, identical with the one which Bach 
improvised for King Frederick. The six-part fugue is one of Bach's most 
complex creations, and its theme is, of course, the Royal Theme. That 
theme, shown in Figure 3, is a very complex one, rhythmically irregular 
and highly chromatic (that is, filled with tones which do not belong to the 
key it is in). To write a decent fugue of even two voices based on it would 
not be easy for the average musician! 
Both of the fugues are inscribed "Ricercar", rather than "Fuga". This 
is another meaning of the word; "ricercar" was, in fact, the original name 
for the musical form now known as "fugue". By Bach's time, the word 
"fugue" (or fuga, in Latin and Italian) had become standard, but the term 
"ricercar" had survived, and now designated an erudite kind of fugue, 
perhaps too austerely intellectual for the common ear. A similar usage 
survives in English today: the word "recherche" means, literally, "sought 
out", but carries the same kind of implication, namely of esoteric or high-
brow cleverness. 
The trio sonata forms a delightful relief from the austerity of the 
fugues and canons, because it is very melodious and sweet, almost dance-

able. Nevertheless, it too is based largely on the King's theme, chromatic 
and austere as it is. It is rather miraculous that Bach could use such a theme 
to make so pleasing an interlude. 
The ten canons in the Musical Offering are among the most sophisti-
cated canons Bach ever wrote. However, curiously enough, Bach himself 
never wrote them out in full. This was deliberate. They were posed as 
puzzles to King Frederick. It was a familiar musical game of the day to give 
a single theme, together with some more or less tricky hints, and to let the 
canon based on that theme be "discovered" by someone else. In order to 
know how this is possible, you must understand a few facts about canons. 
Canons and Fugues 
The idea of a canon is that one single theme is played against itself. This is 
done by having "copies" of the theme played by the various participating 
voices. But there are many ways to do this. The most straightforward of all 
canons is the round, such as "Three Blind Mice", "Row, Row, Row Your 
Boat", or "Frere Jacques". Here, the theme enters in the first voice and, 
after a fixed time-delay, a "copy" of it enters, in precisely the same key. 
After the same fixed time-delay in the second voice, the third voice enters 
carrying the theme, and so on. Most themes will not harmonize with 
themselves in this way. In order for a theme to work as a canon theme, each 
of its notes must be able to serve in a dual (or triple, or quadruple) role: it 
must firstly be part of a melody, and secondly it must be part of a harmoni-
zation of the same melody. When there are three canonical voices, for 
instance, each note of the theme must act in two distinct harmonic ways, as 
well as melodically. Thus, each note in a canon has more than one musical 
meaning; the listener's ear and brain automatically figure out the appro-
priate meaning, by referring to context. 
There are more complicated sorts of canons, of course. The first 
escalation in complexity comes when the "copies" of the theme are 
staggered not only in time, but also in pitch; thus, the first voice might sing 
the theme starting on C, and the second voice, overlapping with the first 
voice, might sing the identical theme starting five notes higher, on G. A 
third voice, starting on the D yet five notes higher, might overlap with the 
first two, and so on. The next escalation in complexity comes when the 
speeds of the different voices are not equal; thus, the second voice might 
sing twice as quickly, or twice as slowly, as the first voice. The former is 
called diminution, the latter augmentation (since the theme seems to shrink or 
to expand). 
We are not yet done! The next stage of complexity in canon construc-
tion is to invert the theme, which means to make a melody which jumps 
down wherever the original theme jumps up, and by exactly the same 
number of semitones. This is a rather weird melodic transformation, but 
when one has heard many themes inverted, it begins to seem quite natural. 
Bach was especially fond of inversions, and they show up often in his 
work-and the Musical Offering is no exception. (For a simple example of 
8 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 

inversion, try the tune "Good King Wenceslas". When the original and its 
inversion are sung together, starting an octave apart and staggered with a 
time-delay of two beats, a pleasing canon results.) Finally, the most esoteric 
of "copies" is the retrograde copy-where the theme is played backwards in 
time. A canon which uses this trick is affectionately known as a crab canon, 
because of the peculiarities of crab locomotion. Bach included a crab canon 
in the Musical Offering, needless to say. Notice that every type of "copy" 
preserves all the information in the original theme, in the sense that the 
theme is fully recoverable from any of the copies. Such an information-
preserving transformation is often called an isomorphism, and we will have 
much traffic with isomorphisms in this book. 
Sometimes it is desirable to relax the tightness of the canon form. One 
way is to allow slight departures from perfect copying, for the sake of more 
fluid harmony. Also, some canons have "free" voices-voices which do not 
employ the canon's theme, but which simply harmonize agreeably with the 
voices that are in canon with each other. 
Each of the canons in the Musical Offering has for its theme a different 
variant of the King's Theme, and all the devices described above for 
making canons intricate are exploited to the hilt; in fact, they are occasion-
ally combined. Thus, one three-voice canon is labeled "Canon per 
Augmentationem, contrario Motu"; its middle voice is free (in fact, it sings 
the Royal Theme), while the other two dance canonically above and below 
it, using the devices of augmentation and inversion. Another bears simply 
the cryptic label "Quaerendo invenietis" ("By seeking, you will discover"). 
All of the canon puzzles have been solved. The canonical solutions were 
given by one of Bach's pupils, Johann Philipp Kirnberger. But one might 
still wonder whether there are more solutions to seek! 
I should also explain briefly what a fugue is. A fugue is like a canon, in 
that it is usually based on one theme which gets played in different voices 
and different keys, and occasionally at different speeds or upside down or 
backwards. However, the notion of fugue is much less rigid than that of 
canon, and consequently it allows for more emotional and artistic expres-
sion. The telltale sign of a fugue is the way it begins: with a single voice 
singing its theme. When it is done, then a second voice enters, either five 
scale-notes up, or four down. Meanwhile the first voice goes on, singing the 
"countersubject": a secondary theme, chosen to provide rhythmic, har-
monic, and melodic contrasts to the subject. Each of the voices enters in 
turn, singing the theme, often to the accompaniment of the countersubject 
in some other voice, with the remaining voices doing whatever fanciful 
things entered the composer's mind. When all the voices have "arrived", 
then there are no rules. There are, to be sure, standard kinds of things to 
do--but not so standard that one can merely compose a fugue by formula. 
The two fugues in the Musical Offering are outstanding examples of fugues 
that could never have been "composed by formula". There is something 
much deeper in them than mere fugality. 
All in all, the Musical Offering represents one of Bach's supreme ac-
complishments in counterpoint. It is itself one large intellectual fugue, in

which many ideas and forms have been woven together, and in which 
playful double meanings and subtle allusions are commonplace. And it is a 
very beautiful creation of the human intellect which we can appreciate 
forever. (The entire work is wonderfully described in the book]. S. Bach's 
Musical Offering, by H. T. David.) 
An Endlessly Rising Canon 
There is one canon in the Musical Offering which is particularly unusual. 
Labeled simply "Canon per Tonos", it has three voices. The uppermost 
voice sings a variant of the Royal Theme, while underneath it, two voices 
provide a canonic harmonization based on a second theme. The lower of 
this pair sings its theme in C minor (which is the key of the canon as a 
whole), and the upper of the pair sings the same theme displaced upwards 
in pitch by an interval of a fifth. What makes this canon different from any 
other, however, is that when it concludes-or, rather, seems to conclude-it 
is no longer in the key of C minor, but now is in D minor. Somehow Bach 
has contrived to modulate (change keys) right under the listener's nose. And 
it is so constructed that this "ending" ties smoothly onto the beginning 
again; thus one can repeat the process and return in the key of E, only to 
join again to the beginning. These successive modulations lead the ear to 
increasingly remote provinces of tonality, so that after several of them, one 
would expect to be hopelessly far away from the starting key. And yet 
magically, after exactly six such modulations, the original key of C minor 
has been restored! All the voices are exactly one octave higher than they 
were at the beginning, and here the piece may be broken off in a musically 
agreeable way. Such, one imagines, was Bach's intention; but Bach indubi-
tably also relished the implication that this process could go on ad 
infinitum, which is perhaps why he wrote in the margin "As the modulation 
rises, so may the King's Glory." To emphasize its potentially infinite aspect, 
I like to call this the "Endlessly Rising Canon". 
In this canon, Bach has given us our first example of the notion of 
Strange Loops. The "Strange Loop" phenomenon occurs whenever, by mov-
ing upwards (or downwards) through the levels of some hierarchical sys-
tem, we unexpectedly find ourselves right back where we started. (Here, 
the system is that of musical keys.) Sometimes I use the term Tangled 
Hierarchy to describe a system in which a Strange Loop occurs. As we go on, 
the theme of Strange Loops will recur again and again. Sometimes it will be 
hidden, other times it will be out in the open; sometimes it will be right side 
up, other times it will be upside down, or backwards. "Quaerendo in-
venietis" is my advice to the reader. 
Escher 
To my mind, the most beautiful and powerful visual realizations of this 
notion of Strange Loops exist in the work of the Dutch graphic artist M. C. 
Escher, who lived from 1902 to 1972. Escher was the creator of some of the

most intellectually stimulating drawings of all time. Many of them have 
their origin in paradox, illusion, or double-meaning. Mathematicians were 
among the first admirers of Escher's drawings, and this is understandable 
because they often are based on mathematical principles of symmetry or 
pattern ... But there is much more to a typical Escher drawing than just 
symmetry or pattern; there is often an underlying idea, realized in artistic 
form. And in particular, the Strange Loop is one of the most recurrent 
themes in Escher's work. Look, for example, at the lithograph Waterfall 
(Fig. 5), and compare its six-step endlessly falling loop with the six-step 
endlessly rising loop of the "Canon per Tonos". The similarity of vision is

remarkable. Bach and Escher are playing one single theme in two different 
"keys": music and art. 
Escher realized Strange Loops in several different ways, and they can 
be arranged according to the tightness of the loop. The lithograph Ascend-
ing and Descending (Fig. 6), in which monks trudge forever in loops, is the 
loosest version, since it involves "so many st~ps before the starting point is 
regained. A tighter loop is contained in Waterfall, which, as we already 
observed, involves only six discrete steps. You may be thinking that there is 
some ambiguity in the notion of a single "step"-for instance, couldn't 
Ascending and Descending be seen just as easily as having four levels (stair-
cases) as forty-five levels (stairs)? It is indeed true that there is an inherent

haziness in level-counting, not only in Escher pictures, but in hierarchical, 
many-level systems. We will sharpen our understanding of this haziness 
later on. But let us not get too distracted now! As we tighten our loop, we 
come to the remarkable Drawing Hands (Fig. 135), in which each of two 
hands draws the other: a two-step Strange Loop. And finally, the tightest of 
all Strange Loops is realized in P~'flt GaU(!ry (F'~g. 142): a picture of a picture 
which contains itself. Or is it a pictureo(a galiery which contains itself? Or 
of a town which contains itself? Or a young man who contains himself? 
(Incidentally, the illusion underlying Ascending and Descending and Waterfall 
'was not invented by Escher, but by Roger Penrose, a British mathematician, 
in 1958. However, the theme of the Strange Loop was already present in 
Escher's work in 1948, the year he drew Drawing Hands. Print Gallery dates 
from 1956.) 
1m plicit in the concept of Strange Loops is the concept of infinity, since 
what else is a loop but a way of representing an endless process in a finite 
way? And infinity plays a large role in many of Escher's drawings. Copies of 
one single theme often fit into each other, forming visual analogues to the 
canons of Bach. Several such patterns can be seen in Escher's famous print 
Metamorphosis (Fig. 8). It is a little like the "Endlessly Rising Canon": wan-
dering further and further from its starting point, it suddenly is back. In 
the tiled planes of Metamorphosis and other pictures, there are already 
suggestions of infinity. But wilder visions of infinity appear in other draw-
ings by Escher. In some of his drawings, one single theme can appear on 
different levels of reality. For instance, one level in a drawing might dearly 
be recognizable as representing fantasy or imagination; another level 
would be recognizable as reality. These two levels might be the only 
explicitly portrayed levels. But the mere presence of these two levels invites 
the viewer to look upon himself as part of yet another level; and by taking 
that step, the viewer cannot help getting caught up in Escher's implied 
chain of levels, in which, for anyone level, there is always another level 
above it of greater "reality", and likewise, there is always a level below, 
"more imaginary" than it is. This can be mind-boggling in itself. However, 
what happens if the chain of levels is not linear, but forms a loop? What is 
real, then, and what is fantasy? The genius of Escher was that he could not 
only concoct, but actually portray, dozens of half-real, half-mythical worlds, 
worlds filled with Strange Loops, which he seems to be inviting his viewers 
to enter. 
G6del 
In the examples we have seen of Strange Loops by Bach and Escher, there 
is a conflict between the finite and the infinite, and hence a strong sense of 
paradox. Intuition senses that there is something mathematical involved 
here. And indeed in our own century a mathematical counterpart was 
discovered, with the most enormous repercussions. And, just as the Bach 
and Escher loops appeal to very simple and ancient intuitions-a musical 
scale, a staircase-so this discovery, by K. Godel, of a Strange Loop in 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 
15 

FIGURE 9.

. 

mathematical systems has its origins in simple and ancient intuitions. In its 
absolutely barest form, Godel's discovery involves the translation of an 
ancient paradox in philosophy into mathematical terms. That paradox is 
the so-called Epimenides paradox, or liar paradox. Epimenides was a Cretan 
who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars." A sharper 
version of the statement is simply "I am lying"; or, "This statement is false". 
It is that last version which I will usuaIiy mean when I speak of the 
Epimenides paradox. It is a statement which rudely violates the usually 
assumed dichotomy of statements into true and false, because if you tenta-
tively think it is true, then it immediately backfires on you and makes you 
think it is false. But once you've decided it is false, a similar backfiring 
returns you to the idea that it must be true. Try it! 
The Epimenides paradox is a one-step Strange Loop, like Escher's 
Print Gallery. But how does it have to do with mathematics? That is what 
Godel discovered. His idea was to use mathematical reasoning in exploring 
mathematical reasoning itself. This notion of making mathematics "intro-
spective" proved to be enormously powerful, and perhaps its richest impli-
cation was the one Godel found: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. What 
the Theorem states and how it is proved are two different things. We shall 
discuss both in quite some detail in this book. The Theorem can De likened 
to a pearl, and the method of proof to an oyster. The pearl is prized for its 
luster and simplicity; the oyster is a complex living beast whose innards give 
rise to this mysteriously simple gem. 
Godel's Theorem appears as Proposition VI in his 1931 paper "On 
Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related 
Systems I." It states: 
To every w-consistent recursive class K of formulae there corre-
spond recursive class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor 
Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v is thefree variable of r). 
Actually, it was in German, and perhaps you feel that it might as well be in 
German anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English: 
All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory 
include undecidable propositions. 
This is the pearl. 
In this pearl it is hard to see a Strange Loop. That is because the 
Strange Loop is buried in the oyster-the proof. The proof of Godel's 
Incompleteness Theorem hinges upon the writing of a self-referential 
mathematical statement, in the same way as the Epimenides paradox is a 
self-referential statement of language. But whereas it is very simple to talk 
about language in language, it is not at all easy to see how a statement about 
numbers can talk about itself. In fact, it took genius merely to connect the 
idea of self-referential statements with number theory. Once Godel had the 
intuition that such a statement could be created, he was over the major 
hurdle. The actual creation of the statement was the working out of this 
one beautiful spark of intuition. 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 
17 

We shall examine the Godel construction quite carefully in Chapters to 
come, but so that you are not left completely in the dark, I will sketch here, 
in a few strokes, the core of the idea, hoping that what you see will trigger 
ideas in your mind. First of all, the difficulty should be made absolutely 
clear. Mathematical statements-let us concentrate on number-theoretical 
ones-are about properties of whole numbers. Whole numbers are not 
statements, nor are their properties. A statement of number theory is not 
about a statement of number theory; it just is a statement of number theory. 
This is the problem; but Godel n:alized that there was more here than 
meets the eye. 
Godel had the insight that a statement of number theory could be about 
a statement of number theory (possibly even itself), if only numbers could 
somehow stand for statements. The idea of a code, in other words, is at the 
heart of his construction. In the Godel Code, usually called "Godel-num-
bering", numbers are made to stand for symbols and sequences of symbols. 
That way, each statement of number theory, being a sequence of 
specialized symbols, acquires a Godel number, something like a telephone 
number or a license plate, by which it can be referred to. And this coding 
trick enables statements of number theory to be understood on two differ-
ent levels: as statements of number theory, and also as statements about 
statements of number theory. 
Once Godel had invented this coding scheme, he had to work out in 
detail a way of transporting the Epimenides paradox into a number-
theoretical formalism. His final transplant of Epimenides did not say, "This 
statement of number theory is false", but rather, "This statement of 
number theory does not have any proof". A great deal of confusion can be 
caused by this, because people generally understand the notion of "proof" 
rather vaguely. In fact, Godel's work was just part of a long attempt by 
mathematicians to explicate for themselves what proofs are. The important 
thing to keep in mind is that proofs are demonstrations within fixed systems of 
propositions. In the case of Godel's work, the fixed system of number-
theoretical reasoning to which the word "proof" refers is that of Principia 
Mathematica (P.M.), a giant opus by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North 
Whitehead, published between 1910 and 1913. Therefore, the Godel sen-
tence G should more properly be written in English as: 
This statement of number theory does not have any proof 
in the system of Principia Mathematica. 
Incidentally, this Godel sentence G is not Godel's Theorem-no more than 
the Epimenides sentence is the observation that "The Epimenides sentence 
is a paradox." We can now state what the effect of discovering Gis. 
Whereas the Epimenides statement creates a paradox since it is neither true 
nor false, the Godel sentence G is unprovable (inside P.M.) but true. The 
grand conclusion? That the system of Principia Mathematica is 
"incomplete"-there are true statements of number theory which its 
methods of proof are too weak to demonstrate. 
18 
Introduction: A Musico-LogicaJ Offering 

But if Principia Mathematica was the first victim of this stroke, it was 
certainly not the last! The phrase "and Related Systems" in the title of 
Godel's article is a telling one; for if Godel's result had merely pointed out a 
defect in the work of Russell and Whitehead, then others could have been 
inspired to improve upon P.M. and to outwit Godel's Theorem. But this 
was not possible: Godel's proof pertained to any axiomatic system which 
purported to achieve the aims which Whitehead and Russell had set for 
themselves. And for each different system, one basic method did the trick. 
In short, Godel showed that provability is a weaker notion than truth, no 
matter what axiomatic system is involved. 
Therefore Godel's Theorem had an electrifying effect upon logicians, 
mathematicians, and philosophers interested in the foundations of mathe-
matics, for it showed that no fixed system, no matter how complicated, 
could represent the complexity of the whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 
Modern readers may not be as nonplussed by this as readers of 1931 were, 
since in the interim our culture has absorbed Godel's Theorem, along with 
the conceptual revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics, and their 
philosophically disorienting messages have reached the public, even if 
cushioned by several layers of translation (and usually obfuscation). There 
is a general mood of expectation, these days, of "limitative" results-but 
back in 1931, this came as a bolt from the blue. 
Mathematical Logic: A Synopsis 
A proper appreciation of Godel's Theorem requires a setting of context. 
Therefore, I will now attempt to summarize in a short space the history of 
mathematical logic prior to 1931-an impossible task. (See DeLong, 
Kneebone, or Nagel and Newman, for good presentations of history.) It all 
began with the attempts to mechanize the thought processes of reasoning. 
Now our ability to reason has often been claimed to be what distinguishes 
us from other species; so it seems somewhat paradoxical, on first thought, 
to mechanize that which is most human. Yet even the ancient Greeks knew 
that reasoning is a patterned process, and is at least partially governed by 
statable laws. Aristotle codified syllogisms, and Euclid codified geometry; 
but thereafter, many centuries had to pass before progress in the study of 
axiomatic reasoning would take place again. 
One of the significant discoveries of nineteenth-century mathematics 
was that there are different, and equally valid, geometries-where by "a 
geometry" is meant a theory of properties of abstract points and lines. It 
had long been assumed that geometry was what Euclid had codified, and 
that, although there might be small flaws in Euclid's presentation, they 
were unimportant and any real progress in geometry would be achieved by 
extending Euclid. This idea was shattered by the roughly simultaneous 
discovery of non-Euclidean geometry by several people-a discovery that 
shocked the mathematics community, because it deeply challenged the idea 
that mathematics studies the real world. How could there be many differ-

19 

ent kinds of "points" and "lines" in one single reality? Today, the solution 
to the dilemma may be apparent, even to some nonmathematicians-but at 
the time, the dilemma created havoc in mathematical circles. 
Later in the nineteenth century, the English logicians George Boole 
and Augustus De Morgan went considerably further than Aristotle in 
codifying strictly deductive reasoning patterns. Boole even called his book 
"The Laws of Thought"-surely an exaggeration, but it was an important 
contribution. Lewis Carroll was fascinated by these mechanized reasoning 
methods, and invented many puzzles which could be solved with them. 
Gottlob Frege in Jena and Giuseppe Peano in Turin worked on combining 
formal reasoning with the study of sets and numbers. David Hilbert in 
Gottingen worked on stricter formalizations of geometry than Euclid's. All 
of these efforts were directed towards clarifying what one means by 
"proof". 
In the meantime, interesting developments were taking place in classi-
cal mathematics. A theory of different types of infinities, known as the 
theory of sets, was developed by Georg Cantor in the 1880's. The theory was 
powerful and beautiful, but intuition-defying. Before long, a variety of 
set-theoretical paradoxes had been unearthed. The situation was very 
disturbing, because just as mathematics seemed to be recovering from one 
set of paradoxes-those related to the theory of limits, in the calculus-
along came a whole new set, which looked worse! 
The most famous is Russell's paradox. Most sets, it would seem, are not 
members of themselves-for example, the set of walruses is not a walrus, 
the set containing only Joan of Arc is not Joan of Arc (a set is not a 
person)-and so on. In this respect, most sets are rather "run-of-the-mill". 
However, some "self-swallowing" sets do contain themselves as members, 
such as the set of all sets, or the set of all things except Joan of Arc, and so 
on. Clearly, every set is either run-of-the-mill or self-swallowing, and no set 
can be both. Now nothing prev(~nts us from inventing R: the set of all 
run-of-the-mill sets. At first, R might seem a rather run-of-the-mill 
invention-but that opinion must be revised when you ask yourself, "Is R 
itself a run-of-the-mill set or a self-swallowing set?" You will find that the 
answer is: "R is neither run-of-the-mill nor self-swallowing, for either 
choice leads to paradox." Try it! 
But if R is neither run-of-the-mill nor self-swallowing, then what is it? 
At the very least, pathological. But no one was satisfied with evasive answers 
of that sort. And so people began to dig more deeply into the foundations 
of set theory. The crucial questions seemed to be: "What is wrong with our 
intuitive concept of 'set'? Can we make a rigorous theory of sets which 
corresponds closely with our intuitions, but which skirts the paradoxes?" 
Here, as in number theory and geometry, the problem is in trying to line 
up intuition with formalized, or axiomatized, reasoning systems. 
A startling variant of Russetrs paradox, called "Grelling's paradox", 
can be made using adjectives instead of sets. Divide the adjectives in English 
into two categories: those which are self-descriptive, such as "pentasyl-
labic", "awkwardnessful", and "recherche", and those which are not, such 
20 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 

as "edible", "incomplete", and "bisyllabic". Now if we admit "non-self-
descriptive" as an adjective, to which class does it belong? If it seems 
questionable to include hyphenated words, we can use two terms invented 
specially for this paradox: auto logical (= "self-descriptive"), and heterological 
(= "non-self-descriptive"). The question then becomes: "Is 'heterological' 
heterological?" Try it! 
There seems to be one common culprit in these paradoxes, namely 
self-reference, or "Strange Loopiness". So if the goal is to ban all 
paradoxes, why not try banning self-reference and anything that allows it 
to arise? This is not so easy as it might seem, because it can be hard to figure 
out just where self-reference is occurring. It may be spread out over a 
whole Strange Loop with several steps, as in this "expanded" version of 
Epimenides, reminiscent of Drawing Hands: 
The following sentence is false. 
The preceding sentence is true. 
Taken together, these sentences have the same effect as the original 
Epimenides paradox; yet separately, they are harmless and even potentially. 
useful sentences. The "blame" for this Strange Loop can't be pinned on 
either sentence--only on the way they "point" at each other. In the same 
way, each local region of Ascending and Descending is quite legitimate; it is 
only the way they are globally put together that creates an impossibility. 
Since there are indirect as well as direct ways of achieving self-reference, 
one must figure out how to ban both types at once-if one sees self-
reference as the root of all evil. 
Banishing Strange Loops 
Russell and Whitehead did subscribe to this view, and accordingly, Principia 
Mathematica was a mammoth exercise in exorcising Strange Loops from 
logic, set theory, and number theory. The idea of their system was basically 
this. A set of the lowest "type" could contain only "objects" as members-
not sets. A set of the next type up could only contain objects, or sets of the 
lowest type. In general, a set of a given type could only contain sets of lower 
type, or objects. Every set would belong to a specific type. Clearly, no set 
could contain itself because it would have to belong to a type higher than its 
own type. Only "run-of-the-mill" sets exist in such a system; furthermore, 
old R-the set of all run-of-the-mill sets-no longer is considered a set at 
all, because it does not belong to any finite type. To all appearances, then, 
this theory of types, which we might also call the "theory of the abolition of 
Strange Loops", successfully rids set theory of its paradoxes, but only at the 
cost of introducing an artificial-seeming hierarchy, and of disallowing the 
formation of certain kinds of sets-such as the set of all run-of-the-mill sets. 
Intuitively, this is not the way we imagine sets. 
The theory of types handled Russell's paradox, but it did nothing 
about the Epimenides paradox or Grelling's paradox. For people whose 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 
21 

interest went no further than set theory, this was quite adequate-but for 
people interested in the elimination of paradoxes generally, some similar 
"hierarchization" seemed necessary, to forbid looping back inside lan-
guage. At the bottom of such a hierarchy would be an object language. Here, 
reference could be made only to a specific domain-not to aspects of the 
object language itself (such as its grammatical rules, or specific sentences in 
it). For that purpose there would be a metalanguage. This experience of two 
linguistic levels is familiar to all learners of foreign languages. Then there 
would be a metametalanguage for discussing the metalanguage, and so on. 
lt would be required that every sentence should belong to some precise 
level of the hierarchy. Therefore, if one could find no level in which a given 
utterance fit, then the utterance would be deemed meaningless, and forgot-
ten. 
An analysis can be attempted on the two-step Epimenides loop given 
above. The first sentence, since it speaks of the second, must be on a higher 
level than the second. But by the same token, the second sentence must be 
on a higher level than the first. Since this is impossible, the two sentences 
are "meaningless". More precisely, such sentences simply cannot be formu-
lated at all in a system based on a strict hierarchy of languages. This 
prevents all versions of the Epimenides paradox as well as Grelling's 
paradox. (To what language level could "heterological" belong?) 
Now in set theory, which deals with abstractions that we don't use all 
the time, a stratification like the theory of types seems acceptable, even if a 
little strange-but when it comes to language, an all-pervading part of life, 
such stratification appears absurd. We don't think of ourselves as jumping 
up and down a hierarchy of languages when we speak about various things. 
A rather matter-of-fact sentence such as, "In this book, I criticize the theory 
of types" would be doubly forbidden in the system we are discussing. 
Firstly, it mentions "this book", which should only be mentionable in a 
"metabook"-and secondly, it mentions me-a person whom I should not 
be allowed to speak of at all! This example points out how silly the theory of 
types seems, when you import it into a familiar context. The remedy it 
adopts for paradoxes-total banishment of self-reference in any form-is a 
real case of overkill, branding many perfectly good constructions as mean-
ingless. The adjective "meaningless", by the way, would have to apply to all 
discussions of the theory of linguistic types (such as that of this very 
paragraph) for they clearly could not occur on any of the levels-neither 
object language, nor metalanguage, nor metametalanguage, etc. So the 
very act of discussing the theory would be the most blatant possible viola-
tion of it! 
Now one could defend such theories by saying that they were only 
intended to deal with formal languages-not with ordinary, informal lan-
guage. This may be so, but then it shows that such theories are extremely 
academic and have little to say about paradoxes except when they crop up 
in special tailor-made systems. Besides, the drive to eliminate paradoxes at 
any cost, especially when it requires the creation of highly artificial for-
malisms, puts too much stress on bland consistency, and too little on the 
22

quirky and bizarre, which make life and mathematics interesting. It is of 
course important to try to maintain consistency, but when this effort forces 
you into a stupendously ugly theory, you know something is wrong. 
These types of issues in the foundations of mathematics were respon-
sible for the high interest in codifying human reasoning methods which 
was present in the early part of this century. Mathematicians and 
philosophers had begun to have serious doubts about whether even the 
most concrete of theories, such as the study of whole numbers (number 
theory), were built on solid foundations. If paradoxes could pop up so 
easily in set theory-a theory whose basic concept, that of a set, is surely 
very intuitively appealing-then might they not also exist in other branches 
of mathematics? Another related worry was that the paradoxes of logic, 
such as the Epimenides paradox, might turn out to be internal to mathe-
matics, and thereby cast in doubt all of mathematics. This was especially 
worrisome to those-and there were a good number-who firmly believed 
that mathematics is simply a branch of logic (or conversely, that logic is 
simply a branch of mathematics). In fact, this very question-"Are mathe-
matics and logic distinct, or separate?"-was the source of much con-
troversy. 
This study of mathematics itself became known as metamathematics-<Jr 
occasionally, metalogic, since mathematics and logic are so intertwined. The 
most urgent priority of metamathematicians was to determine the true 
nature of mathematical reasoning. What is a legal method of procedure, 
and what is an illegal one? Since mathematical reasoning had always been 
done in "natural language" (e.g., French or Latin or some language for 
normal communication), there was always a lot of possible ambiguity. 
Words had different meanings to different people, conjured up different 
images, and so forth. It seemed reasonable and even important to establish 
a single uniform notation in which all mathematical work could be done, 
and with the aid of which any two mathematicians could resolve disputes 
over whether a suggested proof was valid or not. This would require a 
complete codification of the universally acceptable modes of human 
reasoning, at least as far as they applied to mathematics. 
Consistency, Completeness, Hilbert's Program 
This was the goal of Principia Mathematica, which purported to derive all of 
mathematics from logic, and, to be sure, without contradictions! It was 
widely admired, but no one was sure if (1) all of mathematics really was 
contained in the methods delineated by Russell and Whitehead, or (2) the 
methods given were even self-consistent. Was it absolutely clear that con-
tradictory results could never be derived, by any mathematicians what-
soever, following the methods of Russell and Whitehead? 
This question particularly bothered the di~tinguished German 
mathematician (and metamathematician) David Hilbert, who set before the 
world community of mathematicians (and metamathematicians) this chal-
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 
23 

lenge: to demonstrate rigorously-perhaps following the very methods 
outlined by Russell and Whitehead-that the system defined in Principia 
Mathematica was both consistent (contradiction-free), and complete (i.e., that 
every true statement of number theory could be derived within the 
framework drawn up in P.M.). This was a tall order, and one could criticize 
it on the grounds that it was somewhat circular: how can you justify your 
methods of reasoning on the basis of those same methods of reasoning? It 
is like lifting yourself up by your own bootstraps. (We just don't seem to be 
able to get away from these Strange Loops!) 
Hilbert was fully aware of this dilemma, of course, and therefore 
expressed the hope that a demonstration of consistency or completeness 
could be found which depended only on "finitistic" modes of reasoning. 
These were a small set of rea~oning methods usually accepted by 
mathematicians. In this way, Hilbert hoped that mathematicians could 
partially lift themselves by their own bootstraps: the sum total of mathemat-
ical methods might be proved sound, by invoking only a smaller set of 
methods. This goal may sound rather esoteric, but it occupied the minds of 
many of the greatest mathematicians in the world during the first thirty 
years of this century. 
In the thirty-first year, however, Godel published his paper, which in 
some ways utterly demolished Hilbert's program. This paper revealed not 
only that there were irreparable "holes" in the axiomatic system proposed 
by Russell and Whitehead, but more generally, that no axiomatic system 
whatsoever could produce all number-theoretical truths, unless it were an 
inconsistent system! And finally, the hope of proving the consistency of a 
system such as that presented inP .• \{. was shown to be vain: if such a proof 
could be found using only methods inside P.M., then-and this is one of 
the most mystifying consequences of Godel's work-P.M. itself would be 
inconsistent! 
The final irony of it all is that the proof of Godel's Incompleteness 
Theorem involved importing the Epimenides paradox right into the heart 
of Principia Mathematica, a bastion supposedly invulnerable to the attacks of 
Strange Loops! Although Godel's Strange Loop did not destroy Principia 
Mathematica, it made it far less interesting to mathematicians, for it showed 
that Russell and Whitehead's original aims were illusory. 
Babbage, Computers, Artificial Intelligence ... 
When Godel's paper came out, the world was on the brink of developing 
electronic digital computers. Now the idea of mechanical calculating en-
gines had been around for a while. In the seventeenth century, Pascal and 
Leibniz designed machines to perform fixed operations (addition and 
multiplication). These machines had no memory, however, and were not, 
in modern parlance, programmable. 
The first human to conceive of the immense computing potential of 
machinery was the Londoner Charles Babbage (1792-1871), A character 
who could almost have stepped out of the pages of the Pickwick Papers, 
24 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 

Babbage was most famous during his lifetime for his vigorous campaign to 
rid London of "street nuisances"-organ grinders above all. These pests, 
loving to get his goat, would come and serenade him at any time of day or 
night, and he would furiously chase them down the street. Today, we 
recognize in Babbage a man a hundred years ahead of his time: not only 
inventor of the basic principles of modern computers, he was also one of 
the first to battle noise poll ution. 
His first machine, the "Difference Engine", could generate mathemati-
cal tables of many kinds by the "method of differences". But before any 
model of the "D.E." had been built, Babbage became obsessed with a much 
more revolutionary idea: his "Analytical Engine". Rather immodestly, he 
wrote, "The course through which I arrived at it was the most entangled 
and perplexed which probably ever occupied the human mind."4 Unlike 
any previously designed machine, the A.E. was to possess both a "store" 
(memory) and a "mill" (calculating and decision-making unit). These units 
were to be built of thousands of intricate geared cylinders interlocked in 
incredibly complex ways. Babbage had a vision of numbers swirling in and 
out of the mill under control of a program contained in punched cards-an 
idea inspired by the Jacquard loom, a card-controlled loom that wove 
amazingly complex patterns. Babbage's brilliant but ill-fated Countess 
friend, Lady Ada Lovelace (daughter of Lord Byron), poetically com-
mented that "the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the 
Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves." Unfortunately, her use of the 
present tense was misleading, for no A.E. was ever built, and Babbage died 
a bitterly disappointed man. 
Lady Lovelace, no less than Babbage, was profoundly aware that with 
the invention of the Analytical Engine, mankind was flirting with 
mechanized intelligence-particularly if the Engine were capable of "eating 
its own tail" (the way Babbage described the Strange Loop created when a 
machine reaches in and alters its own stored program). In an 1842 
memoir,s she wrote that the A.E. "might act upon other things besides 
number". While Babbage dreamt of creating a chess or tic-tac-toe automa-
ton, she suggested that his Engine, with pitches and harmonies coded into 
its spinning cylinders, "might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of 
music of any degree of complexity or extent." In nearly the same breath, 
however, she cautions that "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions 
whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to 
perform." Though she well understood the power of artificial computa-
tion, Lady Lovelace was skeptical about the artificial creation of intelli-
gence. However, could her keen insight allow her to dream of the potential 
that would be opened up with the taming of electricity? 
In our century the time was ripe for computers--computers beyond 
the wildest dreams of Pascal, Leibniz, Babbage, or Lady Lovelace. In the 
1930's and 1940's, the first "giant electronic brains" were designed and 
built. They catalyzed the convergence of three previously disparate areas: 
the theory of axiomatic reasoning, the study of mechanical computation, 
and the psychology of intelligence. 
These same years saw the theory of computers develop by leaps and 
Introduction: A Musico-LogicaJ Offering 
25 

bounds. This theory was tightly linked to metamathematics. In fact, Godel's 
Theorem has a counterpart in the theory of computation, discovered by 
Alan Turing, which reveals the existence of ineluctable "holes" in even the 
most powerful computer imaginable. Ironically, just as these somewhat 
eerie limits were being mapped out, real computers were being built whose 
powers seemed to grow and grow beyond their makers' power of prophecy. 
Babbage, who once declared he would gladly give up the rest of his life if he 
could come back in five hundred years and have a three-day guided 
scientific tour of the new age, would probably have been thrilled speechless 
a mere century after his death-both by the new machines, and by their 
unexpected limitations. 
By the early 1950's, mechanized intelligence seemed a mere stone's 
throwaway; and yet, for each barrier crossed, there always cropped up 
some new barrier to the actual creation of a genuine thinking machine. Was 
there some deep reason for this goal's mysterious recession? 
No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior 
and intelligent behavior lies; in fact, to suggest that a sharp borderline 
exists is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly: 
to respond to situations very flexibly; 
to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances; 
to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages; 
to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a 
situation; 
to find similarities between situations despite differences which 
may separate them; 
to draw distinctions between ~ituations despite similarities which 
may link them; 
to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting 
them together in new ways; 
to come up with ideas which are novel. 
Here one runs up against a seeming paradox. Computers by their very 
nature are the most inflexible, desireless, rule-following of beasts. Fast 
though they may be, they are nonetheless the epitome of unconsciousness. 
How, then, can intelligent behavior be programmed? Isn't this the most 
blatant of contradictions in terms? One of the major theses of this book is 
that it is not a contradiction at all. One of the major purposes of this book is 
to urge each reader to confront the apparent contradiction head on, to 
savor it, to turn it over, to take it apart, to wallow in it, so that in the end the 
reader might emerge with new imights into the seemingly unbreachable 
gulf between the formal and the informal, the animate and the inanimate, 
the flexible and the inflexible. 
This is what Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is all about. And the 
strange flavor of AI work is that people try to put together long sets of rules 
in strict formalisms which tell inflexible machines how to be flexible. 
What sorts of "rules" could possibly capture all of what we think of as 
intelligent behavior, however? Certainly there must be rules on all sorts of 
26 
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 

different levels. There must be many "just plain" rules. There must be 
"metarules" to modify the 'Just plain" rules; then "metametarules" to 
modify the metarules, and so on. The flexibility of intelligence comes from 
the enormous number of different rules, and levels of rules. The reason 
that so many rules on so many different levels must exist is that in life, a 
creature is faced with millions of situations of completely different types. In 
some situations, there are stereotyped responses which require 'Just plain" 
rules. Some situations are mixtures of stereotyped situations-thus they 
require rules for deciding which of the ''just plain" rules to apply. Some 
situations cannot be classified-thus there must exist rules for inventing 
new rules ... and on and on. Without doubt, Strange Loops involving rules 
that change themselves, directly or indirectly, are at the core of intelligence. 
Sometimes the complexity of our minds seems so overwhelming that one 
feels that there can be no solution to the problem of understanding 
intelligence-that it is wrong to think that rules of any sort govern a 
creature's behavior, even if one takes "rule" in the multilevel sense de-
scribed above. 
. .. and Bach 
In the year 1754, four years after the death of J. S. Bach, the Leipzig 
theologian Johann Michael Schmidt wrote, in a treatise on music and the 
soul, the following noteworthy passage: 
Not many years ago it was reported from France that a man had made a 
statue that could play various pieces on the Fleuttraversiere, placed the flute to 
its lips and took it down again, rolled its eyes, etc. But no one has yet invented 
an image that thinks, or wills, or composes, or even does anything at all 
similar. Let anyone who wishes to be convinced look carefully at the last fugal 
work of the above-praised Bach, which has appeared in copper engraving, 
but which was left unfinished because his blindness intervened, and let him 
observe the art that is contained therein; or what must strike him as even 
more wonderful, the Chorale which he dictated in his blindness to the pen of 
another: Wenn wir in hOchsten Nothen seyn. I am sure that he will soon need his 
soul if he wishes to observe all the beauties contained therein, let alone wishes 
to play it to himself or to form a judgment of the author. Everything that the 
champions of Materialism put forward must fall to the ground in view of this 
single example. 6 
Quite likely, the foremost of the "champions of Materialism" here 
alluded to was none other than Julien Offroy de la Mettrie-philosopher at 
the court of Frederick the Great, author of L'homme machine ("Man, the 
Machine"), and Materialist Par Excellence. It is now more than 200 years 
later, and the battle is still raging between those who agree with Johann 
Michael Schmidt, and those who agree with Julien Offroy de la Mettrie. I 
hope in this book to give some perspective on the battle. 
"G6del, Escher, Bach" 
The book is structured in an unusual way: as a counterpoint between 
Dialogues and Chapters. The purpose of this structure is to allow me to 
Introduction: A Musko-Logical Offering 
27 

present new concepts twice: almost every new concept is first presented 
metaphorically in a Dialogue, yielding a set of concrete, visual images; then 
these serve, during the reading of the following Chapter, as an intuitive 
background for a more serious and abstract presentation of the same 
concept. In many of the Dialogues I appear to be talking about one idea on 
the surface, but in reality I am talking about some other idea, in a thinly 
disguised way. 
Originally, the only characters in my Dialogues were Achilles and the 
Tortoise, who came to me from Zeno of Elea, by way of Lewis Carroll. Zeno 
of Elea, inventor of paradoxes, liv(~d in the fifth century B.C. One of his 
paradoxes was an allegory, with Achilles and the Tortoise as protagonists. 
Zeno's invention of the happy pair is told in my first Dialogue, Three-Part 
Invention. In 1895, Lewis Carroll reincarnated Achilles and the Tortoise for 
the purpose of illustrating his own new paradox of infinity. Carroll's 
paradox, which deserves to be far b(~tter known than it is, plays a significant 
role in this book. Originally titled "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles", it is 
reprinted here as Two-Part Invention. 
When I began writing Dialogues, somehow I connected them up with 
musical forms. I don't remember the moment it happened; I just re-
member one day writing "Fugue" above an early Dialogue, and from then 
on the idea stuck. Eventually I decided to pattern each Dialogue in one way 
or another on a different piece by Bach. This was not so inappropriate. Old 
Bach himself used to remind his pupils that the separate parts in their 
compositions should behave like "persons who conversed together as if in a 
select company". I have taken that suggestion perhaps rather more literally 
than Bach intended it; nevertheless I hope the result is faithful to the 
meaning. I have been particularly inspired by aspects of Bach's composi-
tions which have struck me over and over, and which are so well described 
by David and Mendel in The Bach Reader: 
His form in general was based on relations between separate sections. These 
relations ranged from complete identity of passages on the one hand to the 
return of a single principle of elaboration or a mere thematic allusion on the 
other. The resulting patterns were often symmetrical, but by no means 
necessarily so. Sometimes the relations between the various sections make up 
a maze of interwoven threads that only detailed analysis can unravel. Usually, 
however, a few dominant features afford proper orientation at first sight or 
hearing, and while in the course of study one may discover unending sub-
tleties, one is never at a loss to grasp the unity that holds together every single 
creation by Bach.6 
I have sought to weave an Eternal Golden Braid out of these three 
strands: Godel, Escher, Bach. I began, intending to write an essay at the 
core of which would be Godel's Theorem. I imagined it would be a mere 
pamphlet. But my ideas expanded like a sphere, and soon touched Bach 
and Escher. It took some time for me to think of making this connection 
explicit, instead of just letting it be a private motivating force. But finally I 
realized that to me, Godel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in 
different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the 
central object, and came up with this book.

Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 

Three-Part Invention 
Achilles (a Greek warrior, the fleetest of foot of all mortals) and a Tortoise 
are standing together on a dusty runway in the hot sun. Far down the 
runway, on a tall flagpole, there hangs a large rectangular flag. The flag 
is solid red, except where a thin ring-shaped hole has been cut out of it, 
through which one can see the sky. 
Achilles: 
What is that strange flag down at the other end of the track? It 
reminds me somehow of a print by my favorite artist, M. C. Escher. 
Tortoise: 
That is Zeno's flag. 
Achilles: 
Could it be that the hole in it resembles the holes in a Mobius 
strip Escher once drew? Something is wrong about that flag, I can tell. 
Tortoise: 
The ring which has been cut from it has the shape of the numeral 
for zero, which is Zeno's favorite number. 
Achilles: 
But zero hasn't been invented yet! It will only be invented by a 
Hindu mathematician some millennia hence. And thus, Mr. T, my 
argument proves that such a flag is impossible. 
Tortoise: 
Your argument is persuasive, Achilles, and I must agree that 
such a flag is indeed impossible. But it is beautiful anyway, is it not? 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes, there is no doubt of its beauty. 
Tortoise: 
I wonder if its beauty is related to its impossibility. I don't know; 
I've never had the time to analyze Beauty. It's a Capitalized Essence; 
and I never seem to have the time for Capitalized Essences. 
Achilles: 
Speaking of Capitalized Essences, Mr. T, have you ever won-
dered about the Purpose of Life? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, heavens, no. 
Achilles: 
Haven't you ever wondered why we are here, or who invented 
us? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, that is quite another matter. We are inventions of Zeno (as 
you will shortly see); and the reason we are here is to have a footrace. 
Achilles: 
A footrace? How outrageous! Me, the fleetest of foot of all mor-
tals, versus you, the ploddingest of all plodders! There can be no point 
to such a race. 
Tortoise: 
You might give me a head start. 
Achilles: 
It would have to be a huge one. 
Tortoise: 
I don't object. 
Achilles: 
But I will catch you, sooner or later-most likely sooner. 
Tortoise: 
Not if things go according to Zeno's paradox, you won't. Zeno is 
hoping to use our footrace to show that motion is impossible, you see. 
It is only in the mind that motion seems possible, according to Zeno. In 
truth, Motion Is Inherently Impossible. He proves it quite elegantly.

FIGURE 10. Mobius Strip I, by M. C. E,cher (wood-engraving printedfromfour blocks, 
1961). 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes, it comes back to me now: the famous Zen koan about 
Zen Master Zeno. As you say, it is very simple indeed. 
Tortoise: 
Zen koan? Zen Master? What do you mean? 
Achilles: 
It goes like this: Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said, 
"The flag is moving." The other said, "The wind is moving." The sixth 
patriarch, Zeno, happened to be passing by. He told them, "Not the 
wind, not the flag; mind is moving." 
Tortoise: 
I am afraid you are a little befuddled, Achilles. Zeno is no Zen 
master; far from it. He is, in fact, a Greek philosopher from the town 
of Elea (which lies halfway between points A and B). Centuries hence, 
he will be celebrated for his paradoxes of motion. In one of those 
paradoxes, this very footrace between you and me will playa central 
role. 
Achilles: 
I'm all confused. I remember vividly how I used to repeat over 
and over the names of the six patriarchs of Zen, and I always said, 
"The sixth patriarch is Zeno, the sixth patriarch is Zeno ... " (Suddenly 
a soft warm breeze picks up.) Oh, look, Mr. Tortoise-look at the flag 
waving! How I love to watch the ripples shimmer through its soft 
fabric. And the ring cut out of it is waving, too!

Three-Part Invention 

Tortoise: 
Don't be silly. The flag is impossible, hence it can't be waving. 
The wind is waving. 
(At this moment, Zeno happens by.) 
Zeno: 
Hallo! Hulloo! What's up? What's new? 
Achilles: 
The flag is moving. 
Tortoise: 
The wind is moving. 
Zeno: 
0 Friends, Friends! Cease your argumentation! Arrest your vit-
riolics! Abandon your discord! For I shall resolve the issue for you 
forthwith. Ho! And on such a fine day! 
Achilles: 
This fellow must be playing the fool. 
Tortoise: 
No, wait, Achilles. Let us hear what he has to say. Oh, Unknown 
Sir, do impart to us your thoughts on this matter. 
Zeno: 
Most willingly. Not the wind, not the flag-neither one is moving, 
nor is anything moving at all. For I have discovered a great Theorem, 
which states: "Motion Is Inherently Impossible." And from this 
Theorem follows an even greater Theorem-Zeno's Theorem: 
"Motion Unexists." 
Achilles: 
"Zeno's Theorem"? Are you, sir, by any chance, the philosopher 
Zeno of Elea? 
Zeno: 
I am indeed, Achilles. 
Achilles (scratching his head in puzzlement): 
Now how did he know my name? 
Zeno: 
Could I possibly persuade you two to hear me out as to why this is 
the case? I've come all the way to Elea from point A this afternoon,just 
trying to find someone who'll pay some attention to my closely honed 
argument. But they're all hurrying hither and thither, and they don't 
have time. You've no idea how disheartening it is to meet with refusal 
after refusal. Oh, but I'm sorry to burden you with my troubles. I'djust 
like to ask one thing: Would the two of you humor a silly old 
philosopher for a few moments---only a few, I promise you-in his 
eccentric theories? 
Achilles: 
Oh, by all means! Please do illuminate us! I know I speak for both 
of us, since my companion, Mr. Tortoise, was only moments ago 
speaking of you with great veneration-and he mentioned especially 
your paradoxes. 
Zeno: 
Thank you. You see, my Master, the fifth patriarch, taught me that 
reality is one, immutable, and unchanging; all plurality, change, and 
motion are mere illusions of the senses. Some have mocked his views; 
but I will show the absurdity of their mockery. My argument is quite 
simple. I will illustrate it with two characters of my own Invention: 
Achilles (a Greek warrior, the fleetest of foot of all mortals), and a 
Tortoise. In my tale, they are persuaded by a· passerby to run a 
footrace down a runway towards a distant flag waving in the breeze. 
Let us assume that, since the Tortoise is a much slower runner, he gets 
a head start of, say, ten rods. Now the race begins. In a few bounds, 
Achilles has reached the spot where the Tortoise started. 
Three-Part Invention 
31 

Achilles: 
Hah! 
Zeno: 
And now the Tortoise is but a single rod ahead of Achilles. Within 
only a moment, Achilles has attained that spot. 
Achilles: 
Ho hot 
Zeno: 
Yet, in that short moment, the Tortoise has managed to advance a 
slight amount. In a flash, Achilles covers that distance, too. 
Achilles: 
Hee hee heel 
Zeno: 
But in that very short flash, the Tortoise has managed to inch ahead 
by ever so little, and so Achilles is still behind. Now you see that in 
order for Achilles to catch the Tmtoise, this game of "try-to-catch-me" 
will have to be played an INFINITE number of times-and therefore 
Achilles can NEVER catch up with the Tortoise! 
Tortoise: 
Heh heh heh heh! 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... hmm ... hmm ... hmm ... hmm ... That argument sounds 
wrong to me. And yet, I can't quite make out what's wrong with it. 
leno: 
Isn't it a teaser? It's my favorite paradox. 
Tortoise: 
Excuse me, Zeno, but I believe your tale illustrates the wrong 
principle, does it not? You have just told us what will come to be 
known, centuries hence, as Zeno's "Achilles paradox", which shows 
(ahem!) that Achilles will never catch the Tortoise; but the proof that 
Motion Is Inherently Impossible (and thence that Motion Unexists) is 
your "dichotomy p~radox", isn't that so? 
Zeno: 
Oh, shame on me. Of course, you're right. That's the one about 
how, in getting from A to B, one has to go halfway first-and of that 
stretch one also has to go halfway, and so on and so forth. But you see, 
both those paradoxes really have the same flavor. Frankly, I've only 
had one Great Idea-I just exploit it in different ways. 
Achilles: 
I swear, these arguments contain a flaw. I don't quite see where, 
but they cannot be correct. 
Zeno: 
You doubt the validity of my paradox? Why not just try it out? You 
see that red flag down there, at the far end of the runway? 
Achilles: 
The impossible one, based on an Escher print? 
Zeno: 
Exactly. What do you say to you and Mr. Tortoise racing for it, 
allowing Mr. T a fair head start of, well, I don't know-
Tortoise: 
How about ten rods? 
Zeno: 
Very good-ten rods. 
Achilles: 
Any time. 
Zeno: 
Excellent! How exciting! An empirical test of my rigorously proven 
Theorem! Mr. Tortoise, will you position yourself ten rods upwind? 
(The Tortoise moves ten rods closer to the flag.) 
Are you both ready? 
Tortoise and Achilles: 
Ready! 
Zeno: 
On your mark! Get set! Go!

CHAPTER 
The MU-puzzle 
Formal Systems 
ONE OF THE most central notions in this book is that of a formal system. The 
type of formal system I use was invented by the American logician Emil 
Post in the 1920's, and is often called a "Post production system". This 
Chapter introduces you to a formal system and moreover, it is my hope that 
you will want to explore this formal system at least a little; so to provoke 
your curiosity, I have posed a little puzzle. 
"Can you produce MU?" is the puzzle. To begin with, you will be 
supplied with a string (which means a string of letters). * Not to keep you in 
suspense, that string will be Ml. Then you will be told some rules, with 
which you can change one string into another. If one of those rules is 
applicable at some point, and you want to use it, you may, but-there is 
nothing that will dictate which rule you should use, in case there are several 
applicable rules. That is left up to you-and of course, that is where playing 
the game of any formal system can become something of an art. The major 
point, which almost doesn't need stating, is that you must not do anything 
which is outside the rules. We might call this restriction the "Requirement 
of Formality". In the present Chapter, it probably won't need to be stressed 
at all. Strange though it may sound, though, I predict that when you play 
around with some of the formal systems of Chapters to come, you will find 
yourself violating the Requirement of Formality over and over again, 
unless you have worked with formal systems before. 
The first thing to say about our formal system-the MIU-system-is that 
it utilizes only three letters of the alphabet: M, I, U. That means that"the 
only strings of the MIU-system are strings which are composed of those 
three letters. Below are some strings of the MIU-system: 
MU 
UIM 
MUUMUU 
UIIUMIUUIMUIIUMIUUIMUIIU 
>I< In this book, we shall employ the following conventions when we refer to strings. When 
the string is in the same typeface as the text, then it will be enclosed in single or double quotes. 
Punctuation which belongs to the sentence and not to the string under discussion will go 
outside of the quotes, as logic dictates. For example, the first letter of this sentence is 'F', while 
the first letter of 'this sentence'·is 't'. When the string is in Quadrata Roman, however, quotes 
will usually be left off, unless clarity demands them. For example, the first letter of Quadrata 
is Q. 
The MU-puzzle 
33 

But although all of these are legitimate strings, they are not strings which 
are "in your possession". In fact, the only string in your possession so far is 
MI. Only by using the rules, about to be introduced, can you enlarge your 
private collection. Here is the first rule: 
RULE I: If you possess a string whose last letter is 1, you can add on a U at 
the end. 
By the way, if up to this point you had not guessed it, a fact about the 
meaning of "string" is that the letters are in a fixed order. For example, MI 
and 1M are two different strings. A string of symbols is not just a "bag" of 
symbols, in which the order doesn't make any difference. 
Here is the second rule: 
RULE II: 
Suppose you have Mx. Then you may add Mxx to your collec-
tion. 
What I mean by this is shown below, in a few examples. 
From MIU, you may get MIUIU. 
From MUM, you may get MUMUM. 
From MU, you may get MUU. 
So the letter 'x' in the rule simply stands for any string; but once you have 
decided which string it stands for, you have to stick with your choice (until 
you use the rule again, at which point you may make a new choice). Notice 
the third example above. It shows how, once you possess MU, you can add 
another string to your collection; but you have to get MU first! I want to 
add one last comment about the letter 'x': it is not part of the formal system 
in the same way as the three letters 'M', 'I', and 'U' are. It is useful for us, 
though, to have some way to talk in general about strings of the system, 
symbolically-and that is the function of the 'x'; to stand for an arbitrary 
string. If you ever add a string containing an 'x' to your "collection", you 
have done something wrong, because strings of the MIU-system never 
contain "x" 's! 
Here is the third rule: 
RULE III: If III occurs in one of the strings in your collection, you may 
make a new string with U in place of III. 
Examples: 
From UMIIIMU, you could make UMUMU. 
From MIIII, you could make MIU (also MUI). 
From IIMII, you can't get anywhere using this rule. 
(The three I's have to be consecutive.) 
From Mlil, make MU. 
Don't, under any circumstances, think you can run this rule backwards, as 
in the following example: 
34 
The MU-puzzJe 

From MU, make Mill. 
¢: This is wrong. 
Rules are one-way. 
Here is the final rule: 
RULE IV: If UU occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it. 
From UUU, get U. 
From MUUUIII, get MUIII. 
There you have it. Now you may begin trying to make MU. Don't worry if 
you don't get it. Just try it out a bit-the main thing is for you to get the 
flavor of this MU-puzzle. Have fun. 
Theorems, Axioms, Rules 
The answer to the MU-puzzle appears later in the book. For now, what is 
important is not finding the answer, but looking for it. You probably have 
made some attempts to produce MU. In so doing, you have built up your 
own private collection of strings. Such strings, producible by the rules, are 
called theorems. The term "theorem" has, of course, a common usage in 
mathematics which is quite different from this one. It means some state-
ment in ordinary language which has been proven to be true by a rigorous 
argument, such as Zeno's Theorem about the "unexistence" of motion, or 
Euclid's Theorem about the infinitude of primes. But in formal systems, 
theorems need not be thought of as statements-they are merely strings of 
symbols. And instead of being proven, theorems are merely produced, as ifby 
machine, according to certain typographical rules. To emphasize this im-
portant distinction in meanings for the word "theorem", I will adopt the 
following convention in this book: when "theorem" is capitalized, its mean-
ing will be the everyday one-a Theorem is a statement in ordinary lan-
guage which somebody once proved to be true by some sort of logical 
argument. When uncapitalized, "theorem" will have its technical meaning: 
a string producible in some formal system. In these terms, the MU-puzzle 
asks whether MU is a theorem of the MIU-system. 
I gave you a theorem for free at the beginning, namely MI. Such a 
"free" theorem is called an axiom-the technical meaning again being quite 
different from the usual meaning. A formal system may have zero, one, 
several, or even infinitely many axioms. Examples of all these types will 
appear in the book. 
Every formal system has symbol-shunting rules, such as the four rules 
of the MIU-system. These rules are called either rules of production or rules of 
inference. I will use both terms. 
The last term which I wish to introduce at this point is derivation. 
Shown below is a derivation of the theorem MUIIU: 
(1) 
MI 
(2) 
MIl 
The MU-puzzle 
axiom 
from (1) by rule II 
35 

(3) 
MIIII 
(4) 
MIIIIU 
(5) 
MUIU 
(6) 
MUIUUIU 
(7) 
MUIIU 
from (2) by rule II 
from (3) by rule I 
from (4) by rule III 
from (5) by rule II 
from (6) by rule IV 
A derivation of a theorem is an explicit, line-by-line demonstration of how 
to produce that theorem according to the rules of the formal system. The 
concept of derivation is modeled on that of proof, but a derivation is an 
austere cousin of a proof. It would sound strange to say that you had proven 
MUIIU, but it does not sound so strange to say you have derived MUIIU. 
Inside and Outside the System 
Most people go about the MV-puzzle by deriving a number of theorems, 
quite at random, just to see what kind of thing turns up. Pretty soon, they 
begin to notice some properties of the theorems they have made; that is 
where human intelligence enters the picture. For instance, it was probably 
not obvious to you that all theorems would begin with M, until you had 
tried a few. Then, the pattern emerged, and not only could you see the 
pattern, but you could understand it by looking at the rules, which have the 
property that they make each new theorem inherit its first letter from an 
earlier theorem; ultimately, then, all theorems' first letters can be traced 
back to the first letter of the sole axiom MI-and that is a proof that 
theorems of the MIV-system must all begin with M. 
There is something very significant about what has happened here. It 
shows one difference between people and machines. It would certainly be 
possible-in fact it would be very easy-to program a computer to generate 
theorem after theorem of the Ml V-system; and we could include in the 
program a command to stop only upon generating U. You now know that a 
computer so programmed would ne"er stop. And this does not amaze you. 
But what if you asked a friend to try to generate U? It would not surprise 
you if he came back after a while, complaining that he can't get rid of the 
initial M, and therefore it is a wild goose chase. Even if a person is not very 
bright, he still cannot help making some observations about what he is 
doing, and these observations give him good insight into the task-insight 
which the computer program, as we have described it, lacks. 
Now let me be very explicit about what I meant by saying this shows a 
difference between people and machines. I meant that it is possible to 
program a machine to do a routine task in such a way that the machine will 
never notice even the most obvious facts about what it is doing; but it is 
inherent in human consciousness to notice some facts about the things one 
is doing. But you knew this all along. If you punch "1" into an adding 
machine, and then add 1 to it, and then add 1 again, and again, and again, 
and continue doing so for hours and hours, the machine will never learn to 
anticipate you, and do it itself, although any person would pick up the 
36 
The MU-puzzle 

repetitive behavior very quickly. Or, to take a silly example, a car will never 
pick up the idea, no matter how much or how well it is driven, that it is 
supposed to avoid other cars and obstacles on the road; and it will never 
learn even the most frequently traveled routes of its owner. 
The difference, then, is that it is possible for a machine to act unobserv-
ant; it is impossible for a human to act unobservant. Notice I am not saying 
that all machines are necessarily incapable of making sophisticated observa-
tions; just that some machines are. Nor am I saying that all people are 
always making sophisticated observations; people, in fact, are often very 
unobservant. But machines can be made to be totally unobservant; and 
people cannot. And in fact, most machines made so far are pretty close to 
being totally unobservant. Probably for this reason, the property of being 
unobservant seems to be the characteristic feature of machines, to most 
people. For example, if somebody says that some task is "mechanical", it 
does not mean that people are incapable of doing the task; it implies, 
though, that only a machine could do it over and over without ever 
complaining, or feeling bored. 
Jumping out of the System 
It is an inherent property of intelligence that it can jump out of the task 
which it is performing, and survey what it has done; it is always looking for, 
and often finding, patterns. Now I said that an intelligence canjump out of 
its task, but that does not mean that it always will. However, a little prompt-
ing will often suffice. For example, a human being who is reading a book 
may grow sleepy. Instead of continuing to read until the book is finished, 
he is just as likely to put the book aside and turn off the light. He has 
stepped "out of the system" and yet it seems the most natural thing in the 
world to us. Or, suppose person A is watching television when person B 
comes in the room, and shows evident displeasure with the situation. 
Person A may think he understands the problem, and try to remedy it by 
exiting the present system (that television program), and flipping the chan-
nel knob, looking for a better show. Person B may have a more radical 
concept of what it is to "exit the system"-namely to turn the television off! 
Of course, there are cases where only a rare individual will have the vision 
to perceive a system which governs many peoples' lives, a system which had 
never before even been recognized as a system; then such people often 
devote their lives to convincing other people that the system really is there, 
and that it ought to be exited from! 
How well have computers been taught to jump out of the system? I will 
cite one example which surprised some observers. In a computer chess 
tournament not long ago in Canada, one program-the weakest of all the 
competing ones-had the unusual feature of quitting long before the game 
was over. It was not a very good chess player, but it at least had the 
redeeming quality of being able to spot a hopeless position, and to resign 
then and there, instead of waiting for the other program to go through the 
The MU-puzzle 
37 

boring ritual of checkmating. Although it lost every game it played, it did it 
in style. A lot of local chess experts were impressed. Thus, if you define 
"the system" as "making moves in a chess game", it is clear that this 
program had a sophisticated, preprogrammed ability to exit from the 
system. On the other hand, if you think of "the system" as being "whatever 
the computer had been programmed to do", then there is no doubt that the 
computer had no ability whatsoever to exit from that system. 
It is very important when studying formal systems to distinguish work-
ing within the system from making statements or observations about the 
system. I assume that you began the MU-puzzle, as do most people, by 
working within the system; and that you then gradually started getting 
anxious, and this anxiety finally built up to the point where without any 
need for further consideration, you exited from the system, trying to take 
stock of what you had produced, and wondering why it was that you had 
not succeeded in producing MU. Perhaps you found a reason why you 
could not produce MU; that is thinking about the system. Perhaps you 
produced MIU somewhere along the way; that is working within the system. 
Now I do not want to make it sound as if the two modes are entirely 
incompatible; I am sure that every human being is capable to some extent 
of working inside a system and simultaneously thinking about what he is 
doing. Actually, in human affairs, it is often next to impossible to break 
things neatly up into "inside the system" and "outside the system"; life is 
composed of so many interlocking and interwoven and often inconsistent 
"systems" that it may seem simplistic to think of things in those terms. But it 
is often important to formulate simple ideas very clearly so that one can use 
them as models in thinking about more complex ideas. And that is why I 
am showing you formal systems; and it is about time we went back to 
discussing the MIU-system. 
M-Mode, I-Mode, U-Mode 
The MU-puzzle was stated in such a way that it encouraged some amount 
of exploration within the MIU-system-deriving theorems. But it was also 
stated in a way so as not to imply that staying inside the system would 
necessarily yield fruit. Therefore it encouraged some oscillation between 
the two modes of work. One way to separate these two modes would be to 
have two sheets of paper; on one sheet, you work "in your capacity as a 
machine", thus filling it with nothing but M's, I's, and U's; on the second 
sheet, you work "in your capacity as a thinking being", and are allowed to 
do whatever your intelligence suggests-which might involve using 
English, sketching ideas, working backwards, using shorthand (such as the 
letter 'x'), compressing several steps into one, modifying the rules of the 
system to see what that gives, or whatever else you might dream up. One 
thing you might do is notice that the numbers ~ and 2 play an important 
role, since I's are gotten rid of in three's, and U's in two's-and doubling of 
length (except for the M) is allowed by rule II. So the second sheet might 
38 
The MU-puzzle 

also have some figuring on it. We will occasionally refer back to these two 
modes of dealing with a formal system, and we will call them the Mechanical 
mode (M-mode) and the Intelligent mode (I-mode). To round out our modes, 
with one for each letter of the MIU-system, I will also mention a final 
mode-the Un-mode (U-mode), which is the Zen way of approaching things. 
More about this in a few Chapters. 
Decision Procedures 
An observation about this puzzle is that it involves rules of two opposing 
tendencies-the lengthening rules and the shortening rules. Two rules (I and 
II) allow you to increase the size of strings (but only in very rigid, pre-
scribed ways, of course); and two others allow you to shrink strings some-
what (again in very rigid ways). There seems to be an endless variety to the 
order in which these different types of rules might be applied, and this 
gives hope that one way or another, MU could be produced. It might 
involve lengthening the string to some gigantic size, and then extracting 
piece after piece until only two symbols are left; or, worse yet, it might 
involve successive stages of lengthening and then shortening and then 
lengthening and then shortening, and so on. But there is no guarantee of 
it. As a matter of fact, we already observed that U cannot be produced at all, 
and it will make no difference if you lengthen and shorten till kingdom 
come. 
Still, the case of U and the case of MU seem quite different. It is by a 
very superficial feature of U that we recognize the impossibility of produc-
ing it: it doesn't begin with an M (whereas all theorems must). It is very 
convenient to have such a simple way to detect nontheorems. However, 
who says that that test will detect all nontheorems? There may be lots of 
strings which begin with M but are not producible. Maybe MU is one of 
them. That would mean that the "first-letter test" is of limited usefulness, 
able only to detect a portion of the nontheorems, but missing others. But 
there remains the possibility of some more elaborate test which discrimi-
nates perfectly between those strings which can be produced by the rules, 
and those which cannot. Here we have to face the question, "What do we 
mean by a test?" It may not be obvious why that question makes sense, or is 
important, in this context. But I will give an example of a "test" which 
somehow seems to violate the spirit of the word. 
Imagine a genie who has all the time in the world, and who enjoys 
using it to produce theorems of the MIU-system, in a rather methodical 
way. Here, for instance, is a possible way the genie might go about it: 
Step 1: 
Apply every applicable rule to the axiom MI. This yields 
two new theorems: MIU, MIl. 
Step 2: 
Apply every applicable rule to the theorems produced in 
step 1. This yields three new theorems: MIIU, MIUIU, MlIIl. 
The MU-puzzle 
39 

Step 3: 
Apply every applicable rule to the theorems produced in 
step 2. This yields five new theorems: MIIIIU, MIIUIIU, 
MIUIUIUlU, Mil 111111 , MUI. 
This method produces every single theorem sooner or later, because the 
rules are applied in every conceivable order. (See Fig. 11.) All of the 
lengthening-shortening alternations which we mentioned above eventually 
get carried out. However, it is not clear how long to wait for a given string

A systematically constructed "tree" of all the theorems of the MIU-system. The 
Nth level down contains those theorems whose derivations contain exactly N steps. The 
encircled numbers tell which rule was employed. Is MU anywhere in this tree? 
to appear on this list, since theorems are listed according to the shortness of 
their derivations. This is not a very useful order, if you are interested in a 
specific string (such as MU), and you don't even know if it has any deriva-
tion, much less how long that derivation might be. 
Now we state the proposed "theoremhood-test": 
Wait until the string in question is produced; when that happens, 
you know it is a theorem-and if it never happens, you know that 
it is not a theorem. 
This seems ridiculous, because it presupposes that we don't mind waiting 
around literally an infinite length of time for our answer. This gets to the 
crux of the matter of what should count as a "test". Of prime importance is 
a guarantee that we will get our answer in a finite length of time. If there is 
a test for theoremhood, a test which does always terminate in a finite 
40 
The MU-puzzle 

amount of time, then that test is called a decision procedure for the given 
formal system. 
When you have a decision procedure, then you have a very concrete 
characterization of the nature of all theorems in the system. Offhand, it 
might seem that the rules and axioms of the formal system provide no less 
complete a characterization of the theorems of the system than a decision 
procedure would. The tricky word here is "characterization". Certainly the 
rules of inference and the axioms of the MIU-system do characterize, 
implicitly, those strings that are theorems. Even more implicitly, they charac-
terize those strings that are not theorems. But implicit characterization is 
not enough, for many purposes. If someone claims to have a characteriza-
tion of all theorems, but it takes him infinitely long to deduce that some 
particular string is not a theorem, you would probably tend to say that 
there is something lacking in that characterization-it is not quite concrete 
enough. And that is why discovering that a decision procedure exists is a 
very important step. What the discovery means, in effect, is that you can 
perform a test for theoremhood of a string, and that, even if the test is 
complicated, it is guaranteed to terminate. In principle, the test is just as easy, 
just as mechanical, just as finite, just as full of certitude, as checking 
whether the first letter of the string is M. A decision procedure is a "litmus 
test" for theoremhood! 
Incidentally, one requirement on formal systems is that the set of 
axioms must be characterized by a decision procedure-there must be a 
litmus test for axiomhood. This ensures that there is no problem in getting 
off the ground at the beginning, at least. That is the difference between the 
set of axioms and the set of theorems: the former always has a decision 
procedure, but the latter may not. 
I am sure you will agree that when you looked at the MIU-system for 
the first time, you had to face this problem exactly. The lone axiom was 
known, the rules of inference were simple, so the theorems had been 
implicitly characterized-and yet it was still quite unclear what the conse-
quences of that characterization were. In particular, it was still totally 
unclear whether MU is, or is not, a theorem.

Two-Part! nvention 
or, 
What the Tortoise Said to Achilles 
by Lewis CarrolP 
Achilles had overtaken the Tortoise, and had seated himself comfortably 
on its back. 
"So you've got to the end of our race-course?" said the Tortoise. "Even 
though it DOES consist of an infinite series of distances? I thought some 
wiseacre or other had proved that the thing couldn't be done?" 
"It CAN be done," said Achilles. "It HAS been done! Solvitur ambulando. 
You see the distances were constantly DIMINISHING; and so--" 
"But if they had been constantly INCREASING?" the Tortoise inter-
rupted. "How then?" 
"Then I shouldn't be here," Achilles modestly replied; "and YOU 
would have got several times round the world, by this time!" 
"You flatter me-FLATTEN, I mean," said the Tortoise; "for you ARE a 
heavy weight, and NO mistake! Well now, would you like to hear of a 
race-course, that most people fancy they can get to the end of in two or 
three steps, while it REALLY consists of an infinite number of distances, each 
one longer than the previous one?" 
"Very much indeed!" said the Grecian warrior, as he drew from his 
helmet (few Grecian warriors possessed POCKETS in those days) an enor-
mous note-book and penci1. "Proceed! And speak SLOWLY, please! SHORT-
HAND isn't invented yet!" 
"That beautiful First Proposition by Euclid!" the Tortoise murmured 
dreamily. "You admire Euclid?" 
"Passionately! So far, at least, as one CAN admire a treatise that won't be 
published for some centuries to come!" 
"Well, now, let's take a little bit of the argument in that First 
Proposition-just TWO steps, and the conclusion drawn from them. Kindly 
enter them in your note-book. And in order to refer to them conveniently, 
let's call them A, B, and Z:-
(A) 
Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other. 
(B) 
The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal 
to the same. 
(Z) 
The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other. 
Readers of Euclid will grant, I suppose, that Z follows logically from A 
and B, so that anyone who accepts A and B as true, MUST accept Z as true?" 
"Undoubtedly! The youngest child in a High School-as soon as High 
Two-Part Invention 
43 

Schools are invented, which will not be till some two thousand years 
later-will grant THAT." 
"And if some reader had NOT yet accepted A and B as true, he might 
still accept the SEQUENCE as a VALlD one, 1 suppose?" 
"No doubt such a reader might exist. He might say, 'I accept as true the 
Hypothetical Proposition that, IF A and B be true, Z must be true; but 1 
DON'T accept A and B as true.' Such a reader would do wisely in abandon-
ing Euclid, and taking to football." 
"And might there not ALSO be some reader who would say 'I accept A 
and B as true, but 1 DON'T accept the Hypothetical'?" 
"Certainly there might. HE, also, had better take to football." 
"And NEITHER of these readers," the Tortoise continued, "is AS YET 
under any logical necessity to accept Z as true?" 
"Quite so," Achilles assented. 
"Well, now, 1 want you to consider ME as a reader of the SECOND kind, 
and to force me, logically, to accept Z as true." 
"A tortoise playing football would be-" Achilles was beginning. 
"-an anomaly, of course," the Tortoise hastily interrupted. "Don't 
wander from the point. Let's have Z first, and football afterwards!" 
"I'm to force you to accept Z, am I?" Achilles said musingly. "And your 
present position is that you accept A and B, but you DON'T accept the 
H ypothetical-" 
"Let's call it C," said the Tortoise. 
"-but you DON'T accept 
(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true." 
"That is my present position," said the Tortoise. 
"Then 1 must ask you to accept C." 
"I'll do so," said the Tortoise, "as soon as you've entered it in that 
notebook of yours. What else have you got in it?" 
"Only a few memoranda," said Achilles, nervously fluttering the 
leaves: "a few memoranda of -of the battles in which 1 have distinguished 
myself!" 
"Plenty of blank leaves, 1 see!" the Tortoise cheerily remarked. "We 
shall need them ALL!" (Achilles shuddered.) "Now write as 1 dictate:-
(A) 
Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other. 
(B) 
The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to 
the same. 
(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true. 
(Z) 
The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other." 
"You should call it D, not Z," said Achilles. "It comes NEXT to the other 
three. If you accept A and Band C, you MUST accept Z." 
44 
Two-Part Invention 

"And why must I?" 
"Because it follows LOGICALLY from them. If A and Band C are true, Z 
MUST be true. You can't dispute THAT, I imagine?" 
"If A and Band C are true, Z MUST be true," the Tortoise thoughtfully 
repeated. "That's ANOTHER Hypothetical, isn't it? And, if I failed to see its 
truth, I might accept A and Band C, and STILL not accept Z, mightn't I?" 
"You might," the candid hero admitted; "though such obtuseness 
would certainly be phenomenal. Still, the event is POSSIBLE. SO I must ask 
you to grant ONE more Hypothetical." 
"Very good, I'm quite willing to grant it, as soon as you've written it 
down. We will call it 
(D) If A and Band C are true, Z must be true. 
Have you entered that in your note-book?" 
"I HAVE!" Achilles joyfully exclaimed, as he ran the pencil into its 
sheath. "And at last we've got to the end of this ideal race-course! Now that 
you accept A and Band C and D, OF COURSE you accept Z." 
"Do I?" said the Tortoise innocently. "Let's make that quite clear. I 
accept A and Band C and D. Suppose I STILL refused to accept Z?" 
"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and FORCE you to do it!" 
Achilles triumphantly replied. "Logic would tell you, 'You can't help your-
self. Now that you've accepted A and Band C and D, you MUST accept Z!' 
So you've no choice, you see." 
"Whatever LOGIC is good enough to tell me is worth WRITING DOWN," 
said the Tortoise. "So enter it in your book, please. We will call it 
(E) 
If A and Band C and D are true, Z must be true. 
Until I've granted THAT, of course I needn't grant Z. So it's quite a 
NECESSARY step, you see?" 
"I see," said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone. 
Here the narrator, having pressing business at the Bank, was obliged 
to leave the happy pair, and did not again pass the spot until some months 
afterwards. When he did so, Achilles was still seated on the back of the 
much-enduring Tortoise, and was writing in his notebook, which appeared 
to be nearly full. The Tortoise was saying, "Have you got that last step 
written down? Unless I've lost count, that makes a thousand and one. 
There are several millions more to come. And WOULD you mind, as a 
personal favour, considering what a lot of instruction this colloquy of ours 
will provide for the Logicians of the Nineteenth Century-wouLD you 
mind adopting a pun that my cousin the Mock-Turtle will then make, and 
allowing yourself to be renamed TAUGHT-US?" 
"As you please," replied the weary warrior, in the hollow tones of 
despair, as he buried his face in his hands. "Provided that YOU, for YOUR 
part, will adopt a pun the Mock-Turtle never made, and allow yourself to 
be re-named A KILL-EASE!" .

CHAPTER II 
Meaning and Form 
in Mathematics 
THIS Two-Part Invention was the inspiration for my two characters. Just as 
Lewis Carroll took liberties with Zeno's Tortoise and Achilles, so have I 
taken liberties with Lewis Carroll's Tortoise and Achilles. In Carroll's 
dialogue, the same events take place over and over again, only each time on 
a higher and higher level; it is a wonderful analogue to Bach's Ever-Rising 
Canon. The Carrollian Dialogue, with its wit subtracted out, still leaves a 
deep philosophical problem: Do words and thoughts follow formal rules, or do 
they not? That problem is the problem of this book. 
In this Chapter and the next, we will look at several new formal 
systems. This will give us a much wider perspective on the concept of 
formal system. By the end of these two Chapters, you should have quite a 
good idea of the power of formal systems, and why they are of interest to 
mathematicians and logicians. 
The pq-System 
The formal system of this Chapter is called the pq-system. It is not important 
to mathematicians or logicians-in fact, it is just a simple invention of mine. 
Its importance lies only in the fact that it provides an excellent example of 
many ideas that playa large role in this book. There are three distinct 
symbols of the pq-system: 
p 
q 
-the letters p, q, and the hyphen. 
The pq-system has an infinite number of axioms. Since we can't write 
them all down, we have to have some other way of describing what they are. 
Actually, we want more thanjust a description of the axioms; we want a way 
to tell whether some given string is an axiom or not. A mere description of 
axioms might characterize them fully and yet weakly-which was the prob-
lem with the way theorems in the MIU-system were characterized. We 
don't want to have to struggle for an indeterminate-possibly infinite-
length of time, just to find out if some string is an axiom or not. Therefore, 
we will define axioms in such a way that there is an obvious decision 
procedure for axiomhood of a string composed of p's, q's, and hyphens. 
46 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 

DEFINITION: 
X P - q X - is an axiom, whenever X is composed of hyphens 
only. 
Note that 'x' must stand for the same string of hyphens in both occurrences. 
For example, --p-q--- is an axiom. The literal expression 'xp-qx-' is 
not an axiom, of course (because 'x' does not belong to the pq-system); it is 
more like a mold in which all axioms are cast-and it is called an axiom 
schema. 
The pq-system has only one rule of production: 
RULE: 
Suppose x, y, and z all stand for particular strings containing only 
hyphens. And suppose that x p y q z is known to be a theorem. Then 
xpy-qz- is a theorem. 
For example, take x to be' --', y to be' ---', and z to be '-'. The rule tells 
us: 
If --p---q- turns out to be a theorem, then so will 
--p----q--. 
As is typical of rules of production, the statement establishes a causal 
connection between the theoremhood of two strings, but without asserting 
theoremhood for either one on its own. 
A most useful exercise for you is to find a decision procedure for the 
theorems of the pq-system. It is not hard; if you play around for a while, 
you will probably pick it up. Try it. 
The Decision Procedure 
I presume you have tried it. First of all, though it may seem too obvious to 
mention, I would like to point out that every theorem of the pq-system has 
three separate groups of hyphens, and the separating elements are one p, 
and one q, in that order. (This can be shown by an argument based on 
"heredity", just the way one could show that all MIU-system theorems had 
to begin with M.) This means that we can rule out, from its form alone, a 
string such as --p--p--p--q--------. 
Now, stressing the phrase "from its form alone" may seem silly; what 
else is there to a string except its form? What else could possibly playa role 
in determining its properties? Clearly nothing could. But bear this in mind 
as the discussion of formal systems goes on; the notion of "form" will start 
to get rather more complicated and abstract, and we will have to think more 
about the meaning of the word "form". In any case, let us give the name 
welljormed string to any string which begins with a hyphen-group, then has 
one p, then has a second hyphen-group, then a q, and then a final 
hyphen-group. 
Back to the decision procedure ... The criterion for theoremhood is 
that the first two hyphen-groups should add up, in length, to the third 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
47 

hyphen-group. For instance, --p--q---- is a theorem, since 2 plus 2 
equals 4, whereas --p--q- is not, since 2 plus 2 is not 1. To see why this is 
the proper criterion, look first at the axiom schema. Obviously, it only 
manufactures axioms which satisfy the addition criterion. Second, look at 
the rule of production. If the first string satisfies the addition criterion, so 
must the second one-and conversely, if the first string does not satisfy the 
addition criterion, then neither does the second string. The rule makes the 
addition criterion into a hereditary property of theorems: any theorem 
passes the property on to its offspring. This shows why the addition 
criterion is correct. 
There is, incidentally, a fact about the pq-system which would enable 
us to say with confidence that it has a decision procedure, even before 
finding the addition criterion. That fact is that the pq-system is not compli-
cated by the opposing currents of lengthening and shortening rules; it has 
only lengthening rules. Any formal system which tells you how to make 
longer theorems from shorter ones, but never the reverse, has got to have a 
decision procedure for its theorems. For suppose you are given a string. 
First check whether it's an axiom or not (I am assuming that there is a 
decision procedure for axiomhood--otherwise, things are hopeless). If it 
is an axiom, then i~ is by definition a theorem, and the test is over. So sup-
pose instead that it's not an axiom. Then, to be a theorem, it must have 
come from a shorter string, via one of the rules. By going over the various 
rules one by one, you can pinpoint not only the rules that could conceivably 
produce that string, but also exactly which shorter strings could be its 
forebears on the "family tree". In this way, you "reduce" the problem to 
determining whether any of several new but shorter strings is a theorem. 
Each of them can in turn be subjected to the same test. The worst that can 
happen is a proliferation of more and more, but shorter and shorter, 
strings to test. As you continue inching your way backwards in this fashion, 
you must be getting closer to the source of all theorems-the axiom 
schemata. You just can't get shorter and shorter indefinitely; therefore, 
eventually either you will find that one of your short strings is an axiom, or 
you'll come to a point where you're stuck, in that none of your short strings 
is an axiom, and none of them can be further shortened by running some 
rule or other backwards. This points out that there really is not much deep 
interest in formal systems with lengthening rules only; it is the interplay of 
lengthening and shortening rules that gives formal systems a certain fasci-
nation. 
Bottom-up vs. Top-down 
The method above might be called a top-down decision procedure, to be 
contrasted with a bottom-up decision procedure, which I give now. It is very 
reminiscent of the genie's systematic theorem-generating method for the 
MIU-system, but is complicated by the presence of an axiom schema. We 
are going to form a "bucket" into whicn we throw theorems as they are 
generated. Here is how it is done: 
48 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 

(la) Throw the simplest possible aXIOm (-p-q--) into the 
bucket. 
(1 b) 
Apply the rule of inference to the item in the bucket, and 
put the result into the bucket. 
(2a) 
Throw the second-simplest axiom into the bucket. 
(2b) 
Apply the rule to each item in the bucket, and throw all 
results into the bucket. 
(3a) 
Throw the third-simplest axiom into the bucket. 
(3b) 
Apply the rule to each item in the bucket, and throw all 
results into the bucket. 
etc., etc. 
A moment's reflection will show that you can't fail to produce every 
theorem of the pq-system this way. Moreover, the bucket is getting filled 
with longer and longer theorems, as time goes on. It is again a consequence 
of that lack of shortening rules. So if you have a particular string, such as 
--p---q-----, which you want to test for theoremhood, just follow the 
numbered steps, checking all the while for the string in question. If it turns 
up-theorem! If at some point everything that goes into the bucket is 
longer than the string in question, forget it-it is not a theorem. This 
decision procedure is bottom-up because it is working its way up from the 
basics, which is to say the axioms. The previous decision procedure is 
top-down because it does precisely the reverse: it works its way back down 
towards the basics. 
Isomorphisms Induce Meaning 
Now we come to a central issue of this Chapter-indeed of the book. 
Perhaps you have already thought to yourself that the pq-theorems are like 
additions. The string --p---q----- is a theorem because 2 plus 3 
equals 5. It could even occur to you that the theorem --p---q-----is a 
statement, written in an odd notation, whose meaning is that 2 plus 3 is 5. Is 
this a reasonable way to look at things? Well, I deliberately chose 'p' to 
remind you of 'plus', and 'q' to remind you of 'equals' ... So, does the 
string --p---q----- actually mean "2 plus 3 equals 5"? 
What would make us feel that way? My answer would be that we have 
perceived an isomorphism between pq-theorems and additions. In the Intro-
duction, the word "isomorphism" was defined as an information-
preserving transformation. We can now go into that notion a little more 
deeply, and see it from another perspective. The word "isomorphism" 
applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in 
such a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part 
in the other structure, where "corresponding" means that the two parts 
play similar roles in their respective structures. This usage of the word 
"isomorphism" is derived from a more precise notion in mathematics. 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
49 

It is cause for joy when a mathematician discovers an isomorphism 
between two structures which he knows. It is often a "bolt from the blue", 
and a source of wonderment. The perception of an isomorphism between 
two known structures is a significant advance in knowledge-and I claim 
that it is such perceptions of isomorphism which create meanings in the 
minds of people. A final word on the perception of isomorphisms: since 
they come in many shapes and sizes, figuratively speaking, it is not always 
totally clear when you really have found an isomorphism. Thus, "isomor-
phism" is a word with all the usual vagueness of words-which is a defect 
but an advantage as well. 
In this case, we have an excellent prototype for the concept of isomor-
phism. There is a "lower level" of our isomorphism-that is, a mapping 
between the parts of the two structures: 
p ¢:~ plus 
q ¢:~ equals 
-
¢:~ one 
-- ¢:~ two 
--- ¢:~ three 
etc. 
This symbol-word correspondence has a name: interpretation. 
Secondly, on a higher level, there is the correspondence between true 
statements and theorems. But-note carefully-this higher-level corre-
spondence could not be perceived without the prior choice of an interpre-
tation for the symbols. Thus it would be more accurate to describe it as a 
correspondence between true statements and interpreted theorems. In any 
case we have displayed a two-tiered correspondence, which is typical of all 
isomorphisms. 
When you confront a formal system you know nothing of, and if you 
hope to discover some hidden meaning in it, your problem is how to assign 
interpretations to its symbols in a meaningful way-that is, in such a way 
that a higher-level correspondence emerges between true statements and 
theorems. You may make several tentative stabs in the dark before finding 
a good set of words to associate with the symbols. It is very similar to 
attempts to crack a code, or to decipher inscriptions in an unknown lan-
guage like Linear B of Crete: the only way to proceed is by trial and error, 
based on educated guesses. When you hit a good choice, a "meaningful" 
choice, all of a sudden things just feel right, and work speeds up enor-
mously. Pretty soon everything falls into place. The excitement of such an 
experience is captured in The Decipherment of Linear B by John Chadwick. 
But it is uncommon, to say the least, for someone to be in the position 
of "decoding" a formal system turned up in the excavations of a ruined 
civilization! Mathematicians (and more recently, linguists, philosophers, 
and some others) are the only users of formal systems, and they invariably 
have an interpretation in mind for the formal systems which they use and 
publish. The idea of these people is to set up a formal system whose 
50 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 

theorems reflect some portion of reality isomorphically. In such a case, the 
choice of symbols is a highly motivated one, as is the choice of typographi-
cal rules of production. When I devised the pq-system, I was in this 
position. You see why I chose the symbols I chose. It is no accident that 
theorems are isomorphic to additions; it happened because I deliberately 
sought out a way to reflect additions typographically. 
Meaningless and Meaningful Interpretations 
You can choose interpretations other than the one I chose. You need not 
make every theorem come out true. But there would be very little reason to 
make an interpretation in which, say, all theorems came out false, and 
certainly even less reason to make an interpretation under which there is 
no correlation at all, positive or negative, between theoremhood and truth. 
Let us therefore make a distinction between two types of interpretations for 
a formal system. First, we can have a meaningless interpretation, one under 
which we fail to see any isomorphic connection between theorems of the 
system, and reality. Such interpretations abound-any random choice at all 
will do. For instance, take this one: 
p ¢:~ horse 
q ¢:~ happy 
-
¢:~ apple 
Now -p-q-- acquires a new interpretation: "apple horse apple happy 
apple apple"-a poetic sentiment, which might appeal to horses, and might 
even lead them to favor this mode of interpreting pq-strings! However, this 
interpretation has very little "meaningfulness"; under interpretation, 
theorems don't sound any truer, or any better, than nontheorems. A horse 
might enjoy "happy happy happy apple horse" (mapped onto q q q - p ) 
just as much as any interpreted theorem. 
The other kind of interpretation will be called meaningful. Under such 
an interpretation, theorems and truths correspond-that is, an isomor-
phism exists between theorems and some portion of reality. That is why it is 
good to distinguish between interpretations and meanings. Any old word can 
be used as an interpretation for 'p', but 'plus' is the only meaningful choice 
we've come up with. In summary, the meaning of 'p' seems to be 'plus', 
though it can have a million different interpretations. 
Active vs. Passive Meanings 
Probably the most significant fact of this Chapter, if understood deeply, is 
this: the pq-system seems to force us into recognizing that symbols of a formal 
system, though initially without meaning, cannot avoid taking on "meaning" of sorts, 
at least if an isomorphism is found. The difference between meaning in a 
formal system and in a language is a very important one, however. It is this: 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
51 

in a language, when we have learned a meaning for a word, we then make 
new statements based on the meaning of the word. In a sense the meaning 
becomes active, since it brings into being a new rule for creating sentences. 
This means that our command of language is not like a finished product: 
the rules for making sentences increase when we learn new meanings. On 
the other hand, in a formal system, the theorems are predefined, by the 
rules of production. We can choose "meanings" based on an isomorphism 
(if we can find one) between theorems and true statements. But this does 
not give us the license to go out and add new theorems to the established 
theorems. That is what the Requirement of Formality in Chapter I was 
warning you of. 
In the MIU-system, of course, there was no temptation to go beyond 
the four rules, because no interpretation was sought or found. But here, in 
our new system, one might be seduced by the newly found "meaning" of 
each symbol into thinking that the string 
--p--p--p--q--------
is a theorem. At least, one might wish that this string were a theorem. But 
wishing doesn't change the fact that it isn't. And it would be a serious 
mistake to think that it "must" be a theorem, just because 2 plus 2 plus 2 
plus 2 equals 8. It would even be misleading to attribute it any meaning at 
all, since it is not well-formed, and our meaningful interpretation is entirely 
derived from looking at well-formed strings. 
In a formal system, the meaning must remain passive; we can read each 
string according to the meanings of its constituent symbols, but we do not 
have the right to create new theorems purely on the basis of the meanings 
we've assigned the symbols. Interpreted formal systems straddle the line 
between systems without meaning, and systems with meaning. Their 
strings can be thought of as "expressing" things, but this must come only as 
a consequence of the formal properties of the system. 
Double-Entendrel 
And now, I want to destroy any illusion about having found the meanings 
for the symbols of the pq-system. Consider the following association: 
p ¢:~ equals 
q ¢:~ taken from 
-
¢:~ one 
-- ¢:~ two 
etc. 
Now, --p---q----- has a new interpretation: "2 equals 3 taken from 
5". Of course it is a true statement. All theorems will come out true under 
this new interpretation. It is just as meaningful as the old one. Obviously, it 
is silly to ask, "But which one is the meaning of the string?" An interpreta-
52 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 

tion will be meaningful to the extent that it accurately reflects some iso-
morphism to the real world. When different aspects of the real world are 
isomorphic to each other (in this case, additions and subtractions), one 
single formal system can be isomorphic to both, and therefore can take on 
two passive meanings. This kind of double-valuedness of symbols and 
strings is an extremely important phenomenon. Here it seems trivial, 
curious, annoying. But it will come back in deeper contexts and bring with 
it a great richness of ideas. 
Here is a summary of our observations about the pq-system. Under 
either of the two meaningful interpretations given, every well-formed 
string has a grammatical assertion for its counterpart-some are true, some 
false. The idea of welljormed strings in any formal system is that they are 
those strings which, when interpreted symbol for symbol, yield grammatical 
sentences. (Of course, it depends on the interpretation, but usually, there is 
one in mind.) Among the well-formed strings occur the theorems. These 
are defined by an axiom schema, and a rule of production. My goal in 
inventing the pq-system was to imitate additions: I wanted every theorem 
to express a true addition under interpretation; conversely, I wanted every 
true addition of precisely two positive integers to be translatable into a 
string, which would be a theorem. That goal was achieved. Notice, there-
fore, that all false additions, such as "2 plus 3 equals 6", are mapped into 
strings which are well-formed, but which are not theorems. 
Formal Systems and Reality 
This is our first example of a case where a formal system is based upon a 
portion of reality, and seems to mimic it perfectly, in that its theorems are 
isomorphic to truths about that part of reality. However, reality and the 
formal system are independent. Nobody need be aware that there is an 
isomorphism between the two. Each side stands by itself-one plus one 
equals two, whether or not we know that -p-q-- is a theorem; and 
- p - q - - is still a theorem whether· or not we connect it with addition. 
You might wonder whether making this formal system, or any formal 
system, sheds new light on truths in the domain of its interpretation. Have 
we learned any new additions by producing pq-theorems? Certainly not; 
but we have learned something about the nature of addition as a 
process-namely, that it is easily mimicked by a typographical rule govern-
ing meaningless symbols. This still should not be a big surprise since 
addition is such a simple concept. It is a commonplace that addition can be 
captured in the spinning gears of a device like a cash register. 
But it is clear that we have hardly scratched the surface, as far as 
formal systems go; it is natural to wonder about what portion of reality can 
be imitated in its behavior by a set of meaningless symbols governed by 
formal rules. Can all of reality be turned into a formal system? In a very 
broad sense, the answer might appear to be yes. One could suggest, for 
instance, that reality is itself nothing but one very complicated formal 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
53 

system. Its symbols do not move around on paper, but rather in a three-
dimensional vacuum (space); they are the elementary particles of which 
everything is composed. (Tacit assumption: that there is an end to the 
descending chain of matter, so that the expression "elementary particles" 
makes sense.) The "typographical rules" are the laws of physics, which tell 
how, given the positions and velocities of all particles at a given instant, to 
modify them, resulting in a new set of positions and velocities belonging to 
the "next" instant. So the theorems of this grand formal system are the 
possible configurations of particles at different times in the history of the 
universe. The sole axiom is (or perhaps, was) the original configuration of 
all the particles at the "beginning of time". This is so grandiose a concep-
tion, however, that it has only the most theoretical interest; and besides, 
quantum mechanics (and other parts of physics) casts at least some doubt 
on even the theoretical worth of this idea. Basically, we are asking if the 
universe operates deterministically, which is an open question. 
Mathematics and Symbol Manipulation 
Instead of dealing with such a big picture, let's limit ourselves to mathematics 
as our "real world". Here, a serious question arises: How can we be sure, if 
we've tried to model a formal system on some part of mathematics, that 
we've done the job accurately-especially if we're not one hundred per cent 
familiar with that portion of mathematics already? Suppose the goal of the 
formal system is to bring us new knowledge in that discipline. How will we 
know that the interpretation of every theorem is true, unless we've proven 
that the isomorphism is perfect? And how will we prove that the isomor-
phism is perfect, if we don't already know all about the truths in the 
discipline to begin with? 
Suppose that in an excavation somewhere, we actually did discover 
some mysterious formal system. We would tryout various interpretations 
and perhaps eventually hit upon one which seemed to make every theorem 
come out true, and every nontheorem come out false. But this is something 
which we could only check directly in a finite number of cases. The set of 
theorems is most likely infinite. How will we know that all theorems express 
truths under this interpretation, unless we know everything there is to 
know about both the formal system and the corresponding domain of 
interpretation? 
It is in somewhat this odd position that we will find ourselves when we 
attempt to match the reality of natural numbers (i.e., the nonnegative 
integers: 0, 1,2, ... ) with the typographical symbols of a formal system. We 
will try to understand the relationship between what we call "truth" in 
number theory and what we can get at by symbol manipulation. 
So let us briefly look at the basis for calling some statements of number 
theory true, and others false. How much is 12 times 12? Everyone knows it 
is 144. But how many of the people who give that answer have actually at 
54 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 

any time in their lives drawn a 12 by 12 rectangle, and then counted the 
little squares in it? Most people would regard the drawing and counting as 
unnecessary. They would instead offer as proof a few marks on paper, such 
as are shown below: 
12 
x12 
24 
12 
144 
And that would be the "proof". Nearly everyone believes that if you 
counted the squares, you would get 144 of them; few people feel that the 
outcome is in doubt. 
The conflict between the two points of view comes into sharper 
focus when you consider the problem of determining the value of 
987654321 X 123456789. First of all, it is virtually impossible to construct 
the appropriate rectangle; and what is worse, even if it were constructed, 
and huge armies of people spent centuries counting the little squares, only 
a very gullible person would be willing to believe their final answer. It is just 
too likely that somewhere, somehow, somebody bobbled just a little bit. So 
is it ever possible to know what the answer is? If you trust the symbolic 
process which involves manipulating digits according to certain simple 
rules, yes. That process is presented to children as a device which gets the 
right answer; lost in the shuffle, for many children, are the rhyme and 
reason of that process. The digit-shunting laws for multiplication are based 
mostly on a few properties of addition and multiplication which are as-
sumed to hold for all numbers. 
The Basic Laws of Arithmetic 
The kind of assumption I mean is illustrated below. Suppose that you lay 
down a few sticks: 
11/1/1/11 
Now you count them. At the same time, somebody else counts them, but 
starting from the other end. Is it clear that the two of you will get the same 
answer? The result of a counting process is independent of the way in 
which it is done. This is really an assumption about what counting is. It 
would be senseless to try to prove it, because it is so basic; either you see it 
or you don't-but in the latter case, a proof won't help you a bit. 
From this kind of assumption, one can get to die commutativity and 
associativity of addition (i.e., first that b + c = c + b always, and second 
that b + (c + d) = (b + c) + d always). The same assumption can also lead 
you to the commutativity and associativity of multiplication; just think of 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
55 

many cubes assembled to form a large rectangular solid. Multiplicative 
commutativity and associativity are just the assumptions that when you 
rotate the solid in various ways, the number of cubes will not change. Now 
these assumptions are not verifiable in all possible cases, because the 
number of such cases is infinite. We take them for granted; we believe them 
(if we ever think about them) as deeply as we could believe anything. The 
amount of money in our pocket will not change as we walk down the street, 
jostling it up and down; the number of books we have will not change if we 
pack them up in a box, load them into our car, drive one hundred miles, 
unload the box, unpack it, and place the books in a new shelf. All of this is 
part of what we mean by number. 
There are certain types of people who, as soon as some undeniable fact 
is written down, find it amusing to show why that "fact" is false after all. I 
am such a person, and as soon as I had written down the examples above 
involving sticks, money, and books, I invented situations in which they were 
wrong. You may have done the same. It goes to show that numbers as 
abstractions are really quite different from the everyday numbers which we 
use. 
People enjoy inventing slogans which violate basic arithmetic but which 
illustrate "deeper" truths, such as "1 and 1 make 1" (for lovers), or" 1 plus 1 
plus 1 equals 1" (the Trinity). You can easily pick holes in those slogans, 
showing why, for instance, using the plus-sign is inappropriate in both 
cases. But such cases proliferate. Two raindrops running down a window-
pane merge; does one plus one make one? A cloud breaks up into two 
clouds-more evidence for the same? It is not at all easy to draw a sharp 
line between cases where what is happening could be called "addition", and 
where some other word is wanted. If you think about the question, you will 
probably come up with some criterion involving separation of the objects in 
space, and making sure each one is clearly distinguishable from all the 
others. But then how could one count ideas? Or the number of gases 
comprising the atmosphere? Somewhere, if you try to look it up, you can 
probably find a statement such as, "There are 17 languages in India, and 
462 dialects." There is something strange about precise statements like 
that, when the concepts "language" and "dialect" are themselves fuzzy. 
Ideal Numbers 
Numbers as realities misbehave. However, there is an ancient and innate 
sense in people that numbers ought not to misbehave. There is something 
clean and pure in the abstract notion of number, removed from counting 
beads, dialects, or clouds; and there ought to be a way of talking about 
numbers without always having the silliness of reality come in and intrude. 
The hard-edged rules that govern "ideal" numbers constitute arithmetic, 
and their more advanced consequences constitute number theory. There is 
only one relevant question to be asked, in making the transition from 
numbers as practical things to numbers as formal things. Once you have

decided to try to capsulize all of number theory in an ideal system, is it 
really possible to do the job completely? Are numbers so clean and crystal-
line and regular that their nature can be completely captured in the rules of 
a formal system? The picture Liberation (Fig. 13), one of Escher's most 
beautiful, is a marvelous contrast between the formal and the informal, 
with a fascinating transition region. Are numbers really as free as birds? Do 
they suffer as much from being crystallized into a rule-obeying system? Is 
there a magical transition region between numbers in reality and numbers 
on paper? 
When I speak of the properties of natural numbers, I don't just mean 
properties such as the sum of a particular pair of integers. That can be 
found out by counting, and anybody who has grown up in this century 
cannot doubt the mechanizability of such processes as counting, adding, 
multiplying, and so on. I mean the kinds of properties which mathemati-
cians are interested in exploring, questions for which no counting-process 
is sufficient to provide the answer-not even theoretically sufficient. Let us 
take a classic example of such a property of natural numbers. The state-
ment is: "There are infinitely many prime numbers." First of all, there is no 
counting process which will ever be able to confirm, or refute, this asser-
tion. The best we could do would be to count primes for a while and 
concede that there are "a lot". But no amount of counting alone would ever 
resolve the question of whether the number of primes is finite or infinite. 
There could always be more. The statement-and it is called "Euclid's 
Theorem" (notice the capital "T")--is quite unobvious. It may seem 
reasonable, or appealing, but it is not obvious. However, mathematicians 
since Euclid have always called it true. What is the reason? 
Euclid's Proof 
The reason is that reasoning tells them it is so. Let us follow the reasoning 
involved. We wiIllook at a variant of Euclid's proof. This proof works by 
showing that whatever number you pick, there is a prime larger than it. 
Pick a number-No Multiply all the positive integers starting with 1 and 
ending with N; in other words, form the factorial of N, written "N!". What 
you get is divisible by every number up to N. When you add 1 to N!, the 
result 
58 
can't be a multiple of 2 (because it leaves lover, 
when you divide by 2); 
can't be a multiple of 3 (because it leaves lover, 
when you divide by 3); 
can't be a multiple of 4 
(because it leaves lover, 
when you divide by 4); 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 

can't be a multiple of N 
(because it leaves lover, 
when you divide by N); 
In other words, N! + 1, if it is divisible at all (other than by 1 and itself), 
only is divisible by numbers greater than N. So either it is itself prime, or its 
prime divisors are greater than N. But in either case we've shown there 
must exist a prime above N. The process holds no matter what number N 
is. Whatever N is, there is a prime greater than N. And thus ends the 
demonstration of the infinitude of the primes. 
This last step, incidentally, is called generalization, and we will meet it 
again later in a more formal context. It is where we phrase an argument in 
terms of a single number (N), and then point out that N was unspecified 
and therefore the argument is a general one. 
Euclid's proof is typical of what constitutes "real mathematics". It is 
simple, compelling, and beautiful. It illustrates that by taking several rather 
short steps one can get a long way from one's starting point. In our case, the 
starting points are basic ideas about multiplication and division and so 
forth. The short steps are the steps of reasoning. And though every 
individual step of the reasoning seems obvious, the end result is not obvi-
ous. We can never check directly whether the statement is true or not; yet 
we believe it, because we believe in reasoning. If you accept reasoning, 
there seems to be no escape route; once you agree to hear Euclid out, you'll 
have to agree with his conclusion. That's most fortunate-because it means 
that mathematicians will always agree on what statements to label "true", 
and what statements to label "false". 
This proof exemplifies an orderly thought process. Each statement is 
related to previous ones in an irresistible way. This is why it is called a 
"proof" rather than just "good evidence". In mathematics the goal is 
always to give an ironclad proof for some unobvious statement. The very 
fact of the steps being linked together in an ironclad way suggests that 
there may be a patterned structure binding these statements together. This 
structure can best be exposed by finding a new vocabulary-a stylized 
vocabulary, consisting of symbols-suitable only for expressing statements 
about numbers. Then we can look at the proof as it exists in its translated 
version. It will be a set of statements which are related, line by line, in some 
detectable way. But the statements, since they're represented by means of a 
small and stylized set of symbols, take on the aspect of patterns. In other 
words, though when read aloud, they seem to be statements about numbers 
and their properties, still when looked at on paper, they seem to be abstract 
patterns-and the line-by-Iine structure of the proof may start to look like a 
slow transformation of patterns according to some few typographical rules. 
Getting Around Infinity 
Although Euclid's proof is a proof that all numbers have a certain property, 
it avoids treating each of the infinitely many cases separately. It gets around 
Meaning and Form in Mathematics 
59 

it by using phrases like "whatever N is", or "no matter what number N is". 
We could also phrase the proof over again, so that it uses the phrase "all N". 
By knowing the appropriate context and correct ways of using such 
phrases, we never have to deal with infinitely many statements. We deal 
with just two or three concepts, such as the word "all"-which, though 
themselves finite, embody an infinitude; and by using them, we sidestep the 
apparent problem that there are an infinite number of facts we want to 
prove. 
We use the word "all" in a few ways which are defined by the thought 
processes of reasoning. That is, there are rules which our usage of "all" 
obeys. We may be unconscious of them, and tend to claim we operate on 
the basis of the meaning of the word: but that, after all, is only a circumlocu-
tion for saying that we are guided by rules which we never make explicit. 
We have used words all our lives in certain patterns, and instead of calling 
the patterns "rules", we attribute the courses of our thought processes to 
the "meanings" of words. That discovery was a crucial recognition in the 
long path towards the formalization of number theory. 
If we were to delve into Euclid's proof more and more carefully, we 
would see that it is composed of many, many small-almost infinitesimal-
steps. If all those steps were written out line after line, the proof would 
appear incredibly complicated. To our minds it is clearest when several 
steps are telescoped together, to form one single sentence. If we tried to 
look at the proof in slow motion, we would begin to discern individual 
frames. In other words, the dissection can go only so far, and then we hit 
the "atomic" nature of reasoning processes. A proof can be broken down 
into a series of tiny but discontinuous jumps which seem to flow smoothly 
when perceived from a higher vantage point. In Chapter VIII, I will show 
one way of breaking the proof into atomic units, and you will see how 
incredibly many steps are involved. Perhaps it should not surprise you, 
though. The operations in Euclid's brain when he invented the proof must 
have involved millions of neurons (nerve cells), many of which fired several 
hundred times in a single second. The mere utterance of a sentence 
involves hundreds of thousands of neurons. If Euclid's thoughts were that 
complicated, it makes sense for his proof to contain a huge number of 
steps! (There may be little direct connection between the neural actions in 
his brain, and a proof in our formal system, but the complexities of the two 
are comparable. It is as if nature wants the complexity of the proof of the 
infinitude of primes to be conserved, even when the systems involved are 
very different from each other.) 
In Chapters to come, we will lay out a formal system that (1) includes a 
stylized vocabulary in which all statements about natural numbers can be 
expressed, and (2) has rules corresponding to all the types of reasoning 
which seem necessary. A very important question will be whether the rules 
for symbol manipulation which we have then formulated are really of equal 
power (as far as number theory is concerned) to our usual mental reason-
ing abilities-or, more generally, whether it is theoretically possible to 
attain the level of our thinking abilities, by using some formal system.

CHAPTER III 
Figure and Ground 
Primes vs. Composites 
THERE IS A strangeness to the idea that concepts can be captured by simple 
typographical manipulations. The one concept so far captured is that of 
addition, and it may not have appeared very strange. But suppose the goal 
were to create a formal system with theorems of the form Px, the letter 'x' 
standing for a hyphen-string, and where the only such theorems would be 
ones in which the hyphen-string contained exactly a prime number of 
hyphens. Thus, P--- would be a theorem, but P---- would not. How 
could this be done typographically? First, it is important to specify dearly 
what is meant by typographical operations. The complete repertoire has 
been presented in the MIU-system and the pq-system, so we really only 
need to make a list of the kinds of things we have permitted: 
(1) 
reading and recognizing any of a finite set of symbols; 
(2) 
writing down any symbol belonging to that set; 
(3) 
copying any of those symbols from one place to another; 
(4) 
erasing any of those symbols; 
(5) 
checking to see whether one symbol is the same as another; 
(6) 
keeping and using a list of previously generated theorems. 
The list is a little redundant, but no matter. What is important is that it 
clearly involves only trivial abilities, each of them far less than the ability to 
distinguish primes from nonprimes. How, then, could we compound some 
of these operations to make a formal system in which primes are distin-
guished from composite numbers? 
The tq-System 
A first step might be to try to solve a simpler, but related, problem. We 
could try to make a system similar to the pq-system, except that it repre-
sents multiplication, instead of addition. Let's call it the tq-system, 't' for 
'times'. More specifically, suppose X, Y, and Z are, respectively, the num-
bers of hyphens in the hyphen-strings x, y, and z. (Notice I am taking 
special pains to distinguish between a string and the number of hyphens it 
contains.) Then we wish the string x ty q z to be a theorem if and only if X 
times Y equals Z. For instance, -- t---q ------ should be a theorem 
because 2 times 3 equals 6, but --t---q--- should not be a theorem. The 
tq-system can be characterized just about as easily as the pq-system-
namely, by using just one axiom schema and one rule of inference: 
64 
Figure and Ground 

AXIOM SCHEMA: 
xt-qx is an axiom, whenever x is a hyphen-string. 
RULE OF INFERENCE: 
Suppose that x, y, and z are all hyphen-strings. And 
suppose that xtyqz is an old theorem. Then, xty-qzx is a new 
theorem. 
Below is the derivation of the theorem --t---q------: 
(1) --t-q--
(2) --t--q----
(3) --t---q------
(axiom) 
(by rule of inference, 
using line (1) as the old theorem) 
(by rule of inference, 
using line (2) as the old theorem) 
Notice how the middle hyphen-string grows by one hyphen each time the 
rule of inference is applied; so it is predictable that if you want a theorem 
with ten hyphens in the middle, you apply the rule of inference nine times 
in a row. 
Capturing Composite ness 
Multiplication, a slightly trickier concept than addition, has now been 
"captured" typographically, like the birds in Escher's Liberation. What about 
primeness? Here's a plan that might seem smart: using the tq-system, 
define a new set of theorems of the form Cx, which characterize composite 
numbers, as follows: 
RULE: 
Suppose x, y, and z are hyphen-strings. If x-ty-qz is a theorem, 
then C z is a theorem. 
This works by saying that Z (the number of hyphens in z) is composite as 
long as it is the product of two numbers greater than I-namely, X + 1 
(the number of hyphens in x-), and Y + I (the number of hyphens in y-). 
I am defending this new rule by giving you some "Intelligent mode" 
justifications for it. That is because you are a human being, and want to 
know why there is such a rule. If you were operating exclusively in the 
"Mechanical mode", you would not need any justification, since M-mode 
workers just follow the rules mechanically and happily, never questioning 
them! 
Because you work in the I-mode, you will tend to blur in your mind the 
distinction between strings and their interpretations. You see, things can 
become quite confusing as soon as you perceive "meaning" in the symbols 
which you are manipulating. You have to fight your own self to keep from 
thinking that the string' ---' is the number 3. The Requirement of Formal-
ity, which in Chapter I probably seemed puzzling (because it seemed so 
obvious), here becomes tricky, and crucial. It is the essential thing which 
keeps you from mixing up the I-mode with the M-mode; or said another 
way, it keeps you from mixing up arithmetical facts with typographical 
theorems.

It is very tempting to jump from the C-type theorems directly to P-type 
theorems, by proposing a rule of the following kind: 
PROPOSED RULE: 
Suppose x is a hyphen-string. If Cx is not a theorem, then 
Px is a theorem. 
The fatal flaw here is that checking whether C x is not a theorem is not an 
explicitly typographical operation. To know for sure that MU is not a 
theorem of the MIU-system, you have to go outside of the system ... and so 
it is with this Proposed Rule. It is a rule which violates the whole idea of 
formal systems, in that it asks you to operate informally-that is, outside 
the system. Typographical operation (6) allows you to look into the 
stockpile of previously found theorems, but this Proposed Rule is asking 
you to look into a hypothetical "Table of Nontheorems". But in order to 
generate such a table, you would have to do some reasoning outside the 
system-reasoning which shows why various strings cannot be generated 
inside the system. Now it may well be that there is another formal system 
which can generate the "Table of Nontheorems", by purely typographical 
means. In fact, our aim is to find just such a system. But the Proposed Rule 
is not a typographical rule, and must be dropped. 
This is such an important point that we might dwell on it a bit more. In 
our C-system (which includes the tq-system and the rule which defines 
C-type theorems), we have theorems of the form Cx, with 'x' standing, as 
usual, for a hyphen-string. There are also nontheorems of the form Cx. 
(These are what I mean when I refer to "nontheorems", although of course 
tt-Cq q and other ill-formed messes are also nontheorems.) The differ-
ence is that theorems have a composite number of hyphens, nontheorems 
have a prime number of hyphens. :'-Jow the theorems all have a common 
"form", that is, originate from a common set of typographical rules. Do all 
nontheorems also have a common "form", in the same sense? Below is a list 
of C-type theorems, shown without their derivations. The parenthesized 
numbers following them simply count the hyphens in them.

Figure and Ground 

The "holes" in this list are the nontheorems. To repeat the earlier question: 
Do the holes also have some "form" in common? Would it be reasonable to 
say that merely by virtue of being the holes in this list, they share a common 
form? Yes and no. That they share some typographical quality is undeni-
able, but whether we want to call it "form" is unclear. The reason for 
hesitating is that the holes are only negatively defined-they are the things 
that are left out of a list which is positively defined. 
Figure and Ground 
This recalls the famous artistic distinction between figure and ground. When 
a figure or "positive space" (e.g., a human form, or a letter, or a still life) is 
drawn inside a frame, an unavoidable consequence is that its complemen-
tary shape-also called the "ground", or "background", or "negative 
space"-has also been drawn. In most drawings, however, this figure-
ground relationship plays little role. The artist is much less interested in the 
ground than in the figure. But sometimes, an artist will take interest in the 
ground as well. 
There are beautiful alphabets which play with this figure-ground dis-
tinction. A message written in such an alphabet is shown below. At first it 
looks like a collection of somewhat random blobs, but if you step back a 
ways and stare at it for a while, all of a sudden, you will see seven letters 
appear in this ... 
FIGURE 15. 
For a similar effect, take a look at my drawing Smoke Signal (Fig. 139). 
Along these lines, you might consider this puzzle: can you somehow create 
a drawing containing words in both the figure and the ground? 
Let us now officially distinguish between two kinds of figures: cursively 
drawable ones, and recursive ones (by the way, these are my own terms-they 
are not in common usage). A cursively drawable figure is one whose ground 
is merely an accidental by-product of the drawing act. A recursive figure is 
one whose ground can be seen as a figure in its own right. Usually this is 
quite deliberate on the part of the artist. The "re" in "recursive" represents 
the fact that both foreground and background are cursively drawable-the 
figure is "twice-cursive". Each figure-ground boundary in a recursive figure 
is a double-edged sword. M. C. Escher was a master at drawing recursive 
figures-see, for instance, his beautiful recursive drawing of birds (Fig. 16). 
Figure and Ground 
67 

FIGURE 16. 
Tiling of the plane using birds, by M. C. Escher (from a 1942 notebook). 
Our distinction is not as rigorous as one in mathematics, for who can 
definitively say that a particular ground is not a figure? Once pointed out, 
almost any ground has interest of its own. In that sense, every figure is 
recursive. But that is not what I intended by the term. There is a natural 
and intuitive notion of recognizable forms. Are both the foreground and 
background recognizable forms? If so, then the drawing is recursive. If you 
look at the grounds of most line drawings, you will find them rather 
unrecognizable. This demonstrates that 
There exist recognizable forms whose negative space is not any 
recognizable form. 
In more "technical" terminology, this becomes: 
There exist cursively drawable figures which are not recursive. 
Scott Kim's solution to the above puzzle, which I call his "FIGURE-
FIGURE Figure", is shown in Figure 17. If you read both black and white, 
68

you will see "FIGURE" everywhere, but "GROUND" nowhere! It is a paragon 
of recursive figures. In this clever drawing, there are two nonequivalent 
ways of characterizing the black regions: 
(1) 
as the negative space to the white regions; 
(2) 
as altered copies of the white regions (produced by coloring 
and shifting each white region). 
(In the special case of the FIGURE-FIGURE Figure, the two characterizations 
are equivalent-but in most black-and-white pictures, they would not be.) 
Now in Chapter VIII, when we create our Typographical Number Theory 
(TNT), it will be our hope that the set of all false statements of number 
theory can be characterized in two analogous ways: 
(1) 
as the negative space to the set of all TNT -theorems; 
(2) 
as altered copies of the set of all TNT -theorems (prod uced by 
negating each TNT-theorem). 
But this hope will be dashed, because: 
(1) 
inside the set of all nontheorems are found some truths; 
(2) 
outside the set of all negated theorems are found some false-
hoods. 
You will see why and how this happens, in Chapter XIV. Meanwhile, 
ponder over a pictorial representation of the situation (Fig. 18). 
Figure and Ground in Music 
One may also look for figures and grounds in music. One analogue is the 
distinction between melody and accompaniment-for the melody is always 
in the forefront of our attention, and the accompaniment is subsidiary, in 
some sense. Therefore it is surprising when we find, in the lower lines of a 
piece of music, recognizable melodies. This does not happen too often in 
post-baroque music. Usually the harmonies are not thought of as fore-
ground. But in baroque music-in Bach above all-the distinct lines, 
whether high or low or in between, all act as "figures". In this sense, pieces 
by Bach can be called "recursive". 
Another figure-ground distinction exists in music: that between on-
beat and off-beat. If you count notes in a measure "one-and, two-and, 
three-and, four-and", most melody-notes will come on numbers, not on 
"and" 'So But sometimes, a melody will be deliberately pushed onto the 
"and" 's, for the sheer effect of it. This occurs in several etudes for the 
piano by Chopin, for instance. It also occurs in Bach-particularly in his 
Sonatas and Partitas for unaccompanied violin, and his Suites for unac-
companied cello. There, Bach manages to get two or more musical lines 
going simultaneously. Sometimes he does this by having the solo instru-
ment play "double stops"-two notes at once. Other times, however, he

Considerable visual symbolism is featured in this diagram of the relationship 
between various classes of TNT strings. The biggest box represents the set of all TNT strings. 
The next-biggest box represents the set of all well-formed TNT strings. Within it is found the 
set of all sentences of TNT. Now things begin to get interesting. The set of theorems is 
pictured as a tree growing out of a trunk (representing the set of axioms). The tree-symbol was 
chosen because of the recursive growth pattern which it exhibits: new branches (theorems) 
constantly sprouting from old ones. The fingerlike branches probe into the corners of the 
constraining region (the set of truths), yet can never fully occupy it. The boundary between 
the set of truths and the set of falsities is meant to suggest a randomly meandering coastline 
which, no matter how closely you examine it, always has finer levels of structure, and is 
consequently impossible to describe exactly in any finite way. (See B. Mandelbrot's book 
Fractals.) The reflected tree represents the set of negations of theorems: all of them false, 
yet unable collectively to span the space of false statements. [Drawing by the author.] 
puts one voice on the on-beats, and the other voice on the off-beats, so the 
ear separates them and hears two distinct melodies weaving in and out, and 
harmonizing with each other. Needless to say, Bach didn't stop at this level 
of complexity ... 
Recursively Enumerable Sets vs. Recursive Sets 
Now let us carry back the notions of figure and ground to the domain of 
formal systems. In our example, the role of positive space is played by the 
C-type theorems, and the role of negative space is played by strings with a

prime number of hyphens. So far, the only way we have found to represent 
prime numbers typographically is as a negative space. Is there, however, 
some way-I don't care how complicated-of representing the primes as a 
positive space-that is, as a set of theorems of some formal system? 
Different people's intuitions give different answers here. I remember 
quite vividly how puzzled and intrigued I was upon realizing the difference 
between a positive characterization and a negative characterization. I was 
quite convinced that not only the primes, but any set of numbers which 
could be represented negatively, could also be represented positively. The 
intuition underlying my belief is represented by the question: "How could a 
figure and its ground not carry exactly the same information?" They seemed to me 
to embody the same information, just coded in two complementary ways. 
What seems right to you? 
It turns out I was right about the primes, but wrong in general. This 
astonished me, and continues to astonish me even today. It is a fact that: 
There exist formal systems whose negative space (set of non-
theorems) is not the positive space (set of theorems) of any formal 
system. 
This result, it turns out, is of depth equal to Godel's Theorem-so it is not 
surprising that my intuition was up~et. I, just like the mathematicians of the 
early twentieth century, expected the world of formal systems and natural 
numbers to be more predictable than it is. In more technical terminology, 
this becomes: 
There exist recursively enumerable sets which are not recursive. 
The phrase recursively enumerable (often abbreviated "Le.") is the mathemat-
ical counterpart to our artistic notion of "cursively drawable"-and recursive 
is the counterpart of "recursive". For a set of strings to be "Le." means that 
it can be generated according to typographical rules-for example, the set 
of C-type theorems, the set of theorems of the MIU-system-indeed, the 
set of theorems of any formal system. This could be compared with the 
conception of a "figure" as "a set of lines which can be generated according 
to artistic rules" (whatever that might mean!). And a "recursive set" is like a 
figure whose ground is also a figure--not only is it Le., but its complement 
is also Le. 
It follows from the above result that: 
There exist formal systems for which there is no typographical 
decision proced ure. 
How does this follow? Very simply. A typographical decision procedure is a 
method which tells theorems from nontheorems. The existence of such a 
test allows us to generate all nontheorems systematically, simply by going 
down a list of all strings and performing the test on them one at a time, 
discarding ill-formed strings and theorems along the way. This amounts to 
72 
Figure and Ground 

a typographical method for generating the set of nontheorems. But accord-
ing to the earlier statement (which we here accept on faith), for some 
systems this is not possible. So we must conclude that typographical deci-
sion procedures do not exist for all formal systems. 
Suppose we found a set F of natural numbers ('F' for 'Figure') which 
we could generate in some formal way-like the composite numbers. Sup-
pose its complement is the set G (for 'Ground')-like the primes. Together, 
F and G make up all the natural numbers, and we know a rule for making 
all the numbers in set F, but we know no such rule for making all the 
numbers in set G. It is important to understand that if the members of F 
were always generated in order of increasing size, then we could always 
characterize G. The problem is that many r.e. sets are generated by 
methods which throw in elements in an arbitrary order, so you never know 
if a number which has been skipped over for a long time will get included if 
you just wait a little longer. 
We answered no to the artistic question, "Are all figures recursive?" 
We have now seen that we must likewise answer no to the analogous 
question in mathematics: "Are all sets recursive?" With this perspective, let 
us now come back to the elusive word "form". Let us take our figure-set F 
and our ground-set G again. We can agree that all the numbers in set F 
have some common "form"-but can the same be said about numbers in set 
G? It is a strange question. When we are dealing with an infinite set to start 
with-the natural numbers-the holes created by removing some subset 
may be very hard to define in any explicit way. And so it may be that they 
are not connected by any common attribute or "form". In the last analysis, 
it is a matter of taste whether you want to use the word "form"-butjust 
thinking about it is provocative. Perhaps it is best not to define "form", but 
to leave it with some intuitive fluidity. 
Here is a puzzle to think about in connection with the above matters. 
Can you characterize the following set of integers (or its negative space)?

How is this sequence like the FIGURE-FIGURE Figure? 
Primes as Figure Rather than Ground 
Finally, what about a formal system for generating primes? How is it done? 
The trick is to skip right over multiplication, and to go directly to nondivisi-
bility as the thing to represent positively. Here are an axiom schema and a 
rule for producing theorems which represent the notion that one number 
does not divide (0 NO) another number exactly: 
AXIOM SCHEMA: 
xy 0 N Ox where x and yare hyphen-strings. 
For example, -----ON 0--, where x has been replaced by '--' and y by 
, 
, 
Figure and Ground 
73 

RULE: If x 0 N Oy is a theorem, then so is x 0 N Oxy. 
If you use the rule twice, you can generate this theorem: 
-----ON 0------------
which is interpreted as "5 does not divide 12". But ---0 N 0------ is 
not a theorem. What goes wrong if you try to produce it? 
Now in order to determine that a given number is prime, we have to 
build up some knowledge about its nondivisibility properties. In particular, 
we want to know that it is not divisible by 2 or 3 or 4, etc., all the way up to 1 
less than the number itself. But we can't be so vague in formal systems as to 
say "et cetera". We must spell things out. We would like to have a way of 
saying, in the language of the system, "the number Z is divisorjree up toX", 
meaning that no number between 2 and X divides Z. This can be done, but 
there is a trick to it. Think about it if you want. 
Here is the solution: 
RULE: If --0 N Oz is a theorem, so is z 0 F--. 
RULE: If z 0 Fx is a theorem and also x-O N OZ IS a theorem, then 
z 0 Fx- is a theorem. 
These two rules capture the notion of divisorjreeness. All we need to do is to 
say that primes are numbers which are divisor-free up to 1 less than 
themselves: 
RULE: If z-OFz is a theorem, then pz- is a theorem. 
Oh-Iet's not forget that 2 is prime~ 
AXIOM: 
P--. 
And there you have it. The principle of representing primality formally is 
that there is a test for divisibility which can be done without any backtrack-
ing. You march steadily upward, testing first for divisibility by 2, then by 3, 
and so on. It is this "monotonicity" or unidirectionality-this absence of 
cross-play between lengthening and shortening, increasing and 
decreasing-that allows primality to be captured. And it is this potential 
complexity of formal systems to involve arbitrary amounts of backwards-
forwards interference that is responsible for such limitative results as 
Godel's Theorem, Turing's Halting Problem, and the fact that not all 
recursively enumerable sets are recursive.

Achilles has come to visit his friend and jogging 
companion, the Tortoise, at his home. 
Achilles: 
Heavens, you certainly have an admirable boomerang collection! 
Tortoise: 
Oh, pshaw. No better than that of any other Tortoise. And now, 
would you like to step into the parlor? 
Achilles: 
Fine. (Walks to the corner of the room.) I see you also have a large 
collection of records. What sort of music do you enjoy? 
Tortoise: 
Sebastian Bach isn't so bad, in my opinion. But these days, I must 
say, I am developing more and more of an interest in a rather 
specialized sort of music. 
Achilles: 
Tell me, what kind of music is that? 
Tortoise: 
A type of music which you are most unlikely to have heard of. I 
call it "music to break phonographs by". 
Achilles: 
Did you say "to break phonographs by"? That is a curious con-
cept. I can just see you, sledgehammer in hand, whacking one 
phonograph after another to pieces, to the strains of Beet-
hoven's heroic masterpiece Wellington's Victory. 
Tortoise: 
That's not quite what this music is about. However, you might 
find its true nature just as intriguing. Perhaps I should give you 
a brief description of it? 
Achilles: 
Exactly what I was thinking. 
Tortoise: 
Relatively few people are acquainted with it. It all began when 
my friend the Crab-have you met him, by the way?-paid me 
a visit. 
Achilles: 
'twould be a pleasure to make his acquaintance, I'm sure. 
Though I've heard so much about him, I've never met him. 
Tortoise: 
Sooner or later I'll get the two of you together. You'd hit it off 
splendidly. Perhaps we could meet at random in the park one 
day ... 
Achilles: 
Capital suggestion! I'll be looking forward to it. But you were 
going to tell me about your weird "music to smash phono-
graphs by", weren't you? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, yes. Well, you see, the Crab came over to visit one day. You 
must understand that he's always had a weakness for fancy 
gadgets, and at that time he was quite an aficionado for, of all 
things, record players. He had just bought his first record 
player, and being somewhat gullible, believed every word the 
salesman had told him about it-in particular, that it was capa-
ble of reproducing any and all sounds. In short, he was con-
vinced that it was a Perfect phonograph. 
C ontracrostipunctus 
75 

Achilles: 
Naturally, I suppose you disagreed. 
Tortoise: 
True, but he would hear nothing of my arguments. He staunchly 
maintained that any sound whatever was reproducible on his 
machine. Since I couldn't convince him of the contrary, I left it 
at that. But not long after that, I returned the visit, taking with 
me a record of a song which I had myself composed. The song 
was called "I Cannot Be Played on Record Player 1". 
Achilles: 
Rather unusual. Was it a present for the Crab? 
Tortoise: 
Absolutely. I suggested that we listen to it on his new phono-
graph, and he was very glad to oblige me. So he put it on. But 
unfortunately, after only a few notes, the record player began 
vibrating rather severely, and then with a loud "pop", broke 
into a large number of fairly small pieces, scattered all about 
the room. The record was utterly destroyed also, needless to 
say. 
Achilles: 
Calamitous blow for the poor fellow, I'd say. What was the matter 
with his record player? 
Tortoise: 
Really, there was nothing the matter, nothing at all. It simply 
couldn't reproduce the sounds on the record which I had 
brought him, because they were sounds that would make it 
vibrate and break. 
Achilles: 
Odd, isn't it? I mean, I thought it was a Perfect phonograph. 
That's what the salesman had told him, after all. 
Tortoise: 
Surely, Achilles, you don't believe everything that salesmen tell 
you! Are you as naive as the Crab was? 
Achilles: 
The Crab was naiver by far! I know that salesmen are notorious 
prevaricators. I wasn't born yesterday! 
Tortoise: 
In that case, maybe you can imagine that this particular salesman 
had somewhat exaggerated the quality of the Crab's piece of 
equipment . .. perhaps it was indeed less than Perfect, and 
could not reproduce every possible sound. 
Achilles: 
Perhaps that is an explanation. But there's no explanation for the 
amazing coincidence that your record had those very sounds 
on it ... 
Tortoise: 
Unless they got put there deliberately. You see, before returning 
the Crab's visit, I went to the store where the Crab had bought 
his machine, and inquired as to the make. Having ascertained 
that, I sent off to the manufacturers for a description of its 
design. After receiving that by return mail, I analyzed the 
entire construction of the phonograph and discovered a cer-
tain set of sounds which, if they were produced anywhere in 
the vicinity, would set the device to shaking and eventually to 
falling apart. 
Achilles: 
Nasty fellow! You needn't spell out for me the last details: that 
you recorded those sounds yourself, and offered the dastardly 
item as a gift ...

Tortoise: 
Clever devil! You jumped ahead of the story! But that wasn't the 
end of the adventure, by any means, for the Crab did not 
believe that his record player was at fault. He was quite stub-
born. So he went out and bought a new record player, this one 
even more expensive, and this time the salesman promised to 
give him double his money back in case the Crab found a sound 
which it could not reproduce exactly. So the Crab told me 
excitedly about his new model, and I promised to come over 
and see it. 
Tell me if I'm wrong-I bet that before you did so, you once 
again wrote the manufacturer, and composed and recorded a 
new song called "I Cannot Be Played on Record Player 2", 
based on the construction of the new model. 
Utterly brilliant deduction, Achilles. You've quite got the spirit. 
So what happened this time? 
As you might expect, precisely the same thing. The phonograph 
fell into innumerable pieces, and the record was shattered. 
Consequently, the Crab finally became convinced that there can 
be no such thing as a Perfect record player. 
Rather surprisingly, that's not quite what happened. He was sure 
that the next model up would fill the bill, and having twice the 
money, he-
Oho-I have an idea! He could have easily outwitted you, by 
obtaining a LOW-fidelity phonograph-one that was not capa-
ble of reproducing the sounds which would destroy it. In that 
way, he would avoid your trick. 
Surely, but that would defeat the·original purpose-namely, to 
have a phonograph which could reproduce any sound what-
soever, even its own self-breaking sound, which is of course 
impossible. 
That's true. I see the dilemma now. If any record player-say 
Record Player X-is sufficiently high-fidelity, then when it 
attempts to play the song "I Cannot Be Played on Record 
Player X", it will create just those vibrations which will cause it 
to break ... So it fails to be Perfect. And yet, the only way to get 
around that trickery, namely for Record Player X to be of 
lower fidelity, even more directly ensures that it is not Perfect. 
It seems that every record player is vulnerable to one or the 
other of these frailties, and hence all record players are defec-
tive. 
I don't see why you call them "defective". It is simply an inherent 
fact about record players that they can't do all that you might 
wish them to be able to do. But if there is a defect anywhere, it 
is not in THEM, but in your expectations of what they should be 
able to do! And the Crab was just full of such unrealistic 
expectations. 
Contracrostipunctus 
77 

Achilles: 
Compassion for the Crab overwhelms me. High fidelity or low 
fidelity, he loses either way. 
Tortoise: 
And so, our little game went on like this for a few more rounds, 
and eventually our friend tried to become very smart. He got 
wind of the principle upon which I was basing my own records, 
and decided to try to outfox me. He wrote to the phonograph 
makers, and described a device of his own invention, which 
they built to specification. He called it "Record Player Omega". 
It was considerably more sophisticated than an ordinary record 
player. 
Achilles: 
Let me guess how: Did it have no moving parts? Or was it made 
of cotton? Or-
Tortoise: 
Let me tell you, instead. That will save some time. In the first 
place, Record Player Omega incorporated a television camera 
whose purpose it was to scan any record before playing it. This 
camera was hooked up to a small built-in computer, which 
would determine exactly the nature of the sounds, by looking 
at the groove-patterns. 
Achilles: 
Yes, so far so good. But what could Record Player Omega do with 
this information? 
Tortoise: 
By elaborate calculations, its little computer figured out what 
effects the sounds would have upon its phonograph. If it de-
duced that the sounds were such that they would cause the 
machine in its present configuration to break, then it did some-
thing very clever. Old Omega contained a device which could 
disassemble large parts of its phonograph subunit, and rebuild 
them in new ways, so that it could, in effect, change its own 
structure. If the sounds were "dangerous", a new configuration 
was chosen, one to which the sounds would pose no threat, and 
this new configuration would then be built by the rebuilding 
subunit, under direction of the little computer. Only after this 
rebuilding operation would Record Player Omega attempt to 
play the record. 
Achilles: 
Aha! That must have spelled the end of your tricks. I bet you 
were a little disappointed. 
Tortoise: 
Curious that you should think so ... I don't suppose that you 
know Godel's Incompleteness Theorem backwards and for-
wards, do you? 
Achilles: 
Know WHOSE Theorem backwards and forwards? I've never 
heard of anything that sounds like that. I'm sure it's fascinat-
ing, but I'd rather hear more about "music to break records 
by". It's an amusing little story. Actually, I guess I can fill in the 
end. Obviously, there was no point in going on, and so you 
sheepishly admitted defeat, and that was that. Isn't that exactly 
it? 
Tortoise: 
What! It's almost midnight! I'm afraid it's my bedtime. I'd love to 
talk some more, but really I am growing quite sleepy.

call it "G"-were the one? Tell me, where did you come across 
Goblet G? 
Sorry, but that's MY little secret. But you might like to know who 
its maker is. 
Pray tell, who is it? 
Ever hear of the famous glassblower Johann Sebastian Bach? 
Well, he wasn't exactly famous for glassblowing-but he dab-
bled at the art as a hobby, though hardly a soul knows it-and 
this goblet is the last piece he blew. 
Literally his last one? My gracious. If it truly was made by Bach, 
its value is inestimable. But how are you sure of its maker? 
Look at the inscription on the inside-do you see where the 
letters 'B', 'A', 'C', 'H' have been etched? 
Sure enough! What an extraordinary thing. (Gently sets Goblet G 
down on a shelf) By the way, did you know that each of the four 
letters in Bach's name is the name of a musical note? 
, tisn't possible, is it? After all, musical notes only go from 'A' 
through 'G'. 
Just so; in most countries, that's the case. But in Germany, Bach's 
own homeland, the convention has always been similar, except 
that what we call 'B', they call 'H', and what we call 'B-Hat', they 
call 'B'. For instance, we talk about Bach's "Mass in B Minor", 
whereas they talk about his "H-moll Messe". Is that clear? 
... hmm ... I guess so. It's a little confusing: H is B, and B is 
B-Hat. I suppose his name actually constitutes a melody, then. 
Strange but true. In fact, he worked that melody subtly into one 
of his most elaborate musical pieces-namely, the final Con-
trapunctus in his Art cif the Fugue. It was the last fugue Bach ever 
wrote. When I heard it for the first time, I had no idea how it 
would end. Suddenly, without warning, it broke off. And then 
... dead silence. I realized immediately that was where Bach 
died. It is an indescribably sad moment, and the effect it had on 
me was-shattering. In any case, B-A-C-H is the last theme of 
that fugue. It is hidden inside the piece. Bach didn't point it out

explicitly, but if you know about it, you can find it without 
much trouble. Ah, me-there are so many clever ways of hid-
ing things in music ... 
Achilles: 
... or in poems. Poets used to do very similar things, you know 
(though it's rather out of style these days). For instance, Lewis 
Carroll often hid words and names in the first letters (or 
characters) of the successive lines in poems he wrote. Poems 
which conceal messages that way are called "acrostics". 
Tortoise: 
Bach, too, occasionally wrote acrostics, which isn't surprising. 
After all, counterpoint and acrostics, with their levels of hidden 
meaning, have quite a bit in common. Most acrostics, however, 
have only one hidden level-but there is no reason that one 
couldn't make a double-decker-an acrostic on top of an acros-
tic. Or one could make a "contracrostic"-where the initial 
letters, taken in reverse order, form a message. Heavens! 
There's no end to the possibilities inherent in the form. 
Moreover, it's not limited to poets; anyone could write 
acrostics-even a dialogician. 
Achilles: 
A dial-a-Iogician? That's a new one on me. 
Tortoise: 
Correction: I said "dialogician", by which I meant a writer of 
dialogues. Hmm ... something just occurred to me. In the 
unlikely event that a dialogician should write a contrapuntal 
acrostic in homage to J. S. Bach, do you suppose it would be 
more proper for him to acrostically embed his OWN name-<>r 
that of Bach? Oh, well, why worry about such frivolous mat-
ters? Anybody who wanted to write such a piece could make up 
his own mind. Now getting back to Bach's melodic name, did 
you know that the melody B-A-C-H, if played upside down and 
backwards, is exactly the same as the original? 
Achilles: 
How can anything be played upside down? Backwards, I can 
see-you get H-C-A-B-but upside down? You must be pulling 
my leg. 
Tortoise: 
' pon my word, you're quite a skeptic, aren't you? Well, I guess 
I'll have to give you a demonstration. Let me just go and fetch 
my fiddle- (Walks into the next room, and returns in a jiffy with an 
ancient-looking violin.) -and play it for you forwards and back-
wards and every which way. Let's see, now ... (Places his copy of 
the Art of the Fugue on his music stand and opens it to the last page.) 
... here's the last Contrapunctus, and here's the last theme ... 
The Tortoise begins to play: B-A-C-
-
but as he bows 
the final H, suddenly, without warning, a shattering 
sound rudely interrupts his performance. Both he and 
Achilles spin around, just in time to catch a glimpse of 
myriad fragments of glass tinkling to the floor from the 
shelf where Goblet G had stood, only moments before. And 
then . . . dead silence.

CHAPTER IV 
Consistency, Completeness, 
and Geometry 
Implicit and Explicit Meaning 
I N CHAPTER I I, we saw how meaning-at least in the relatively simple 
context of formal systems-arises when there is an isomorphism between 
rule-governed symbols, and things in the real world. The more complex 
the isomorphism, in general, the more "equipment"-both hardware and 
software-is required to extract the meaning from the symbols. If an 
isomorphism is very simple (or very familiar), we are tempted to say that 
the meaning which it allows us to see is explicit. We see the meaning 
without seeing the isomorphism. The most blatant example is human 
language, where people often attribute meaning to words in themselves, 
without being in the slightest aware of the very complex "isomorphism" 
that imbues them with meanings. This is an easy enough error to make. It 
attributes all the meaning to the o~iect (the word), rather than to the link 
between that object and the real world. You might compare it to the naive 
belief that noise is a necessary side effect of any collision of two objects. 
This is a false belief; if two objects collide in a vacuum, there will be no 
noise at all. Here again, the error stems from attributing the noise exclu-
sively to the collision, and not recognizing the role of the medium, which 
carries it from the objects to the ear. 
Above, I used the word "isomorphism" in quotes to indicate that it 
must be taken with a grain of salt. The symbolic processes which underlie 
the understanding of human language are so much more complex than the 
symbolic processes in typical formal systems, that, if we want to continue 
thinking of meaning as mediated by isomorphisms, we shall have to adopt a 
far more flexible conception of what isomorphisms can be than we have up 
till now. In my opinion, in fact, the key element in answering the question 
"What is consciousness?" will be the unraveling of the nature of the "iso-
morphism" which underlies meaning. 
Explicit Meaning of the Contracrostipunctus 
All this is by way of preparation for a discussion of the 
Contracrostipunctus-a study in levels of meaning. The Dialogue has both 
explicit and implicit meanings. Its most explicit meaning is simply the story 
82 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

which was related. This "explicit" meaning is, strictly speaking, extremely 
implicit, in the sense that the brain processes required to understand the 
events in the story, given only the black marks on paper, are incredibly 
complex. Nevertheless, we shall consider the events in the story to be the 
explicit meaning of the Dialogue, and assume that every reader of English 
uses more or less the same "isomorphism" in sucking that meaning from 
the marks on the paper. 
Even so, I'd like to be a little more explicit about the explicit meaning 
of the story. First I'll talk about the record players and the records. The 
main point is that there are two levels of meaning for the grooves in the 
records. Level One is that of music. Now what is "music"-a sequence of 
vibrations in the air, or a succession of emotional responses in a brain? It is 
both. But before there can be emotional responses, there have to be 
vibrations. Now the vibrations get "pulled" out of the grooves by a record 
player, a relatively straightforward device; in fact you can do it with a pin, 
just pulling it down the grooves. After this stage, the ear converts the 
vibrations into firings of auditory neurons in the brain. Then ensue a 
number of stages in the brain, which gradually transform the linear se-
quence of vibrations into a complex pattern of interacting emotional 
responses-far too complex for us to go into here, much though I would 
like to. Let us therefore content ourselves with thinking of the sounds in 
the air as the "Level One" meaning of the grooves. 
What is the Level Two meaning of the grooves? It is the sequence of 
vibrations induced in the record player. This meaning can only arise after 
the Level One meaning has been pulled out of the grooves, since the 
vibrations in the air cause the vibrations in the phonograph. Therefore, the 
Level Two meaning depends upon a chain of two isomorphisms: 
(1) 
isomorphism between arbitrary groove patterns and air vi-
brations; 
(2) 
isomorphism between arbitrary air vibrations and phono-
graph vibrations. 
This chain of two isomorphisms is depicted in Figure 20. Notice that 
isomorphism 1 is the one which gives rise to the Level One meaning. The 
Level Two meaning is more implicit than the Level One meaning, because 
it is mediated by the chain of two isomorphisms. It is the Level Two 
meaning which "backfires", causing the record player to break apart. What 
is of interest is that the production of the Level One meaning forces the 
production of the Level Two meaning simultaneously-there is no way to 
have Level One without Level Two. So it was the implicit meaning of the 
record which turned back on it, and destroyed it. 
Similar comments apply to the goblet. ,One difference is that the 
mapping from letters of the alphabet to musical notes is one more level of 
isomorphism, which we could call "transcription". That is followed by 
"translation"-conversion of musical notes into musical sounds. There-
after, the vibrations act back on the goblet just as they did on the escalating 
series of phonographs. 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry

Phonograph 
+ Record 
FlCURE 20. 
Visual rendition of the principle underlying Codet's Theorem: two back-to-
back mappings which have an unexpected boomeranging effect. The first is from groove-
patterns to sounds, carried out by a phonograph. The second-familiar, but usually ignored-
is from sounds to vibrations of the phonograph. Note that the second mapping exists indepen-
dently of the first one,for any sound in the vicinity, not just ones produced by the phonograph 
itself, will cause such vibrations. The paraphrase of Codet's Theorem says that for any record 
player, there are records which it cannot play because they will cause its indirect self-
destruction. [Drawing by the author.] 
Implicit Meanings of the Contracrostipunctus 
What about implicit meanings of the Dialogue? (Yes, it has more than one 
of these.) The simplest of these has already been pointed out in the 
paragraphs above-namely, that the events in the two halves of the 
dialogue are roughly isomorphic to each other: the phonograph becomes a 
violin, the Tortoise becomes Achilles, the Crab becomes the Tortoise, the 
grooves become the etched autograph, etc. Once you notice this simple 
isomorphism, you can go a little further. Observe that in the first half of the 
story, the Tortoise is the perpetrator of all the mischief, while in the second 
half, he is the victim. What do you know, but his own method has turned 
around and backfired on him! Reminiscent of the backfiring of the records' 
music-or the goblet'S inscript.ion-or perhaps of the Tortoise's 
boomerang collection? Yes, indeed. The story is about backfiring on two 
levels, as follows ... 
Level One: 
Goblets and records which backfire; 
Level Two: The Tortoise's devilish method of exploiting implicit 
meaning to cause backfires-which backfires. 
Therefore we can even make an isomorphism between the two levels of the 
story, in which we equate the way in which the records and goblet 
boomerang back to destroy themselves, with the way in which the Tortoise's 
own fiendish method boomerangs back to get him in the end. Seen this 
84 
ConSistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

way, the story itself is an example of the backfirings which it discusses. So 
we can think of the Contracrostipunctus as referring to itself indirectly, in 
that its own structure is isomorphic to the events it portrays. (Exactly as the 
goblet and records refer implicitly to themselves via the back-to-back iso-
morphisms of playing and vibration-causing.) One may read the Dialogue 
without perceiving this fact, of course-but it is there all the time. 
Mapping Between the Contracrostipunctus 
and Godel's Theorem 
Now you may feel a little dizzy-but the best is yet to come. (Actually, some 
levels of implicit meaning will not even be discussed here-they will be left 
for you to ferret out.) The deepest reason for writing this Dialogue was to 
illustrate Godel's Theorem, which, as I said in the Introduction, relies 
heavily on two different levels of meaning of statements of number theory. 
Each of the two halves of the Contracrostipunctus is an "isomorphic copy" of 
Godel's Theorem. Because this mapping is the central idea of the Dialogue, 
and is rather elaborate, I have carefully charted it out below. 
phonograph ¢:=? axiomatic system for number theory 
low-fidelity phonograph ¢:=? "weak" axiomatic system 
high-fidelity phonograph ¢:=? "strong" axiomatic system 
"Perfect" phonograph ¢:=? complete system for number theory 
"blueprint" of phonograph ¢:=? axioms and rules of formal system 
record ¢:=? string of the formal system 
playable record ¢:=? theorem of the axiomatic system 
un playable record ¢:=? non theorem of the axiomatic system 
sound ¢:=? true statement of number theory 
reproducible sound ¢:=? interpreted theorem of the system 
un reproducible sound ¢:=? true statement which isn't a theorem 
song title: 
¢:=? implicit meaning of Codel's string: 
"I Cannot Be Played 
"I Cannot Be Derived 
on Record Player X" 
in Formal System X" 
This is not the full extent of the isomorphism between Godel's Theo-
rem and the Contracrostipunctus, but it is the core of it. You need not worry 
if you don't fully grasp Godel's Theorem by now-there are still a few 
Chapters to go before we reach it! Nevertheless, having read this Dialogue, 
you have already tasted some of the flavor of Godel's Theorem without 
necessarily being aware of it. I now leave you to look for any other types of 
implicit meaning in the Contracrostipunctus. "Quaerendo invenietis!"

The Art of the Fugue 
A few words on the Art of the Fugue . .. Composed in the last year of Bach's 
life, it is a collection of eighteen fugues all based on one theme. Apparently, 
writing the Musical Offering was an inspiration to Bach. He decided to 
compose another set of fugues on a much simpler theme, to demonstrate 
the full range of possibilites inherent in the form. In the Art r.if the Fugue, 
Bach uses a very simple theme in the most complex possible ways. The 
whole work is in a single key. Most of the fugues have four voices, and they 
gradually increase in complexity and depth of expression. Toward the end, 
they soar to such heights of intricacy that one suspects he can no longer 
maintain them. Yet he does ... until the last Contrapunctus. 
The circumstances which cam-ed the break-off of the Art of the Fugue 
(which is to say, of Bach's life) are these: his eyesight having troubled him 
for years, Bach wished to have an operation. It was done; however, it came 
out quite poorly, and as a consequence, he lost his sight for the better part 
of the last year of his life. This did not keep him from vigorous work on his 
monumental project, however. His aim was to construct a complete exposi-
tion of fugal writing, and usage of multiple themes was one important facet 
of it. In what he planned as the next-to-Iast fugue, he inserted his own 
name coded into notes as the third theme. However, upon this very act, his 
health became so precarious that he was forced to abandon work on his 
cherished project. In his illness, he managed to dictate to his son-in-law a 
final chorale prelude, of which Bach's biographer Forkel wrote, "The 
expression of pious resignation and devotion in it has always affected me 
whenever I have played it; so that I can hardly say which I would rather 
miss-this Chorale, or the end of the last fugue." 
One day, without warning, Bach regained his vision. But a few hours 
later, he suffered a stroke; and ten days later, he died, leaving it for others 
to speculate on the incompleteness of the Art of the Fugue. Could it have 
been caused by Bach's attainment of self-reference? 
Problems Caused by Godel's Result 
The Tortoise says that no sufficiently powerful record player can be per-
fect, in the sense of being able to reproduce every possible sound from a 
record. Godel says that no sufficiently powerful formal system can be 
perfect, in the sense of reproducing every single true statement as a 
theorem. But as the Tortoise pointed out with respect to phonographs, this 
fact only seems like a defect if you have unrealistic expectations of what 
formal systems should be able to do. Nevertheless, mathematicians began 
this century with just such unrealistic expectations, thinking that axiomatic 
reasoning was the cure to all ills. They found out otherwise in 1931. The 
fact that truth transcends theoremhood, in any given formal system, is 
called "incompleteness" of that system. 
A most puzzling fact about Godel's method of proof is that he uses 
86 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

reasoning methods which seemingly cannot be "encapsulated"-they resist 
being incorporated into any formal system. Thus, at first sight, it seems that 
G6del has unearthed a hitherto unknown, but deeply significant, differ-
ence between human reasoning and mechanical reasoning. This mysteri-
ous discrepancy in the power of living and nonliving systems is mirrored in 
the discrepancy between the notion of truth, and that of theoremhood ... 
or at least that is a "romantic" way to view the situation. 
The Modified pq-System and Inconsistency 
In order to see the situation more realistically, it is necessary to see in more 
depth why and how meaning is mediated, in formal systems, by isomor-
phisms. And I believe that this leads to a more romantic way to view the 
situation. So we now will proceed to investigate some further aspects of the 
relation between meaning and form. Our first step is to make a new formal 
system by modifying our old friend, the pq-system, very slightly. We add 
one more axiom schema (retaining the original one, as well as the single 
rule of inference): 
AXIOM SCHEMA II: If x is a hyphen-string, then xp-qx is an axiom. 
Clearly, then, --p-q-- is a theorem in the new system, and so is 
--p--q---. And yet, their interpretations are, respectively, "2 plus 1 
equals 2", and "2 plus 2 equals 3". It can be seen that our new system will 
contain a lot of false statements (if you consider strings to be statements). 
Thus, our new system is inconsistent with the external world. 
As if this weren't bad enough, we also have internal problems with our 
new system, since it contains statements which disagree with one another, 
such as -p-q-- (an old axiom) and -p-q- (a new axiom). So our system 
is inconsistent in a second sense: internally. 
Would, therefore, the only reasonable thing to do at this point be to 
drop the new system entirely? Hardly. I have deliberately presented these 
"inconsistencies" in a wool-pulling manner: that is, I have tried to present 
fuzzy-headed arguments as strongly as possible, with the purpose of mis-
leading. In fact, you may well have detected the fallacies in what I have 
said. The crucial fallacy came when I unquestioningly adopted the very 
same interpreting words for the new system as I had for the old one. 
Remember that there was only one reason for adopting those words in the 
last Chapter, and that reason was that the symbols acted isomorphically to the 
concepts which they wen~ matched with, by the interpretation. But when you 
modify the rules governing the system, you are bound to damage the 
isomorphism. It just cannot be helped. Thus all the problems which were 
lamented over in preceding paragraphs were bogus problems; they can be 
made to vanish in no time, by suitably reinterpreting some of the symbols of the 
system. Notice that I said "some"; not necessarily all symbols will have to be 
mapped onto new notions. Some may very well retain their "meanings", 
while others change. 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
87 

Regaining Consistency 
Suppose, for instance, that we reinterpret just the symbol q, leaving all the 
others constant; in particular, interpret q by the phrase "is greater than or 
equal to". Now, our "contradictory" theorems -p-q-and -p-q--come 
out harmlessly as: "1 plus 1 is greater than or equal to 1", and" 1 plus 1 is 
greater than or equal to 2". We have simultaneously gotten rid of (1) the 
inconsistency with the external world, and (2) the internal inconsistency. 
And our new interpretation is a meaningful interpretation; of course the 
original one is meaningless. That is, it is meaninglessfor the new system; for the 
original pq-system, it is fine. But it now seems as pointless and arbitrary to 
apply it to the new pq-system as it was to apply the "horse-apple-happy" 
interpretation to the old pq-system. 
The History of Euclidean Geometry 
Although I have tried to catch you off guard and surprise you a little, this 
lesson about how to interpret symbols by words may not seem terribly 
difficult once you have the hang of it. In fact, it is not. And yet it is one of 
the deepest lessons of all of nineteenth century mathematics! It all begins 
with Euclid, who, around 300 B.C., compiled and systematized all of what 
was known about plane and solid geometry in his day. The resulting work, 
Euclid's Elements, was so solid that it was virtually a bible of geometry for 
over two thousand years-{}ne of the most enduring works of all time. Why 
was this so? 
The principal reason was that Euclid was the founder of rigor in 
mathematics. The Elements began with very simple concepts, definitions, 
and so forth, and gradually built up a vast body of results organized in such 
a way that any given result depended only on foregoing results. Thus, 
there was a definite plan to the work, an architecture which made it strong 
and sturdy. 
Nevertheless, the architecture was of a different type from that of, say, 
a skyscraper. (See Fig. 21.) In the latter, that it is standing is proof enough 
that its structural elements are holding it up. But in a book on geometry, 
when each proposition is claimed to follow logically from earlier proposi-
tions, there will be no visible crash if one of the proofs is invalid. The 
girders and struts are not physical, hut abstract. In fact, in Euclid's Elements, 
the stuff out of which proofs were constructed was human language-that 
elusive, tricky medium of communication with so many hidden pitfalls. 
What, then, of the architectural strength of the Elements? Is it certain that it 
is held up by solid structural elements, or could it have structural weak-
nesses? 
Every word which we use has a meaning to us, which guides us in our 
use of it. The more common the word, the more associations we have with 
it, and the more deeply rooted is its meaning. Therefore, when someone 
gives a definition for a common word in the hopes that we will abide by that 
88 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

FIGURE 21. 
Tower of Babel, by M. C. Escher (woodcut, 1928). 

definition, it is a foregone conclusion that we will not do so but will instead 
be guided, largely unconsciously, by what our minds find in their associa-
tive stores. I mention this because it is the sort of problem which Euclid 
created in his Elements, by attempting to give definitions of ordinary, com-
mon words such as "point", "straight line", "circle", and so forth. How can 
you define something of which everyone already has a clear concept? The 
only way is if you can make it clear that your word is supposed to be a 
technical term, and is not to be confused with the everyday word with the 
same spelling. You have to stress that the connection with the everyday 
word is only suggestive. Well, Euclid did not do this, because he felt that the 
points and lines of his Elements were indeed the points and lines of the real 
world. So by not making sure that all associations were dispelled, Euclid was 
inviting readers to let their powers of association run free ... 
This sounds almost anarchic, and is a little unfair to Euclid. He did set 
down axioms, or postulates, which were supposed to be used in the proofs 
of propositions. In fact, nothing other than those axioms and postulates 
was supposed to be used. But this is where he slipped up, for an inevitable 
consequence of his using ordinary words was that some of the images 
conjured up by those words crept into the proofs which he created. How-
ever, if you read proofs in the Elements, do not by any means expect to find 
glaring ')umps" in the reasoning. On the contrary, they are very subtle, for 
Euclid was a penetrating thinker, and would not have made any simple-
minded errors. Nonetheless, gaps are there, creating slight imperfections 
in a classic work. But this is not to be complained about. One should merely 
gain an appreciation for the difference between absolute rigor and relative 
rigor. In the long run, Euclid's lack of absolute rigor was the cause of some 
of the most fertile path-breaking in mathematics, over two thousand years 
after he wrote his work. 
Euclid gave five postulates to be used as the "ground story" of the 
infinite skyscraper of geometry, of which his Elements constituted only the 
first several hundred stories. The first four postulates are rather terse and 
elegant: 
(1) 
A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. 
(2) Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a 
straight line. 
(3) 
Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having 
the segment as radius and one end point as center. 
(4) 
All right angles are congruent. 
The fifth, however, did not share their grace: 
(5) If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way 
that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two 
right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each 
other on that side if extended far enough. 
90 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

Though he never explicitly said so, Euclid considered this postulate to be 
somehow inferior to the others, since he managed to avoid using it in the 
proofs of the first twenty-eight propositions. Thus, the first twenty-eight 
propositions belong to what might be called "four-postulate geometry"-
that part of geometry which can be derived on the basis of the first four 
postulates of the Elements, without the help of the fifth postulate. (It is also 
often called absolute geometry.) Certainly Euclid would have found it far 
preferable to prove this ugly duckling, rather than to have to assume it. But 
he found no proof, and therefore adopted it. 
But the disciples of Euclid were no happier about having to assume 
this fifth postulate. Over the centuries, untold numbers of people gave 
untold years of their lives in attempting to prove that the fifth postulate was 
itself part of four-postulate geometry. By 1763, at least twenty-eight differ-
ent proofs had been published-all erroneous! (They were all criticized in 
the dissertation of one G. S. Kliigel.) All of these erroneous proofs involved 
a confusion between everyday intuition and strictly formal properties. It is 
safe to say that today, hardly any of these "proofs" holds any mathematical 
or historical interest-but there are certain exceptions. 
The Many Faces of Noneuclid 
Girolamo Saccheri (1667-1733) lived around Bach's time. He had the 
ambition to free Euclid of every flaw. Based on some earlier work he had 
done in logic, he decided to try a novel approach to the proof of the famous 
fifth: suppose you assume its opposite; then work with that as your fifth 
postulate ... Surely after a while you will create a contradiction. Since no 
mathematical system can support a contradiction, you will have shown the 
unsoundness of your own fifth postulate, and therefore the soundness of 
Euclid's fifth postulate. We need not go into details here. Suffice it to say 
that with great skill, Saccheri worked out proposition after proposition of 
"Saccherian geometry" and eventually became tired of it. At one point, he 
decided he had reached a proposition which was "repugnant to the nature 
of the straight line". That was what he had been hoping for-to his mind, it 
was the long-sought contradiction. At that point, he published his work 
under the title Euclid Freed of Every Flaw, and then expired. 
But in so doing, he robbed himself of much posthumous glory, since 
he had unwittingly discovered what came later to be known as "hyperbolic 
geometry". Fifty years after Saccheri, J. H. Lambert repeated the "near 
miss", this time coming even closer, if possible. Finally, forty years after 
Lambert, and ninety years after Saccheri, non-Euclidean geometry was recog-
nized for what it was-an authentic new brand of geometry, a bifurcation 
in the hitherto single stream of mathematics. In 1823, non-Euclidean 
geometry was discovered simultaneously, in one of those inexplicable coin-
cidences, by a Hungarian mathematician, Janos (or Johann) Bolyai, aged 
twenty-one, and a Russian mathematician, Nikolay Lobachevskiy, aged 
thirty. And, ironically, in that same year, the great French mathematician

91 

Adrien-Marie Legendre came up with what he was sure was a proof of 
Euclid's fifth postulate, very much along the lines of Saccheri. 
Incidentally, Bolyai's father, Farkas (or Wolfgang) Bolyai, a close 
friend of the great Gauss, invested much effort in trying to prove Euclid's 
fifth postulate. In a letter to his son Janos, he tried to dissuade him from 
thinking about such matters: 
You must not attempt this approach to parallels. I know this way to its very 
end. I have traversed this bottomless night, which extinguished all light and 
joy of my life. I entreat you, leave the science of parallels alone .... I thought 
I would sacrifice myself for the sake of the truth. I was ready to become a 
martyr who would remove the flaw from geometry and return it purified to 
mankind. I accomplished monstrous, enormous labors; my creations are far 
better than those of others and yet I have not achieved complete satisfaction. 
For here it is true that si paullum a summo discessit, vergit ad imum. I turned back 
when I saw that no man can reach the bottom of this night. I turned back 
unconsoled, pitying myself and all-mankind .... I have traveled past all reefs 
of this infernal Dead Sea and have always come back with broken mast and 
torn sail. The ruin of my disposition and my fall date back to this time. I 
thoughtlessly risked my life and happiness--aut Caesar aut nihil.l 
But later, when convinced his son really "had something", he urged 
him to publish it, anticipating correctly the simultaneity which is so fre-
quent in scientific discovery: 
When the time is ripe for certain things, these things appear in different 
places in the manner of violets coming to light in early spring.2 
How true this was in the case of non-Euclidean geometry! In Germany, 
Gauss himself and a few others had more or less independently hit upon 
non-Euclidean ideas. These included a lawyer, F. K. Schweikart, who in 
1818 sent a page describing a new "astral" geometry to Gauss; Schweikart's 
nephew, F. A. Taurinus, who did non-Euclidean trigonometry; and F. L. 
Wachter, a student of Gauss, who died in 1817, aged twenty-five, having 
found several deep results in non-Euclidean geometry. 
The clue to non-Euclidean geometry was "thinking straight" about the 
propositions which emerge in geometries like Saccheri's and Lambert's. 
The Saccherian propositions are only "repugnant to the nature of the 
straight line" if you cannot free yourself of preconceived notions of what 
"straight line" must mean. If, however, you can divest yourself of those 
preconceived images, and merely let a "straight line" be something which 
satisfies the new propositions, then you have achieved a radically new 
viewpoint. 
Undefined Terms 
This should begin to sound familiar. In particular, it harks back to the 
pq-system, and its variant, in which the symbols acquired passive meanings 
by virtue of their roles in theorems. The symbol q is especially interesting, 
92 
ConSistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

since its "meaning" changed when a new axiom schema was added. In that 
very same way, one can let the meanings of "point", "line", and so on be 
determined by the set of theorems (or propositions) in which they occur. This was the 
great realization of the discoverers of non-Euclidean geometry. They 
found different sorts of non-Euclidean geometries by denying Euclid's fifth 
postulate in different ways and following out the consequences. Strictly 
speaking, they (and Saccheri) did not deny the fifth postulate directly, but 
rather, they denied an equivalent postulate, called the parallel postulate, 
which runs as follows: 
Given any straight line, and a point not on it, there exists one, and 
only one, straight line which passes through that point and never 
intersects the first line, no matter how far they are extended. 
The second straight line is then said to be parallel to the first. If you assert 
that no such line exists, then you reach elliptical geometry; if you assert that at 
least two such lines exist, you reach hyperbolic geometry. Incidentally, the 
reason that such variations are still called "geometries" is that the core 
element-absolute, or four-postulate, geometry-is embedded in them. It 
is the presence of this minimal core which makes it sensible to think of them 
as describing properties of some sort of geometrical space, even if the space 
is not as intuitive as ordinary space. 
Actually, elliptical geometry is easily visualized. All "points", "lines", 
and so forth are to be parts of the surface of an ordinary sphere. Let us 
write "POINT" when the technical term is meant, and "point" when the 
everyday sense is desired. Then, we can say that a POINT consists of a pair 
of diametrically opposed points of the sphere's surface. A LINE is a great 
circle on the sphere (a circle which, like the equator, has its center at the 
center of the sphere). Under these interpretations, the propositions of 
elliptical geometry, though they contain words like "POINT" and "LINE", 
speak of the goings-on on a sphere, not a plane. Notice that two LINES 
always intersect in exactly two antipodal points of the sphere's surface-
that is, in exactly one single POINT! And just as two LINES determine a 
POINT, so two POINTS determine a LINE. 
By treating words such as "POINT" and "LINE" as if they had only the 
meaning instilled in them by the propositions in which they occur, we take a 
step towards complete formalization of geometry. This semiformal version 
still uses a lot of words in English with their usual meanings (words such as 
"the", "if", "and", 'join", "have"), although the everyday meaning has been 
drained out of special words like "POINT" and "LINE", which are con-
sequently called undefined terms. Undefined terms, like the p and q of the 
pq-system, do get defined in a sense: implicitly-by the totality of all proposi-
tions in which they occur, rather than explicitly, in a definition. 
One could maintain that a full definition of the undefined terms 
resides in the postulates alone, since the propositions which follow from 
them are implicit in the postulates already. This view would say that the 
postulates are implicit definitions of all the undefined terms, all of the 
undefined terms being defined in terms of the others. 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
93 

The Possibility of Multiple Interpretations 
A full formalization of geometry would take the drastic step of making every 
term undefined-that is, turning every term into a "meaningless" symbol of 
a formal system. I put quotes around "meaningless" because, as you know, 
the symbols automatically pick up passive meanings in accordance with the 
theorems they occur in. It is another question, though, whether people 
discover those meanings, for to do so requires finding a set of concepts 
which can be linked by an isomorphism to the symbols in the formal system. 
If one begins with the aim of formalizing geometry, presumably one has an 
intended interpretation for each symbol, so that the passive meanings are 
built into the system. That is what I did for p and q when I first created the 
pq-system. 
But thete may be other passive meanings which are potentially percep-
tible, which no one has yet noticed. For instance, there were the surprise 
interpretations of p as "equals" and q as "taken from", in the original 
pq-system. Although this is rather a trivial example, it contains the essence 
of the idea that symbols may have many meaningful interpretations-it is 
up to the observer to look for them. 
We can summarize our observations so far in terms of the word 
"consistency". We began our discussion by manufacturing what appeared 
to be an inconsistent formal system-one which was internally inconsistent, 
as well as inconsistent with the external world. But a moment later we took 
it all back, when we realized our error: that we had chosen unfortunate 
interpretations for the symbols. By changing the interpretations, we re-
gained consistency! It now becomes clear that consistency is not a property of a 
formal system per se, but depends on the Interpretation which is proposed for it. By 
the same token, inconsistency is not an intrinsic property of any formal 
system. 
Varieties of Consistency 
We have been speaking of "consistency" and "inconsistency" all along, 
without defining them. We have just relied on good old everyday notions. 
But now let us say exactly what is meant by consistency of a formal system 
(together with an interpretation): that every theorem, when interpreted, 
becomes a true statement. And we will say that inconsistency occurs when 
there is at least one false statement among the interpreted theorems. 
This definition appears to be talking about inconsistency with the 
external world-what about internal inconsistencies? Presumably, a system 
would be internally inconsistent if it contained two or more theorems 
whose interpretations were incompatible with one another, and internally 
consistent if all interpreted theorems were compatible with one another. 
Consider, for example, a formal system which has only the following three 
theorems: TbZ, ZbE, and EbT. If T is interpreted as "the Tortoise", Z as 
"Zeno", E as "Egbert", and x by as "x beats y in chess always", then we have 
the following interpreted theorems: 
94 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

The Tortoise always beats Zeno at chess. 
Zeno always beats Egbert at chess. 
Egbert always beats the Tortoise at chess. 
The statements are not incompatible, although they describe a rather 
bizarre circle of chess players. Hence, under this interpretation, the formal 
system in which those three strings are theorems is internally consistent, 
although, in point of fact, none of the three statements is true! Internal 
consistency does not require all theorems to come out true, but merely that 
they come out compatible with one another. 
Now suppose instead that x by is to be interpreted as "x was invented 
by y". Then we would have: 
The Tortoise was invented by Zeno. 
Zeno was invented by Egbert. 
Egbert was invented by the Tortoise. 
In this case, it doesn't matter whether the individual statements are true or 
false-and perhaps there is no way to know which ones are true, and which 
are not. What is nevertheless certain is that not all three can be true at once. 
Thus, the interpretation makes the system internally inconsistent. This 
internal inconsistency depends not on the interpretations of the three 
capital letters, but only on that of b, and on the fact that the three capitals 
are cyclically permuted around the occurrences of b. Thus, one can have 
internal inconsistency without having interpreted all of the symbols of the 
formal system. (In this case it sufficed to interpret a single symbol.) By the 
time sufficiently many symbols have been given interpretations, it may be 
clear that there is no way that the rest of them can be interpreted so that all 
theorems will come out true. But it is not just a question of truth-it is a 
question of possibility. All three theorems would come out false if the 
capitals were interpreted as the names of real people-but that is not why 
we would call the system internally inconsistent; our grounds for doing so 
would be the circularity, combined with the interpretation of the letter b. 
(By the way, you'll find more on this "authorship triangle" in Chapter XX.) 
Hypothetical Worlds and Consistency 
We have given two ways of looking at consistency: the first says that a 
system-plus-interpretation is consistent with the external world if every theo-
rem comes out true when interpreted; the second says that a system-plus-
interpretation is internally consistent if all theorems come out mutually compat-
ible when interpreted. Now there is a close relationship between these two 
types of consistency. In order to determine whether several statements are 
mutually compatible, you try to imagine a world in which all of them could 
be simultaneously true. Therefore, internal consistency depends upon 
consistency with the external world-only now, "the external world" is 
allowed to be any imaginable world, instead of the one we live in. But this is 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
95 

an extremely vague, unsatisfactory conclusion. What constitutes an "im-
aginable" world? After all, it is possible to imagine a world in which three 
characters invent each other cyclically. Or is it? Is it possible to imagine a 
world in which there are square circles? Is a world imaginable in which 
Newton's laws, and not relativity, hold? Is it possible to imagine a world in 
which something can be simultaneously green and not green? Or a world in 
which animals exist which are not made of cells? In which Bach improvised 
an eight-part fugue on a theme of King Frederick the Great? In which 
mosquitoes are more intelligent than people? In which tortoises can play 
football-or talk? A tortoise talking football would be an anomaly, of 
course. 
Some of these worlds seem more imaginable than others, since some 
seem to embody logical contradictions-for example, green and not 
green-while some of them seem, for want of a better word, "plausible"-
such as Bach improvising an eight-part fugue, or animals which are not 
made of cells. Or even, come to think of it, a world in which the laws of 
physics are different ... Roughly, then, it should be possible to establish 
different brands of consistency. For instance, the most lenient would be 
"logical consistency", putting no restraints on things at all, except those of 
logic. More specifically, a system-plus-interpretation would be logically con-
sistent just as long as no two of its theorems, when interpreted as statements, 
directly contradict each other; and mathematically consistent just as long as 
interpreted theorems do not violate mathematics; and physically consistent 
just as long as all its interpreted theorems are compatible with physical law; 
then comes biological consistency, and so on. In a biologically consistent 
system, there could be a theorem whose interpretation is the statement 
"Shakespeare wrote an opera", but no theorem whose interpretation is the 
statement "Cell-less animals exist". Generally speaking, these fancier kinds 
of inconsistency are not studied, for the reason that they are very hard to 
disentangle from one another. What kind of inconsistency, for example, 
should one say is involved in the problem of the three characters who 
invent each other cyclically? Logical? Physical? Biological? Literary? 
Usually, the borderline between uninteresting and interesting is drawn 
between physical consistency and mathematical consistency. (Of course, it is 
the mathematicians and logicians who do the drawing-hardly an impartial 
crew ... ) This means that the kinds of inconsistency which "count", for 
formal systems, are just the logical and mathematical kinds. According to 
this convention, then, we haven't yet found an interpretation which makes 
the trio of theorems TbZ, ZbE, EbT inconsistent. We can do so by interpret-
ing b as "is bigger than". What about T and Z and E? They can be interpret-
ed as natural numbers-for example, Z as 0, T as 2, and E as 11. Notice that 
two theorems come out true this way, one false. If, instead, we had inter-
preted Z as 3, there would have been two falsehoods and only one truth. 
But either way, we'd have had inconsistency. In fact, the values assigned to 
T, Z, and E are irrelevant, as long as it is understood that they are restricted 
to natural numbers. Once again we see a case where only some of the 
interpretation is needed, in order to recognize internal inconsistency. 
96 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

Embedding of One Formal System in Another 
The preceding example, in which some symbols could have interpretations 
while others didn't, is reminiscent of doing geometry in natural language, 
using some words as undefined terms. In such a case, words are divided 
into two classes: those whose meaning is fixed and immutable, and those 
whose meaning is to be adjusted until the system is consistent (these are the 
undefined terms). Doing geometry in this way requires that meanings have 
already been established for words in the first class, somewhere outside of 
geometry. Those words form a rigid skeleton, giving an underlying struc-
ture to the system; filling in that skeleton comes other material, which can 
vary (Euclidean or non-Euclidean geometry). 
Formal systems are often built up in just this type of sequential, or 
hierarchical, manner. For example, Formal System I may be devised, with 
rules and axioms that give certain intended passive meanings to its symbols. 
Then Formal System I is incorporated fully into a larger system with more 
symbols-Formal System II. Since Formal System I's axioms and rules are 
part of Formal System II, the passive meanings of Formal System I's 
symbols remain valid; they form an immutable skeleton which then plays a 
large role in the determination of the passive meanings of the new symbols 
of Formal System II. The second system may in turn play the role of a 
skeleton with respect to a third system, and so on. It is also possible-and 
geometry is a good example of this-to have a system (e.g., absolute 
geometry) which partly pins down the passive meanings of its undefined 
terms, and which can be supplemented by extra rules or axioms, which 
then further restrict the passive meanings of the undefined terms. This is 
the case with Euclidean versus non-Euclidean geometry. 
Layers of Stability in Visual Perception 
In a similar, hierarchical way, we acquire new knowledge, new vocabulary, 
or perceive unfamiliar objects. It is particularly interesting in the case of 
understanding drawings by Escher, such as Relativity (Fig. 22), in which 
there occur blatantly impossible images. You might think that we would 
seek to reinterpret the picture over and over again until we came to an 
interpretation of its parts which was free of contradictions-but we don't 
do that at all. We sit there amused and puzzled by staircases which go every 
which way, and by people going in inconsistent directions on a single 
staircase. Those staircases are "islands of certainty" upon which we base our 
interpretation of the overall picture. Having once identified them, we try to 
extend our understanding, by seeking to establish the relationship which 
they bear to one another. At that stage, we encounter trouble. But if we 
attempted to backtrack-that is, to question the "islands of certainty"-we 
would also encounter trouble, of another sort. There's no way of backtrack-
ing and "undeciding" that they are staircases. They are not fishes, or whips, 
or hands-they are just staircases. (There is, actually, one other out-to 
leave all the lines of the picture totally uninterpreted, like the "meaningless

symbols" of a formal system. This ultimate escape route is an example of a 
"U-mode" response-a Zen attitude towards symbolism.) 
So we are forced, by the hierarchical nature of our perceptive process-
es, to see either a crazy world or just a bunch of pointless lines. A similar 
analysis could be made of dozens of Escher pictures, which rely heavily 
upon the recognition of certain basic forms, which are then put together in 
nonstandard ways; and by the time the observer sees the paradox on a high 
level, it is too late-he can't go back and change his mind about how to 
interpret the lower-level objects. The difference between an Escher draw-
ing and non-Euclidean geometry is that in the latter, comprehensible 
interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a com-
98 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

prehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not 
reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one 
stares at the pictures. Of course, one can still manufacture hypothetical 
worlds, in which Escherian events can happen ... but in such worlds, the 
laws of biology, physics, mathematics, or even logic will be violated on one 
level, while simultaneously being obeyed on another, which makes them 
extremely weird worlds. (An example of this is in Wateifall (Fig. 5), where 
normal gravitation applies to the moving water, but where the nature of 
space violates the laws of physics.) 
Is Mathematics the Same in Every Conceivable World? 
We have stressed the fact, above, that internal consistency of a formal 
system (together with an interpretation) requires that there be some imag-
inable world-that is, a world whose only restriction is that in it, mathe-
matics and logic should be the same as in our world-in which all the 
interpreted theorems come out true. External consistency, however-
consistency with the external world-requires that all theorems come out 
true in the real world. Now in the special case where one wishes to create a 
consistent formal system whose theorems are to be interpreted as state-
ments of mathematics, it would seem that the difference between the two 
types of consistency should fade away, since, according to what we said 
above, all imaginable worlds have the same mathematics as the real world. Thus, in 
every conceivable world, 1 plus 1 would have to be 2; likewise, there would 
have to be infinitely many prime numbers; furthermore, in every conceiv-
able world, all right angles would have to be congruent; and of course, 
through any point not on a given line there would have to be exactly one 
parallel line ... 
But wait a minute! That's the parallel postulate-and to assert its 
universality would be a mistake, in light of what's just been said. If in all 
conceivable worlds the parallel postulate is obeyed, then we are asserting 
that non-Euclidean geometry is inconceivable, which puts us back in the 
same mental state as Saccheri and Lambert-surely an unwise move. But 
what, then, if not all of mathematics, must all conceivable worlds share 7 Could it be 
as little as logic itself? Or is even logic suspect? Could there be worlds where 
contradictions are normal parts of existence-worlds where contradictions 
are not contradictions? 
Well, in some sense, by merely inventing the concept, we have shown 
that such worlds are indeed conceivable; but in a deeper sense, they are also 
quite inconceivable. (This in itself is a little contradiction.) Quite seriously, 
however, it seems that if we want to be able to communicate at all, we have 
to adopt some common base, and it pretty well has to include logic. (There 
are belief systems which reject this point of view-it is too logical. In 
particular, Zen embraces contradictions and non-contradictions with equal 
eagerness. This may seem inconsistent, but then being inconsistent is part 
of Zen, and so ... what can one say?) 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
99 

Is Number Theory the Same in All Conceivable Worlds? 
If we assume that logic is part of every conceivable world (and note that we 
have not defined logic, but we will in Chapters to come), is that all? Is it 
really conceivable that, in some worlds, there are not infinitely many 
primes? Would it not seem necessary that numbers should obey the same 
laws in all conceivable worlds? Or ... is the concept "natural number" 
better thought of as an undefined term, like "POINT" or "LINE"? In that 
case, number theory would be a bifurcated theory, like geometry: there 
would be standard and nonstandard number theories. But there would 
have to be some counterpart to absolute geometry: a "core" theory, an 
invariant ingredient of all number theories which identified them as 
number theories rather than, say, theories about cocoa or rubber or 
bananas. It seems to be the consensm. of most modern mathematicians and 
philosophers that there is such a core number theory, which ought to be 
included, along with logic, in what we consider to be "conceivable worlds". 
This core of number theory, the counterpart to absolute geometry-is 
called Peano arithmetic, and we shall formalize it in Chapter VIII. Also, it is 
now well established-as a matter of fact as a direct consequence of Godel's 
Theorem-that number theory is a bifurcated theory, with standard and 
nonstandard versions. Unlike the situation in geometry, however, the 
number of "brands" of number theory is infinite, which makes the situation 
of number theory considerably more complex. 
For practical purposes, all number theories are the same. In other 
words, if bridge building depended on number theory (which in a sense it 
does), the fact that there are different number theories would not matter, 
since in the aspects relevant to the real world, all number theories overlap. 
The same cannot be said of different geometries; for example, the sum of 
the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees only in Euclidean geometry; it is 
greater in elliptic geometry, less in hyperbolic. There is a story that Gauss 
once attempted to measure the sum of the angles in a large triangle defined 
by three mountain peaks, in order to determine, once and for all, which 
kind of geometry really rules our universe. It was a hundred years later 
that Einstein gave a theory (general relativity) which said that the geometry 
of the universe is determined by its content of matter, so that no one 
geometry is intrinsic to space itself. Thus to the question, "Which geometry is 
true?" nature gives an ambiguous answer not only in mathematics, but also 
in physics. As for the corresponding question, "Which number theory is true?", 
we shall have more to say on it after going through Godel's Theorem in 
detail. 
Completeness 
If consistency is the minimal condition under which symbols acquire pas-
sive meanings, then its complementary notion, completeness, is the maximal 
confirmation of those passive meanings. Where consistency is the property 
100 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 

that "Everything produced by the system is true", completeness is the other 
way round: "Every true statement is produced by the system". Now to 
refine the notion slightly. We can't mean every true statement in the 
world-we mean only those which belong to the domain which we are 
attempting to represent in the system. Therefore, completeness means: 
"Every true statement which can be expressed in the notation of the system 
is a theorem." 
Consistency: when every theorem, upon interpretation, 
comes out true (in some imaginable world). 
Completeness: when all statements which are true (in some 
imaginable world), and which can be expressed as 
well-formed strings of the system, are theorems. 
An example of a formal system which is complete on its own modest 
level is the original pq-system, with the original interpretation. All true 
additions of two positive integers are represented by theorems of the 
system. We might say this another way: "All true additions of two positive 
integers are provable within the system." (Warning: When we start using the 
term "provable statements" instead of "theorems", it shows that we are 
beginning to blur the distinction between formal systems and their in-
terpretations. This is all right, provided we are very conscious of the 
blurring that is taking place, and provided that we remember that multiple 
interpretations are sometimes possible.) The pq-system with the original 
interpretation is complete; it is also consistent, since no false statement is-to 
use our new phrase-provable within the system. 
Someone might argue that the system is incomplete, on the grounds 
that additions of three positive integers (such as 2 + 3 + 4 =9) are not 
represented by theorems of the pq-system, despite being translatable into 
the notation of the system (e.g., --p---p----q---------). How-
ever, this string is not well-formed, and hence should be considered to be 
just as devoid of meaning as is p q p---q p q. Triple additions are simply 
not expressible in the notation of the system-so the completeness of the 
system is preserved. 
Despite the completeness of the pq-system under this interpretation, it 
certainly falls far short of capturing the full notion of truth in number 
theory. For example, there is no way that the pq-system tells us how many 
prime numbers there are. Godel's Incompleteness Theorem says that any 
system which is "sufficiently powerful" is, by virtue of its power, incom-
plete, in the sense that there are well-formed strings which express true 
statements of number theory, but which are not theorems. (There are 
truths belonging to number theory which are not provable within the 
system.) Systems like the pq-system, which are complete but not very 
powerful, are more like low-fidelity phonographs; they are so poor to begin 
with that it is obvious that they cannot do what we would wish them to 
do-namely tell us everything about number theory. 
Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 
101 

How an Interpretation May Make or Break Completeness 
What does it mean to say, as I did above, that "completeness is the maximal 
confirmation of passive meanings"? It means that if a system is consistent 
but incomplete, there is a mismatch between the symbols and their in-
terpretations. The system does not have the power to justify being inter-
preted that way. Sometimes, if the interpretations are "trimmed" a little, 
the system can become complete. To illustrate this idea, let's look at the 
modified pq-system (including Axiom Schema II) and the interpretation 
we used for it. 
After modifying the pq-system, we modified the interpretation for q 
from "equals" to "is greater than or equal to". We saw that the modified 
pq-system was consistent under this interpretation; yet something about 
the new interpretation is not very sat.isfying. The problem is simple: there 
are now many expressible truths which are not theorems. For instance, "2 
plus 3 is greater than or equal to 1" is expressed by the nontheorem 
--p---q-. The interpretation is just too sloppy! It doesn't accurately 
reflect what the theorems in the system do. Under this sloppy interpreta-
tion, the pq-system is not complete. We could repair the situation either by 
(1) adding new rules to the system, making it more powerful, or by (2) 
tightening up the interpretation. In this case, the sensible alternative seems to 
be to tighten the interpretation. Instead of interpreting q as "is greater 
than or equal to", we should say "equals or exceeds by 1". Now the modified 
pq-system becomes both consistent and complete. And the completeness 
confirms the appropriateness of the interpretation. 
Incompleteness of Formalized Number Theory 
In number theory, we will encounter incompleteness again; but there, to 
remedy the situation, we will be pulled in the other direction-towards 
adding new rules, to make the system more powerful. The irony is that we 
think, each time we add a new rule, that we surely have made the system 
complete now! The nature of the dilemma can be illustrated by the follow-
ing allegory ... 
We have a record player, and we also have a record tentatively labeled 
"Canon on B-A-C-H". However, when we play the record on the record 
player, the feedback-induced vibrations (as caused by the Tortoise's rec-
ords) interfere so much that we do not even recognize the tune. We 
conclude that something is defective~ither our record, or our record 
player. In order to test our record, we would have to play it on friends' 
record players, and listen to its quality. In order to test our phonograph, we 
would have to play friends' records on it, and see if the music we hear 
agrees with the labels. If our record player passes its test, then we will say 
the record was defective; contrariwise, if the record passes its test, then we 
will say our record player was defective. What, however, can we conclude 
when we find out that both pass their respective tests? That is the moment to 
remember the chain of two isomorphisms (Fig. 20), and think carefully!

Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
The Tortoise and Achilles are spending a day at Coney Island .• 
After buying a couple of cotton candies, they decide to take a ride 
on the Ferris wheel. 
Tortoise: 
This is my favorite ride. One seems to move so far, and yet in 
reality one gets nowhere. 
Achilles: 
I can see why it would appeal to you. Are you all strapped in? 
Tortoise: 
Yes, I think I've got this buckle done. Well, here we go. Whee! 
Achilles: 
You certainly are exuberant today. 
Tortoise: 
I have good reason to be. My aunt, who is a fortune-teller, told 
me that a stroke of Good Fortune would befall me today. So I am 
tingling with anticipation. 
Achilles: 
Don't tell me you believe in fortune-telling! 
Tortoise: 
No ... but they say it works even if you don't believe in it. 
Achilles: 
Well, that's fortunate indeed. 
Tortoise: 
Ah, what a view of the beach, the crowd, the ocean, the city ... 
Achilles: 
Yes, it certainly is splendid. Say, look at that helicopter over 
there. It seems to be flying our way. In fact it's almost directly above us 
now. 
Tortoise: 
Strange-there's a cable dangling down from it, which is coming 
very close to us. It's coming so close we could practically grab it. 
Achilles: 
Look! At the end of the line there's a giant hook, with a note. 
(He reaches out and snatches the note. They pass by and are on their way 
down.) 
Tortoise: 
Can you make out what the note says? 
Achilles: 
Yes-it reads, "Howdy, friends. Grab a hold of the hook next 
time around, for an Unexpected Surprise." 
Tortoise: 
The note's a little corny but who knows where it might lead. 
Perhaps it's got something to do with that bit of Good Fortune due me. 
By all means, let's try it! 
Achilles: 
Let's! 
(On the trip up they unbuckle their buckles, and at the crest of the ride, they 
grab for the giant hook. All of a sudden they are whooshed up by the cable, 
which quickly reels them skyward into the hovering helicopter. A large 
strong hand helps them in.) 
Voice: 
Welcome aboard-Suckers. 
Achilles: 
Wh-who are you? 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
103 

Voice: 
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Hexachlorophene J. Goodfor-
tune, Kidnapper-At-Large, and Devourer of Tortoises par Excellence, 
at your service. 
Tortoise: 
Gulp! 
Achilles (whispering to his friend): 
Uh-oh-I think that this "Goodfortune" is 
not exactly what we'd anticipated. (To Goodfortune) Ah-if I may be so 
bold-where are you spiriting us off to? 
Goodfortune: 
Ho hot To my all-electric kitchen-in-the-sky, where I will 
prepare THIS tasty morsel--{leering at the Tortoise as he says this)-in a 
delicious pie-in-the-sky! And make no mistake-it's all just for my 
gobbling pleasure! Ho ho hot 
Achilles: 
All I can say is you've got a pretty fiendish laugh. 
Goodfortune (laughing fiendishly): 
Ho ho hot For that remark, my friend, 
you will pay dearly. Ho hot 
Achilles: 
Good grief-I wonder what he means by that! 
Goodfortune: 
Very simple-I've got a Sinister Fate in store for both of you! 
Just you wait! Ho ho hot Ho ho hot 
Achilles: 
Yikes! 
Goodfortune: 
Well, we have arrived. Disembark, my friends, into my fabu-
lous all-electric kitchen-in-the-sky. 
(They walk inside.) 
Let me show you around, before I prepare your fates. Here is my 
bedroom. Here is my study. Please wait here for me for a moment. I've 
got to go sharpen my knives. While you're waiting, help yourselves to 
some popcorn. Ho ho hot Tortoise pie! Tortoise pie! My favorite kind 
of pie! (Exit.) 
Achilles: 
Oh, boy-popcorn! I'm going to munch my head off! 
Tortoise: 
Achilles! You just stuffed yourself with cotton candy! Besides, 
how can you think about food at a time like this? 
Achilles: 
Good gravy-oh, pardon me-I shouldn't use that turn of 
phrase, should I? I mean in these dire circumstances ... 
Tortoise: 
I'm afraid our goose is cooked. 
Achilles: 
Say-take a gander at all these books old Goodfortune has in his 
study. Quite a collection of esoterica: Birdbrains I Have Known; Chess and 
Umbrella-Twirling Made Easy; Concerto for Tapdancer and Orchestra . .. 
Hmmm. 
Tortoise: 
What's that small volume lying open over there on the desk, next 
to the dodecahedron and the open drawing pad? 
Achilles: 
This one? Why, its title is Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the 
Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe. 
Tortoise: 
A moderately provocative title. 
Achilles: 
Indeed-and the adventure it's opened to looks provocative. It's 
called "Djinn and Tonic". 
Tortoise: 
Hmm ... I wonder why. Shall we try reading it? I could take the 
Tortoise's part, and you could take that of Achilles. 
104 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

Achilles: 
I'm game. Here goes nothing ... 
(They begin reading "Djinn and Tonic".) 
(Achilles has invited the Tortoise over to see his 
collection of prints by his favorite artist, M. C. Escher.) 
Tortoise: 
These are wonderful prints, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
I knew you would enjoy seeing them. Do you have any 
particular favorite? 
Tortoise: 
One of my favorites is Convex and Concave, where two 
internally consistent worlds, when juxtaposed, make a com-
pletely inconsistent composite world. Inconsistent worlds are 
always fun places to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. 
Achilles: 
What do you mean, "fun to visit"? Inconsistent worlds 
don't EXIST, so how can you visit one? 
Tortoise: 
I beg your pardon, but weren't we just agreeing that in 
this Escher picture, an inconsistent world is portrayed? 
Achilles: 
Yes, but that's just a two-dimensional world-a fictitious 
world-a picture. You can't visit that world. 
Tortoise: 
I have my ways ... 
Achilles: 
How could you propel yourself into a flat picture-
universe? 
Tortoise: 
By drinking a little glass of PUSHING-POTION. That does 
the trick. 
Achilles: 
What on earth is pushing-potion? 
Tortoise: 
It's a liquid that comes in small ceramic phials, and 
which, when drunk by someone looking at a picture, "pushes" 
him right into the world of that picture. People who aren't 
aware of the powers of pushing-potion often are pretty sur-
prised by the situations they wind up in. 
Achilles: 
Is there no antidote? Once pushed, is one irretrievably 
lost? 
Tortoise: 
In certain cases, that's not so bad a fate. But there is, in 
fact, another potion-well, not a potion, actually, but an 
elixir-no, not an elixir, but a-a-
Tortoise: 
He probably means "tonic". 
Achilles: 
Tonic? 
Tortoise: 
That's the word I was looking for! "POPPING-TONIC" is 
what it's called, and if you remember to carry a bottle of it in 
your right hand as you swallow the pushing-potion, it too will 
be pushed into the picture; then, whenever you get a hanker-
ing to "pop" back out into real life, you need only take a 
swallow of popping-tonic, and presto! You're back in the real 
world, exactly where you were before you pushed yourself in. 
Achilles: 
That sounds very interesting. What would happen if 
you took some popping-tonic without having previously 
pushed yourself into a picture? 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
105 

106 
Tortoise: 
I don't precisely know, Achilles, but I would be rather 
wary of horsing around with these strange pushing and pop-
ping liquids. Once I had a friend, a Weasel, who did precisely 
what you suggested-and no one has heard from him since. 
Achilles: 
That's unfortunate. Can you also carry along the bottle 
of pushing-potion with you? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, certainly. Just hold it in your left hand, and it too 
will get pushed right along with you into the picture you're 
looking at. 
Achilles: 
What happens if you then find a picture inside the 
picture which you have already entered, and take another 
swig of pushing-potion? 
Tortoise: Just what you would expect: you wind up inside that 
picture-in-a-picture. 
Achilles: 
I suppose that yml have to pop twice, then, in order to 
extricate yourself from the nested pictures, and re-emerge 
back in real life. 
Tortoise: 
That's right. You have to pop once for each push, since 
a push takes you down inside a picture, and a pop undoes 
that. 
Achilles: 
You know, this all sounds pretty fishy to me ... Are you 
sure you're not just testing the limits of my gullibility? 
Tortoise: 
I swear! Look-here are two phials, right here in my 
pocket. (Reaches into his lapel pocket, and pulls out two rather large 
unlabeled phials, in one oj which one can hear a red liquid sloshing 
around, and in the other of which one can hear a blue liquid sloshing 
around.) If you're willing, we can try them. What do you say? 
Achilles: 
Well, I guess, ahrn, maybe, ahm ... 
Tortoise: 
Good! I knew you'd want to try it out. Shall we push 
ourselves into the world of Escher's Convex and Concave? 
Achilles: 
Well, ah, ... 
Tortoise: 
Then it's decided. Now we've got to remember to take 
along this flask of tonic, so that we can pop back out. Do you 
want to take that heavy responsibility, Achilles? 
Achilles: If it's all the same to you, I'm a little nervous, and I'd 
prefer letting you, with your experience, manage the opera-
tion. 
Tortoise: 
Very well, then. 
(So saying, the Tortoise pours two small portions oj pushing-
potion. Then he picks up the flask oj tonic and grasps it firmly in 
his right hand, and both he and Achilles lift their glasses to their 
lips.) 
Tortoise: 
Bottoms up! 
(They swallow.)

FIGURE 23. 
Convex and Concave, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1955). 
Achilles: 
That's an exceedingly strange taste. 
Tortoise: 
One gets used to it. 
Achilles: 
Does taking the tonic feel this strange? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, that's quite another sensation. Whenever 
you taste the tonic, you feel a deep sense of satisfac-
tion, as if you'd been waiting to taste it all your life. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I'm looking forward to that. 
Tortoise: 
Well, Achilles, where are we? 
Achilles (taking cognizance of his surroundings): 
We're in a 
little gondola, gliding down a canal! I want to get 
out. Mr.Gondolier, please let us out here. 
(The gondolier pays no attention to this request.) 
Tortoise: 
He doesn't speak English. If we want to get out 
here, we'd better just clamber out quickly before he 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
107 

108 
enters the sinister "Tunnel of Love", just ahead of 
us. 
(Achilles, hisface a little pale, scrambles out in a split 
second and then pulls his slower friend out.) 
Achilles: 
I didn't like the sound of that place, somehow. 
I'm glad we got out here. Say, how do you know so 
much about this place, anyway? Have you been here 
before? 
Tortoise: 
Many times, although I always came in from 
other Escher pictures. They're all connected behind 
the frames, you know. Once you're in one, you can 
get to any other one. 
Achilles: 
Amazing! Were I not here, seeing these things 
with my own eyes, I'm not sure I'd believe you. (They 
wander out through a little arch.) Oh, look at those two 
cute lizards! 
Tortoise: 
Cute? They aren't cute-it makes me shudder 
just to think of them! They are the vicious guardians 
of that magic copper lamp hanging from the ceiling 
over there. A mere touch of their tongues, and any 
mortal turns to a pickle. 
Achilles: 
Dill, or sweet? 
Tortoise: 
Dill. 
Achilles: 
Oh, what a sour fate! But if the lamp has magi-
cal powers, I would like to try for it. 
Tortoise: 
It's a foolhardy venture, my friend. I wouldn't 
risk it. 
Achilles: 
I'm going to try just once. 
(He stealthily approaches the lamp, making sure not to 
awaken the sleeping lad nearby. But suddenly, he slips 
on a strange shell-like indentation in the floor, and 
lunges out into space. Lurching crazily, he reaches for 
anything, and manages somehow to grab onto the lamp 
with one hand. Swinging wildly, with both lizards 
hissing and thrusting their tongues violently out at 
him, he is left dangling helplessly out in the middle of 
space.) 
Achilles: 
He-e-e-elp! 
(His cry attracts the attention of a woman who rushes 
downstairs and awakens the sleeping boy. He takes 
stock of the situation, and, with a kindly smile on his 
face, gestures to A chilles that all will be well. He shouts 
something in a strange guttural tongue to a pair of 
trumpeters high up in windows, and immediately, 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

weird tones begin ringing out and making beats with 
each other. The sleepy young lad points at the lizards, 
and Achilles sees that the music is having a strong 
soporific effect on them. Soon, they are completely 
unconscious. Then the helpful lad shouts to two com-
panions climbing up ladders. They both pull their 
ladders up and then extend them out into space just 
underneath the stranded Achilles, forming a sort of 
bridge. Their gestures make it clear that Achilles 
should hurry and climb on. But before he does so, 
Achilles carefully unlinks the top link of the chain 
holding the lamp, and detaches the lamp. Then he 
climbs onto the ladder-bridge and the three young lads 
pull him in to safety. Achilles throws his arms around 
them and hugs them gratefully.) 
Achilles: 
Oh, Mr. T, how can I repay them? 
Tortoise: 
I happen to know that these valiant lads just 
love coffee, and down in the town below, there's a 
place where they make an incomparable cup of es-
presso. Invite them for a cup of espresso! 
Achilles: 
That would hit the spot. 
(And so, by a rather comical series of gestures, smiles, 
and words, Achilles manages to convey his invitation 
to the young lads, and the party of five walks out and 
down a steep staircase descending into the town. They 
reach a charming small cafe, sit down outside, and 
order five espressos. As they sip their drinks, Achilles 
remembers he has the lamp with him.) 
Achilles: 
I forgot, Mr. Tortoise-I've got this magic 
lamp with me! But-what's magic about it? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, you know, just the usual-a genie. 
Achilles: 
What? You mean a genie comes out when you 
rub it, and grants you wishes? 
Tortoise: 
Right. What did you expect? Pennies from 
heaven? 
Achilles: 
Well, this is fantastic! I can have any wish I 
want, eh? I've always wished this would happen to 
me ... 
(And so Achilles gently rubs the large letter 'L' which is 
etched on the lamp's copper surface ... Suddenly a 
huge puff of smoke appears, and in the forms of the 
smoke the five friends can make out a weird, ghostly 
figure towering above them.)

Genie: 
Hello, my friends-and thanks ever so much for 
rescuing my Lamp from the evil Lizard-Duo. 
(And so saying, the Genie picks up the Lamp, and 
stuffs it into a pocket concealed among the folds of his 
long ghostly robe which swirls out of the Lamp.) 
As a sign of gratitude for your heroic deed, I would 
like to offer YOll, on the part of my Lamp, the oppor-
tunity to have any three of your wishes realized. 
Achilles: 
How stupefying! Don't you think so, Mr. T? 
Tortoise: 
I surely do. Go ahead, Achilles, take the first 
wish. 
Achilles: 
Wow! But what should I wish? Oh, I know! It's 
what I thought of the first time I read the Arabian 
Nights (that collection of silly (and nested) tales)-I 
wish that I had a HUNDRED wishes, instead of just 
three! Pretty clever, eh, Mr. T? I bet YOU never 
would have thought of that trick. I always wondered 
why those dopey people in the stories never tried it 
themselves. 
Tortoise: 
Maybe now you'll find out the answer. 
Genie: 
I am sorry, Achilles, but I don't grant meta-
wishes. 
Achilles: 
I wish you'd tell me what a "meta-wish" is! 
Genie: 
But THAT is a meta-meta-wish, Achilles-and I 
don't grant them, either. 
Achilles: 
Whaaat? [ don't follow you at all. 
Tortoise: 
Why don't you rephrase your last request, 
Achilles? 
Achilles: 
What do you mean? Why should I? 
Tortoise: 
Well, you began by saying "I wish". Since 
you're just asking for information, why don't you 
just ask a question? 
Achilles: 
All right, though I don't see why. Tell me, Mr. 
Genie-what is a meta-wish? 
Genie: 
It is simply a wish about wishes. I am not allowed 
to grant meta-wishes. It is only within my purview to 
grant plain ordinary wishes, such as wishing for ten 
bottles of beer, to have Helen of Troy on a blanket, 
or to have an all-expenses-paid weekend for two at 
the Copacabana. You know-simple things like that. 
But meta-wishes I cannot grant. GOD won't permit 
me to. 
Achilles: 
GOD? Who is GOD? And why won't he let you 
grant meta-wishes? That seems like such a puny 
thing compared to the others you mentioned. 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

Genie: 
Well, it's a complicated matter, you see. Why 
don't you just go ahead and make your three wishes? 
Or at least make one of them. I don't have all the 
time in the world, you know ... 
Achilles: 
Oh, I feel so rotten. I was REALLY HOPING to 
wish for a hundred wishes ... 
Genie: 
Gee, I hate to see anybody so disappointed- as 
that. And besides, meta-wishes are my favorite kind 
of wish. Let me just see if there isn't anything I can 
do about this. This'll just take one moment-
(The Genie removes from the wispy folds of his robe an 
object which looks just like the copper Lamp he had put 
away, except that this one is made of silver; and where 
the previous one had 'L' etched on it, this one has 'ML' 
in smaller letters, so as to cover the same area.) 
Achilles: 
And what is that? 
Genie: 
This is my Meta-Lamp ... 
(He rubs the Meta-Lamp, and a huge puff of smoke 
appears. In the billows of smoke, they can all make out 
a ghostly form towering above them.) 
Meta-Genie: 
I am the Meta-Genie. You sum-
moned me, 0 Genie? What is your wish? 
Genie: 
I have a special wish to make of you, 0 Djinn, 
and of GOD. I wish for permission for temporary 
suspension of all type-restrictions on wishes, for the 
duration of one Typeless Wish. Could you please 
grant this wish for me? 
Meta-Genie: 
I'll have to send it through Chan-
nels, of course. One half a moment, please. 
(And, twice as quickly as the Genie did, this 
Meta-Genie removes from the wispy folds of 
her robe an object which looks just like the 
silver Meta-Lamp, except that it is made of 
gold; and where the previous one had 'ML' 
etched on it, this one has 'MML' in smaller 
letters, so as to cover the same area.) 
A chilies (his voice an octave higher than be-
fore): 
And what is that? 
Meta-Genie: 
This is my Meta-Meta-Lamp ...

mission for temporary suspension of all 
type-restrictions on wishes, for the duration 
of one Typeless Wish. Could you please 
grant this wish for me? 
Meta-Meta-Genie: 
I'll have to send it 
through Channels, of course. One 
quarter of a moment, please.

Meta-Genie did, this Meta-

folds back into his robe, half as quickly as the Meta-

Your wish is granted, Achilles. 
(And one precise moment has elapsed since he said 
"This will just take one moment.") 
Achilles: 
Thank you, 0 Djinn, and GOD. 
Genie: 
1 am pleased to report, Achilles, that you may 
have exactly one (1) Typeless Wish-that is to say, a 
wish, or a meta-wish, or a meta-meta-wish, as many 
"meta" 's as you wish--even infinitely many (if you 
wish). 
Achilles: 
Oh, thank you so very much, Genie. But my 
curiosity is provoked. Before 1 make my wish, would 
you mind telling me who-or what-GOD is? 
Genie: 
Not at all. "GOD" is an acronym which stands for 
"GOD Over Djinn". The word "Djinn" is used to 
designate Genies, Meta-Genies, Meta-Meta-Genies, 
etc. It is a Typeless word. 
Achilles: 
But-but-how can "GOD" be a word in its 
own acronym? That doesn't make any sense! 
Genie: 
Oh, aren't you acquainted with recursive ac-
ronyms? 1 thought everybody knew about them. You 
see, "GOD" stands for "GOD Over Djinn"-which 
can be expanded as "GOD Over Djinn, Over 
Djinn"-and that can, in turn, be expanded to "GOD 
Over Djinn, Over Djinn, Over Djinn"-which can, in 
its turn, be further expanded ... You can go as far 
as you like. 
Achilles: 
But I'll never finish! 
Genie: 
Of course not. You can never totally expand 
GOD. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... That's puzzling. What did you mean 
when you said to the Meta-Genie, "I have a special 
wish to make of you, 0 Djinn, and of GOD"? 
Genie: 
1 wanted not only to make a request of the 
Meta-Genie, but also of all the Djinns over her. The 
recursive acronym method accomplishes this quite 
naturally. You see, when the Meta-Genie received 
my request, she then had to pass it upwards to her 
GOD. So she forwarded a similar message to the 
Meta-Meta-Genie, who then did likewise to the 
Meta-Meta-Meta-Genie ... Ascending the chain this 
way transmits the message to GOD. 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
113 

114 
Achilles: 
I see. You mean GOD sits up at the top of the 
ladder of djinns? 
Genie: 
No, no, no! There is nothing "at the top", for 
there is no top. That is why GOD is a recursive 
acronym. GOD is not some ultimate djinn; GOD is 
the tower of djinns above any given djinn. 
Tortoise: 
It seems to me that each and every djinn would 
have a different concept of what GOD is, then, since 
to any djinn, GOD is the set of djinns above him or 
her, and no two djinns share that set. 
Genie: 
You're absolutely right-and since I am the low-
est djinn of all, my notion of GOD is the most exalted 
one. I pity the higher djinns, who fancy themselves 
somehow closer to GOD. What blasphemy! 
Achilles: 
By gum, it must have taken genies to invent 
GOD. 
Tortoise: 
Do you really believe all this stuff about GOD, 
Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Why certainly, I do. Are you atheistic, Mr. T? 
Or are you agnostic? 
Tortoise: 
I don't think I'm agnostic. Maybe I'm meta-
agnostic. 
Achilles: 
Whaaat? I don't follow you at all. 
Tortoise: 
Let's see ... If I were meta-agnostic, I'd be 
confused over whether I'm agnostic or not-but I'm 
not quite sure if I feel THAT way; hence I must be 
meta-meta-agnostic (I guess). Oh, well. Tell me, 
Genie, does any djinn ever make a mistake, and 
garble up a message moving up or down the chain? 
Genie: 
This does happen; it is the most common cause 
for Typeless Wishes not being granted. You see, the 
chances are infinitesimal that a garbling will occur at 
any PARTICULAR link in the chain-but when you 
put an infinite number of them in a row, it becomes 
virtually certain that a garbling will occur SOME-
WHERE. In fact, strange as it seems, an infinite 
number of garblings usually occur, although they 
are very sparsely distributed in the chain. 
Achilles: 
Then it seems a miracle that any Typeless Wish 
ever gets carried out. 
Genie: 
Not really. Most garblings are inconsequential, 
and many garb lings tend to cancel each other out. 
But occasionally-in fact, rather seldom-the non-
fulfillment of a Typeless Wish can be traced back to a 
single unfortunate djinn's garbling. When this hap-
pens, the guilty djinn is forced to run an infinite 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

gauntlet, and get paddled on his or her rump, by 
GOD. It's good fun for the paddlers, and quite 
harmless for the paddlee. You might be amused by 
the sight. 
Achilles: 
I would love to see that! But it only happens 
when a Typeless Wish goes ungranted? 
Genie: 
That's right. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... That gives me an idea for my wish. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, really? What is it? ' 
Achilles: 
I wish my wish would not be granted! 
(At that moment, an event--or is "event" the word for 
it?-takes place which cannot be described, and hence 
no attempt will be made to describe it.) 
Achilles: 
What on earth does that cryptic comment mean? 
Tortoise: 
It refers to the Typeless Wish Achilles made. 
Achilles: 
But he hadn't yet made it. 
Tortoise: 
Yes, he had. He said, "I wish my wish would not be 
granted", and the Genie took THAT to be his wish. 
(At that moment, some footsteps are heard coming down the hallway in 
their direction.) 
Achilles: 
Oh, my! That sounds ominous. 
(The footsteps stop; then they tum around and fade away.) 
Tortoise: 
Whew! 
Achilles: 
But does the story go on, or is that the end? Turn the page and 
let's see. 
(The Tortoise turns the page of "DJinn and Tonic", where theyfind that the 
story goes on ... ) 
Achilles: 
Hey! What happened? Where is my Genie? My 
lamp? My cup of espresso? What happened to our 
young friends from the Convex and Concave 
worlds? What are all those little lizards doing here? 
Tortoise: 
I'm afraid our context got restored incorrectly, 
Achilles. 
Achilles: 
What on earth does that cryptic comment 
mean? 
Tortoise: 
I refer to the Typeless Wish you made. 
Achilles: 
But I hadn't yet made it. 
Tortoise: 
Yes, you had. You said, "I wish my wish would 
not be granted", and the Genie took THAT to be your 
wish. 
Achilles: 
Oh, my! That sounds ominous. 
Tortoise: 
It spells PARADOX. For that Typeless Wish to be 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
115 

116 
granted, it had to be denied-yet not to grant it 
would be to grant it. 
Achilles: 
So what happened? Did the earth come to a 
standstill? Did the universe cave in? 
Tortoise: 
No. The System crashed. 
Achilles: 
What does that mean? 
Tortoise: 
It means that you and I, Achilles, were sud-
denly and instantaneously transported to Tumbolia. 
Achilles: 
To where? 
Tortoise: 
Tumbolia: the land of dead hiccups and extin-
guished light bulbs. It's a sort of waiting room, where 
dormant software waits for its host hardware to 
come back up. No telling how long the System was 
down, and we were in Tumbolia. It could have been 
moments, hours, days--even years. 
Achilles: 
I don't know what software is, and I don't know 
what hardware is. But I do know that I didn't get to 
make my wishes! I want my Genie back! 
Tortoise: 
I'm sorry, Achilles-you blew it. You crashed 
the System, and you should thank your lucky stars 
that we're back at all. Things could have come out a 
lot worse. But I have no idea where we are. 
Achilles: 
I recognize it now-we're inside another of 
Escher's pictures. This time it's Reptiles. 
Tortoise: 
Aha! The System tried to save as much of our 
context as it could before it crashed, and it got as far 
as recording that it was an Escher picture with lizards 
before it went down. That's commendable. 
Achilles: 
And look-isn't that our phial of popping-
tonie over there on the table, next to the cycle of 
lizards? 
Tortoise: 
It certainly is, Achilles. I must say, we are very 
lucky indeed. The System was very kind to us, in 
giving us back our popping-tonie-it's precious 
stuff! 
Achilles: 
I'll say! Now we can pop back out of the Escher 
world, into my house. 
Tortoise: 
There are a couple of books on the desk, next 
to the tonic. I wonder what they are. (He picks up the 
smaller one, which is open to a random page.) This looks 
like a moderately provocative book. 
Achilles: 
Oh, really? What is its title? 
Tortoise: 
Provocative Adventures of the Tortoise and Achilles 
Taking Place in Sundry Parts of the Globe. It sounds like 
an interesting book to read out of.

Reptiles, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1943). 
Achilles: 
Well, YOU can read it if you want, but as for me, 
I'm not going to take any chances with that 
popping-tonie-one of the lizards might knock it 
off the table, so I'm going to get it right now! 
(He dashes over to the table and reaches for the 
popping-tonic, but in his haste he somehow bumps the 
flask of tonic, and it tumbles off the desk and begins 
rolling.) 
Oh, no! Mr. T -look! I accidentally knocked the 
tonic onto the floor, and it's rolling towards-
towards-the stairwell! Quick-before it falls! 
(The Tortoise, however, is completely wrapped up in 
the thin volume which he has in his hands.)

Tortoise (muttering): 
Eh? This story looks fascinating. 
Achilles: 
Mr. T, Mr. T, help! Help catch the tonic-flask! 
Tortoise: 
What's all the fuss about? 
Achilles: 
The tonic-flask-I knocked it down from the 
desk, and now it's rolling and-
(At that instant it reaches the brink of the stairwell, 
and plummets over ... ) 
Oh no! What can we do? Mr. Tortoise-aren't you 
alarmed? We're losing our tonic! It'sjust fallen down 
the stairwell! There's only one thing to do! We'll 
have to go down one story! 
Tortoise: 
Go down one story? My pleasure. Won't you 
join me? 
(He begins to read aloud, and Achilles, pulled in two 
directions at once, finally stays, taking the role of the 
Tortoise.) 
Achille~: 
It's very dark here, Mr. T. I can't see a 
thing. Oof! I bumped into a wall. Watch 
out! 
Tortoise: 
Here-I have a couple of walking 
sticks. Why don't you take one of them? 
You can hold it out in front of you so that 
you don't bang into things. 
Achilles: 
Good idea. (He takes the stick.) Do you 
get the sense that this path is curving gently 
to the left as we walk? 
Tortoise: 
Very slightly, yes. 
Achilles: 
I wonder where we are. And whether 
we'll ever see the light of day again. I wish 
I'd never listened to you, when you 
suggested I swallow some of that "DRINK 
ME" stuff. 
Tortoise: 
I assure you, it's quite harmless. I've 
done it scads of times, and not a once have I 
ever regretted it. Relax and enjoy being 
small. 
Achilles: 
Being small? What is it you've done to 
me, Mr. T? 
Tortoise: 
Now don't go blaming me. You did it 
of your own free will. 
Achilles: 
Have you made me shrink? So that 
this labyrinth we're in is actually some teeny 
thing that someone could STEP on?

Matthews, Mazes and Labyrinths: Their History and Development (New York: Dover Publica-
tions, 1970).] 
Tortoise: 
Labyrinth? Labyrinth? Could it be? 
Are we in the notorious Little Harmonic 
Labyrinth of the dreaded Majotaur? 
Achilles: 
Yiikes! What is that? 
Tortoise: 
They say-although I personally 
never believed it myself-that an Evil 
Majotaur has created a tiny labyrinth and 
sits in a pit in the middle of it, waiting for 
innocent victims to get lost in its fearsome 
complexity. Then, when they wander lost 
and dazed into the center, he laughs and 
laughs at them-so hard, that he laughs 
them to death! 
Achilles: 
Oh, no! 
Tortoise: 
But it's only a myth. Courage, Achil-
les. 
(And the dauntless pair trudge on.) 
Achilles: 
Feel these walls. They're like corru-
gated tin sheets, or something. But the cor-
rugations have different sizes. 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
119 

120 
(To emphasize his point, he sticks out his 
walking stick against the wall surface as he 
walks. As the stick bounces back and forth 
against the corrugations, strange noises echo 
up and down the long curved corridor they 
are in.) 
Tortoise (alarmed): 
What was THAT? 
Achilles: 
Oh, just me, rubbing my walking stick 
against the wall. 
Tortoise: 
Whew! I thought for a moment it was 
the bellowing of the ferocious Majotaur! 
Achilles: 
I thought you said it was all a myth. 
Tortoise: 
Of course it is. Nothing to be afraid 
of. 
(Achilles puts his walking stick back against 
the wall, and continues walking. As he does 
so, some musical sounds are heard, coming 
from the point where his stick is scraping the 
wall.) 
Tortoise: 
Uh-oh. I have a bad feeling, Achilles. 
That Labyrinth may not be a myth, after all. 
Achilles: 
Wait a minute. What makes you 
change your mind all of a sudden? 
Tortoise: 
Do you hear that music? 
(To hear more clearly, Achilles lowers the 
stick, and the strains of melody cease.) 
Hey! Put that back! I want to hear the end 
of this piece! 
(Confused, Achilles obeys, and the music re-
sumes.) 
Tpank you. Now as I was about to say, I 
have just figured out where we are. 
Achilles; 
Really? Where are we? 
Tortoise: 
We are walking down a spiral groove 
of a record in its jacket. Your stick scraping 
against the strange shapes in the wall acts 
like a needle running down the groove, al-
lowing us to hear the music. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no, oh, no ... 
Tortoise: 
What? Aren't you overjoyed? Have 
you ever had the chance to be in such inti-
mate contact with music before? 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

Achilles: 
How am I ever going to win footraces 
against full-sized people when I am smaller 
than a flea, Mr. Tortoise? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, is that all that's bothering you? 
That's nothing to fret about, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
The way you talk, I get the impression 
that you never worry at all. 
Tortoise: 
I don't know. But one thing for cer-
tain is that I don't worry about being small. 
Especially not when faced with the awful 
danger of the dreaded Majotaur! 
Achilles: 
Horrors! Are you telling me-
Tortoise: 
I'm afraid so, Achilles. The music 
gave it away. 
Achilles: 
How could it do that? 
Tortoise: 
Very simple. When I heard the 
melody B-A-C-H in the top voice, I im-
mediately realized that the grooves that 
we're walking through could only be the 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth, one of Bach's less-
er known organ pieces. It is so named be-
cause of its dizzyingly frequent modula-
tions. 
Achilles: 
Wh-what are they? 
Tortoise: 
Well, you know that most musical 
pieces are written in a key, or tonality, such 
as C major, which is the key of this one. 
Achilles: 
I had heard the term before. Doesn't 
that mean that C is the note you want to end 
on? 
Tortoise: 
Yes, C acts like a home base, in a way. 
Actually, the usual word is "tonic". 
Achilles: 
Does one then stray away from the 
tonic with the aim of eventually returning? 
Tortoise: 
That's right. As the piece develops, 
ambiguous chords and melodies are used, 
which lead away from the tonic. Little by 
little, tension builds up-you feel an in-
creasing desire to return home, to hear the 
tonic. 
Achilles: 
Is that why, at the end of a piece, I 
always feel so satisfied, as if I had been 
waiting my whole life to hear the tonic? 
Tortoise: 
Exactly. The composer has used his 
knowledge of harmonic progressions to 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
121 

122 
manipulate your emotions, and to build up 
hopes in you to hear that tonic. 
Achilles: 
But you were going to tell me about 
modulations. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, yes. One very important thing a 
composer can do is to "modulate" partway 
through a piece, which means that he sets 
up a temporary goal other than resolution 
into the tonic. 
Achilles: 
I see . . . I think. Do you mean that 
some sequence of chords shifts the har-
monic tension somehow so that I actually 
desire to resolve in a new key? 
Tortoise: 
Right. This makes the situation more 
complex, for although in the short term you 
want to resolve in the new key, all the while 
at the back of your mind you retain the 
longing to hit that original goal-in this 
case, C major. And when the subsidiary 
goal is reached, there is-
Achilles (suddenly gesturing enthusiastically): 
Oh, 
listen to the gorgeous upward-swooping 
chords which mark the end of this Little 
Harmonic Labyrinth! 
Tortoise: 
No, Achilles, this isn't the end. It's 
merei}-
Achilles: 
Sure it is! Wow! What a powerful, 
strong ending! What a sense of relief! 
That's some resolution! Gee! 
(And sure enough, at that moment the music 
stops, as they emerge into an open area with 
no walls.) 
You .~ee, it IS over. What did I tell you? 
Tortoise: 
Something is very wrong. This record 
is a disgrace to the world of music. 
Achillps: 
What do you mean? 
Tortoise: 
It was exactly what I was telling you 
about. Here Bach had modulated from C 
into G, setting up a secondary goal of hear-
ing G. This means that you experience two 
tensions at once-waiting for resolution 
into G, but also keeping in mind that ulti-
mate desire-to resolve triumphantly into C 
Major. 
Achilles: 
Why should you have to keep any-
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

thing in mind when listening to a piece of 
music? Is music only an intellectual exer-
cise? 
Tortoise: 
No, of course not. Some music is 
highly intellectual, but most music is not. 
And most of the time your ear or brain does 
the "calculation" for you, and lets your 
emotions know what they want to hear. You 
don't have to think about it consciously. But 
in this piece, Bach was playing tricks, hop-
ing to lead you astray. And in your case, 
Achilles, he succeeded. 
Achilles: 
Are you telling me that I responded to 
a resolution in a subsidiary key? 
Tortoise: 
That's right. 
Achilles: 
It still sounded like an ending to me. 
Tortoise: 
Bach intentionally made it sound that 
way. You just fell into his trap. I t was delib-
erately contrived to sound like an ending, 
but if you follow the harmonic progression 
carefully, you will see that it is in the wrong 
key. Apparently not just you but also this 
miserable record company fell for the same 
trick-and they truncated the piece early! 
Achilles: 
What a dirty trick Bach played on me! 
Tortoise: 
That is his whole game-to make you 
lose your way in his Labyrinth! The Evil 
Majotaur is in cahoots with Bach, you see. 
And if you don't watch out, he will now 
laugh you to death-and perhaps me along 
with you! 
Achilles: 
Oh, let us hurry up and get out of 
here! Quick! Let's run backwards in the 
grooves, and escape on the outside of the 
record before the Evil Majotaur finds us! 
Tortoise: 
Heavens, no! My sensibility is far too 
delicate to handle the bizarre chord pro-
gressions which occur when time is re-
versed. 
Achilles: 
Oh, Mr. T, how will we ever get out of 
here, if we can't just retrace our steps? 
Tortoise: 
That's a very good question. 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
(A little desperately, Achilles starts running 
about aimlessly in the dark. Suddenly there 
is a slight gasp, and then a "thud".)

Achilles-are you all right? 
Achilles: Just a bit shaken up but otherwise 
fine. ] fell into some big hole. 
Tortoise: 
You've fallen into the pit of the Evil 
Majotaur! Here, I'll come help you out. 
We've got to move fast! 
Achilles: 
Careful, Mr. T -I don't want YOU to 
fall in here, too ... 
Tortoise: 
Don't fret, Achilles. Everything will be 
all-
(Suddenly, there is a slight gasp, and then a 
"thud".) 
Achilles: 
Mr. T -you fell in, too! Are you all 
right? 
Tortoise: 
Only my pride is hurt-otherwise I'm 
fine. 
Achilles: 
Now we're in a pretty pickle, aren't 
we? 
(Suddenly, a giant, booming laugh is heard, 
alarmingly close to them.) 
Tortoise: 
Watch out, Achilles! This is no laugh-
ing matter. 
Majotaur: 
Hee hee heel Ho hot Haw haw haw! 
Achilles: 
I'm starting to feel weak, Mr. T ... 
Tortoise: 
Try to pay no attention to his laugh, 
Achilles. That's your only hope. 
Achilles: 
I'll do my best. If only my stomach 
weren't empty! 
Tortoise: 
Say, am I smelling things, or is there a 
bowl of hot buttered popcorn around here? 
Achilles: 
] smell it, too. Where is it coming 
from? 
Tortoise: 
Over here, I think. Oh! Ijust ran into 
a big bowl of the stuff. Yes, indeed-it 
seems to be a bowl of popcorn! 
Achilles: 
Oh, boy-popcorn! I'm going to 
munch my head om 
Tortoise: 
Let's just hope it isn't pushcorn! Pushcorn and popcorn are so 
extraordinarily difficult to tell apart. 
124 
Achilles: 
What's this about Pushkin? 
Tortoise: 
I didn't say a thing. You must be hear-
ing things. 
Achilles: 
Go-golly! I hope not. Well, let's dig in! 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

(And the two friends begin munching the 
popcorn (or pushcorn?)-and all at 
once-POP! I guess it was popcorn, after 
all.) 
Tortoise: 
What an amusing story. Did you enjoy it? 
Achilles: 
Mildly. Only I wonder whether they ever got 
out of that Evil Majotaur's pit or not. Poor 
Achilles-he wanted to be full-sized again. 
Tortoise: 
Don't worry-they're out, and he is full-sized 
again. That's what the "POP" was all about. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I couldn't tell. Well, now I REALLY want to 
find that bottle of tonic. For some reason, my lips are 
burning. And nothing would taste better than a 
drink of popping-tonic. 
Tortoise: 
That stuff is renowned for its thirst quenching 
powers. Why, in some places people very nearly go 
crazy over it. At the turn of the century in Vienna, 
the Schonberg food factory stopped making tonic, 
and started making cereal instead. You can't imagine 
the uproar that caused. 
Achilles: 
I have an inkling. But let's go look for the tonic. 
Hey-just a moment. Those lizards on the desk-do 
you see anything funny about them? 
Tortoise: 
Umm ... not particularly. What do you see of 
such great interest? 
Achilles: 
Don't you see it? They're emerging from that 
flat picture without drinking any popping-tonic! 
How are they able to do that? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, didn't I tell you? You can get out of a 
picture by moving perpendicularly to its plane, if 
you have no popping-tonic. The little lizards have 
learned to climb UP when they want to get out of the 
two-dimensional sketchbook world. 
Achilles: 
Could we do the same thing to get out of this 
Escher picture we're in? 
Tortoise: 
Of course! Wejust need to go UP one story. Do 
you want to try it? 
Achilles: 
Anything to get back to my house! I'm tired of 
all these provocative adventures. 
Tortoise: 
Follow me, then, up this way. 
(And they go up one story.) 
Achilles: 
It's good to be back. But something seems wrong. This 
isn't my house! This is YOUR house, Mr. Tortoise. 
Tortoise: 
Well, so it is-and am I glad for that! I wasn't looking 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
125 

126 
forward one whit to the long walk back from your house. I am 
bushed, and doubt if I could have made it. 
Achilles: 
I don't mind walking home, so I guess it's lucky we 
ended up here, after all. 
Tortoise: 
I'll say! This certainly is a piece of Good Fortune! 
Little Harmonic Labyrinth 

CHAPTER V 
Recursive Structures 
and Processes 
What Is Recursion? 
WHAT IS RECURSION? It is what was illustrated in the Dialogue Little 
Harmonic Labyrinth: nesting, and variations on nesting. The concept is very 
general. (Stories inside stories, movies inside movies, paintings inside paint-
ings, Russian dolls inside Russian dolls (even parenthetical comments in-
side parenthetical comments!)-these are just a few of the charms of 
recursion.) However, you should be aware that the meaning of "recursive" 
in this Chapter is only faintly related to its meaning in Chapter III. The 
relation should be clear by the end of this Chapter. 
Sometimes recursion seems to brush paradox very closely. For exam-
ple, there are recursive definitions. Such a definition may give the casual 
viewer the impression that something is being defined in terms of itself. 
That would be circular and lead to infinite regress, if not to paradox 
proper. Actually, a recursive definition (when properly formulated) never 
leads to infinite regress or paradox. This is because a recursive definition 
never defines something in terms of itself, but always in terms of simpler 
versions of itself. What I mean by this will become clearer shortly, when I 
show some examples of recursive definitions. 
One of the most common ways in which recursion appears in daily life 
is when you postpone completing a task in favor of a simpler task, often of 
the same type. Here is a good example. An executive has a fancy telephone 
and receives many calls on it. He is talking to A when B calls. To A he says, 
"Would you mind holding for a moment?" Of course he doesn't really care 
if A minds; he just pushes a button, and switches to B. Now C calls. The 
same deferment happens to B. This could go on indefinitely, but let us not 
get too bogged down in our enthusiasm. So let's say the call with C termi-
nates. Then our executive "pops" back up to B, and continues. Meanwhile, 
A is sitting at the other end of the line, drumming his fingernails against 
some table, and listening to some horrible Muzak piped through the phone 
lines to placate him ... Now the easiest case is if the call with B simply 
terminates, and the executive returns to A finally. But it could happen that 
after the conversation with B is resumed, a new caller-D--calls. B is once 
again pushed onto the stack of waiting callers, and D is taken care of. After 
D is done, back to B, then back to A. This executive is hopelessly mechani-
cal, to be sure-but we are illustrating recursion in its most precise form. 
Recursive Structures and Processes 
127 

Pushing, Popping. and Stacks 
In the preceding example, I have introduced some basic terminology of 
recursion-at least as seen through the eyes of computer scientists. The 
terms are push, pop, and stack (or push-down stack, to be precise) and they are 
all related. They were introduced in the late 1950's as part of IPL, 
one of the first languages for Artificial Intelligence. You have already 
encountered "push" and "pop" in the Dialogue. But I will spell things out 
anyway. To push means to suspend operations on the task you're currently 
working on, without forgetting where you are-and to take up a new task. 
The new task is usually said to be "on a lower level" than the earlier task. To 
pop is the reverse-it means to close operations on one level, and to resume 
operations exactly where you left off, one level higher. 
But how do you remember exactly where you were on each different 
level? The answer is, you store the relevant information in a stack. So a stack 
is just a table telling you such things as (1) where you were in each 
unfinished task (jargon: the "return address"), (2) what the relevant facts to 
know were at the points of interruption (jargon: the "variable bindings"). 
When you pop back up to resume some task, it is the stack which restores 
your context, so you don't feel lost. In the telephone-call example, the stack 
tells you who is waiting on each different level, and where you were in the 
conversation when it was interrupted. 
By the way, the terms "push", "pop", and "stack" all come from the 
visual image of cafeteria trays in a stack. There is usually some sort of 
spring underneath which tends to keep the topmost tray at a constant 
height, more or less. So when you push a tray onto the stack, it sinks a 
little-and when you remove a tray from the stack, the stack pops up a 
little. 
One more example from daily life. When you listen to a news report 
on the radio, oftentimes it happens that they switch you to some foreign 
correspondent. "We now switch you to Sally Swumpley in Peafog, Eng-
land." Now Sally has got a tape of some local reporter interviewing 
someone, so after giving a bit of background, she plays it. "I'm Nigel 
Cadwallader, here on scenejust outside of Pea fog, where the great robbery 
took place, and I'm talking with ... " Now you are three levels down. It may 
turn out that the interviewee also plays a tape of some conversation. It is 
not too uncommon to go down three levels in real news reports, and 
surprisingly enough, we scarcely have any awareness of the suspension. It is 
all kept track of quite easily by our subconscious mind. Probably the reason 
it is so easy is that each level is extremely different in flavor from each other 
level. If they were all similar, we would get confused in no time flat. 
An example of a more complex recursion is, of course, our Dialogue. 
There, Achilles and the Tortoise appeared on all the different levels. 
Sometimes they were reading a story in which they appeared as characters. 
That is when your mind may get a little hazy on what's going on, and you 
have to concentrate carefully to get things straight. "Let's see, the real 
Achilles and Tortoise are still up there in Goodfortune's helicopter, but the 
128 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

secondary ones are in some Escher picture-and then they found this book 
and are reading in it, so it's the tertiary Achilles and Tortoise who are 
wandering around inside the grooves of the Little Harmonic Labyrinth. No, 
wait a minute-I left out one level somewhere ... " You have to have a 
conscious mental stack like this in order to keep track of the recursion in 
the Dialogue. (See Fig. 26.)

Little Harmonic Labyrinth 
FIGURE 26. Diagram of the structure of the Dialogue Little Harmonic Labyrinth. 
Vertical descents are "pushes"; rises are "pops". Notice the similarity of this diagram to the 
indentation pattern of the Dialogue. From the diagram it is clear that the initial tension-
Goodfortune's threat-never was resolved; Achilles and the Tortoise were just left dangling in 
the sky. Some readers might agonize over this unpopped push, while others might not bat an 
eyelash. In the story, Bach's musical labyrinth likewise was cut off too soon-but Achilles didn't 
even notice anythingfunny. Only the Tortoise was aware of the more global dangling tension. 
Stacks in Music 
While we're talking about the Little Harmonic Labyrinth, we should discuss 
something which is hinted at, if not stated explicitly in the Dialogue: that we 
hear music recursively-in particular, that we maintain a mental stack of 
keys, and that each new modulation pushes a new key onto the stack. The 
implication is further that we want to hear that sequence of keys retraced in 
reverse order-popping the pushed keys off the stack, one by one, until the 
tonic is reached. This is an exaggeration. There is a grain of truth to it, 
however. 
Any reasonably musical person automatically maintains a shallow stack 
with two keys. In that "short stack", the true tonic key is held, and also the 
most immediate "pseudotonic" (the key the composer is pretending to be 
in). In other words, the most global key and the most local key. That way, 
the listener knows when the true tonic is regained, and feels a strong sense 
of "relief". The listener can also distinguish (unlike Achilles) between a 
local easing of tension-for example a resolution into the pseudotonic-
Recursive Structures and Processes 
129 

and a global resolution. In fact, a pseudoresolution should heighten the 
global tension, not relieve it, because it is a piece of irony-just like Achilles' 
rescue from his perilous perch on the swinging lamp, when all the while 
you know he and the Tortoise are really awaiting their dire fates at the 
knife of Monsieur Goodfortune. 
Since tension and resolution are the heart and soul of music, there are 
many, many examples. But let usjust look at a couple in Bach. Bach wrote 
many pieces in an "AABB" form-that is, where there are two halves, and 
each one is repeated. Let's take the gigue from the French Suite no. 5, 
which is quite typical of the form. Its tonic key is G, and we hear a gay 
dancing melody which establishes the key of G strongly. Soon, however, a 
modulation in the A-section leads to the closely related key of D (the 
dominant). When the A-section ends, we are in the key of D. In fact, it 
sounds as if the piece has ended in the key of D! (Or at least it might sound 
that way to Achilles.) But then a strange thing happens-we abruptly jump 
back to the beginning, back to G, and rehear the same transition into D. But 
then a strange thing happens-we abruptly jump back to the beginning, 
back to G, and rehear the same transition into D. 
Then comes the B -section. With the inversion of the theme for our 
melody, we begin in D as if that had always been the tonic-but we 
modulate back to G after all, which means that we pop back into the tonic, 
and the B-section ends properly. Then that funny repetition takes place, 
jerking us without warning back into D, and letting us return to Gonce 
more. Then that funny repetition takes place, jerking us without warning 
back into D, and letting us return to G once more. 
The psychological effect of all this key shifting-some jerky, some 
smooth-is very difficult to describe. I t is part of the magic of music that we 
can automatically make sense of these shifts. Or perhaps it is the magic of 
Bach that he can write pieces with this kind of structure which have such a 
natural grace to them that we are not aware of exactly what is happening. 
The original Little Harmonic Labyrinth is a piece by Bach in which he 
tries to lose you in a labyrinth of quick key changes. Pretty soon you are so 
disoriented that you don't have any sense of direction left-you don't know 
where the true tonic is, unless you have perfect pitch, or like Theseus, have 
a friend like Ariadne who gives you a thread that allows you to retrace your 
steps. In this case, the thread would be a written score. This piece-another 
example is the Endlessly Rising Canon-goes to show that, as music listen-
ers, we don't have very reliable deep stacks. 
Recursion in Language 
Our mental stacking power is perhaps slightly stronger in language. The 
grammatical structure of all languages involves setting up quite elaborate 
push-down stacks, though, to be sure, the difficulty of understanding a 
sentence increases sharply with the number of pushes onto the stack. The 
proverbial German phenomenon of the "verb-at-the-end", about which 
130 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

droll tales of absentminded professors who would begin a sentence, ramble 
on for an entire lecture, and then finish up by rattling off a string of verbs 
by which their audience, for whom the stack had long since lost its coher-
ence, would be totally nonplussed, are told, is an excellent example of 
linguistic pushing and popping. The confusion among the audience that 
out-of-order popping from the stack onto which the professor's verbs had 
been pushed, is amusing to imagine, could engender. But in normal spo-
ken German, such deep stacks almost never occur-in fact, native speakers 
of German often unconsciously violate certain conventions which force the 
verb to go to the end, in order to avoid the mental effort of keeping track of 
the stack. Every language has constructions which involve stacks, though 
usually of a less spectacular nature than German. But there are always ways 
of rephrasing sentences so that the depth of stacking is minimal. 
Recursive Transition Networks 
The syntactical structure of sentences affords a good place to present a way 
of describing recursive structures and processes: the Recursive Transition 
Network (RTN). An RTN is a diagram showing various paths which can be 
followed to accomplish a particular task. Each path consists of a number of 
nodes, or little boxes with words in them,joined by arcs, or lines with arrows. 
The overall name for the RTN is written separately at the left, and the first 
and last nodes have the words begin and end in them. All the other nodes 
contain either very short explicit directions to perform, or else names of 
other RTN's. Each time you hit a node, you are to carry out the directions 
inside it, or to jump to the RTN named inside it, and carry it out. 
Let's take a sample RTN, called ORNATE NOUN, which tells how to 
construct a certain type of English noun phrase. (See Fig. 27a.) If we 
traverse ORNATE NOUN purely horizontally, we begin, then we create an 
ARTICLE, an ADJECTIVE, and a NOUN, then we end. For instance, "the silly 
shampoo" or "a thankless brunch". But the arcs show other possibilities, 
such as skipping the article, or repeating the adjective. Thus we could 
construct "milk", or "big red blue green sneezes", etc. 
When you hit the node NOUN, you are asking the unknown black box 
called NOUN to fetch any noun for you from its storehouse of nouns. This 
is known as a procedure call, in computer science terminology. It means you 
temporarily give control to a procedure (here, NOUN) which (1) does its 
thing (produces a noun) and then (2) hands control back to you. In the 
above RTN, there are calls on three such procedures: ARTICLE, ADJECTIVE, 
and NOUN. Now the RTN ORNATE NOUN could itself be called from some 
other RTN-for instance an RTN called SENTENCE. In this case, ORNATE 
NOUN would produce a phrase such as "the silly shampoo" and then 
return to the place inside SENTENCE from which it had been called. It is 
quite reminiscent of the way in which you resume where you left off in 
nested telephone calls or nested news reports. 
However, despite calling this a "recursive transition network", we have

not exhibited any true recursion so far. Things get recursive-and seem-
ingly circular-when you go to an RTN such as the one in Figure 27b, for 
FANCY NOUN. As you can see, every possible pathway in FANCY NOUN 
involves a call on ORNATE NOUN, so there is no way to avoid getting a 
noun of some sort or other. And it is possible to be no more ornate than 
that, coming out merely with "milk" or "big red blue green sneezes". But 
three of the pathways involve recursive calls on FANCY NOUN itself. It 
certainly looks as if something is being defined in terms of itself. Is that 
what is happening, or not? 
The answer is "yes, but benignly". Suppose that, in the procedure 
SENTENCE, there is a node which calls FANCY NOUN, and we hit that node. 
This means that we commit to memory (viz., the stack) the location of that 
node inside SENTENCE, so we'll know where to return to-then we transfer 
our attention to the procedure FANCY NOUN. Now we must choose a 
pathway to take, in order to generate a FANCY NOUN. Suppose we choose 
the lower of the upper pathways-the one whose calling sequence goes: 
ORNATE NOUN; 
RELATIVE PRONOUN; 
FANCY NOUN; VERB. 
132 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

So we spit out an ORNATE NOUN: "the strange bagels"; a RELATIVE PRO-
NOUN: "that"; and now we are suddenly asked for a FANCY NOUN. But we 
are in the middle of FANCY NOUN! Yes, but remember our executive who 
was in the middle of one phone call when he got another one. He merely 
stored the old phone call's status on a stack, and began the new one as if 
nothing were unusual. So we shall do the same. 
We first write down in our stack the node we are at in the outer call on 
FANCY NOUN, so that we have a "return address"; then we jump to the 
beginning of FANCY NOUN as if nothing were unusual. Now we have to 
choose a pathway again. For variety's sake, let's choose the lower pathway; 
ORNATE NOUN; PREPOSITION; FANCY NOUN. That means we produce 
an ORNATE NOUN (say "the purple cow"), then a PREPOSITION (say "with-
out"), and once again, we hit the recursion. So we hang onto our hats, and 
descend one more level. To avoid comple,xity, let's assume that this time, 
the pathway we take is the direct one-just ORNATE NOUN. For example, 
we might get "horns". We hit the node END in this call on FANCY NOUN, 
which amounts to popping out, and so we go to our stack to find the return 
address. It tells us that we were in the middle of executing FANCY NOUN 
one level up-and so we resume there. This yields "the purple cow without 
horns". On this level, too, we hit END, and so we pop up once more, this time 
finding ourselves in need of a VERB-so let's choose "gobbled". This ends the 
highest-level call on FANCY NOUN, with the result that the phrase 
"the strange bagels that the purple cow without horns gobbled" 
will get passed upwards to the patient SENTENCE, as we pop for the last 
time. 
As you see, we didn't get into any infinite regress. The reason is that at 
least one pathway inside the RTN FANCY NOUN does not involve any 
recursive calls on FANCY NOUN itself. Of course, we could have perversely 
insisted on always choosing the bottom pathway inside FANCY NOUN, and 
then we would never have gotten finished, just as the acronym "GOD" 
never got fully expanded. But if the pathways are chosen at random, then 
an infinite regress of that sort will not happen. 
"Bottoming Out" and Heterarchies 
This is the crucial fact which distinguishes recursive definitions from circu-
lar ones. There is always some part of the definition which avoids self-
reference, so that the action of constructing an object which satisfies the 
definition will eventually "bottom out". 
Now there are more oblique ways of achieving recursivity in RTN's 
than by self-calling. There is the analogue of Escher's Drawing Hands 
(Fig. 135), where each of two procednres calls the other, but not itself. For 
example, we could have an RTN named CLAUSE, which calls FANCY NOUN 
whenever it needs an object for a transitive verb, and conversely, the upper 
path of FANCY NOUN could call RELATIVE PRONOUN and then CLAUSE 
Recursive Structures and Processes 
133 

whenever it wants a relative clause. This is an example of indirect recursion. 
It is reminiscent also of the two-step version of the Epimenides paradox. 
Needless to sa y, there can be a trio of proced ures which call one another, 
cyclically-and so on. There can be a whole family of RTN's which are all 
tangled up, calling each other and themselves like crazy. A program which 
has such a structure in which there is no single "highest level", or 
"monitor", is called a heterarchy (as distinguished from a hierarchy). The 
term is due, I believe, to Warren McCulloch, one of the first cyberneticists, 
and a reverent student of brains and minds. 
Expanding Nodes 
One graphic way of thinking about RTN's is this. Whenever you are 
moving along some pathway and you hit a node which calls on an RTN, you 
"expand" that node, which means to replace it by a very small copy of the 
RTN it calls (see Fig. 28). Then you proceed into the very small RTN! 
FIGURE 28. 
The FANCY NOUN RTN with one node recursively expanded. 
When you pop out of it, you are automatically in the right place in the big 
one. While in the small one, you may wind up constructing even more 
miniature RTN's. But by expanding nodes only when you come across 
them, you avoid the need to make an infinite diagram, even when an RTN 
calls itself. 
Expanding a node is a little like replacing a letter in an acronym by the 
word it stands for. The "GOD" acronym is recursive but has the defect--or 
advantage-that you must repeatedly expand the 'G'; thus it never bottoms 
out. When an RTN is implemented as a real computer program, however, 
it always has at least one pathway which avoids recursivity (direct or indi-
rect) so that infinite regress is not created. Even the most heterarchical 
program structure bottoms out--otherwise it couldn't run! It would just be 
constantly expanding node after node, but never performing any action. 
134 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

Diagram G and Recursive Sequences 
Infinite geometrical structures can be defined in just this way-that is, by 
expanding node after node. For example, let us define an infinite diagram 
called "Diagram G". To do so, we shall use an implicit representation. In 
two nodes, we shall write merely the letter 'G', which, however, will stand 
for an entire copy of Diagram G. In Figure 29a, Diagram G is portrayed 
implicitly. Now if we wish to see Diagram G more explicitly, we expand 
each of the two G's-that is, we replace them by the same diagram, only reduced 
in scale (see Fig. 2gb). This "second-order" version of Diagram G gives us 
an inkling of what the final, impossible-to-realize Diagram G really looks 
like. In Figure 30 is shown a larger portion of Diagram G, where all the 
nodes have been numbered from the bottom up, and from left to right. 
Two extra nodes-numbers 1 and 2-have been inserted at the bottom. 
This infinite tree has some very curious mathematical properties. Run-
ning up its right-hand edge is the famous sequence of Fibonacci numbers:

defined recursively by the pair of formulas 
FIBO(n) = FIBO(n - 1) + FIBO(n - 2) 
for n > 2

Notice how new Fibonacci numbers are defined in terms of previous 
Fibonacci numbers. We could represent this pair of formulas in an RTN 
(see Fig. 31). 
let x = FlBO(n-l)

value is 1 
FIGURE 31. An RTN for Fibonacci numbers. 
Thus you can calculate FIBO(l5) by a sequence of recursive calls on the 
procedure defined by the RTN above. This recursive definition bottoms 
out when you hit FIBO(l) or FIBO(2) (which are given explicitly) after you 
have worked your way backwards through descending values of n. It is 
slightly awkward to work your way backwards, when you could just as well 
work your way forwards, starting with FIBO(I) and FIBO(2) and always 
adding the most recent two values, until you reach FIBO(l5). That way you 
don't need to keep track of a stack. 
Now Diagram G has some even more surprising properties than this. 
Its entire structure can be coded up in a single recursive definition, as 
follows: 
136 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

G(n) = n -
G(G(n - 1» 
G(O) = 0 
for n > 0 
How does this function G(n) code for the tree-structure? Quite simply, if 
you construct a tree by placing G(n) below n, for all values of n, you will 
recreate Diagram G. In fact, that is how I discovered Diagram G in the first 
place. I was investigating thefunction G, and in trying to calculate its values 
quickly, I conceived of displaying the values I already knew in a tree. To my 
surprise, the tree turned out to have this extremely orderly recursive 
geometrical description. 
What is more wonderful is that if you make the analogous tree for a 
function H(n) defined with one more nesting than G-
H(n) = n - H(H(H(n - 1») 
H(O) = 0 
for n > 0 
-then the associated "Diagram H" is defined implicitly as shown in Figure 
29c. The right-hand trunk contains one more node; that is the only 
difference. The first recursive expansion of Diagram H is shown in Figure 
29d. And so it goes, for any degree of nesting. There is a beautiful 
regularity to the recursive geometrical structures, which corresponds pre-
cisely to the recursive algebraic definitions. 
A problem for curious readers is: suppose you flip Diagram G around 
as if in a mirror, and label the nodes of the new tree so they increase from 
left to right. Can you find a recursive algebraic definition for this "flip-tree"? 
What about for the "flip" of the H-tree? Etc.? 
Another pleasing problem involves a pair of recursively intertwined 
functions F(n) and M(n)-"married" functions, you might say-defined 
this way: 
F(n) = n -
M(F(n - 1» } 
for n > 0 
M(n) = n -
F(M(n - 1» 
F(O) = 1, and 
M(O) = o. 
The RTN's for these two functions call each other and themselves as well. 
The problem is simply to discover the recursive structures of Diagram F 
and Diagram M. They are quite elegant and simple. 
A Chaotic Sequence 
One last example of recursion in number theory leads to a small mystery. 
Consider the following recursive definition of a function: 
Q(n) = Q(n - Q(n - 1» + Q(n - Q(n - 2» 
Q(l) = Q(2) = 1. 
Recursive Structures and Processes 
for n > 2

It is reminiscent of the Fibonacci definition in that each new value is a sum 
of two previous values-but not of the immediately previous two values. 
Instead, the two immediately previous values tell how far to count back 
to obtain the numbers to be added to make the new value! The first 17 
Q-numbers run as follows: 
1, 
1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6,

To obtain the next one, move leftwards (from the three dots) respectively 
10 and 9 terms; you will hit a 5 and a 6, shown by the arrows. Their 
sum-II-yields the new value: Q( 18). This is the strange process by which 
the list of known Q-numbers is w;ed to extend itself. The resulting se-
quence is, to put it mildly, erratic. The further out you go, the less sense it 
seems to make. This is one of those very peculiar cases where what seems to 
be a somewhat natural definition leads to extremely puzzling behavior: 
chaos produced in a very orderly manner. One is naturally led to wonder 
whether the apparent chaos conceals some subtle regularity. Of course, by 
definition, there is regularity, but what is of interest is whether there is 
another way of characterizing this sequence-and with luck, a nonrecursive 
way. 
Two Striking Recursive Graphs 
The marvels of recursion in mathematics are innumerable, and it is not my 
purpose to present them all. However, there are a couple of particularly 
striking examples from my own experience which I feel are worth present-
ing. They are both graphs. One came up in the course of some number-
theoretical investigations. The other came up in the course of my Ph.D. 
thesis work, in solid state physics. What is truly fascinating is that the 
graphs are closely related. 
The first one (Fig. 32) is a graph of a function which I call INT(x). It is 
plotted here for x between ° and 1. For x between any other pair of 
integers nand n + 1, you just find INT(x-n), then add n back. The 
structure of the plot is quite jumpy. as you can see. It consists of an infinite 
number of curved pieces, which get smaller and smaller towards the 
corners-and incidentally, less and less curved. Now if you look closely at 
each such piece, you will find that it is actually a copy of the full graph, 
merely curved! The implications are wild. One of them is that the graph of 
INT consists of nothing but copies of itself, nested down infinitely deeply. 
If you pick up any piece of the graph, no matter how small, you are holding 
a complete copy of the whole graph-in fact, infinitely many copies of it! 
The fact that INT consists of nothing but copies of itself might make 
you think it is too ephemeral to exist. Its definition sounds too circular.

value qf x. 
How does it ever get off the ground? That is a very interesting matter. The 
main thing to notice is that, to describe INT to someone who hasn't seen it, 
it will not suffice merely to say, "It consists of copies of itself." The other 
half of the story-the nonrecursive half-tells where those copies lie inside 
the square, and how they have been deformed, relative to the full-size 
graph. Only the combination of these two aspects of INT will specify the 
structure of INT. It is exactly as in the definition of Fibonacci numbers, 
where you need two lines-one to define the recursion, the other to define 
the bottom (i.e., the values at the beginning). To be very concrete, if you 
make one of the bottom values 3 instead of 1, you will produce a completely 
different sequence, known as the Lucas sequence: 
1, 
3, 4, 7,

123, ...

Recursive Structures and Processes 
139 

What corresponds to the bottom in the definition of INT is a picture 
(Fig. 33a) composed of many boxes, showing where the copies go, and how 
they are distorted. I call it the "skeleton" of INT. To construct INT from its 
skeleton, you do the following. First, for each box of the skeleton, you do 
two operations: (1) put a small curved copy of the skeleton inside the box, 
using the curved line inside it as a guide; (2) erase the containing box and 
its curved line. Once this has been done for each box of the original 
skeleton, you are left with many "baby" skeletons in place of one big one. 
Next you repeat the process one level down, with all the baby skeletons. 
Then again, again, and again ... What you approach in the limit is an exact 
graph of INT, though you never get there. By nesting the skeleton inside 
itself over and over again, you gradually construct the graph of INT "from 
out of nothing". But in fact the "nothing" was not nothing-it was a picture. 
To see this even more dramatically, imagine keeping the recursive part 
of the definition of INT, but changing the initial picture, the skeleton. A 
variant skeleton is shown in Figure :J3b, again with boxes which get smaller 
and smaller as they trail off to the four corners. If you nest this second 
skeleton inside itself over and over again, you will create the key graph 
from my Ph.D. thesis, which I call Gplot (Fig. 34). (In fact, some compli-
cated distortion of each copy is needed as well-but nesting is the basic 
idea.) Gplot is thus a member of the I NT-family. It is a distant relative, 
because its skeleton is quite different from-and considerably more com-
plex than-that of INT. However, the recursive part of the definition is 
identical, and therein lies the family tie. 
I should not keep you too much in the dark about the origin of these 
beautiful graphs. INT -standing for "interchange"--comes from a prob-
lem involving "Eta-sequences", whlCh are related to continued fractions. 
The basic idea behind INT is that plus and minus signs are interchanged in 
a certain kind of continued fraction. As a consequence, INT(INT(x» = x. 
INT has the property that if x is rational, so is INT(x); if x is quadratic, so 
is INT(x). I do not know if this trend holds for higher algebraic degrees. 
Another lovely feature of INT is that at all rational values of x, it has a 
jump discontinuity, but at all irrational values of x, it is continuous. 
Gplot comes from a highly idealized version of the question, "What are 
the allowed energies of electrons in a crystal in a magnetic field?" This 
problem is interesting because it is a cross between two very simple and 
fundamental physical situations: an electron in a perfect crystal, and an 
electron in a homogeneous magnetic field. These two simpler problems are 
both well understood, and their characteristic solutions seem almost in-
compatible with each other. Therefore, it is of quite some interest to see 
how nature manages to reconcile the two. As it happens, the crystal-
without-magnetic-field situation and the magnetic-field-without-crystal 
situation do have one feature in common: in each of them, the electron 
behaves periodically in time. It turns out that when the two situations are 
combined, the ratio of their two time periods is the key parameter. In fact, 
that ratio holds all the information about the distribution of allowed elec-
tron energies-but it only gives up its secret upon being expanded into a 
continued fraction.

~------------------------

Gplot shows that distribution. The horizontal axis represents energy, 
and the vertical axis represents the above-mentioned ratio of time periods, 
which we can call "0". At the bottom, 0 is zero, and at the top 0 is unity. 
When 0 is zero, there is no magnetic field. Each of the line segments 
making up Gplot is an "energy band"-that is, it represents allowed values 
of energy. The empty swaths traversing Gplot on all different size scales are 
therefore regions of forbidden energy. One of the most startling properties 
of Gplot is that when 0 is rational (say plq in lowest terms), there are exactly 
q such bands (though when q is even, two of them "kiss" in the middle). 
And when 0 is irrational, the bands shrink to points, of which there are 
infinitely many, very sparsely distributed in a so-called "Cantor set"-
another recursively defined entity which springs up in topology. 
You might well wonder whether such an intricate structure would ever 
show up in an experiment. Frankly, I would be the most surprised person 
in the world if Gplot came out of any experiment. The physicality of Gplot 
lies in the fact that it points the way to the proper mathematical treatment 
of less idealized problems of this SOI·t. In other words, Gplot is purely a 
contribution to theoretical physics, not a hint to experimentalists as to what 
to expect to see! An agnostic friend of mine once was so struck by Gplot's 
infinitely many infinities that he called it "a picture of God", which I don't 
think is blasphemous at all. 
Recursion at the Lowest Level of Matter 
We have seen recursion in the grammars of languages, we have seen 
recursive geometrical trees which grow upwards forever, and we have seen 
one way in which recursion enters the theory of solid state physics. Now we 
are going to see yet another way in which the whole world is built out of 
recursion. This has to do with the structure of elementary particles: elec-
trons, protons, neutrons, and the tiny quanta of electromagnetic radiation 
called "photons". We are going to see that particles are-in a certain sense 
which can only be defined rigorously in relativistic quantum mechanics-
nested inside each other in a way which can be described recursively, 
perhaps even by some sort of "grammar". 
We begin with the observation that if particles didn't interact with each 
other, things would be incredibly simple. Physicists would like such a world 
because then they could calculate the behavior of all particles easily (if 
physicists in such a world existed, which is a doubtful proposition). Particles 
without interactions are called bare JlGrticles, and they are purely hypotheti-
cal creations; they don't exist. 
Now when you "turn on" the interactions, then particles get tangled up 
together in the way that functions F and M are tangled together, or 
married people are tangled together. These real particles are said to be 
renormalized-an ugly but intriguing term. What happens is that no particle 
can even be defined without referring to all other particles, whose defini-
tions in turn depend on the first particles, etc. Round and round, in a 
never-ending loop.

FIGURE 34. Gplot: a recursive graph showing energy bands for electrons in an idealized 
crystal in a magnetic field. ex, representing magnetic field strength, runs vertically from 0 to 1. 
Energy runs horizontally. The horizontal line segments are bands of allowed electron energies. 

Let us be a little more concrete, now. Let's limit ourselves to only two 
kinds of particles: electrons and photons. We'll also have to throw in the 
electron's antiparticle, the positron. (Photons are their own antiparticles.) 
Imagine first a dull world where a bare electron wishes to propagate from 
point A to point B, as Zeno did in my Three-Part Invention. A physicist would 
draw a picture like this: 
A •• ------... _----........ B 
There is a mathematical expression which corresponds to this line and its 
endpoints, and it is easy to write down. With it, a physicist can understand 
the behavior of the bare electron in this trajectory. 
Now let us "turn on" the electromagnetic interaction, whereby elec-
trons and photons interact. Although there are no photons in the scene, 
there will nevertheless be profound consequences even for this simple 
trajectory. I n particular, our electron now becomes capable of emitting and 
then reabsorbing virtual photons-photons which flicker in and out of exis-
tence before they can be seen. Let us show one such process: 
A •• 
.. .B 
Now as our electron propagates, it may emit and reabsorb one photon after 
another, or it may even nest them, as shown below: 
A •• 
• 
.B 
The mathematical expressions corresponding to these diagrams-called 
"Feynman diagrams"-are easy to write down, but they are harder to 
calculate than that for the bare electron. But what really complicates mat-
ters is that a photon (real or virtual) can decay for a brief moment into an 
electron-positron pair. Then these two annihilate each other, and, as if by 
magic, the original photon reappears. This sort of process is shown below: 
The electron has a right-pointing arrow, while the positron's arrow points 
leftwards. 
144 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

As you might have anticipated, these virtual processes can be nested 
inside each other to arbitrary depth. This can give rise to some very 
complicated-looking drawings, such as the one in Figure 35. In that Feyn-
man diagram, a single electron enters on the left at A, does some amazing 
acrobatics, and then a single electron emerges on the right at B. To an 
outsider who can't see the inner mess, it looks as if one electron has 
peacefully sailed from A to B. In the diagram, you can see how electron 
lines can get arbitrarily embellished, and so can the photon lines. This 
diagram would be ferociously hard to calculate. 
>-t-.,,....--... --..... B 
FIGURE 35. A Feynman diagram showing the propagation of a renormalized electron from 
A to B. In this diagram, time increases to the right. Therefore, in the segments where the 
electron's arrow points leftwards, it is moving "backwards in time". A more intuitive way to say 
this is that an antielectron (positron) is moving forwards in time. Photons are their own 
antiparticles; hence their lines have no need of arrows. 
There is a sort of "grammar" to these diagrams, that only allows 
certain pictures to be realized in nature. For instance, the one below is 
impossible: 
You might say it is not a "well-formed" Feynman diagram. The grammar is 
a result of basic laws of physics, such as conservation of energy, conserva-
tion of electric charge, and so on. And, like the grammars of human 
languages, this grammar has a recursive structure, in that it allows deep 
nestings of structures inside each other. It would be possible to draw up a 
set of recursive transition networks defining the "grammar" of the elec-
tromagnetic interaction. 
When bare electrons and bare photons are allowed to interact in these 
arbitrarily tangled ways, the result is renormalized electrons and photons. 
Thus, to understand how a real, physical electron propagates from A to B, 
Recursive Structures and Processes 
145 

the physicist has to be able to take a sort of average of all the infinitely many 
different possible drawings which involve virtual particles. This is Zeno 
with a vengeance! 
Thus the point is that a physical particle-a renormalized particle-
involves (1) a bare particle and (2) a huge tangle of virtual particles, 
inextricably wound together in a recursive mess. Every real particle's exis-
tence therefore involves the existence of infinitely many other particles, 
contained in a virtual "cloud" which surrounds it as it propagates. And each 
of the virtual particles in the cloud, of course, also drags along its own 
virtual cloud, and so on ad infinitum. 
Particle physicists have found that this complexity is too much to 
handle, and in order to understand the behavior of electrons and photons, 
they use approximations which neglect all but fairly simple Feynman dia-
grams. Fortunately, the more complex a diagram, the less important its 
contribution. There is no known way of summing up all of the infinitely 
many possible diagrams, to get an expression for the behavior of a fully 
renormalized, physical electron. Bul by considering roughly the simplest 
hundred diagrams for certain processes, physicists have been able to pre-
dict one value (the so-called g-factor of the muon) to nine decimal places-
correctly! 
Renormalization takes place not only among electrons and photons. 
Whenever any types of particle interact together, physicists use the ideas of 
renormalization to understand the phenomena. Thus protons and neu-
trons, neutrinos, pi-mesons, quarks·-all the beasts in the subnuclear zoo--
they all have bare and renormalized versions in physical theories. And 
from billions of these bubbles within bubbles are all the beasts and baubles 
of the world composed. 
Copies and Sameness 
Let us now consider Gplot once again. You will remember that in the 
Introduction, we spoke of different varieties of canons. Each type of canon 
exploited some manner of taking an original theme and copying it by an 
isomorphism, or information-preserving transformation. Sometimes the 
copies were upside down, sometimes backwards, sometimes shrunken or 
expanded ... In Gplot we have all those types of transformation, and 
more. The mappings between the full Gplot and the "copies" of itself inside 
itself involve size changes, skewings. reflections, and more. And yet there 
remains a sort of skeletal identity, which the eye can pick up with a bit of 
effort, particularly after it has practiced with INT. 
Escher took the idea of an object's parts being copies of the object itself 
and made it into a print: his woodcut Fishes and Scales (Fig. 36). Of course 
these fishes and scales are the same only when seen on a sufficiently abstract 
plane. Now everyone knows that a fish's scales aren't really small copies of 
the fish; and a fish's cells aren't small wpies of the fish; however, a fish's 
DN A, sitting inside each and everyone of the fish's cells, is a very convo-

Recursive Structures and Processes 

FIGURE 36. 
Fish and Scales, by M. C. Escher (woodcut, 1959). 
luted "copy" of the entire fish-and so there is more than a grain of truth to 
the Escher picture. 
What is there that is the "same" about all butterflies? The mapping 
from one butterfly to another does not map cell onto cell; rather, it maps 
functional part onto functional part, and this may be partially on a macro-
scopic scale, partially on a microscopic scale. The exact proportions of parts 
are not preserved; just the functional relationships between parts. That is 
the type of isomorphism which links all butterflies in Escher's wood engrav-
ing Butterflies (Fig. 37) to each other. The same goes for the more abstract 
butterflies of Gplot, which are all linked to each other by mathematical 
mappings that carry functional part onto functional part, but totally ignore 
exact line proportions, angles, and so on. 
Taking this exploration of sameness to a yet higher plane of abstrac-
tion, we might well ask, "What is there that is the 'same' about all Escher 
drawings?" It would be quite ludicrous to attempt to map them piece by 
piece onto each other. The amazing thing is that even a tiny section of an

147 

FIGURE 37. 
Butterflies, by M. C. Escher (wood-engraving, 1950). 
Escher drawing or a Bach piece gives it away. Just as a fish's DNA IS 
contained inside every tiny bit of the fish, so a creator's "signature" is 
contained inside every tiny section of his creations. We don't know what to 
call it but "style"-a vague and elusive word. 
We keep on running up against "sameness-in-differentness", and the 
question 
When are two things the same? 
It will recur over and over again in this book. We shall come at it from all 
sorts of skew angles, and in the end, we shall see how deeply this simple 
question is connected with the nature of intelligence. 
That this issue arose in the Chapter on recursion is no accident, for 
recursion is a domain where "sameness-in-differentness" plays a central 
role. Recursion is based on the "same" thing happening on several differ-
148 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

ent levels at once. But the events on different levels aren't exactly the 
same-rather, we find some invariant feature in them, despite many ways 
in which they differ. For example, in the Little Harmonic Labyrinth, all the 
stories on different levels are quite unrelated-their "sameness" resides in 
only two facts: (1) they are stories, and (2) they involve the Tortoise and 
Achilles. Other than that, they are radically different from each other. 
Programming and Recursion: 
Modularity, Loops, Procedures 
One of the essential skills in computer programming is to perceive when 
two processes are the same in this extended sense, for that leads to 
modularization-the breaking-up of a task into natural subtasks. For in-
stance, one might want a sequence of many similar operations to be carried 
out one after another. Instead of writing them all out, one can write a loop, 
which tells the computer to perform a fixed set of operations and then loop 
back and perform them again, over and over, until some condition is 
satisfied. Now the body of the loop-the fixed set of instructions to be 
repeated-need not actually be completely fixed. It may vary in some 
predictable way. 
An example is the most simple-minded test for the primality of a 
natural number N, in which you begin by trying to divide N by 2, then by 
3, 4, 5, etc. until N - 1. If N has survived all these tests without being 
divisible, it's prime. Notice that each step in the loop is similar to, but not 
the same as, each other step. Notice also that the number of steps varies 
with N-hence a loop of fixed length could never work as a general test for 
primality. There are two criteria for "aborting" the loop: (1) if some 
number divides N exactly, quit with answer "NO"; (2) if N - 1 is reached 
as a test divisor and N survives, quit with answer "YES". 
The general idea of loops, then, is this: perform some series of related 
steps over and over, and abort the process when specific conditions are met. 
Now sometimes, the maximum number of steps in a loop will be known in 
advance; other times, you just begin, and wait until it is aborted. The 
second type of loop-which I call afree loop-is dangerous, because the 
criterion for abortion may never occur, leaving the computer in a so-called 
"infinite loop". This distinction between bounded loops andfree loops is one of 
the most important concepts in all of computer science, and we shall devote 
an entire Chapter to it: "BlooP and FlooP and GlooP". 
Now loops may be nested inside each other. For instance, suppose that 
we wish to test all the numbers between 1 and 5000 for primality. We can 
write a second loop which uses the above-described test over and over, 
starting with N = 1 and finishing with N = 5000. So our program will 
have a "loop-the-loop" structure. Such program structures are typical-in 
fact they are deemed to be good programming style. This kind of nested 
loop also occurs in assembly instructions for commonplace items, and in 
such activities as knitting or crocheting-in which very small loops are 
Recursive Structures and Processes 
149 

repeated several times in larger loops, which in turn are carried out re-
peatedly ... While the result of a low-level loop might be no more than 
couple of stitches, the result of a high-level loop might be a substantial 
portion of a piece of clothing. 
In music, too, nested loops often occur-as, for instance, when a scale 
(a small loop) is played several times in a row, perhaps displaced in pitch 
each new time. For example, the last movements of both the Prokofiev fifth 
piano concerto and the Rachmaninoff second symphony contain extended 
passages in which fast, medium, and slow scale-loops are played simultane-
ously by different groups of instruments, to great effect. The Prokofiev-
scales go up; the Rachmaninoff-scales, down. Take your pick. 
A more general notion than loop is that of subroutine, or procedure, 
which we have already discussed somewhat. The basic idea here is that a 
group of operations are lumped together and considered a single unit with 
a name-such as the procedure ORNATE NOUN. As we saw in RTN's, 
procedures can call each other by name, and thereby express very concisely 
sequences of operations which are to be carried out. This is the essence of 
modularity in programming. Modularity exists, of course, in hi-fi systems, 
furniture, living cells, human society-wherever there is hierarchical or-
ganization. 
More often than not, one wants a procedure which will act variably, 
according to context. Such a procedure can either be given a way of 
peering out at what is stored in memory and selecting its actions accord-
ingly, or it can be explicitly fed a list of parameters which guide its choice of 
what actions to take. Sometimes both of these methods are used. In RTN-
terminology, choosing the sequence of actions to carry out amounts to 
choosing which pathway to follow. An RTN which has been souped up with 
parameters and conditions that control the choice of pathways inside it is 
called an Augmented Transition Network (ATN). A place where you might 
prefer ATN's to RTN's is in producing sensible-as distinguished from 
nonsensical-English sentences out of raw words, according to a grammar 
represented in a set of ATN's. The parameters and conditions would allow 
you to insert various semantic constraints, so that random juxtapositions 
like "a thankless brunch" would be prohibited. More on this in Chapter 
XVIII, however. 
Recursion in Chess Programs 
A classic example of a recursive procedure with parameters is one for 
choosing the "best" move in chess. The best move would seem to be the one 
which leaves your opponent in the toughest situation. Therefore, a test for 
goodness of a move is simply this: pretend you've made the move, and now 
evaluate the board from the point of view of your opponent. But how does 
your opponent evaluate the position? Well, he looks for his best move. That 
is, he mentally runs through all possible moves and evaluates them from 
what he thinks is your point of view, hoping they will look bad to you. But 
150 
Recursive Structures and Processes 

notice that we have now defined "best move" recursively, simply using the 
maxim that what is best for one side is worst for the other. The recursive 
procedure which looks for the best move operates by trying a move, and 
then calling on itself in the role of opponent! As such, it tries another move, and 
calls on itself in the role of its opponent's opponent-that is, itself. 
This recursion can go several levels deep-but it's got to bottom out 
somewhere! How do you evaluate a board position without looking ahead? 
There are a number of useful criteria for this purpose, such as simply the 
number of pieces on each side, the number and type of pieces under attack, 
the control of the center, and so on. By using this kind of evaluation at the 
bottom, the recursive move-generator can pop back upwards and give an 
evaluation at the top level of each different move. One of the parameters in 
the self-calling, then, must tell how many moves to look ahead. The outer-
most call on the procedure will use some externally set value for this 
parameter. Thereafter, each time the procedure recursively calls itself, it 
must decrease this look-ahead parameter by 1. That way, when the 
parameter reaches zero, the procedure will follow the alternate pathway-
the non-recursive evaluation. 
In this kind of game-playing program, each move investigated causes 
the generation of a so-called "look-ahead tree", with the move itself as 
trunk, responses as main branches, counter-responses as subsidiary 
branches, and so on. In Figure 38 I have shown a simple look-ahead tree, 
depicting the start of a tic-tac-toe game. There is an art to figuring out how 
to avoid exploring every branch of a look-ahead tree out to its tip. In chess 
trees, people-not computers-seem to excel at this art; it is known that 
top-level players look ahead relatively little, compared to most chess pro-
grams-yet the people are far better! In the early days of computer chess, 
people used to estimate that it wO).lld be ten years until a computer (or 
FIGURE 38. 
The branching tree of moves and countermoves at the start of a game of 
tic-tac-toe. 
Recursive Structures and Processes 
151 

program) was world champion. But after ten years had passed, it seemed 
that the day a computer would become world champion was still more than 
ten years away ... This is just one more piece of evidence for the rather 
recursive 
Hofstadter's Law: 
It always takes longer than you expect, even 
when you take into account Hofstadter's Law. 
Recursion and Unpredictability 
Now what is the connection between the recursive processes of this Chap-
ter, and the recursive sets of the preceding Chapter? The answer involves 
the notion of a recursively enumerable set. For a set to be r.e. means that it can 
be generated from a set of starting points (axioms), by the repeated applica-
tion of rules of inference. Thus, the set grows and grows, each new element 
being compounded somehow out of previous elements, in a sort of "math-
ematical snowball". But this is the essence of recursion-something being 
defined in terms of simpler versions of itself, instead of explicitly. The 
Fibonacci numbers and the Lucas numbers are perfect examples of r.e. 
sets-snowballing from two elements by a recursive rule into infinite sets. It 
isjust a matter of convention to call an r.e. set whose complement is also r.e. 
"recursive" . 
Recursive enumeration is a process in which new things emerge from 
old things by fixed rules. There seem to be many surprises in such process-
es-for example the unpredictability of the Q-sequence. It might seem that 
recursively defined sequences of that type possess some sort of inherently 
increasing complexity of behavior, so that the further out you go, the less 
predictable they get. This kind of thought carried a little further suggests 
that suitably complicated recursive systems might be strong enough to 
break out of any predetermined patterns. And isn't this one of the defining 
properties of intelligence? Instead of just considering programs composed 
of procedures which can recursively call themselves, why not get really 
sophisticated, and invent programs which can modify themselves-pro-
grams which can act on programs, extending them, improving them, 
generalizing them, fixing them, and so on? This kind of "tangled recur-
sion" probably lies at the heart of intelligence.

Recursive Structures and Processes 

Canon 
by I ntervallic Augmentation 
Achilles and the Tortoise have just finished a delicious Chinese banquet 
for two, at the best Chinese restaurant in town. 
Achilles: 
You wield a mean chopstick, Mr. T. 
Tortoise: 
I ought to. Ever since my youth, I have had a fondness for 
Oriental cuisine. And you-did you enjoy your meal, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Immensely. I'd not eaten Chinese food before. This meal was a 
splendid introduction. And now, are you in a hurry to go, or shall we 
just sit here and talk a little while? 
Tortoise: 
I'd love to talk while we drink our tea. Waiter! 
(A waiter comes up.) 
Could we have our bill, please, and some more tea? 
(The waiter rushes off) 
Achilles: 
You may know more about Chinese cuisine than I do, Mr. T, but 
I'll bet I know more about Japanese poetry than you do. Have you ever 
read any haiku? 
Tortoise: 
I'm afraid not. What is a haiku? 
Achilles: 
A haiku is a Japanese seventeen-syllable poem-or minipoem, 
rather, which is evocative in the same way, perhaps, as a fragrant rose 
petal is, or a lily pond in a light drizzle. It generally consists of groups 
of five, then seven, then five syllables. 
Tortoise: 
Such compressed poems with seventeen syllables can't have 
much meaning ... 
Achilles: 
Meaning lies as much in the mind of the reader as in the 
haiku. 
Tortoise: 
Hmm ... T.hat's an evocative statement. 
(The waiter arrives with their bill, another pot of tea, and two fortune 
cookies.) 
Thank you, waiter. Care for more tea, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Please. Those little cookies look delicious. (Picks one up, bites into it, 
and begins to chew.) Hey! What's this funny thing inside? A piece of 
paper? 
Tortoise: 
That's your fortune, Achilles. Many Chinese restaurants give out 
fortune cookies with their bills, as a way of softening the blow. If you 
frequent Chinese restaurants, you come to think of fortune cookies 
C anon by I ntervallic Augmentation 
153 

less as cookies than as message bearers. Unfortunately you seem to 
have swallowed some of your fortune. What does the rest say? 
Achilles: 
It's a little strange, for all the letters are run together, with no 
spaces in between. Perhaps it needs decoding in some way? Oh, now I 
see. If you put the spaces back in where they belong, it says, "ONE WAR 
TWO EAR EWE". I can't quite make head or tail of that. Maybe it was a 
haiku-like poem, of which I ate the majority of syllables. 
Tortoise: 
In that case, your fortune is now a mere 5/l7-haiku. And a 
curious image it evokes. If 5/l7-haiku is a new art form, then I'd say 
woe, 0, woe are we ... May I look at it? 
Achilles (handing the Tortoise the small slip of paper): 
Certainly. 
Tortoise: 
Why, when I "decode" it, Achilles, it comes out completely dif-
ferent! It's not a 5/l7-haiku at all. It is a six-syllable message which says, 
"0 NEW ART WOE ARE WE". That sounds like an insightful commentary 
on the new art form of 5/l7-haiku. 
Achilles: 
You're right. Isn't it astonishing that the poem contains its own 
commentary! 
Tortoise: 
All I did was to shift the reading frame by one unit-that is, shift 
all the spaces one unit to the right. 
Achilles: 
Let's see what your fortune says, Mr. Tortoise. 
Tortoise (deftly splitting open his cookie, reads): 
"Fortune lies as much in the 
hand of the eater as in the cookie." 
Achilles: 
Your fortune is also a haiku, Mr. Tortoise-at least it's got seven-
teen syllables in the 5-7-5 form. 
Tortoise: 
Glory be! I would never have noticed that, Achilles. It's the kind 
of thing only you would have noticed. What struck me more is what it 
says-which, of course, is open to interpretation. 
Achilles: 
I guess it just shows that each of us has his own characteristic way 
of interpreting messages which we run across ... 
(Idly, Achilles gazes at the tea leaves on the bottom of his empty teacup.) 
Tortoise: 
More tea, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Yes, thank you. By the way, how is your friend the Crab? I have 
been thinking about him a lot since you told me of your peculiar 
phonograph-battle. 
Tortoise: 
I have told him about you, too, and he is quite eager to meet you. 
He is getting along just fine. In fact, he recently made a new acquisition 
in the record player line: a rare type of jukebox. 
Achilles: 
Oh, would you tell me about it? I find jukeboxes, with their 
flashing colored lights and silly songs, so quaint and reminiscent of 
bygone eras. 
Tortoise: 
This jukebox is too large to fit in his house, so he had a shed 
specially built in back for it. 
Achilles: 
I can't imagine why it would be so large, unless it has an unusu-
ally large selection of records. Is that it? 
Tortoise: 
As a matter of fact, it has exactly one record. 
154 
Canon by Intervallic Augmentation 

Achilles: 
What? A jukebox with only one record? That's a contradiction in 
terms. Why is the jukebox so big, then? Is its single record gigantic-
twenty feet in diameter? 
Tortoise: 
No, it's just a regular jukebox-style record. 
Achilles: 
Now, Mr. Tortoise, you must be joshing me. After all, what kind 
of a jukebox is it that has only a single song? 
Tortoise: 
Who said anything about a single song, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Every jukebox I've ever run into obeyed the fundamental 
jukebox-axiom: "One record, one song". 
Tortoise: 
This jukebox is different, Achilles. The one record sits vertically 
suspended, and behind it there is a small but elaborate network of 
overhead rails, from which hang various record players. When you 
push a pair of buttons, such as B-1, that selects one of the record 
players. This triggers an automatic mechanism that starts the record 
player squeakily rolling along the rusty tracks. It gets shunted up 
alongside the record-then it clicks into playing position. 
Achilles: 
And then the record begins spinning and music comes out-
right? 
Tortoise: 
Not quite. The record stands still-it's the record player which 
rotates. 
Achilles: 
I might have known. But how, if you have but one record to play, 
can you get more than one song out of this crazy contraption? 
Tortoise: 
I myself asked the Crab that question. He merely suggested that 
I try it out. So I fished a quarter from my pocket (you get three plays 
for a quarter), stuffed it in the slot, and hit buttons B-1, then C-3, then 
B-IO-all just at random. 
Achilles: 
So phonograph B-1 came sliding down the rail, I suppose, and 
plugged itself into the vertical record, and began spinning? 
Tortoise: 
Exactly. The music that came out was quite agreeable, based on 
the famous old tune B-A-C-H, which I believe you remember ... 
J 
Achilles: 
Could I ever forget it? 
Tortoise: 
This was record player B-1. Then it finished, and was slowly 
rolled back into its hanging position, so that C-3 could be slid into 
position. 
Achilles: 
Now don't tell me that C-3 played another song? 
Tortoise: 
It did just that. 
Achilles: 
Ah, I understand. It played the flip side of the first song, or 
another band on the same side. 
Tortoise: 
No, the record has grooves only on one side, and has only a 
single band.

Achilles: 
I don't understand that at all. You CAN'T pull different songs out 
of the same record! 
Tortoise: 
That's what I thought until I saw Mr. Crab's jukebox. 
Achilles: 
How did the second song go? 
Tortoise: 
That's the interesting thing ... It was a song based on the melody 
C-A-G-E. 
Achilles: 
That's a totally different melody! 
Tortoise: 
True. 
Achilles: 
And isn't John Cage a composer of modern music? I seem to 
remember reading about him in one of my books on haiku. 
Tortoise: 
Exactly. He has composed many celebrated pieces, such as 4'33", 
a three-movement piece consisting of silences of different lengths. It's 
wonderfully expressive-if you like that sort of thing. 
Achilles: 
I can see where if I were in a loud and brash cafe I might gladly 
pay to hear Cage's 4 '33" on a jukebox. It might afford some relief! 
Tortoise: 
Right-who wants to hear the racket of clinking dishes and 
jangling silverware? By the way, another place where 4 '33" would 
come in handy is the Hall of Big Cats, at feeding time. 
Achilles: 
Are you suggesting that Cage belongs in the zoo? Well, I guess 
that makes some sense. But about the Crab's jukebox ... I am baffled. 
How could both "BACH" and "CAGE" be coded inside a single record 
at once? 
Tortoise: 
You may notice that there is some relation between the two, 
Achilles, if you inspect them carefully. Let me point the way. What do 
you get if you list the successive intervals in the melody B-A-C-H? 
Achilles: 
Let me see. First it goes down one semitone, from B to A (where 
B is taken the German way); then it rises three semitones to C; and 
finally it falls one semitone, to H. That yields the pattern: 
-1, +3, -1. 
Tortoise: 
Precisely. What about C-A-G-E, now? 
Achilles: 
Well, in this case, it begins by falling three semitones, then rises 
ten semitones (nearly an octave), and finally falls three more 
semitones. That means the pattern is: 
-3, + 10, -3. 
It's very much like the other one, isn't it? 
Tortoise: 
Indeed it is. They have exactly the same "skeleton", in a certain 
sense. You can make C-A-G-E out of B-A-C-H by multiplying all the 
intervals by 3%, and taking the nearest whole number. 
Achilles: 
Well, blow me down and pick me up! So does that mean that only 
156 
Canon by Intervallic Augmentation 

some sort of skeletal code is present in the grooves, and that the 
various record players add their own interpretations to that code? 
Tortoise: 
I don't know, for sure. The cagey Crab wouldn't fill me in on all 
the details. But I did get to hear a third song, when record player B-I0 
swiveled into place. 
Achilles: 
How did it go? 
Tortoise: 
The melody consisted of enormously wide intervals, and went 
B-C-A-H. , 
~. J 
~ ~r 
I 
I 
The interval pattern in semitones was; 
-10, +33, 
-10. 
It can be gotten from the CAGE pattern by yet another multiplication 
by 3 %, and rounding to whole numbers. 
Achilles: 
Is there a name for this kind of interval multiplication? 
Tortoise: 
One could call it "intervallic augmentation". It is similar to the 
canonic device of temporal augmentation, where all the time values of 
notes in a melody get multiplied by some constant. There, the effect is 
just to slow the melody down. Here, the effect is to expand the melodic 
range in a curious way. 
Achilles: 
Amazing. So all three melodies you tried were intervallic aug-
mentations of one single underlying groove-pattern in the record? 
Tortoise: 
That's what I conclyded. 
Achilles: 
I find it curious that when you augment BACH you get CAGE, 
and when you augment CAGE over again, you get BACH back, except 
jumbled up inside, as if BACH had an upset stomach after passing 
through the intermediate stage of CAGE. 
Tortoise: 
That sounds like an insightful commentary on the new art form 
of Cage.

CHAPTER VI 
The Location of Meaning 
When Is One Thing Not Always the Same? 
LAST CHAPTER, WE came upon the question, "When are two things the 
same?" In this Chapter, we will deal with the flip side of that question: 
"When is one thing not always the same?" The issue we are broaching is 
whether meaning can be said to be inherent in a message, or whether 
meaning is always manufactured by the interaction of a mind or a 
mechanism with a message-as in the preceding Dialogue. In the latter 
case, meaning could not said to be located in any single place, nor could it 
be said that a message has any universal, or objective, meaning, since each 
observer could bring its own meaning to each message. But in the former 
case, meaning would have both location and universality. In this Chapter, I 
want to present the case for the universality of at least some messages, 
without, to be sure, claiming it for all messages. The idea of an "objective 
meaning" of a message will turn out to be related, in an interesting way, to 
the simplicity with which intelligence can be described. 
I nformation-Bearers and I nformation-Revealers 
I'll begin with my favorite example: the relationship between records, 
music, and record players. We feel quite comfortable with the idea that a 
record contains the same information as a piece of music, because of the 
existence of record players, which can "read" records and convert the 
groove-patterns into sounds. In other words, there is an isomorphism 
between groove-patterns and sounds, and the record player is a mechanism 
which physically realizes that isomorphism. It is natural, then, to think of 
the record as an information-bearer, and the record-player as an information-
revealer. A second example of these notions is given by the pq-system. 
There, the "information-bearers" are the theorems, and the "information-
revealer" is the interpretation, which is so transparent that we don't need 
any electrical machine to help us extract the information from pq-
theorems. 
One gets the ImpressIOn from these two examples that isomorphisms 
and decoding mechanisms (i.e., information-revealers) simply reveal in-
formation which is intrinsically inside the structures, waiting to be "pulled 
out". This leads to the idea that for each structure, there are certain pieces 
of information which can be pulled out of it, while there are other pieces of 
information which cannot be pulled out of it. But what does this phrase 
158 
The Location of Meaning 

"pull out" really mean? How hard are you allowed to pull? There are cases 
where by investing sufficient effort, you can pull very recondite pieces of 
information out of certain structures. In fact, the pulling-out may involve 
such complicated operations that it makes you feel you are putting in more 
information than you are pulling out. 
Genotype and Phenotype 
Take the case of the genetic information commonly said to reside in the 
double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A molecule of DNA-a 
genotype-is converted into a physical organism-a phenotype-by a very 
complex process, involving the manufacture of proteins, the replication of 
the DNA, the replication of cells, the gradual differentiation of cell types, 
and so on. Incidentally, this unrolling of phenotype from genotype-
epigenesis-is the most tangled of tangled recursions, and in Chapter XVI 
we shall devote our full attention to it. Epigenesis is guided by a set of 
enormously complex cycles of chemical reactions and feedback loops. By 
the time the full organism has been constructed, there is not even the 
remotest similarity between its physical characteristics and its genotype. 
And yet, it is standard practice to attribute the physical structure of the 
organism to the structure of its DNA, and to that alone. The first evidence 
for this point of view came from experiments conducted by Oswald Avery 
in 1946, and overwhelming corroborative evidence has since been amassed. 
Avery's experiments showed that, of all the biological molecules, only DNA 
transmits hereditary properties. One can modify other molecules in an 
organism, such as proteins, but such modifications will not be transmitted 
to later generations. However, when DNA is modified, all successive gener-
ations inherit the modified DNA. Such experiments show that the only way 
of changing the instructions for building a new organism is to change the 
DNA-and this, in turn, implies that those instructions must be coded 
somehow in the structure of the DNA. 
Exotic and Prosaic Isomorphisms 
Therefore one seems forced into accepting the idea that the DNA's struc-
ture contains the information of the phenotype's structure, which is to say, 
the two are isomorphic. However, the isomorphism is an exotic one, by which 
I mean that it is highly nontrivial to divide the phenotype and genotype 
into "parts" which can be mapped onto each other. Prosaic isomorphisms, 
by contrast, would be ones in which the parts of one structure are easily 
mappable onto the parts of the other. An example is the isomorphism 
between a record and a piece of music, where one knows that to any sound 
in the piece there exists an exact "image" in the patterns etched into the 
grooves, and one could pinpoint it arbitrarily accurately, if the need arose. 
Another prosaic isomorphism is that between Gplot and any of its internal 
bu tterflies. 
The Location of Meaning 
159 

The isomorphism between DNA structure and phenotype structure is 
anything but prosaic, and the mechanism which carries it out physically is 
awesomely complicated. For instance, if you wanted to find some piece of 
your DNA which accounts for the shape of your nose or the shape of your 
fingerprint, you would have a very hard time. It would be a little like trying 
to pin down the note in a piece of music which is the carrier of the emotional 
meaning of the piece. Of course there is no such note, because the emo-
tional meaning is carried on a very high level, by large "chunks" of the 
piece, not by single notes. Incidentally, such "chunks" are not necessarily 
sets of contiguous notes; there may be disconnected sections which, taken 
together, carry some emotional meaning. 
Similarly, "genetic meaning"-that is, information about phenotype 
structure-is spread all through the small parts of a molecule of DNA, 
although nobody understands the language yet. (Warning: Understanding 
this "language" would not at all be the same as cracking the Genetic Code, 
something which took place in the early 1960's. The Genetic Code tells how 
to translate short portions of DNA into various amino acids. Thus, cracking 
the Genetic Code is comparable to figuring out the phonetic values of the 
letters of a foreign alphabet, without figuring out the grammar of the 
language or the meanings of any of its words. The cracking of the Genetic 
Code was a vital step on the way to extracting the meaning of DNA strands, 
but it was only the first on a long path which is yet to be trodden.) 
Jukeboxes and Triggers 
The genetic meaning contained in DNA is one of the best possible exam-
ples of implicit meaning. In order to convert genotype into phenotype, a 
set of mechanisms far more complex than the genotype must operate on 
the genotype. The various parts of the genotype serve as triggers for those 
mechanisms. Ajukebox-the ordinary type, not the Crab type!-provides a 
useful analogy here: a pair of buttons specifies a very complex action to be 
taken by the mechanism, so that the pair of buttons could well be described 
as "triggering" the song which is played. In the process which converts 
genotype into phenotype, cellular jukeboxes-if you will pardon the 
notion!-accept "button-pushings" from short excerpts from a long strand 
of DNA, and the "songs" which they play are often prime ingredients in the 
creation of further 'Jukeboxes". It is as if the output of real jukeboxes, 
instead of being love ballads, were songs whose lyrics told how to build 
more complex jukeboxes ... Portions of the DNA trigger the manufacture 
of proteins; those proteins trigger hundreds of new reactions; they in turn 
trigger the replicating-operation which, in several steps, copies the 
DNA-and on and on ... This gives a sense of how recursive the whole 
process is. The final result of these many-triggered triggerings is the 
phenotype-the individual. And one says that the phenotype is the 
revelation-the "pulling-out"-of the information that was present in the 
DNA to start with, latently. (The term "revelation" in this context is due to 
160 
The Location of Meaning 

Jacques Monod, one of the deepest and most original of twentieth-century 
molecular biologists.) 
Now no one would say that a song coming 'Jut of the loudspeaker of a 
jukebox constitutes a "revelation" of information inherent in the pair of 
buttons which were pressed, for the pair of buttons seem to be mere triggers 
whose purpose is to activate information-bearing portions of the jukebox 
mechanism. On the other hand, it seems perfectly reasonable to call the 
extraction of music from a record a "revelation" of information inherent in 
the record, for several reasons: 
0) the music does not seem to be concealed in the mechanism of 
the record player; 
(2) 
it is possible to match pieces of the input (the record) with 
pieces of the output (the music) to an arbitrary degree of 
accuracy; 
(3) 
it is possible to play other records on the same record player 
and get other sounds out; 
(4) 
the record and the record player are easily separated from 
one another. 
It is another question altogether whether the fragments of a smashed 
record contain intrinsic meaning. The edges of the separate pieces fit 
together and in that way allow the information to be reconstituted-but 
something much more complex is going on here. Then there is the ques-
tion of the intrinsic meaning of a scrambled telephone call ... There is a 
vast spectrum of degrees of inherency of meaning. It is interesting to try to 
place epigenesis in this spectrum. As development of an organism takes 
place, can it be said that the information is being "pulled out" of its DNA? 
Is that where all of the information about the organism's structure resides? 
DNA and the Necessity of Chemical Context 
In one sense, the answer seems to be yes, thanks to experiments like 
Avery's. But in another sense, the answer seems to be no, because so much 
of the pulling-out process depends on extraordinarily complicated cellular 
chemical processes, which are not coded for in the DNA itself. The DNA 
relies on the fact that they will happen, but does not seem to contain any 
code which brings them about. Thus we have two conflicting views on the 
nature of the information in a genotype. One view says that so much of the 
information is outside the DNA that it is not reasonable to look upon the 
DNA as anything more than a very intricate set of triggers, like a sequence 
of buttons to be pushed on ajukebox; another view says that the information 
is all there, but in a very implicit form. 
Now it might seem that these are just two ways of saying the same 
thing, but that is not necessarily so. One view says that the DNA is quite 
meaningless out of context; the other says that even if it were taken out of 
context, a molecule of DNA from a living being has such a compelling inner 
The Location of Meaning 
161 

logic to its structure that its message could be deduced anyway. To put it as 
succinctly as possible, one view says that in order for DNA to have meaning, 
chemical context is necessary; the other view says that only intelligence IS 
necessary to reveal the "intrinsic meaning" of a strand of DNA. 
An Unlikely UFO 
We can get some perspective on this issue by considering a strange 
hypothetical event. A record of David Oistrakh and Lev Oborin playing 
Bach's sonata in F Minor for violin and clavier is sent up in a satellite. From 
the satellite it is then launched on a course which will carry it outside of the 
solar system, perhaps out of the entire galaxy-just a thin plastic platter 
with a hole in the middle, swirling its way through intergalactic space. It has 
certainly lost its context. How much meaning does it carry? 
If an alien civilization were to encounter it, they would almost certainly 
be struck by its shape, and would probably be very interested in it. Thus 
immediately its shape, acting as a trigger, has given them some informa-
tion: that it is an artifact, perhaps an information-bearing artifact. This 
idea-communicated, or triggered, by the record itself-now creates a new 
context in which the record will henceforth be perceived. The next steps in 
the decoding might take considerably longer-but that is very hard for us 
to assess. We can imagine that if such a record had arrived on earth in 
Bach's time, no one would have known what to make of it, and very likely it 
would not have gotten deciphered. But that does not diminish our convic-
tion that the information was in principle there; we just know that human 
knowledge in those times was not very sophisticated with respect to the 
possibilities of storage, transformation, and revelation of information. 
Levels of Understanding of a Message 
Nowadays, the idea of decoding is extremely widespread; it is a significant 
part of the activity of astronomers, linguists, archaeologists, military 
specialists, and so on. It is often suggested that we may be floating in a sea 
of radio messages from other civilizations, messages which we do not yet 
know how to decipher. And much serious thought has been given to the 
techniques of deciphering such a message. One of the main problems-
perhaps the deepest problem-is the question, "How will we recognize the 
fact that there is a message at all? How to identify a frame?" The sending of 
a record seems to be a simple solution-its gross physical structure is very 
attention-drawing, and it is at least plausible to us that it would trigger, in 
any sufficiently great intelligence, the idea of looking for information 
hidden in it. However, for technological reasons, sending of solid objects to 
other star systems seems to be out of the question. Still, that does not 
prevent our thinking about the idea. 
Now suppose that an alien civilization hit upon the idea that the 
appropriate mechanism for translation of the record is a machine which 
162 
The Location of Meaning 

converts the groove-patterns into sounds. This would still be a far cry from 
a true deciphering. What, indeed, would constitute asuccessJul deciphering 
of such a record? Evidently, the civilization would have to be able to make 
sense out of the sounds. Mere production of sounds is in itself hardly 
worthwhile, unless they have the desired triggering effect in the brains (if 
that is the word) of the alien creatures. And what is that desired effect? It 
would be to activate structures in their brains which create emotional 
effects in them which are analogous to the emotional effects which we 
experience in hearing the piece. In fact, the production of sounds could 
even be bypassed, provided that they used the record in some other way to 
get at the appropriate structures in their brains. (If we humans had a way 
of triggering the appropriate structures in our brains in sequential order, 
as music does, we might be quite content to bypass the sounds-but it seems 
extraordinarily unlikely that there is any way to do that, other than via our 
ears. Deaf composers-Beethoven, Dvorak, Faure--<>r musicians who can 
"hear" music by looking at a score, do not give the lie to this assertion, for 
such abilities are founded upon preceding decades of direct auditory 
experiences. ) 
Here is where things become very unclear. Will beings of an alien 
civilization have emotions? Will their emotions-supposing they have 
some-be mappable, in any sense, onto ours? If they do have emotions 
somewhat like ours, do the emotions cluster together in somewhat the same 
way as ours do? Will they understand such amalgams as tragic beauty or 
courageous suffering? If it turns out that beings throughout the universe 
do share cognitive structures with us to the extent that even emotions 
overlap, then in some sense, the record can never be out of its natural 
context; that context is part of the scheme of things, in nature. And if such 
is the case, then it is likely that a meandering record, if not destroyed en 
route, would eventually get picked up by a being or group of beings, and 
get deciphered in a way which we would consider successful. 
"Imaginary Spacescape" 
In ~sking about the meaning of a molecule of DNA above, I used the 
phrase "compelling inner logic"; and I think this is a key notion. To 
illustrate this, let us slightly modify our hypothetical record-into-space 
event by substituting John Cage's "Imaginary Landscape no. 4" for the 
Bach. This piece is a classic of aleatoric, or chance, music-music whose 
structure is chosen by various random processes, rather than by an attempt 
to convey a personal emotion. In this case, twenty-four performers attach 
themselves to the twenty-four knobs on twelve radios. For the duration of 
the piece they twiddle their knobs in aleatoric ways so that each radio 
randomly gets louder and softer, switching stations all the while. The total 
sound produced is the piece of music. Cage's attitude is expressed in his 
own words: "to let sounds be themselves, rather than vehicles for man-
made theories or expressions of human sentiments." 
The Location of Meaning 
163 

Now imagine that this is the piece on the record sent out into space. It 
would be extraordinarily unlikely-if not downright impossible-for an 
alien civilization to understand the nature of the artifact. They would 
probably be very puzzled by the contradiction between the frame message 
("I am a message; decode me"), and the chaos of the inner structure. There 
are few "chunks" to seize onto in this Cage piece, few patterns which could 
guide a decipherer. On the other hand, there seems to be, in a Bach piece, 
much to seize onto-patterns, patterns of patterns, and so on. We have no 
way of knowing whether such patterns are universally appealing. We do 
not know enough about the nature of intelligence, emotions, or music to 
say whether the inner logic of a piece by Bach is so universally compelling 
that its meaning could span galaxies. 
However, whether Bach in particular has enough inner logic is not the 
issue here; the issue is whether any message has, per se, enough compelling 
inner logic that its context will be restored automatically whenever intelli-
gence of a high enough level comes III contact with it. If some message did 
have that context-restoring property, then it would seem reasonable to 
consider the meaning of the message as an inherent property of the 
message. 
The Heroic Decipherers 
Another illuminating example of these ideas is the decipherment of ancient 
texts written in unknown languages and unknown alphabets. The intuition 
feels that there is information inherent in such texts, whether or not we 
succeed in revealing it. It is as strong a feeling as the belief that there is 
meaning inherent in a newspaper written in Chinese, even if we are 
completely ignorant of Chinese. Once the script or language of a text has 
been broken, then no one questions where the meaning resides: clearly it 
resides in the text, not in the method of decipherment-just as music resides 
in a record, not inside a record player! One of the ways that we identify 
decoding mechanisms is by the fact that they do not add any meaning to the 
signs or objects which they take as input; they merely reveal the intrinsic 
meaning of those signs or objects. A jukebox is not a decoding mechanism, 
for it does not reveal any meaning belonging to its input symbols; on the 
contrary, it supplies meaning concealed inside itself. 
Now the decipherment of an ancient text may have involved decades 
of labor by several rival teams of scholars, drawing on knowledge stored in 
libraries all over the world ... Doesn·t this process add information, too? 
Just how intrinsic is the meaning of a text, when such mammoth efforts are 
required in order to find the decoding rules? Has one put meaning into the 
text, or was that meaning already there? My intuition says that the meaning 
was always there, and that despite the arduousness of the pulling-out 
process, no meaning was pulled out that wasn't in the text to start with. This 
intuition comes mainly from one fact: I feel that the result was inevitable; 
that, had the text not been deciphered by this group at this time, it would 
have been deciphered by that group at that time-and it would have come 
164

out the same way. That is why the meaning is part of the text itself; it acts 
upon intelligence in a predictable way. Generally, we can say: meaning is 
part of an object to the extent that it acts upon intelligence in a predictable 
way. 
In Figure 39 is shown the Rosetta stone, one of the most precious of all 
historic discoveries. It was the key to the decipherment of Egyptian hiero-
glyphics, for it contains parallel text in three ancient scripts: hieroglyphics, 
demotic characters, and Greek. The inscription on this basalt stele was first 
deciphered in 1821 by Jean Fran~ois Champollion, the "father of Egyptol-
ogy"; it is a decree of priests assembled at Memphis in favor of Ptolemy V 
Epiphanes.

165 

Three Layers of Any Message 
In these examples of decipherment of out-of-context messages, we can 
separate out fairly clearly three levels of information: (1) the frame mes-
sage; (2) the outer message; (3) the inner message. The one we are most 
familiar with is (3), the inner message; it is the message which is supposed 
to be transmitted: the emotional experiences in music, the phenotype in 
genetics, the royalty and rites of ancient civilizations in tablets, etc. 
To understand the inner message is to have extracted the meaning 
intended by the sender. 
The frame message is the message "I am a message; decode me if you 
can!"; and it is implicitly conveyed by the gross structural aspects of any 
information-bearer. 
To understand the frame mes-sage is to recognize the need 
for a decoding-mechanism. 
If the frame message is recognized as such, then attention is switched 
to level (2), the outer message. This is information, implicitly carried by 
symbol-patterns and structures in the message, which tells how to decode 
the inner message. 
To understand the outer message is to build, or know how to 
build, the correct decoding mechanism for the inner message. 
This outer level is perforce an implicit message, in the sense that the sender 
cannot ensure that it will be understood. It would be a vain effort to send 
instructions which tell how to decode the outer message, for they would 
have to be part of the inner message, which can only be understood once 
the decoding mechanism has been found. For this reason, the outer message is 
necessarily a set of triggers, rather than a message which can be revealed by a 
known decoder. 
The formulation of these three "layers" is only a rather crude begin-
ning at analyzing how meaning is contained in messages. There may be 
layers and layers of outer and inner messages, rather than just one of each. 
Think, for instance, of how intricately tangled are the inner and outer 
messages of the Rosetta stone. To decode a message fully, one would have 
to reconstruct the entire semantic structure which underlay its creation-
and thus to understand the sender in every deep way. Hence one could 
throwaway the inner message, because if one truly understood all the 
finesses of the outer message, the inner message would be reconstructible. 
The book After Babel, by George Steiner, is a long discussion of the 
interaction between inner and outer messages (though he never uses that 
terminology). The tone of his book is given by this quote: 
We normally use a shorthand beneath which there lies a wealth of subcon-
scious, deliberately concealed or declared associations so extensive and intri-
166 
The Location of Meaning 

cate that they probably equal the sum and uniqueness of our status as an 
individual person.! 
Thoughts along the same lines are expressed by Leonard B. Meyer, in his 
book Music, the Arts, and Ideas: 
The way of listening to a composition by Elliott Carter is radically different 
from the way of listening appropriate to a work by John Cage. Similarly, a 
novel by Beckett must in a significant sense be read differently from one by 
Bellow. A painting by Willem de Kooning and one by Andy Warhol require 
different perceptional-cognitive attitudes. 2 
Perhaps works of art are trying to convey their style more than any-
thing else. In that case, if you could ever plumb a style to its very bottom, 
you could dispense with the creations in that style. "Style", "outer message", 
"decoding technique"-all ways of expressing the same basic idea. 
Schrodinger's Aperiodic Crystals 
What makes us see a frame message in certain objects, but none in others? 
Why should an alien civilization suspect, if they intercept an errant record, 
that a message lurks within? What would make a record any different from 
a meteorite? Clearly its geometric shape is the first clue that "something 
funny is going on". The next clue is that, on a more microscopic scale, it 
consists of a very long aperiodic sequence of patterns, arranged in a spiral. 
If we were to unwrap the spiral, we would have one huge linear sequence 
(around 2000 feet long) of minuscule symbols. This is not so different from 
a DNA molecule, whose symbols, drawn from a meager "alphabet" of four 
different chemical bases, are arrayed in a one-dimensional sequence, and 
then coiled up into a helix. Before Avery had established the connection 
between genes and DNA, the physicist Erwin Schrodinger predicted, on 
purely theoretical grounds, that genetic information would have to be 
stored in "aperiodic crystals", in his influential book What Is Life? In fact, 
books themselves are aperiodic crystals contained inside neat geometrical 
forms. These examples suggest that, where an aperiodic crystal is found 
"packaged" inside a very regular geometric structure, there may lurk an 
inner message. (I don't claim this is a complete characterization of frame 
messages; however, it is a fact that many common messages have frame 
messages of this description. See Figure 40 for some good examples.) 
Languages for the Three Levels 
The three levels are very clear in the case of a message found in a bottle 
washed up on a beach. The first level, the frame message, is found when 
one picks up the bottle and sees that it is sealed, and contains a dry piece of 
paper. Even without seeing writing, one recognizes this type of artifact as 
an information-bearer, and at this point it would take an extraordinary-
almost inhuman-lack of curiosity, to drop the bottle and not look further.

Next, one opens the bottle and examines the marks on the paper. Perhaps 
they are in Japanese; this can be discovered without any of the inner 
message being understood-it merely comes from a recognition of the 
characters. The outer message can be stated as an English sentence: "I am 
in Japanese." Once this has been discovered, then one can proceed to 
the inner message, which may be a call for help, a haiku poem, a lover's 
lament ... 
It would be of no use to include in the inner message a translation of 
the sentence "This message is in Japanese", since it would take someone 
who knew Japanese to read it. And before reading it, he would have to 
recognize the fact that, as it is in Japanese, he can read it. You might try to 
wriggle out of this by including translations of the statement "This message 
is in Japanese" into many different languages. That would help in a 
practical sense, but in a theoretical sense the same difficulty is there. An 
English-speaking person still has to recognize the "Englishness" of the 
message; otherwise it does no good. Thus one cannot avoid the problem 
that one has to find out how to decipher the inner message from the outside; 
the inner message itself may provide clues and confirmations, but those are 
at best triggers acting upon the bottle finder (or upon the people whom he 
enlists to help). 
Similar kinds of problem confront the shortwave radio listener. First, 
he has to decide whether the sounds he hears actually constitute a message, 
or are just static. The sounds in themselves do not give the answer, not even 
in the unlikely case that the inner message is in the listener's own native 
language, and is saying, "These sounds actually constitute a message and 
are not just static!" If the listener recognizes a frame message in the sounds, 
then he tries to identify the language the broadcast is in-and clearly, he is 
still on the outside; he accepts triggers from the radio, but they cannot 
explicitly tell him the answer. 
It is in the nature of outer messages that they are not conveyed in any 
FIGURE 40. 
A collage of scripts. Uppermost on the left is an inscription in the unde-
ciphered boustrophedonic writing system from Easter Island, in which every second line is 
upside down. The characters are chiseled on a wooden tablet, 4 inches by 35 inches. Moving 
clockwise, we encounter vertically written Mongolian: above, present-day Mongolian, and 
below, a document dating from 1314. Then we come to a poem in Bengali lry Rabindranath 
Tagore in the bottom righthand corner. Next to it is a newspaper headline in Malayiilam (West 
Kerala, southern India), above which is the elegant curvilinear language Tamil (East 
Kerala). The smallest entry is part of a folk tale in Buginese (Celebes Island, Indonesia). In the 
center if the collage is a paragraph in the Thai language, and above it a manuscript in Runic 
datingfrom the fourteenth century, containing a sample if the provincial law of Scania (south 
Sweden). Finally, wedged in on the left is a section of the laws of Hammurabi, written in 
Assyrian cuneiform. As an outsider, I feel a deep sense of mystery as I wonder how meaning is 
cloaked in the strange curves and angles of each of these beautiful aperiodic crystals. In form, 
there is content. [From Hans Jensen, Sign, Symbol, and Script (New York: G. Putnam's Sons, 
1969), pp. 89 (cuneiform), 356 (Easter Island), 386, 417 (Mongolian), 552 (Runic); from Kenneth 
Katzner, The Languages of the World (New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1975), pp. 190 (Bengali), 237

Washington Square Press, 1960), pp. 73 (Tamil), 82 (Thai).]

explicit language. To find an explicit language in which to convey outer 
messages would not be a breakthrough-it would be a contradiction in 
terms! It is always the listener's burden to understand the outer message. 
Success lets him break through into the inside, ,at which point the ratio of 
triggers to explicit meanings shifts drastically towards the latter. By com-
parison with the previous stages, understanding the inner message seems 
effortless. It is as if it just gets pumped in. 
The "Jukebox" Theory of Meaning 
These examples may appear to be evidence for the viewpoint that no 
message has intrinsic meaning, for in order to understand any inner 
message, no matter how simple it is, one must first understand its frame 
message and its outer message, both of which are carried only by triggers 
(such as being written in the Japanese alphabet, or having spiraling 
grooves, etc.). It begins to seem, then, that one cannot get away from a 
''jukebox'' theory of meaning-the doctrine that no message contains inherent 
meaning, because, before any message can be understood, it has to be used 
as the input to some "jukebox", which means that information contained in 
the ''jukebox'' must be added to the message before it acquires meaning. 
This argument is very similar to the trap which the Tortoise caught 
Achilles in, in Lewis Carroll's Dialogue. There, the trap was the idea that 
before you can use any rule, you have to have a rule which tells you how to 
use that rule; in other words, there is an infinite hierarchy oflevels of rules, 
which prevents any rule from ever getting used. Here, the trap is the idea 
that before you can understand any message, you have to have a message 
which tells you how to understand that message; in other words, there is an 
infinite hierarchy of levels of messages, which prevents any message from 
ever getting understood. However, we all know that these paradoxes are 
invalid, for rules do get used, and me:>sages do get understood. How come? 
Against the Jukebox Theory 
This happens because our intelligence is not disembodied, but is instan-
tiated in physical objects: our brains. Their structure is due to the long 
process of evolution, and their operations are governed by the laws of 
physics. Since they are physical entities, our brains run without being told how 
to run. So it is at the level where thoughts are produced by physical law that 
Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down: and likewise, it is at the level where a 
brain interprets incoming data as a message that the message-paradox 
breaks down. It seems that brains come equipped with "hardware" for 
recognizing that certain things are messages, and for decoding those mes-
sages. This minimal inborn ability to extract inner meaning is what allows 
the highly recursive, snowballing process of language acquisition to take 
place. The inborn hardware is like a jukebox: it supplies the additional 
information which turns mere triggers into complete messages. 
170 
The Location of Meaning 

Meaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence Is Natural 
Now if different people's ''jukeboxes'' had different "songs" in them, and 
responded to given triggers in completely idiosyncratic ways, then we 
would have no inclination to attribute intrinsic meaning to those triggers. 
However, human brains are so constructed that one brain responds in 
much the same way to a given trigger as does another brain, all other things 
being equal. This is why a baby can learn any language; it responds to 
triggers in the same way as any other baby. This uniformity of "human 
jukeboxes" establishes a uniform "language" in which frame messages and 
outer messages can be communicated. If, furthermore, we believe that 
human intelligence is just one example of a general phenomenon in 
nature-the emergence of intelligent beings in widely varying contexts-
then presumably the "language" in which frame messages and outer mes-
sages are communicated among humans is a "dialect" of a universal lan-
guage by which intelligences can communicate with each other. Thus, there 
would be certain kinds of triggers which would have "universal triggering 
power", in that all intelligent beings would tend to respond to them in the 
same way as we do. 
This would allow us to shift our description of where meaning is 
located. We could ascribe the meanings (frame, outer, and inner) of a 
message to the message itself, because of the fact that deciphering 
mechanisms are themselves universal-that is, they are fundamental forms 
of nature which arise in the same way in diverse contexts. To make it very 
concrete, suppose that "A-5" triggered the same song in all jukeboxes-and 
suppose moreover that jukeboxes were not man-made artifacts, but widely 
occurring natural objects, like galaxies or carbon atoms. Under such cir-
cumstances, we would probably feel justified in calling the universal trig-
gering power of "A-5" its "inherent meaning"; also, "A-5" would merit the 
name of "message", rather than "trigger", and the song would indeed be a 
"revelation" of the inherent, though implicit, meaning of "A-5". 
Earth Chauvinism 
This ascribing of meaning to a message comes from the invariance of the 
processing of the message by intelligences distributed anywhere in the 
universe. In that sense, it bears some resemblance to the ascribing of mass 
to an object. To the ancients, it must have seemed that an object's weight 
was an intrinsic property of the object. But as gravity became understood, it 
was realized that weight varies with the gravitational field the object is 
immersed in. Nevertheless, there is a related quantity, the mass, which does 
not vary according to the gravitational field; and from this invariance came 
the conclusion that an object's mass was an intrinsic property of the object 
itself. If it turns out that mass is also variable, according to context, then we 
will backtrack and revise our opinion that it is an intrinsic property of an 
object. In the same way, we might imagine that there could exist other 
The Location of Meaning 
171 

kinds of "jukeboxes"-intelligences·-which communicate among each 
other via messages which we would never recognize as messages, and who 
also would never recognize our messages as messages. If that were the case, 
then the claim that meaning is an intrinsic property of a set of symbols 
would have to be reconsidered. On the other hand, how could we ever 
realize that such beings existed? 
It is interesting to compare this argument for the inherency of mean-
ing with a parallel argument for the inherency of weight. Suppose one 
defined an object's weight as "the magnitude of the downward force which 
the object exerts when on the surface of the planet Earth". Under this 
definition, the downward force which an object exerts when on the surface 
of Mars would have to be given another name than "weight". This defini-
tion makes weight an inherent property, but at the cost of geocentricity-
"Earth chauvinism". It would be like "Greenwich chauvinism"-refusing to 
accept local time anywhere on the globe but in the GMT time zone. It is an 
unnatural way to think of time. 
Perhaps we are unknowingly burdened with a similar chauvinism with 
respect to intelligence, and consequently with respect to meaning. In our 
chauvinism, we would call any being with a brain sufficiently much like our 
own "intelligent", and refuse to recognize other types of objects as intelli-
gent. To take an extreme example, consider a meteorite which, instead of 
deciphering the outer-space Bach record, punctures it with colossal indif-
ference, and continues in its merry orbit. It has interacted with the record 
in a way which we feel disregards the record's meaning. Therefore, we 
might well feel tempted to call the meteorite "stupid". But perhaps we 
would thereby do the meteorite a disservice. Perhaps it has a "higher 
intelligence" which we in our Earth chauvinism cannot perceive, and its 
interaction with the record was a manifestation of that higher intelligence. 
Perhaps, then, the record has a "higher meaning"-totally different from 
that which we attribute to it; perhaps its meaning depends on the type of 
intelligence perceiving it. Perhaps. 
It would be nice if we could define intelligence in some other way than 
"that which gets the same meaning out of a sequence of symbols as we do". 
For if we can only define it this one way, then our argument that meaning is 
an intrinsic property is circular, hence content-free. We should try to 
formulate in some independent way a set of characteristics which deserve 
the name "intelligence". Such characteristics would constitute the uniform 
core of intelligence, shared by humans. At this point in history we do not 
yet have a well-defined list of those characteristics. However, it appears 
likely that within the next few decades there will be much progress made in 
elucidating what human intelligence is. In particular, perhaps cognitive 
psychologists, workers in Artificial Intelligence, and neuroscientists will be 
able to synthesize their understandings, and come up with a definition of 
intelligence. It may still be human-chauvinistic; there is no way around 
that. But to counterbalance that, there may be some elegant and 
beautiful-and perhaps even simple-abstract ways of characterizing the 
essence of intelligence. This would serve to lessen the feeling of having 
172 
The Location of Meaning 

formulated an anthropocentric concept. And of course, if contact were 
established with an alien civilization from another star system, we would 
feel supported in our belief that our own type of intelligence is not just a 
fluke, but an example of a basic form which reappears in nature in diverse 
contexts, like stars and uranium nuclei. This in turn would support the idea 
of meaning being an inherent property. 
To conclude this topic, let us consider some new and old examples, 
and discuss the degree of inherent meaning which they have, by putting 
ourselves, to the extent that we can, in the shoes of an alien civilization 
which intercepts a weird object ... 
Two Plaques in Space 
Consider a rectangular plaque made of an indestructible metallic alloy, on 
which are engraved two dots, one immediately above the another: the 
preceding colon shows a picture. Though the overall form of the object 
might suggest that it is an artifact, and therefore that it might conceal some 
message, two dots are simply not sufficient to convey anything. (Can you, 
before reading on, hypothesize what they are supposed to mean?) But 
suppose that we made a second plaque, containing more dots, as follows: 
Now one of the most obvious things to do-so it might seem to a 
terrestrial intelligence at least-would be to count the dots in the successive 
rows. The sequence obtained is: 
1, 
1, 
2, 
3, 
5, 
8, 
13, 
21, 34. 
Here there is evidence of a rule governing the progression from one line to 
the next. In fact, the recursive part of the definition of the Fibonacci 
numbers can be inferred, with some confidence, from this list. Suppose we 
think of the initial pair of values (1,1) as a "genotype" from which the 
"phenotype"-the full Fibonacci sequence-is pulled out by a recursive 
rule. By sending the genotype alone-namely the first version of the 
plaque-we fail to send the information which allows reconstitution of the 
phenotype. Thus, the genotype does not contain the full specification of 
The Location of Meaning 
173 

the phenotype. On the other hand, if we consider the second version of the 
plaque to be the genotype, then there is much better cause to suppose that 
the phenotype could actually be reconstituted. This new version of the 
genotype-a "long genotype"-contains so much information that the 
mechanism by which phenotype is pulled out of genotype can be inferred by intelli-
gence from the genotype alone. 
Once this mechanism is firmly established as the way to pull phenotype 
from genotype, then we can go back to using "short genotypes"-like the 
first plaque. For instance, the "short genotype" (1,3) would yield the 
phenotype 
1, 
3, 4, 7, 
11, 
18, 
29, 47, ... 
-the Lucas sequence. And for every set of two initial values-that is, for 
every short genotype-there will be a corresponding phenotype. But the 
short genotypes, unlike the long ones, are only triggers-buttons to be 
pushed on the jukeboxes into which the recursive rule has been built. The 
long genotypes are informative enough that they trigger, in an intelligent 
being, the recognition of what kind of ')ukebox" to build. In that sense, the 
long genotypes contain the information of the phenotype, whereas the 
short genotypes do not. In other words, the long genotype transmits not 
only an inner message, but also an outer message, which enables the inner 
message to be read. It seems that the clarity of the outer message resides in 
the sheer length of the message. This is not unexpected; it parallels pre-
cisely what happens in deciphering ancient texts. Clearly, one's likelihood 
of success depends crucially on the amount of text available. 
Bach vs. Cage Again 
But just having a long text may not be enough. Let us take up once more 
the difference between sending a record of Bach's music into space, and a 
record of John Cage's music. Incidentally, the latter, being a Composition 
of Aleatorically Generated Elements, might be handily called a "CAGE", 
whereas the former, being a Beautiful Aperiodic Crystal of Harmony, 
might aptly be dubbed a "BACH". Now let's consider what the meaning of 
a Cage piece is to ourselves. A Cage piece has to be taken in a large cultural 
setting-as a revolt against certain kinds of traditions. Thus, if we want to 
transmit that meaning, we must not only send the notes of the piece, but we 
must have earlier communicated an extensive history of Western culture. It 
is fair to say, then, that an isolated record of John Cage's music does not 
have an intrinsic meaning. However, for a listener who is sufficiently well 
versed in Western and Eastern cultures, particularly in the trends in West-
ern music over the last few decades, it does carry meaning-but such a 
listener is like a jukebox, and the piece is like a pair of buttons. The 
meaning is mostly contained inside the listener to begin with; the music 
serves only to trigger it. And this '~ukebox", unlike pure intelligence, is not 
at all universal; it is highly earthbound, depending on idiosyncratic se-
174 
The Location of Meaning 

quences of events all over our globe for long periods of time. Hoping that 
John Cage's music will be understood by another civilization is like hoping 
that your favorite tune, on ajukebox on the moon, will have the same code 
buttons as in a saloon in Saskatoon. 
On the other hand, to appreciate Bach requires far less cultural knowl-
edge. This may seem like high irony, for Bach is so much more complex 
and organized, and Cage is so devoid of intellectuality. But there is a 
strange reversal here: intelligence loves patterns and balks at randomness. 
For most people, the randomness in Cage's music requires much explana-
tion; and even after explanations, they may feel they are missing the 
message-whereas with much of Bach, words are superfluous. In that 
sense, Bach's music is more self-contained than Cage's music. Still, it is not 
clear how much of the human condition is presumed by Bach. 
For instance, music has three major dimensions of structure (melody, 
harmony, rhythm), each of which can be further divided into small-scale, 
intermediate, and overall aspects. Now in each of these dimensions, there is 
a certain amount of complexity which our minds can handle before bog-
gling; clearly a composer takes this into account, mostly unconsciously, 
when writing a piece. These "levels of tolerable complexity" along different 
dimensions are probably very dependent on the peculiar conditions of our 
evolution as a species, and another intelligent species might have developed 
music with totally different levels of tolerable complexity along these many 
dimensions. Thus a Bach piece might conceivably have to be accompanied 
by a lot of information about the human species, which simply could not be 
inferred from the music's structure alone. If we equate the Bach music with 
a genotype, and the emotions which it is supposed to evoke with the 
phenotype, then what we are interested in is whether the genotype contains 
all the information necessary for the revelation of the phenotype. 
How Universal Is DNA's Message? 
The general question which we are facing, and which is very similar to the 
questions inspired by the two plaques, is this: "How much of the context 
necessary for its own understanding is a message capable of restoring?" We 
can now revert to the original biological meanings of "genotype" and 
"phenotype"-DNA and a living organism-and ask similar questions. 
Does DNA have universal triggering power? Or does it need a 
"biojukebox" to reveal its meaning? Can DNA evoke a phenotype without 
being embedded in the proper chemical context? To this question the 
answer is no-but a qualified no. Certainly a molecule of DNA in a vacuum 
will not create anything at all. However, if a molecule of DNA were sent out 
to seek its fortune in the universe, as we imagined the BACH and the 
CAGE were, it might be intercepted by an intelligent civilization. They 
might first of all recognize its frame message. Given that, they might go on 
to try to deduce from its chemical structure what kind of chemical envi-
ronment it seemed to want, and then supply such an environment. Succes-
The Location of Meaning 
175 

sively more refined attempts along these lines might eventually lead to a 
full restoration of the chemical context necessary for the revelation of 
DNA's phenotypical meaning. This may sound a little implausible, but if 
one allows many millions of years for the experiment, perhaps the DNA's 
meaning would finally emerge. 
On the other hand, if the sequence of bases which compose a strand of 
DNA were sent as abstract symbols (as in Fig. 41), not as a long helical 
molecule, the odds are virtually nil that this, as an outer message, would 
trigger the proper decoding mechanism which would enable the 
phenotype to be drawn out of the genotype. This would be a case of 
wrapping an inner message in such an abstract outer message that the 
context-restoring power of the outer message would be lost, and so in a 
very pragmatic sense, the set of symbols would have no intrinsic meaning. 
Lest you think this all sounds hopelessly abstract and philosophical, consid-
er that the exact moment when phenotype can be said to be "available", or 
"implied", by genotype, is a highly charged issue in our day: it is the issue of 
abortion.

information as a molecular blueprint for one measly E. Coli cell.

Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud 
Having had a splendid dip in the pond, the Tortoise is just crawling out 
and shaking himself dry, when who but Achilles walks by. 
Tortoise: 
Ho there, Achilles. I was just thinking of you as I splashed 
around in the pond. 
Achilles: 
Isn't that curious? I was just thinking of you, too, while I mean-
dered through the meadows. They're so green at this time of year ... 
Tortoise: 
You think so? It reminds me of a thought I was hoping to share 
with you. Would you like to hear it? 
Achilles: 
Oh, I would be delighted. That is, I would be delighted as long as 
you're not going to try to snare me in one of your wicked traps of logic, 
Mr. T. 
Tortoise: 
Wicked traps? Oh, you do me wrong. Would I do anything 
wicked? I'm a peaceful soul, bothering nobody and leading a gentle, 
herbivorous life. And my thoughts merely drift among the oddities 
and quirks of how things are (as I see them). I, humble observer of 
phenomena, plod along and puff my silly words into the air rather 
unspectacularly, I am afraid. But to reassure you about my intentions, 
I was only planning to speak of my Tortoise-shell today, and as you 
know, those things have nothing-nothing whatsoever-to do with 
logic! 
Achilles: 
Your words DO reassure me, Mr. T. And, in fact, my curiosity is 
quite piqued. I would certainly like to listen to what you have to say, 
even if it is unspectacular. 
Tortoise: 
Let's see ... how shall I begin? Hmm ... What strikes you most 
about my shell, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
It looks wonderfully clean! 
Tortoise: 
Thank you. I just went swimming and washed off several layers 
of dirt which had accumulated last century. Now you can see how 
green my shell is. 
Achilles: 
Such a good healthy green shell, it's nice to see it shining in the 
sun. 
Tortoise: 
Green? It's not green. 
Achilles: 
Well, didn't you just tell me your shell was green? 
Tortoise: 
I did. 
Achilles: 
Then, we agree: it is green. 
Tortoise: 
No, it isn't green. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I understand your game. You're hinting to me that what you 
say isn't necessarily true; that Tortoises play with language; that your 
statements and reality don't necessarily match; that-
Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud 
177 

Tortoise: 
I certainly am not. Tortoises treat words as sacred; Tortoises 
revere accuracy. 
Achilles: 
Well, then, why did you say that your shell is green, and that it is 
not green also? 
Tortoise: 
I never said such a thing; but I wish I had. 
Achilles: 
You would have liked to say that? 
Tortoise: 
Not a bit. I regret saying it, and disagree wholeheartedly with it. 
Achilles: 
That certainly contradicts what you said before! 
Tortoise: 
Contradicts? Contradicts? I never contradict myself. It's not part 
of Tortoise-nature. 
Achilles: 
Well, I've caught you this time, you slippery fellow, you. Caught 
you in a full-fledged contradiction. 
Tortoise: 
Yes, I guess you did. 
Achilles: 
There you go again! Now you're contradicting yourself more and 
more! You are so steeped in contradiction it's impossible to argue with 
you! 
Tortoise: 
Not really. I argue with mys.elf without any trouble at all. Perhaps 
the problem is with you. I would venture a guess that maybe you're the 
one who's contradictory, but you're so trapped in your own tangled 
web that you can't see how inconsistent you're being. 
Achilles: 
What an insulting suggestion! I'm going to show you that you're 
the contradictory one, and there are no two ways about it. 
Tortoise: 
Well, if it's so, your task ought to be cut out for you. What could 
be easier than to point out a contradiction? Go ahead-try it out. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... Now I hardly know where to begin. Oh ... I know. 
You first said that (1) your shell is green, and then you went on to say 
that (2) your shell is not green. What more can I say? 
Tortoise: 
Just kindly point out the contradiction. Quit beating around the 
bush. 
Achilles: 
But-but-but ... Oh, now I begin to see. (Sometimes I am so 
slow-witted!) It must be that you and I differ as to what constitutes a 
contradiction. That's the trouble. Well, let me make myself very clear: 
a contradiction occurs when somebody says one thing and denies it at 
the same time. 
Tortoise: 
A neat trick. I'd like to see it done. Probably ventriloquists would 
excel at contradictions, speaking out of both sides of their mouth, as it 
were. But I'm not a ventriloquist. 
Achilles: 
Well, what I actually meant is just that somebody can say one 
thing and deny it all within one single sentence! It doesn't literally have 
to be in the same instant. 
Tortoise: 
Well, you didn't give ONE sentence. You gave TWO. 
Achilles: 
Yes-two sentences that contradict each other! 
Tortoise: 
I am sad to see the tangled structure of your thoughts becoming 
so exposed, Achilles. First you lold me that a contradiction is some-
thing which occurs in a single sentence. Then you told me that you 
178 
Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud 

found a contradiction in a pair of sentences I uttered. Frankly, it's just 
as I said. Your own system of thought is so delusional that you manage 
to avoid seeing how inconsistent it is. From the outside, however, it's 
plain as day. 
Achilles: 
Sometimes I get so confused by your diversionary tactics that I 
can't quite tell if we're arguing about something utterly petty, or 
something deep and profound! 
Tortoise: 
I assure you, Tortoises don't spend their time on the petty. 
Hence it's the latter. 
Achilles: 
I am very reassured. Thank you. Now I have had a moment to 
reflect, and I see the necessary logical step to convince you that you 
contradicted yourself. 
Tortoise: 
Good, good. I hope it's an easy step, an indisputable one. 
Achilles: It certainly is. Even you will agree with it. The idea is that since 
you believed sentence 1 ("My shell is green"), AND you believed sen-
tence 2 ("My shell is not green"), you would believe one compound 
sentence in which both were combined, wouldn't you? 
Tortoise: 
Of course. It would only be reasonable ... providing just that the 
manner of combination is universally acceptable. But I'm sure that 
we'll agree on that. 
Achilles: 
Yes, and then I'll have you! The combination I propose is-
Tortoise: 
But we must be careful in combining sentences. For instance, 
you'd grant that "Politicians lie" is true, wouldn't you? 
Achilles: 
Who could deny it? 
Tortoise: 
Good. Likewise, "Cast-iron sinks" is a valid utterance, isn't it? 
Achilles: 
Indubitably. 
Tortoise: 
Then, putting them together, we get "Politicians lie in cast-iron 
sinks". Now that's not the case, is it? 
Achilles: 
Now wait a minute ... "Politicians lie in cast-iron sinks?" Well, 
no, but-
Tortoise: 
So, you see, combining two true sentences in one is not a safe 
policy, is it? 
Achilles: 
But you-you combined the two-in such a silly way! 
Tortoise: 
Silly? What have you got to object to in the way I combined them? 
Would you have me do otherwise? 
Achilles: 
You should have used the word "and", not "in". 
Tortoise: 
I should have? You mean, if YOU'D had YOUR way, I should have. 
Achilles: 
No-it's the LOGICAL thing to do. It's got nothing to do with me 
personally. 
Tortoise: 
This is where you always lose me, when you resort to your Logic 
and its high-sounding Principles. None of that for me today, please. 
Achilles: 
Oh, Mr. Tortoise, don't put me through all this agony. You know 
very well that that's what "and" means! It's harmless to combine two 
true sentences with "and"! 
Tortoise: 
"Harmless", my eye! What gall! This is certainly a pernicious plot 
Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud 
179 

to entrap a poor, innocent, bumbling Tortoise in a fatal contradiction. 
If it were so harmless, why would you be trying so bloody hard to get 
me to do it? Eh? 
Achilles: 
You've left me speechless. You make me feel like a villain, where 
I really had only the most innocent of motivations. 
Tortoise: 
That's what everyone believes of himself ... 
Achilles: 
Shame on me-trying to outwit you, to use words to snare you in 
a self-contradiction. I feel so rotten. 
Tortoise: 
And well you should. I know what you were trying to set up. 
Your plan was to make me accept sentence 3, to wit: "My shell is green 
and my shell is not green". And such a blatant falsehood is repellent to 
the Tongue of a Tortoise. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I'm so sorry I started all this. 
Tortoise: 
You needn't be sorry. My feelings aren't hurt. After all, I'm used 
to the unreasonable ways of the folk about me. I enjoy your company, 
Achilles, even if your thinking lacks clarity. 
Achilles: Yes... Well, I fear I am set in my ways, and will probably 
continue to err and err again, in my quest for Truth. 
Tortoise: 
Today's exchange may have served a little to right your course. 
Good day, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
Good day, Mr. T.

Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud 

CHAPTER VII 
The Propositional Calculus 
Words and Symbols 
THE PRECEDING DIALOGUE is reminiscent of the Two-Part Invention by 
Lewis Carroll. In both, the Tortoise refuses to use normal, ordinary words 
in the normal, ordinary way-or at least he refuses to do so when it is not to 
his advantage to do so. A way to think about the Carroll paradox was given 
last Chapter. In this Chapter we are going to make symbols do what 
Achilles couldn't make the Tortoise do with his words. That is, we are going 
to make a formal system one of whose symbols will do just what Achilles 
wished the word 'and' would do, when spoken by the Tortoise, and another 
of whose symbols will behave the way the word's 'if ... then . . .' ought to 
behave. There are only two other words which we will attempt to deal with: 
'or' and 'not'. Reasoning which depends only on correct usage of these four 
words is termed propositional reasoning. 
Alphabet and First Rule of the Propositional Calculus 
I will present this new formal system, called the Propositional Calculus, a little 
like a puzzle, not explaining everything at once, but letting you figure 
things out to some extent. We begin with the list of symbols: 
p 
< 
> 
Q 
v 
R 
:::> 
The first rule of this system that I will reveal is the following: 
RULE OF JOINING: If x and yare theorems of the system, then so is the 
string < x/\ y >. 
This rule takes two theorems and combines them into one. It should 
remind you of the Dialogue. 
Well-Formed Strings 
There will be several other rules of inference, and they will all be presented 
shortly-but fi.rst, it is important to define a subset of all strings, namely the 
The Propositional Calculus 
181 

welljormed strings. They will be defined in a recursive way. We begin with 
the 
ATOMS: 
P, Q, and R are called atoms. New atoms are formed by appending 
primes onto the right of old atoms-thus, R', Q", P"', etc. This gives 
an endless supply of atoms. All atoms are well-formed. 
Then we have four recursive 
FORMATION RULES: If x and yare well-formed, then the following four 
strings are also well-formed: 
(1) 
-x 
(2) 
< xAy> 
(3) < xvy> 
(4) 
<x:::>y> 
For example, all of the following are well-formed: 
P 
-P 
--P 
Q' 
-Q' 
<PA-Q'> 
-<PA-Q'> 
<--P:::>Q'> 
<-<PA-Q'>V< --P:::>Q'» 
atom 
by (1) 
by (1) 
atom 
by (1) 
by (2) 
by (1) 
by (4) 
by (3) 
The last one may look quite formidable, but it is built up straightforwardly 
from two components-namely the two lines just above it. Each of them is 
in turn built up from previous lines ... and so on. Every well-formed string 
can in this way be traced back to its elementary constituents-that is, atoms. 
You simply run the formation rules backwards until you can no more. This 
process is guaranteed to terminat(~, since each formation rule (when run 
forwards) is a lengthening rule, so that running it backwards always drives 
you towards atoms. 
This method of decomposing strings thus serves as a check on the 
well-formedness of any string. It is a top-down decision procedure for well-
formedness. You can test your understanding of this decision procedure by 
checking which of the following strings are well-formed: 
(1) 
<P> 
(2) <-P> 
(3) 
<PAQAR> 
(4) 
<PAQ> 
(5) «PAQ>A<Q-AP» 
(6) 
<PA-P> 
(7) 
«Pv<Q:::>R»A<-Pv--R'» 
(8) 
<PAQ>A<QAP> 
182 
The Propositional Calculus 

(Answer: Those whose numbers are Fibonacci numbers are not well-
formed. The rest are well-formed.) 
More Rules of Inference 
Now we come to the rest of the rules by which theorems of this system are 
constructed. A few rules of inference follow. In all of them, the symbols 'x' 
and 'y' are always to be understood as restricted to welllormed strings. 
RULE OF SEPARATION: If < xA y> is a theorem, then both x and yare 
theorems. 
Incidentally, you should have a pretty good guess by now as to what 
concept the symbol 'A' stands for. (Hint: it is the troublesome word from 
the preceding Dialogue.) From the following rule, you should be able to 
figure out what concept the tilde ('-') represents: 
DOUBLE-TILDE RULE: 
The string '--' can be deleted from any theorem. It 
can also be inserted into any theorem, provided that the resulting 
string is itself well-formed. 
The Fantasy Rule 
Now a special feature of this system is that it has no axioms--only rules. If 
you think back to the previous formal systems we've seen, you may wonder 
how there can be any theorems, then. How does everything get started? 
The answer is that there is one rule which manufactures theorems from out 
of thin air-it doesn't need an "old theorem" as input. (The rest of the rules 
do require input.) This special rule is called the fantasy rule. The reason I 
call it that is quite simple. 
To use the fantasy rule, the first thing you do is to write down any 
well-formed string x you like, and then "fantasize" by asking, "What if this 
string x were an axiom, or a theorem?" And then, you let the system itself 
give an answer. That is, you go ahead and make a derivation with x as the 
opening line; let us suppose y is the last line. (Of course the derivation must 
strictly follow the rules of the system.) Everything from x to y (inclusive) is 
the fantasy; x is the premise of the fantasy, and y is its outcome. The next step 
is to jump out of the fantasy, having learned from it that 
If x were a theorem, y would be a theorem. 
Still, you might wonder, where is the real theorem? The real theorem is the 
string 
<x:::>y>. 
Notice the resemblance of this string to the sentence printed above. 
To signal the entry into, and emergence from, a fantasy, one uses the 
The Propositional Calculus 
183 

square brackets '[' and ,]" respectively. Thus, whenever you see a left 
square bracket, you know you are "pushing" into a fantasy, and the next line 
will contain the fantasy's premise. Whenever you see a right square bracket, 
you know you are "popping" back out, and the preceding line was the 
outcome. It is helpful (though not necessary) to indent those lines of a 
derivation which take place in fantasies. 
Here is an illustration of the fantasy rule, in which the string P is taken 
as a premise. (It so happens that P is not a theorem, but that is of no import; 
we are merely inquiring, "What if it were?") We make the following fan-
tasy: 
P 
--P 
push into fantasy 
premise 
outcome (by double-tilde rule) 
pop out of fantasy 
The fantasy shows that: 
If P were a theorem, so would --P be one. 
We now "squeeze" this sentence of English (the metalanguage) into the 
formal notation (the object language): <P::J--P>. This, our first theorem 
of the Propositional Calculus, should reveal to you the intended interpreta-
tion of the symbol '::J'. 
Here is another derivation using the fantasy rule: 
[ 
] 
<PAQ> 
P 
Q 
<QAP> 
< <PAQ> ::J<QAP> > 
push 
premise 
separation 
separation 
joining 
pop 
fantasy rule 
It is important to understand that only the last line is a genuine theorem, 
here-everything else is in the fantasy. 
Recursion and the Fantasy Rule 
As you might guess from the recursion terminology "push" and "pop", the 
fantasy rule can be used recursively-thus, there can be fantasies within 
fantasies, thrice-nested fantasies, and so on. This means that there are all 
sorts of "levels of reality", just as in nested stories or movies. When you pop 
out of a movie-within-a-movie, you feel for a moment as if you had reached 
the real world, though you are still one level away from the top. Similarly, 
when you pop out of a fantasy-within-a-fantasy, you are in a "realer" world 
than you had been, but you are still one level away from the top. 
Now a "No Smoking" sign inside a movie theater does not apply to the 
184 
The PropOSitional Calculus 

characters in the movie-there is no carry-over from the real world into the 
fantasy world, in movies. But in the Propositional Calculus, there is a 
carry-over from the real world into the fantasies; there is even carry-over 
from a fantasy to fantasies inside it. This is formalized by the following 
rule: 
CARRY-OVER RULE: 
Inside a fantasy, any theorem from the "reality" one 
level higher can be brought in and used. 
It is as if a "No Smoking" sign in a theater applied not only to all the 
moviegoers, but also to all the actors in the movie, and, by repetition of the 
same idea, to anyone inside multiply nested movies! (Warning: There is no 
carry-over in the reverse direction: theorems inside fantasies cannot be 
exported to the exterior! If it weren't for this fact, you could write anything 
as the first line of a fantasy, and then lift it out into the real world as a 
theorem.) 
To show how carry-over works, and to show how the fantasy rule can 
be used recursively, we present the following derivation: 
[ 
] 
P 
[ 
] 
Q 
P 
<PAQ> 
<Q:::><PAQ>> 
<P:::><Q:::><PAQ»> 
push 
premise of outer fantasy 
push again 
premise of inner fantasy 
carry-over of P into inner fantasy 
joining 
pop out of inner fantasy, regain outer fantasy 
fantasy rule 
pop out of outer fantasy, reach real world! 
fantasy rule 
Note that I've indented the outer fantasy once, and the inner fantasy 
twice, to emphasize the nature of these nested "levels of reality". One way 
to look at the fantasy rule is to say that an observation made about the 
system is inserted into the system. Namely, the theorem < x:::> y> which gets 
produced can be thought of as a representation inside the system of the 
statement about the system "If x is a theorem, then y is too". To be more 
specific, the intended interpretation for <P:::>Q> is "if P, then Q", or 
equivalently, "P implies Q". 
The Converse of the Fantasy Rule 
Now Lewis Carroll's Dialogue was all about "if-then" statements. In particu-
lar, Achilles had a lot of trouble in persuading the Tortoise to accept the 
second clause of an "if-then" statement, even when the "if-then" statement 
itself was accepted, as well as its first clause. The next rule allows you to 
infer the second "clause" of a ':::>'-string, provided that the ':::>' -string itself is 
a theorem, and that its first "clause" is also a theorem. 
The Propositional Calculus 
185 

RULE OF DETACHMENT: 
If X and < x:::> y> are both theorems, then y is a 
theorem. 
Incidentally, this rule is often called "Modus Ponens", and the fantasy rule 
is often called the "Deduction Theorem". 
The Intended Interpretation of the Symbols 
We might as well let the cat out of the bag at this point, and reveal the 
"meanings" of the rest of the symbols of our new system. In case it is not yet 
apparent, the symbol '1\' is meant to be acting isomorphically to the normal, 
everyday word 'and'. The symbol '-' represents the word 'not'-it is a 
formal sort of negation. The angle brackets '<' and '>' are groupers-their 
function being very similar to that of parentheses in ordinary algebra. The 
main difference is that in algebra, you have the freedom to insert parenthe-
ses or to leave them out, according to taste and style, whereas in a formal 
system, such anarchic freedom is not tolerated. The symbol 'v' represents 
the word 'or' ('vel' is a Latin word for 'or'). The 'or' that is meant is the 
so-called inclusive 'or', which means that the interpretation of < xv y> is 
"either x or y- or both". 
The only symbols we have not interpreted are the atoms. An atom has 
no single interpretation-it may be interpreted by any sentence of English 
(it must continue to be interpreted by the same sentence if it occurs 
multiply within a string or derivation). Thus, for example, the well-formed 
string <PI\-P> could be interpreted by the compound sentence 
This mind is Buddha, and this mind is not Buddha. 
Now let us look at each of the theorems so far derived, and interpret 
them. The first one was <P:::> - -P>. If we keep the same interpretation for 
P, we have the following interpretation: 
If this mind is Buddha, 
then it is not the case that this mind is not Buddha. 
Note how I rendered the double negation. It is awkward to repeat a 
negation in any natural language. so one gets around it by using two 
different ways of expressing negation. The second theorem we derived was 
«P/\Q>:::><Q/\P». If we let Q be interpreted by the sentence "This 
flax weighs three pounds", then our theorem reads as follows: 
If this mind is Buddha and this flax weighs three pounds, 
then this flax weighs three pounds and this mind is Buddha. 
The third theorem was <P:::><Q:::><PI\Q»>. This one goes into the 
following nested "if-then" sentence: 
186 
The Propositional Calculus 

If this mind is Buddha, 
then, if this flax weighs three pounds, 
then this mind is Buddha and this flax weighs three pounds. 
You probably have noticed that each theorem, when interpreted, says 
something absolutely trivial and self-evident. (Sometimes they are so self-
evident that they sound vacuous and-paradoxically enough-confusing 
or even wrong!) This may not be very impressive, but just remember that 
there are plenty of falsities out there which could have been produced-yet 
they weren't. This system-the Propositional Calculus-steps neatly from 
truth to truth, carefully avoiding all falsities, just as a person who is 
concerned with staying dry will step carefully from one stepping-stone in a 
creek to the next, following the layout of stepping-stones no matter how 
twisted and tricky it might be. What is impressive is that-in the Proposi-
tional Calculus-the whole thing is done purely typographically. There is 
nobody down "in there", thinking about the meaning of the strings. It is all 
done mechanically, thoughtlessly, rigidly, even stupidly. 
Rounding Out the List of Rules 
We have not yet stated all the rules of the Propositional Calculus. The 
complete set of rules is listed below, including the three new ones. 
JOINING RULE: If x and yare theorems, then < xA y> is a theorem. 
SEPARATION RULE: If < xA y> is a theorem, then both x and yare theo-
rems. 
DOUBLE-TILDE RULE: 
The string '--' can be deleted from any theorem. It 
can also be inserted into any theorem, provided that the resulting 
string is itself well-formed. 
FANTASY RULE: 
If y can be derived when x is assumed to be a theorem, 
then < x:::> y> is a theorem. 
CARRY-OVER RULE: 
Inside a fantasy, any theorem from the "reality" one 
level higher can be brought in and used. 
RULE OF DETACHMENT: If x and < x:::> y> are both theorems, then y is a 
theorem. 
CONTRAPOSITIVE RULE: 
< x:::> y> and <- y:::>- x> are interchangeable. 
DE MORGAN'S RULE: <- xA- y> and -< xv y> are interchangeable. 
SWITCHEROO RULE: < xv y> and <- x::J y> are interchangeable. 
(The Switcheroo rule is named after Q. q. Switcheroo, an Albanian railroad 
engineer who worked in logic on the siding.) By "interchangeable" in the 
foregoing rules, the following is meant: If an expression of one form 
occurs as either a theorem or part of a theorem, the other form may be

187 

substituted, and the resulting string will also be a theorem. It must be kept 
in mind that the symbols 'x' and 'y' always stand for well-formed strings of 
the system. 
Justifying the Rules 
Before we see these rules used inside derivations, let us look at some very 
short justifications for them. You can probably justify them to yourself 
better than my examples-which i~ why I only give a couple. 
Th~ contrapositive rule expresses explicitly a way of turning around 
conditional statements which we carry out unconsciously. For instance, the 
"Zentence" 
If you are studying it, then you are far from the Way 
means the same thing as 
If you are close to the Way, then you are not studying it. 
De Morgan's rule can be illustrated by our familiar sentence "The flag 
is not moving and the wind is not: moving". If P symbolizes "the flag is 
moving", and Q symbolizes "the wind is moving", then the compound 
sentence is symbolized by <-PA-Q>, which, according to De Morgan's 
law, is interchangeable with -<PvQ>, whose interpretation would be "It is 
not true that either the flag or the wind is moving". And no one could deny 
that that is a Zensible conclusion to draw. 
For the Switcheroo rule, consider the sentence "Either a cloud is 
hanging over the mountain, or the moonlight is penetrating the waves of 
the lake," which might be spoken, I suppose, by a wistful Zen master 
remembering a familiar lake which he can visualize mentally but cannot 
see. Now hang onto your seat, for the Switcheroo rule tells us that this is 
interchangeable with the thought: "If a cloud is not hanging over the 
mountain, then the moonlight is penetrating the waves of the lake." This 
may not be enlightenment, but it is the best the Propositional Calculus has 
to offer. 
Playing Around with the System 
Now let us apply these rules to a previous theorem, and see what we get. 
For instance, take the theorem <P:::>--P>: 
<P:::>--P> 
<---P:::>-P> 
<-P:::>-P> 
<Pv-P> 
old theorem 
contrapositive 
double-tilde 
switcheroo 
This new theorem, when interpreted, says: 
188 
The Propositional Calculus 

Either this mind is Buddha, or this mind is not Buddha. 
Once again, the interpreted theorem, though perhaps less than mind-
boggling, is at least true. 
Semi-Interpretations 
It is natural, when one reads theorems of the Propositional Calculus out 
loud, to interpret everything but the atoms. I call this semi-interpreting. For 
instance, the semi-interpretation of <Pv-P> would be 
P or not P. 
Despite the fact that P is not a sentence, the above semisentence still sounds 
true, because you can very easily imagine sticking any sentence in for 
P-and the form of the semi-interpreted theorem assures you that however 
you make your choice, the resulting sentence will be true. And that is the 
key idea of the Propositional Calculus: it produces theorems which, when 
semi-interpreted, are seen to be "universally true semisentences", by which 
is meant that no matter how you complete the interpretation, the final 
result will be a true statement. 
Ganto's Ax 
Now we can do a more advanced exercise, based on a Zen koan called 
"Ganto's Ax". Here is how it begins: 
One day Tokusan told his student Ganto, "I have two monks who have been 
here for many years. Go and examine them." Ganto picked up an ax and 
went to the hut where the two monks were meditating. He raised the ax, 
saying, "If you say a word I will cut off your heads; and if you do not say a 
word, I will also cut off your heads."! 
If you say a word I will cut off this koan; and if you do not say a word, I will 
also cut off this koan-because I want to translate some of it into our 
notation. Let us symbolize "you say a word" by P, and "I will cut off your 
heads" by Q. Then Ganto's ax threat is symbolized by the string 
«P=>Q>I\<-P=>Q». What if this ax threat were an axiom? Here is a 
fantasy to answer that ques tion.

The power of the Propositional Calculus is shown in this example. Why, in 
but two dozen steps, we have deduced Q: that the heads will be cut off! 
(Ominously, the rule last invoked was "detachment" ... ) It might seem 
superfluous to continue the koan now, since we know what must ensue ... 
However, I shall drop my resolve to cut the koan off; it is a true Zen koan, 
after all. The rest of the incident IS here related: 
Both monks continued their meditation as if he had not spoken. Ganto 
dropped the ax and said, "You are true Zen students." He returned to 
Tokusan and related the incident. "} see your side well," Tokusan agreed, 
"but tell me, how is their side?" "Tozan may admit them," replied Ganto, "but 
they should not be admitted under Tokusan."2 
Do you see my side well? How is the Zen side? 
Is There a Decision Procedure for Theorems? 
The Propositional Calculus gives us a set of rules for producing statements 
which would be true in all conceivable worlds. That is why all of its 
theorems sound so simple-minded; it seems that they have absolutely no 
content! Looked at this way, the Propositional Calculus might seem to be a 
waste of time, since what it tells us is absolutely trivial. On the other hand, it 
does it by specifying the form of statements that are universally true, and 
this throws a new kind of light onto the core truths of the universe: they are 
not only fundamental, but also regular: they can be produced by one set of 
typographical rules. To put it another way, they are all "cut from the same 
cloth". You might consider whether the same could be said about Zen 
koans: could they all be produced by one set of typographical rules? 
It is quite relevant here to bring up the question of a decision proce-
dure. That is, does there exist any mechanical method to tell nontheorems 
from theorems? If so, that would tell us that the set of theorems of the 
190 
The Propositional Calculus 

Propositional Calculus is not only r.e., but also recursive. It turns out that 
there is an interesting decision procedure-the method of truth tables. It 
would take us a bit afield to present it here; you can find it in almost any 
standard book on logic. And what about Zen koans? Could there conceiv-
ably be a mechanical decision procedure which distinguishes genuine Zen 
koans from other things? 
Do We Know the System Is Consistent? 
Up till now, we have only presumed that all theorems, when interpreted as 
indicated, are true statements. But do we know that that is the case? Could 
we prove it to be? This is just another way of asking whether the intended 
interpretations ('and' for '/\', etc.) merit being called the "passive meanings" 
of the symbols. One can look at this issue from two very different points of 
view, which might be called the "prudent" and "imprudent" points of view. 
I will now present those two sides as I see them, personifying their holders 
as "Prudence" and "Imprudence". 
Prudence: 
We will only KNOW that all theorems come out true under the 
intended interpretation if we manage to PROVE it. That is the cautious, 
thoughtful way to proceed. 
Imprudence: 
On the contrary. It is OBVIOUS that all theorems will come out 
true. If you doubt me, look again at the rules of the system. You will 
find that each rule makes a symbol act exactly as the word it represents 
ought to be used. For instance, the joining rule makes the symbol '/\' act 
as 'and' ought to act; the rule of detachment makes ':::>' act as it ought 
to, if it is to stand for 'implies', or 'if-then'; and so on. Unless you are 
like the Tortoise, you will recognize in each rule a codification of a 
pattern you use in your own thought. So if you trust your own thought 
patterns, then you HAVE to believe that all theorems come out true! 
That's the way I see it. I don't need any further proof. If you think that 
some theorem comes out false, then presumably you think that some 
rule must be wrong. Show me which one. 
Prudence: 
I'm not sure that there is any faulty rule, so I can't point one out 
to you. Still, I can imagine the following kind of scenario. You, follow-
ing the rules, come up with a theorem-say x. Meanwhile I, also 
following the rules, come up with another theorem-it happens to be 
- x. Can't you force yourself to conceive of that? 
Imprudence: 
All right; let's suppose it happened. Why would it bother 
you? Or let me put it another way. Suppose that in playing with the 
MIU-system, I came up with a theorem x, and you came up with xu. 
Can you force yourself to conceive of that? 
Prudence: 
Of course-in fact both Ml and MIU are theorems. 
Imprudence: 
Doesn't that bother you? 
Prudence: 
Of course not. Your example is ridiculous, because MI and MIU 
are not CONTRADICTORY, whereas two strings x and - x in the Propo-
sitional Calculus ARE contradictory. 
The Propositional Calculus 
191 

Imprudence: 
Well, yes-provided you wish to interpret '-' as 'not'. But 
what would lead you to think that '-' should be interpreted as 'not'? 
Prudence: 
The rules themselves. When you look at them, you realize that 
the only conceivable interpretation for '-' is 'not'-and likewise, the 
only conceivable interpretation for '1\' is 'and', etc. 
Imprudence: 
In other words, you are convinced that the rules capture the 
meanings of those words? 
Prudence: 
Precisely. 
Imprudence: 
And yet you are still willing to entertain the thought that both 
x and - x could be theorems? Why not also entertain the notion that 
hedgehogs are frogs, or that 1 equals 2, or that the moon is made of 
green cheese? I for one am not prepared even to consider whether 
such basic ingredients of my thought processes are wrong-because if 
I entertained that notion, then 1 would also have to consider whether 
my modes of analyzing the entire question are also wrong, and I would 
wind up in a total tangle. 
Prudence: 
Your arguments are forceful ... Yet I would still like to see a 
PROOF that all theorems come out true, or that x and - x can never 
both be theorems. 
Imprudence: 
You want a proof. I guess that means that you want to be 
more convinced that the Propositional Calculus is consistent than you 
are convinced of your own sanity. Any proof I could think of would 
involve mental operations of a greater complexity than anything in the 
Propositional Calculus itself. So what would it prove? Your desire for a 
proof of consistency of the Propositional Calculus makes me think of 
someone who is learning English and insists on being given a dictio-
nary which defines all the simple words in terms of complicated 
ones ... 
The Carroll Dialogue Again 
This little debate shows the difficulty of trying to use logic and reasoning to 
defend themselves. At some point, you reach rock bottom, and there is no 
defense except loudly shouting, "I know I'm right!" Once again, we are up 
against the issue which Lewis Carroll so sharply set forth in his Dialogue: 
you can't go on defending your patterns of reasoning forever. There comes 
a point where faith takes over. 
A system of reasoning can be compared to an egg. An egg has a shell 
which protects its insides. If you want to ship an egg somewhere, though, 
you don't rely on the shell. You pack the egg in some sort of container, 
chosen according to how rough you expect the egg's voyage to be. To be 
extra careful, you may put the egg inside several nested boxes. However, 
no matter how many layers of boxes you pack your egg in, you can imagine 
some cataclysm which could break the egg. But that doesn't mean that 
you'll never risk transporting your egg. Similarly, one can never give an 
ultimate, absolute proof that a proof in some system is correct. Of course, 
192 
The Propositional Calculus 

one can give a proof of a proof, or a proof of a proof of a proof-but the 
validity of the outermost system always remains an unproven assumption, 
accepted on faith. One can always imagine that some unsuspected subtlety 
will invalidate every single level of proof down to the bottom, and that the 
"proven" result will be seen not to be correct after all. But that doesn't 
mean that mathematicians and logicians are constantly worrying that the 
whole edifice of mathematics might be wrong. On the other hand, when 
unorthodox proofs are proposed, or extremely lengthy proofs, or proofs 
generated by computers, then people do stop to think a bit about what they 
really mean by that quasi-sacred word "proven". 
An excellent exercise for you at this point would be to go back to the 
Carroll Dialogue, and code the various stages of the debate into our 
notation-beginning with the original bone of contention: 
Achilles: If you have «AAB>::JZ>, and you also have <AAB>, 
then surely you have Z. 
Tortoise: 
Oh! You mean: ««AAB>::JZ>A<AAB»::JZ>, 
don't you? 
(Hint: Whatever Achilles considers a rule of inference, the Tortoise im-
mediately flattens into a mere string of the system. If you use only the 
letters A, B, and Z, you will get a recursive pattern of longer and longer 
strings.) 
Shortcuts and Derived Rules 
When carrying out derivations in the Propositional Calculus, one quickly 
invents various types of shortcut, which are not strictly part of the system. 
For instance, if the string <Qv-Q> were needed at some point, and 
<Pv-P> had been derived earlier, many people would proceed as if 
<Qv-Q> had been derived, since they know that its derivation is an exact 
parallel to that of <Pv-P>. The derived theorem is treated as a "theorem 
schema"-a mold for other theorems. This turns out to be a perfectly valid 
procedure, in that it always leads you to new theorems, but it is not a rule of 
the Propositional Calculus as we presented it. It is, rather, a derived rule. It is 
part ofthe knowledge which we have about the system. That this rule always 
keeps you within the space of theorems needs proof, of course-but such a 
proof is not like a derivation inside the system. I t is a proof in the ordinary, 
intuitive sense-a chain of reasoning carried out in the I-mode. The theory 
about the Propositional Calculus is a "metatheory", and results in it can be 
called "metatheorems"-Theorems about theorems. (Incidentally, note the 
peculiar capitalization in the phrase "Theorems about theorems". It is a 
consequence of our convention: metatheorems are Theorems (proven re-
sults) concerning theorems (derivable strings).) 
In the Propositional Calculus, one could discover many other 
metatheorems, or derived rules of inference. For instance, there is a second 
De Morgan's Rule: 
The Propositional Calculus 
193 

<- xv- y> and -< X/\y> are interchangeable. 
If this were a rule of the system, it could speed up many derivations 
considerably. But if we prove that it is correct, isn't that good enough? Can't 
we use it just like a rule of inference, from then on? 
There is no reason to doubt the correctness of this particular derived 
rule. But once you start admitting derived rules as part of your procedure 
in the Propositional Calculus, you have lost the formality of the system, 
since derived rules are derived informally---outside the system. Now for-
mal systems were proposed as a way to exhibit every step of a proof 
explicitly, within one single, rigid framework, so that any mathematician 
could check another's work mechanically. But if you are willing to step 
outside of that framework at the drop of a hat, you might as well never 
have created it at all. Therefore, there is a drawback to using such 
shortcuts. 
Formalizing Higher Levels 
On the other hand, there is an alternative way out. Why not formalize the 
metatheory, too? That way, derived rules (metatheorems) would be theo-
rems of a larger formal system, and it would be legitimate to look for 
shortcuts and derive them as theorems-that is, theorems of the formalized 
metatheory-which could then be used to speed up the derivations of 
theorems of the Propositional Calculus. This is an interesting idea, but as 
soon as it is suggested, one jumps ahead to think of metametatheories, and 
so on. It is clear that no matter how many levels you formalize, someone 
will eventually want to make shortcuts in the top level. 
It might even be suggested that a theory of reasoning could be identi-
cal to its own metatheory, if it were worked out carefully. Then, it might 
seem, all levels would collapse into one, and thinking about the system 
would be just one way of working in the system! But it is not that easy. Even 
if a system can "think about itself", it still is not outside itself. You, outside 
the system, perceive it differently from the way it perceives itself. So there 
still is a metatheory-a view from outside-even for a theory which can 
"think about itself" inside itself. We will find that there are theories which 
can "think about themselves". In fact, we will soon see a system in which this 
happens completely accidentally, without our even intending it! And we 
will see what kinds of effects this produces. But for our study of the 
Propositional Calculus, we will stick with the simplest ideas-no mixing of 
levels. 
Fallacies can result if you fail to distinguish carefully between working 
in the system (the M-mode) and thinking about the system (the I-mode). 
For example, it might seem perfectly reasonable to assume that, since 
<Pv-P> (whose semi-interpretation is "either P or not P") is a theorem, 
either P or -P must be a theorem. But this is dead wrong: neither one of 
the latter pair is a theorem. In general, it is a dangerous practice to assume 
that symbols can be slipped back and forth between different levels-here, 
the language of the formal system and its metalanguage (English). 
194 
The Propositional Calculus 

Reflections on the Strengths and Weaknesses of the System 
You have now seen one example of a system with a purpose-to represent 
part of the architecture of logical thought. The concepts which this system 
handles are very few in number, and they are very simple, precise concepts. 
But the simplicity and precision of the Propositional Calculus are exactly 
the kinds of features which make it appealing to mathematicians. There are 
two reasons for this. (1) It can be studied for its own properties, exactly as 
geometry studies simple, rigid shapes. Variants can be made on it, employ-
ing different symbols, rules of inference, axioms or axiom schemata, and so 
on. (Incidentally, the version of the Propositional Calculus here presented 
is related to one invented by G. Gentzen in the early 1930's. There are 
other versions in which only one rule of inference is used--detachment, 
usually-and in which there are several axioms, or axiom schemata.) The 
study of ways to carry out propositional reasoning in elegant formal sys-
tems is an appealing branch of pure mathematics. (2) The Propositional 
Calculus can easily be extended to include other fundamental aspects of 
reasoning. Some of this will be shown in the next Chapter, where the 
Propositional Calculus is incorporated lock, stock and barrel into a much 
larger and deeper system in which sophisticated number-theoretical 
reasoning can be done. 
Proofs vs. Derivations 
The Propositional Calculus is very much like reasoning in some ways, but 
one should not equate its rules with the rules of human thought. A proof is 
something informal, or in other words a product of normal thought, 
written in a human language, for human consumption. All sorts of com-
plex features ofthought may be used in proofs, and, though they may "feel 
right", one may wonder if they can be defended logically. That is really 
what formalization is for. A derivation is an artificial counterpart of a proof, 
and its purpose is to reach the same goal but via a logical structure whose 
methods are not only all explicit, but also very simple. 
If-and this is usually the case-it happens that a formal derivation is 
extremely lengthy compared with the corresponding "natural" proof, that 
is just too bad. It is the price one pays for making each step so simple. What 
often happens is that a derivation and a proof are "simple" in complemen-
tary senses of the word. The proof is simple in that each step "sounds 
right", even though one may not know just why; the derivation is simple in 
that each of its myriad steps is considered so trivial that it is beyond 
reproach, and since the whole derivation consists just of such trivial steps, it 
is supposedly error-free. Each type of simplicity, however, brings along a 
characteristic type of complexity. In the case of proofs, it is the complexity 
of the underlying system on which they rest-namely, human language; 
and in the case of derivations, it is their' astronomical size, which makes 
them almost impossible to grasp. 
Thus, the Propositional Calculus should be thought of as part of a 
The Propositional Calculus 
195 

g-eneral method for synthesizing artificial proof-like structures. It does not, 
however, have much flexibility or generality. It is intended only for use in 
connection with mathematical concepts-which are themselves quite rigid. 
As a rather interesting example of this, let us make a derivation in which a 
very peculiar string is taken as a premise in a fantasy: <PA-P>. At least its 
semi-interpretation is peculiar. The Propositional Calculus, however, does 
not think about semi-interpretations; it just manipulates strings typograph-
ically-and typographically, there is really nothing peculiar about this 
string. Here is a fantasy with this string as its premise:

Now this theorem has a very strange semi-interpretation: 
P and not P together imply Q 
Since Q is interpretable by any statement, we can loosely take the theorem 
to say that "From a contradiction, anything follows"! Thus, in systems 
based on the Propositional Calculus, contradictions cannot be contained; 
they infect the whole system like an instantaneous global cancer. 
The Handling of Contradictions 
This does not sound much like human thought. If you found a contradic-
tion in your own thoughts, it's very unlikely that your whole mentality 
would break down. Instead, you would probably begin to question the 
beliefs or modes of reasoning which you felt had led to the contradictory 
thoughts. In other words, to the extent you could, you would step out of 
the systems inside you which you felt were responsible for the contradic-
tion, and try to repair them. One of the least likely things for you to do 
would be to throw up your arms and cry, "Well, I guess that shows that I 
believe everything now!" As a joke, yes-but not seriously. 
Indeed, contradiction is a major source of clarification and progress in 
all domains oflife-and mathematics is no exception. When in times past, a 
196 
The Propositional Calculus 

contradiction in mathematics was found, mathematicians would im-
mediately seek to pinpoint the system responsible for it, to jump out of it, to 
reason about it, and to amend it. Rather than weakening mathematics, the 
discovery and repair of a contradiction would strengthen 'it. This might 
take time and a number of false starts, but in the end it would yield fruit. 
For instance, in the Middle Ages, the value of the infinite series 
1-1+1-1+1- ... 
was hotly disputed. It was "proven" to equal 0, 1, Y2, and perhaps other 
values. Out of such controversial findings came a fuller, deeper theory 
about infinite series. 
A more relevant example is the contradiction right now confronting 
us-namely the discrepancy between the way we really think, and the way 
the Propositional Calculus imitates us. This has been a source of discomfort 
for many logicians, and much creative effort has gone into trying to patch 
up the Propositional Calculus so that it would not act so stupidly and 
inflexibly. One attempt, put forth in the book Entailment by A. R. Anderson 
and N. Belnap,3 involves "relevant implication", which tries to make the 
symbol for "if-then" reflect genuine causality, or at least connection of 
meanings. Consider the following theorems of the Propositional Calculus: 
<P:::><Q:::>P>> 
<P:::><Qv-Q» 
«PA-P>:::>Q> 
< <P:::>Q>v<Q:::>P> > 
They, and many others like them, all show that there need be no relation-
ship at all between the first and second clauses of an if-then statement for it 
to be provable within the Propositional Calculus. In protest, "relevant 
implication" puts certain restrictions on the contexts in which the rules of 
inference can be applied. Intuitively, it says that "something can only be 
derived from something else if they have to do with each other". For 
example, line lOin the derivation given above would not be allowed in such 
a system, and that would block the derivation of the string 
«PA-P>:::>Q>. 
More radical attempts abandon completely the quest for completeness 
or consistency, and try to mimic human reasoning with all its inconsisten-
cies. Such research no longer has as its goal to provide a solid underpinning 
for mathematics, but purely to study human thought processes. 
Despite its quirks, the Propositional Calculus has some features to 
recommend itself. If one embeds it into a larger system (as we will do next 
Chapter), and if one is sure that the larger system contains no contradic-
tions (and we will be), then the Propositional Calculus does all that one 
could hope: it provides valid propositional inferences-all that can be 
made. So if ever an incompleteness or an inconsistency is uncovered, one 
can be sure that it will be the fault of the larger system, and not of its 
subsystem which is the Propositional Calculus.

Oh, really? I guess there's nothing better for you than walking. 
Tortoise: 
Incidentally, you're looking in very fine fettle these days, I must 
say. 
Achilles: 
Thank you very much. 
Tortoise: 
Not at all. Here, care for one of my cigars? 
Achilles: 
Oh, you are such a philistine. In this area, the Dutch contribu-
tions are of markedly inferior taste, don't you think? 
Tortoise: 
I disagree, in this case. But speaking of taste, I finally saw that 
Crab Canon by your favorite artist, M. C. Escher, in a gallery the other 
day, and I fully appreciate the beauty and ingenuity with which he 
made one single theme mesh with itself going both backwards and 
forwards. But I am afraid I will always feel Bach is superior to Escher.

Achilles: 
I don't know. But one thing for certain is that I don't worry about 
arguments of taste. De gustibus non est disputandum. 
Tortoise: 
Tell me, what's it like to be your age? Is it true that one has no 
worries at all? 
Achilles: 
To be precise, one has no frets. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, well, it's all the same to me. 
Achilles: 
Fiddle. It makes a big difference, you know. 
Tortoise: 
Say, don't you play the guitar? 
Achilles: 
That's my good friend. He often plays, the fool. But I myself 
wouldn't touch a guitar with a ten-foot pole! 
(Suddenly, the Crab, appearing from out of nowhere, wanders up ex-
citedly, pointing to a rather prominent black eye.) 
Crab: 
Hallo! Hulloo! What's up? What's new? You see this bump, this 
lump? Given to me by a grump. Ho! And on such a fine day. You see, I 
was just idly loafing about the park when up lumbers this giant fellow 
from Warsaw-a colossal b~ar of a man-playing a lute. He was three 
meters tall, if I'm a day. I mosey on up to the chap, reach skyward and 
manage to tap him on the knee, saying, "Pardon me, sir, but you are 
Pole-luting our park with your mazurkas." But wow! he had no sense 
of humor-not a bit, not a wit--and pow!-he lets loose and belts me 
one, smack in the eye! Were it in my nature, I would crab up a storm, 
but in the time-honored tradition of my species, I backed off. After all, 
when we walk forwards, we move backwards. It's in our genes, you 
know, turning round and round. That reminds me-I've always 
wondered, "Which came first--the Crab, or the Gene?" That 
is to say, 
"Which came last--the Gene, or the Crab?" I'm always 
turning things round and round, you know. It's in our genes, after 
all. When we walk backwards, we move forwards. Ah me, oh my! 
I must lope along on my merry way-so off I go on such a fine day. 
Sing "ho!" for the life of a Crab! TATA! jOle! 
(And he disappears as suddenly as he arrived.) 
Tortoise: 
That's my good friend. He often plays the fool. But I myself 
wouldn't touch a ten-foot Pole with a guitar! 
Achilles: 
Say, don't you play the guitar? 
Tortoise: 
Fiddle. It makes a big difference, you know. 
Achilles: 
Oh, well, it's all the same to me. 
Tortoise: 
To be precise, one has no frets. 
Achilles: 
Tell me, what's it like to be your age? Is it true that one has no 
worries at ail? 
Tortoise: 
I don't know. But one thing for certain is that I don't worry about 
arguments of taste. Disputandum non est de gustibus.

Here is a short section of 
one of the Crab's Genes, turning round and 
round. When the two DNA strands are un-
raveled and laid out side by side, they read 
this way: 
... TTTTTTTTTCGAAAAAAAAA .. . 
. . . AAAAAAAAAGCTTTTTTTTT .. . 
Notice that they are the same, only one goes 
forwards while the other goes backwards. 
This is the defining property of the form 
called "crab canon" in music. It is reminis-
cent of, though a little different from, a 
palindrome, which is a sentence that reads 
the same backwards and forwards. In 
molecular biology, such segments of DNA 
are called "palindromes"--a slight mis-
nomer, since "crab canon" would be more 
accurate. Not only is this DNA segment 
crab-canonical~ut moreover its base se-
quence codes for the Dialogue's structure. 
Look carefully! 
Achilles: 
I disagree, in this case. But speaking of taste, I finally heard that 
Crab Canon by your favorite composer, J. S. Bach, in a concert the 
other day, and I fully appreciate the beauty and ingenuity with which 
he made one single theme mesh with itself going both backwards and 
forwards. But I'm afraid I will always feel Escher is superior to Bach.

CHAPTER VIII 
Typographical Number Theory 
The Crab Canon and Indirect Self-Reference 
THREE EXAMPLES OF indirect self-reference are found in the Crab Canon. 
Achilles and the Tortoise both describe artistic creations they know-and, 
quite accidentally, those creations happen to have the same structure as the 
Dialogue they're in. (Imagine my surprise, when I, the author, noticed 
this!) Also, the Crab describes a biological structure and that, too, has the 
same property. Of course, one could read the Dialogue and understand it 
and somehow fail to notice that it, too, has the form of a crab canon. This 
would be understanding it on one level, but not on another. To see the 
self-reference, one has to look at the form, as well as the content, of the 
Dialogue. 
Godel's construction depends on describing the form, as well as the 
content, of strings of the formal system we shall define in this Chapter-
Typographical Number Theory (TNT). The unexpected twist is that, because 
of the subtle mapping which Codel discovered, the form of strings can be 
described in the formal system itself. Let us acquaint ourselves with this 
strange system with the capacity for wrapping around. 
What We Want to Be Able to Express in TNT 
We'll begin by citing some typical sentences belonging to number theory; 
then we will try to find a set of basic notions in terms of which all our 
sentences can be rephrased. Those notions will then be given individual 
symbols. Incidentally, it should be stated at the outset that the term 
"number theory" will refer only to properties of positive integers and zero 
(and sets of such integers). These numbers are called the natural numbers. 
Negative numbers play no role in this theory. Thus the word "number", 
when used, will mean exclusively a natural number. And it is important-
vital-for you to keep separate in your mind the formal system (TNT) and 
the rather ill-defined but comfortable old branch of mathematics that is 
number theory itself; this I shall call "N". 
Some typical sentences of N-number theory-are: 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
204 
5 is prime. 
2 is not a square. 
1729 is a sum of two cubes. 
No sum of two positive cubes is itself a cube. 
There are infinitely many prime numbers. 
6 is even. 
Typographical Number Theory 

Now it may seem that we will need a symbol for each notion such as "prime" 
or "cube" or "positive"-but those notions are really not primitive. Prime-
ness, for instance, has to do with the factors which a number has, which in 
turn has to do with multiplication. Cubeness as well is defined in terms of 
multiplication. Let us rephrase the sentences, then, in terms of what seem 
to be more elementary notions. 
(1') There do not exist numbers a and b, both greater than 1, 
such that 5 equals a times b. 
(2') There does not exist a number b, such that b times b 
equals 2. 
(3') There exist numbers band c such that b times b times b, plus 
c times c times c, equals 1729. 
(4') 
For all numbers band c, greater than 0, there is no number 
a such that a times a times a equals b times b times b plus 
c times c times c. 
(5') For each number a, there exists a number b, greater than a, 
with the property that there do not exist numbers c and d, 
both greater than 1, such that b equals c times d. 
(6') There exists a number e such that 2 times e equals 6. 
This analysis has gotten us a long ways towards the basic elements of the 
language of number theory. It is clear that a few phrases reappear over and 
over: 
for all numbers b 
there exists a number b, such that ... 
greater than 
equals 
times 
plus 
0, 1,2, ... 
Most of these will be granted individual symbols. An exception is "greater 
than", which can be further reduced. In fact, the sentence "a is greater than 
b" becomes 
there exists a number c, not equal to 0, such that a equals b plus c. 
Numerals 
We will not have a distinct symbol for each natural number. Instead, we will 
have a very simple, uniform way of giving a compound symbol to each 
natural number-very much as we did in the pq-system. Here is our 
notation for natural numbers: 
, 
Typographical Number Theory 
205 

zero: 
one: 
two: 
three: 
etc. 
o 
50 
550 
5550 
The symbol 5 has an interpretation--"the successor of". Hence, the in-
terpretation of 550 is literally "the successor of the successor of zero". 
Strings of this form are called numerals. 
Variables and Terms 
Clearly, we need a way of referring to unspecified, or variable, numbers. 
For that, we will use the letters a, b, e, d, e. But five will not be enough. We 
need an unlimited supply of them, just as we had of atoms in the Proposi-
tional Calculus. We will use a similar method for making more variables: 
tacking on any number of primes. (Note: Of course the symbol "'-read 
"prime"-is not to be confused with prime numbers!) For instance: 
are all variables. 
e 
d ' 
e" 
b'l' 
a' I" 
In a way it is a luxury to use the first five letters of the alphabet when 
we could get away with just a and the prime. Later on, I will actually drop b, 
e, d, and e, which will result in a sort of "austere" version of TNT-austere 
in the sense that it is a little harder to decipher complex formulas. But for 
now we'll be luxurious. 
Now what about addition and multiplication? Very simple: we will use 
the ordinary symbols '+' and" '. However, we will also introduce a paren-
thesizing requirement (we are now slowly slipping into the rules which 
define well-formed strings of TNT). To write "b plus e" and "b times e", for 
instance, we use the strings 
(b+e) 
(b 'e) 
There is no laxness about such parentheses; to violate the convention is to 
produce a non-well-formed formula. ("Formula"? I use the term instead of 
"string" because it is conventional to do so. A formula is no more and no less 
than a string of TNT.) 
Incidentally, addition and multiplication are always to be thought of as 
binary operations-that is, they unite precisely two numbers, never three or 
more. Hence, if you wish to translate" I plus 2 plus 3", you have to decide 
which of the following two expressions you want: 
206 
Typographical Number Theory 

(SO+(SSO+SSSO)) 
((SO+SSO) +SSSO) 
The next notion we'll symbolize is equals. That is very simple: we use 
'='. The advantage of taking over the standard symbol used in 
N-nonformal number theory-is obvious: easy legibility. The disadvan-
tage is very much like the disadvantage of using the words "point" and 
"line" in a formal treatment of geometry: unless one is very conscious and 
careful, one may blur the distinction between the familiar meaning and the 
strictly rule-governed behavior of the formal symbol. In discussing 
geometry, I distinguished between the everyday word and the formal term 
by capitalizing the formal term: thus, in elliptical geometry, a POINT was the 
union of two ordinary points. Here, there is no such distinction; hence, 
mental effort is needed not to confuse a symbol with all of the associations it 
is laden with. As I said earlier, with reference to the pq-system: the string 
--- is not the number 3, but it acts isomorphically to 3, at least in the 
context of additions. Similar remarks go for the string SSSO. 
Atoms and Propositional Symbols 
All the symbols of the Propositional Calculus except the letters used in 
making atoms (P, Q, and R) will be used in TNT, and they retain their 
interpretations. The role of atoms will be played by strings which, when 
interpreted, are statements of equality, such as SO=SSO or (SO· SO) =SO. 
Now, we have the equipment to do a fair amount of translation of simple 
sentences into the notation of TNT: 
2 plus 3 equals 4: 
2 plus 2 is not equal to 3: 
If 1 equals 0, then ° equals 1: 
(SSO+SSSO) =SSSSO 
-(SSO+SSO) =SSSO 
<SO=O~O=SO> 
The first of these strings is an atom; the rest are compound formulas. 
(Warning: The 'and' in the phrase "I and 1 make 2" is just another word 
for 'plus', and must be represented by '+' (and the requisite parentheses).) 
Free Variables and Quantifiers 
All the well-formed formulas above have the property that their interpreta-
tions are sentences which are either true or false. There are, however, 
well-formed formulas which do not have that property, such as this one: 
(b+SO)=SSO 
I ts interpretation is "b plus 1 equals 2". Since b is unspecified, there is no 
way to assign a truth value to the statement. It is like an out-of-context 
statement with a pronoun, such as "she is clumsy". It is neither true nor 
false; it is waiting for you to put it into a context. Because it is neither true 
nor false, such a formula is called open, and the variable b is called afree 
variable. 
Typographical Number Theory 
207 

One way of changing an open formula into a closed formula, or sentence, 
is by prefixing it with a quantifier-either the phrase "there exists a number 
b such that ... ", or the phrase "for all numbers b". In the first instance, you 
get the sentence 
There exists a number b such that b plus 1 equals 2. 
Clearly this is true. In the second instance, you get the sentence 
For all numbers b, b plus 1 equals 2. 
Clearly this is false. We now introduce symbols for both of these quantifiers. 
These sentences are translated into TNT-notation as follows: 
3b:(b+SO)=SSO 
Vb:(b+SO) =SSO 
('3' stands for 'exists'.) 
('V' stands for 'all'.) 
It is very important to note that these statements are no longer about 
unspecified numbers; the first one is an assertion of existence, and the second 
one is a universal assertion. They would mean the same thing, even if written 
with c instead of b: 
3c:(c+SO)=SSO 
Vc:(c+SO)=SSO 
A variable which is under the dominion of a quantifier is called a 
quantified variable. The following two formulas illustrate the difference 
between free variables and quantified variables: 
(b·b)=SSO 
-3b:(b'b)=SSO 
(open) 
(closed; a sentence of TNT) 
The first one expresses a property which might be possessed by some natural 
number. Of course, no natural number has that property. And that is 
precisely what is expressed by the second one. It is very crucial to under-
stand this difference between a string with afree variable, which expresses a 
property, and a string where the variable is quantified, which expresses a truth 
or falsity. The English translation of a formula with at least one free 
variable-an open formula-is called a predicate. It is a sentence without a 
subject (or a sentence whose subject is an out-of-context pronoun). For 
instance, 
"is a sentence without a subject" 
"would be an anomaly" 
"runs backwards and forwards simultaneously" 
"improvised a six-part fugue on demand" 
are nonarithmetical predicates. They express properties which specific en-
tities might or might not possess. One could as well stick on a "dummy 
208 
Typographical Number Theory 

subject", such as "so-and-so". A string with free variables is like a predicate 
with "so-and-so" as its subject. For instance, 
(SO+SO)=b 
is like saying "I plus 1 equals so-and-so". This is a predicate in the variable 
b. It expresses a property which the number b might have. If one were to 
substitute various numerals for b, one would get a succession of formulas, 
most of which would express falsehoods. Here is another example of the 
difference between open formulas and sentences: 
Vb:Vc:(b+c)=(c+b) 
The above formula is a sentence representing, of course, the commutativity 
of addition. On the other hand, 
Vc:(b+c)=(c+b) 
is an open formula, since b is free. It expresses a property which the 
unspecified number b might or might not have-namely of commuting 
with all numbers c. 
Translating Our Sample Sentences 
This completes the vocabulary with which we will express all number-
theoretical statements! It takes considerable practice to get the hang of 
expressing complicated statements of N in this notation, and conversely of 
figuring out the meaning of well-formed formulas. For this reason we 
return to the six sample sentences given at the beginning, and work out 
their translations into TNT. By the way, don't think that the translations 
given below are unique-far from it. There are many-infinitely many-
ways to express each one. 
Let us begin with the last one: "6 is even". This we rephrased in terms 
of more primitive notions as "There exists a number e such that 2 times e 
equals 6". This one is easy: 
3e:(SSO' e) =SSSSSSO 
Note the necessity of the quantifier; it simply would not do to write 
(SSO· e) =SSSSSSO 
alone. This string's interpretation is of course neither true nor false; it just 
expresses a property which the number e might have. 
It is curious that, since we know multiplication is commutative, we 
might easily have written 
3e:(e 'SSO)=SSSSSSO 
instead. Or, knowing that equality is a symmetrical relation, we might have 
chosen to write the sides of the equation in the opposite order: 
Typographical Number Theory 
209 

3e:SSSSSSO = (SSO· e) 
Now these three translations of "6 is even" are quite different strings, and it 
is by no means obvious that theoremhood of anyone of them is tied to 
theoremhood of any of the others. (Similarly, the fact that --p -q --- was 
a theorem had very little to do with the fact that its "equivalent" string 
-p--q--- was a theorem. The equivalence lies in our minds, since, as 
humans, we almost automatically think about interpretations, not struc-
tural properties of formulas.) 
We can dispense with sentence 2: "2 is not a square", almost im-
mediately: 
- 3b:(b . b) =SSO 
However, once again, we find an ambiguity. What if we had chosen to write 
it this way? 
Vb:-(b· b) =SSO 
The first way says, "It is not the case that there exists a number b with the 
property that b's square is 2", while the second way says, "For all numbers 
b, it is not the case that b's square is 2." Once again, to us, they are 
conceptually equivalent-but to TNT, they are distinct strings. 
Let us proceed to sentence 3: "1729 is a sum of two cubes." This one 
will involve two existential quantifiers, one after the other, as follows: 
3b:3c:SSSSSS ..... SSSSSO=(((b· b) ·b)+((c· c) ·c)) 
~ 
1729 of them 
There are alternatives galore. Reverse the order of the quantifiers; switch 
the sides of the equation; change the variables to d and e; reverse the 
addition; write the multiplications differently; etc., etc. However, I prefer 
the following two translations of the sentence: 
3b:3c:(((SSSSSSSSSSO·SSSSSSSSSSO) . SSSSSSSSSSO) + 
((SSSSSSSSSO ·SSSSSSSSSO) . SSSSSSSSSO))=(((b . b)· b)+((c ·c) ·c)) 
and 
3b:3c:( ((SSSSSSSSSSSSO· SSSSSSSSSSSSO) . SSSSSSSSSSSSO) + 
((SO ·SO)· SO)) =(((b· b) . b) +(( c· c)· c)) 
Do you see why? 
Tricks of the Trade 
Now let us tackle the related sentence 4: "No sum of two positive cubes is 
itself a cube". Suppose that we wished merely to state that 7 is not a sum of 
two positive cubes. The easiest way to do this is by negating the formula 
210 
Typographical Number Theory 

which asserts that 7 is a sum of two positive cubes. This will be just like the 
preceding sentence involving 1729, except that we have to add in the 
proviso of the cubes being positive. We can do this with a trick: prefix the 
variables with the symbol S, as follows: 
3b:3e:SSSSSSSO=(((Sb ·Sb) ·Sb)+((Se ·Se) ·Se)) 
You see, we are cubing not band e, but their successors, which must be 
positive, since the smallest value which either b or e can take on is zero. 
Hence the right-hand side represents a sum of two positive cubes. Inciden-
tally, notice that the phrase "there exist numbers band e such that ... ", 
when translated, does not involve the symbol '1\' which stands for 'and'. 
That symbol is used for connecting entire well-formed strings, not for 
joining two quantifiers. 
Now that we have translated "7 is a sum of two positive cubes", we wish 
to negate it. That simply involves prefixing the whole thing by a single tilde. 
(Note: you should not negate each quantifier, even though the desired 
phrase runs "There do not exist numbers band e such that ... ".) Thus we 
get: 
-3b:3e:SSSSSSSO=(((Sb·Sb) ·Sb)+((Se·Se) ·Se)) 
Now our original goal was to assert this property not of the number 7, but 
of all cubes. Therefore, let us replace the numeral SSSSSSSO by the string 
((a ·a) ·a), which is the translation of "a cubed": 
-3b:3e:((a ·a) ·a) =(((Sb·Sb) ·Sb)+((Se ·Se) ·Se)) 
At this stage, we are in possession of an open formula, since a is still free. 
This formula expresses a property which a number a might or might not 
have-and it is our purpose to assert that all numbers do have that prop-
erty. That is simple-just prefix the whole thing with a universal quantifier: 
Va:-3b:3e:((a ·a) ·a)=(((Sb ·Sb) ·Sb)+((Se ·Se) ·Se)) 
An equally good translation would be this: 
-3a:3b:3e:((a ·a) ·a) =(((Sb ·Sb) ·Sb) +((Se ·Se) ·Se») 
In austere TNT, we could use a' instead of b, and a" instead of e, and the 
formula would become: 
- 3a:3a' :3a" :((a ·a) ·a) =(((Sa'· Sa')· Sa') +((Sa"· Sa") . Sa")) 
What about sentence 1: "5 is prime"? We had reworded it in this way: 
"There do not exist numbers a and b, both greater than 1, such that 5 
equals a times b". We can slightly modify it, as follows: "There do not exist 
numbers a and b such that 5 equals a plus 2, times b plus 2". This is another 
trick-since a and b are restricted to natural number values, this is an 
adequate way to say the same thing. Now "b plus 2" could be translated into 
Typographical Number Theory 
211 

(b+SSO), but there is a shorter way to write it-namely, SSb. Likewise, "e 
plus 2" can be written SSe. Now, our translation is extremely concise: 
-3b:3e:SSSSSO=(SSb·SSe) 
Without the initial tilde, it would be an assertion that two natural numbers 
do exist, which, when augmented by 2, have a product equal t,o 5. With the 
tilde in front, that whole statement is denied, resulting in an assertion that 5 
IS pnme. 
If we wanted to assert that d plus e plus 1, rather than 5, is prime, the 
most economical way would be to replace the numeral for 5 by the string 
(d+Se): 
- 3b:3e:( d+Se) =(SSb· SSe) 
Once again, an open formula, one whose interpretation is neither a true 
nor a false sentence, but just an assertion about two unspecified numbers, d 
and e. Notice that the number represented by the string (d+Se) is necessar-
ily greater than d, since one has added to d an unspecified but definitely 
positive amount. Therefore, if we existentially quantify over the variable e, 
we will have a formula which asserts that: 
There exists a number which is greater than d and which is prime. 
3e:-3b:3e:( d+Se)=(SSb ·SSe) 
Well, all we have left to do now is to assert that this property actually 
obtains, no matter what d is. The way to do that is to universally quantify 
over the variable d: 
Vd:3e:-3b:3e:(d+Se)=(SSb·SSe) 
That's the translation of sentence 5! 
Translation Puzzles for You 
This completes the exercise of translating all six typical number-theoretical 
sentences. However, it does not necessarily make you an expert in the 
notation of TNT. There are still some tricky issues to be mastered. The 
following six well-formed formulas will test your understanding of TNT-
notation. What do they mean? Which ones are true (under interpretation, 
of course), and which ones are false? (Hint: the way to tackle this exercise is 
to move leftwards. First, translate the atom; next, figure out what adding a 
single quantifier or a tilde does; then move leftwards, adding another 
quantifier or tilde; then move leftwards again, and do the same.) 
212

Ve:-3b:(SSO·b)=e 
Typographical Number Theory 

Vc:3b:-(SSO·b)=c 
-3b:Vc:(SSO·b)=c 
3b:-Vc:(SSO·b)=c 
3b:Vc:-(SSO·b)=c 
(Second hint: Either four of them are true and two false, or four false and 
two true.) 
How to Distinguish True from False? 
At this juncture, it is worthwhile pausing for breath and contemplating 
what it would mean to have a formal system that could sift out the true ones 
from the false ones. This system would treat all these strings-which to us 
look like statements-as designs having form, but no content. And this 
system would be like a sieve through which could pass only designs with a 
special style-the "style of truth". If you yourself have gone through the six 
formulas above, and have separated the true from the false by thinking 
about meaning, you will appreciate the subtlety that any system would have 
to have, that could do the same thing-but typographically! The boundary 
separating the set of true statements from the set of false statements (as 
written in the TNT-notation) is anything but straight; it is a boundary with 
many treacherous curves (recall Fig. 18), a boundary of which mathemati-
cians have delineated stretches, here and there, working over hundreds of 
years. Just think what a coup it would be to have a typographical method 
which was guaranteed to place any formula on the proper side of the 
border! 
The Rules of Well-Formedness 
It is useful to have a table of Rules of Formation for well-formed formulas. 
This is provided below. There are some preliminary stages, defining nu-
merals, vt'friables, and terms. Those three classes of strings are ingredients of 
well-formed formulas, but are not in themselves well-formed. The smallest 
well-formed formulas are the atoms; then there are ways of compounding 
atoms. Many of these rules are recursive lengthening rules, in that they 
take as input an item of a given class and produce a longer item of the same 
class. In this table, I use 'x' and 'y' to stand for well-formed formulas, and 
'5', 't', and 'u' to stand for other kinds of TNT-strings. Needless to say, 
none of these five symbols is itself a symbol of TNT. 
NUMERALS. 
o is a numeral. 
A numeral preceded by S is also a numeral. 
Examples: 
0 
SO 
SSO 
SSSO 
SSSSO 
SSSSSO 
Typographical Number Theory 
213 

VARIABLES. 
a is a variable. If we're not being austere, so are b, e, d and e. 
A variable followed by a prime is also a variable. 
Examples: a b' e" d"' e'"' 
TERMS. 
All numerals and variables are terms. 
A term preceded by S is also a term. 
If sand t are terms, then so are (s+ t) and (s' t). 
Examples: 
0 
b SSa' (SO'(SSO+e)) S(Sa·(Sb·Se)) 
TERMS may be divided into two categories: 
(1) 
DEFINITE terms. These contain no variables. 
Examples: 
0 
(SO+SO) 
SS((SSO'SSO)+(SO'SO)) 
(2) 
INDEFINITE terms. These contain variables. 
Examples: 
b Sa (b+SO) 
(((SO+SO)+SO)+e) 
The above rules tell how to make parts of well-formed formulas; the 
remaining rules tell how to make complete well-formed formulas. 
ATOMS. 
If sand t are terms, then s = t is an atom. 
Examples: 
SO=O (SSO+SSO)=SSSSO S(b+e)=((e·d)·e) 
If an atom contains a variable u, then u is free in it. Thus there are 
four free variables in the last example. 
NEGATIONS. 
A well-formed formula preceded by a tilde is well-formed. 
Examples: 
-SO=O -3b:(b+b)=SO 
-<O=O~SO=O> -b=SO 
The quantification status of a variable (which says whether the variable is 
free or quantified) does not change under negation. 
COMPOUNDS. 
If x and yare well-formed formulas, and provided that no variable 
which is free in one is quantified in the other, then the following 
are all well-formed formulas: 
<xl\y>, <xvy>, 
<x~y>. 
Examples: 
<0=01\-0=0> <b=bv-3e:e=b> 
<SO=0~Ve:-3b:(b+b)=e> 
The quantification status of a variable doesn't change here. 
QUANTIFICATIONS. 
If u is a variable, and x is a well-formed formula in which u is free, 
then the following strings are well-formed formulas: 
3u: x and 
Vu: x. 
Examples: 
Vb:<b=bv-3e:e=b> Ve:-3b:(b+b)=e -3e:Se=d 
OPEN FORMULAS contain at least one free variable. 
Examples: -e=e b=b <Vb:b=bl\-e=e> 
CLOSED FORMULAS (SENTENCES) contain no free variables. 
Examples: 
SO=O -Vd:d=O 3e:<Vb:b=bA-e=e> 
214 
Typographical Number Theory 

This completes the table of Rules of Formation for the well-formed for-
mulas of TNT. 
A Few More Translation Exercises 
And now, a few practice exercises for you, to test your understanding of 
the notation of TNT. Try to translate the first four of the following 
N-sentences into TNT-sentences, and the last one into an open well-
formed formula. 
All natural numbers are equal to 4. 
There is no natural number which equals its own square. 
Different natural numbers have different successors. 
If 1 equals 0, then every number is odd. 
b is a power of 2. 
The last one you may find a little tricky. But it is nothing, compared to this 
one: 
b is a power of 10. 
Strangely, this one takes great cleverness to render in our notation. I would 
caution you to try it only if you are willing to spend hours and hours on 
it-and if you know quite a bit of number theory! 
A Nontypographical System 
This concludes the exposition of the notation of TNT; however, we are still 
left with the problem of making TNT into the ambitious system which we 
have described. Success would justify the interpretations which we have 
given to the various symbols. Until we have done that, however, these 
particular interpretations are no more justified than the "horse-apple-
happy" interpretations were for the pq-system's symbols. 
Someone might suggest the following way of constructing TNT: {1) Do 
not have any rules of inference; they are unnecessary, because (2) We take 
as axioms all true statements of number theory (as written in TNT-
notation). What a simple prescription! Unfortunately it is as empty as one's 
instantaneous reaction says it is. Part (2) is, of course, not a typographical 
description of strings. The whole purpose of TNT is to figure out if and 
how it is possible to-- characterize the true strings typographically. 
The Five Axioms and First Rules of TNT 
Thus we will follow a more difficult route than the suggestion above; we 
will have axioms and rules of inference. Firstly, as was promised, all of the 
rules of the Propositional Calculus are taken over into TNT. Therefore, one 
theorem of TNT will be this one: 
<so=Ov-so=o> 
Typographical Number Theory 
215 

which can be derived in the same way as <Pv-P> was derived. 
Before we give more rules, let us give the five axioms of TNT: 
AXIOM 1: 
Va:-Sa=O 
AXIOM 2: 
Va:(a+O)=a 
AXIOM 3: 
Va:Vb:(a+Sb)=S(a+b) 
AXIOM 4: 
Va:(a'O)=O 
AXIOM 5: 
Va:\fb:(a'Sb)=((a'b)+a) 
(In the austere versions, use a' instead of b.) All of them are very simple to 
understand. Axiom 1 states a special fact about the number 0; Axioms 2 
and 3 are concerned with the nature of addition; Axioms 4 and 5 are 
concerned with the nature of multiplication, and in particular with its 
relation to addition. 
The Five Peano Postulates 
By the way, the interpretation of Axiom 1-"Zero is not the successor of 
any natural number"-is one of five famous properties of natural numbers 
first explicitly recognized by the mathematician and logician Giuseppe 
Peano, in 1889. In setting out his postulates, Peano was following the path 
of Euclid in this way: he made no attempt to formalize the principles of 
reasoning, but tried to give a small set of properties of natural numbers 
from which everything else could be derived by reasoning. Pea no's attempt 
might thus be considered "semiformal". Pea no's work had a significant 
influence, and thus it would be good to show Peano's five postulates. Since 
the notion of "natural number" is the one which Peano was attempting to 
define, we will not use the familiar term "natural number", which is laden 
with connotation. We will replace it with the undefined term djinn, a word 
which comes fresh and free of connotations to our mind. Then Pea no's five 
postulates place five restrictions on djinns. There are two other undefined 
terms: Genie, and meta. I will let you figure out for yourself what usual 
concept each of them is supposed to represent. The five Peano postulates: 
( 1) 
Genie is a d jinn. 
(2) 
Every djinn has a meta (which is also a djinn). 
(3) 
Genie is not the meta of any djinn. 
(4) 
Different djinns have different metas. 
(5) If Genie has X, and each djinn relays X to its meta, then all 
djinns get X. 
In light of the lamps of the Little Harmonic Labyrinth, we should name the set 
of all djinns "GOD". This harks back to a celebrated statement by the 
German mathematician and logician Leopold Kronecker, archenemy of 
Georg Cantor: "God made the natural numbers; all the rest is the work of 
man." 
216 
Typographical Number Theory 

You may recognize Peano's fifth postulate as the principle of mathe-
matical induction-another term for a hereditary argument. Peano hoped 
that his five restrictions on the concepts "Genie", "djinn", and "meta" were 
so strong that if two different people formed images in their minds of the 
concepts, the two images would have completely isomorphic structures. For 
example, everybody's image would include an infinite number of distinct 
djinns. And presumably everybody would agree that no djinn coincides 
with its own meta, or its meta's meta, etc. 
Peano hoped to have pinned down the essence of natural numbers in 
his five postulates. Mathematicians generally grant that he succeeded, but 
that does not lessen the importance of the question, "How is a true state-
ment about natural numbers to be distinguished from a false one?" And to 
answer this question, mathematicians turned to totally formal systems, such 
as TNT. However, you will see the influence of Pea no in TNT, because all 
of his postulates are incorporated in TNT in one way or another. 
New Rules of TNT: Specification and Generalization 
Now we come to the new rules of TNT. Many of these rules will allow us to 
reach in and change the internal structure of the atoms of TNT. In that 
sense they deal with more "microscopic" properties of strings than the rules 
of the Propositional Calculus, which treat atoms as indivisible units. For 
example, it would be nice if we could extract the string -50=0 from the 
first axiom. To do this we would need a rule which permits us to drop a 
universal quantifier, and at the same time to change the internal structure 
of the string which remains, if we wish. Here is such a rule: 
RULE OF SPECIFICATION: 
Suppose u is a variable which occurs inside the 
string x. If the string Vu: x is a theorem, then so is x, and so are any 
strings made from x by replacing u, wherever it occurs, by one and 
the same term. 
(Restriction: The term which replaces u must not contain any variable 
that is quantified in x.) 
The rule of specification allows the desired string to be extracted from 
Axiom 1. It is a one-step derivation: 
Va:-5a=0 
-50=0 
axiom 
specification 
Notice that the rule of specification will allow some formulas which contain 
free variables (i.e., open formulas) to become theorems. For example, the 
following strings could also be derived from Axiom 1, by specification: 
-5a=0 
-5(c+550)=0 
There is another rule, the rule of generalization, which allows us to put 
Typographical Number Theory 
217 

back the universal quantifier on theorems which contain variables that 
became free as a result of usage of specification. Acting on the lower string, 
for example, generalization would give: 
Vc:-S(c+SSO)=O 
Generalization undoes the action of specification, and vice versa. Usually, 
generalization is applied after sevetal intermediate steps have transformed 
the open formula in various ways. Here is the exact statement of the rule: 
RULE OF GENERALIZATION: 
Suppose x is a theorem in which u, a variable, 
occurs free. Then Vu: x is a theorem. 
(Restriction: No generalization is allowed in a fantasy on any variable 
which appeared free in the fantasy's premise.) 
The need for restrictions on these two rules will shortly be demonstrated 
explicitly. Incidentally, this generalization is the same generalization as was 
mentioned in Chapter II. in Euclid's proof about the infinitude of primes. 
Already we can see how the symbol-manipulating rules are starting to 
approximate the kind of reasoning which a mathematician uses. 
The Existential Quantifier 
These past two rules told how to take off universal quantifiers and put 
them back on; the next two rules tell how to handle existential quantifiers. 
RULEOF INTERCHANGE: 
Suppose u is a variable. Then the strings Vu:- and 
- 3u: are interchangeable anywhere inside any theorem. 
For example. let us apply this rule to Axiom 1: 
Va:-Sa=O 
-3a:Sa=O 
axiom 1 
interchange 
By the way, you might notice that both these strings are perfectly natural 
renditions, in TNT, of the sentence "Zero is not the successor of any 
natural number". Therefore it is good that they can be turned into each 
other with ease. 
The next rule is. if anything. even more intuitive. It corresponds to the 
very simple kind of inference we make when we go from "2 is prime" to 
"There exists a prime". The name of this rule is self-explanatory: 
RULE OF EXISTENCE: 
Suppose a term (which may contain variables as long 
as they are free) appears once. or multiply, in a theorem. Then any (or 
several, or all) of the appearances of the term may be replaced by a 
variable which otherwise does not occur in the theorem, and the 
corresponding existential quantifier must be placed in front. 
Let us apply the rule to--as usual--Axiom 1: 
218 
Typographical Number Theory 

Va:-Sa=O 
3b:Va:-Sa=b 
aXiom 
existence 
You might now try to shunt symbols, according to rules so far given, to 
produce the theorem -Vb:3a:Sa=b. 
Rules of Equality and Successorship 
We have given rules for manipulating quantifiers, but so far none for the 
symbols '=' and'S'. We rectify that situation now. In what follows, r, 5, and 
t all stand for arbitrary terms. 
RULES OF EQUALITY: 
SYMMETRY: If r = 5 is a theorem, then so is 5 = r. 
TRANSITIVITY: If r = 5 and 5 = t are theorems, then so is r = t. 
RULES OF SUCCESSORSHIP: 
ADD S: If r = t is a theorem, then Sr = St is a theorem. 
DROP S: If Sr = St is a theorem, then r = t is a theorem. 
Now we are equipped with rules that can give us a fantastic variety of 
theorems. For example, the following derivations yield theorems which are 
pretty fundamental: 
(1) Va:Vb:(a+Sb)=S(a+b) 
(2) Vb:(SO+Sb)=S(SO+b) 
(3) (SO+SO)=S(SO+O) 
(4) 
Va:(a+O)=a 
(5) (SO+O)=SO 
(6) S(SO+O)=SSO 
(7) (SO+SO)=SSO

Va:Vb:(a'Sb)=((a'b)+a) 
(2) Vb:(SO'Sb)=((SO'b)+SO) 
(3) (SO·SO)=((SO·O)+SO) 
(4) Va:Vb:(a+Sb)=S(a+b) 
(5) 
Vb:((SO'O)+Sb)=S((SO'O)+b)

Illegal Shortcuts 
Now here is an interesting question: "How can we make a derivation for the 
string O=O?" It seems that the obvious route to go would be first to derive 
the string Va:a=a, and then to use specification. So, what about the follow-
ing "derivation" of Va:a=a ... What is wrong with it? Can you fix it up? 
(1) Va:(a+O)=a 
(2) Va:a=(a+O) 
(3) Va:a=a 
axiom 2 
symmetry 
transiti vity (lines 2,1) 
I gave this mini-exercise to point out one simple fact: that one should not 
jump too fast in manipulating symbols (such as '=') which are familiar. One 
must follow the rules, and not one's knowledge of the passive meanings of 
the symbols. Of course, this latter type of knowledge is invaluable in 
guiding the route of a derivation. 
Why Specification and Generalization Are Restricted 
Now let us see why there are restrictions necessary on both specification 
and generalization. Here are two derivations. In each of them, one of the 
restrictions is violated. Look at the disastrous results they produce: 
(1) 
[ 
(2) 
a=O 
(3) 
Va:a=O 
(4) 
Sa=O 
(5) 
] 
(6) 
<a=O~Sa=O> 
(7) 
Va:<a=O~Sa=O> 
(8) 
<O=O~SO=O> 
(9) 0=0 
(0) SO=O 
push 
premise 
generalization (Wrong!) 
specification 
pop 
fantasy rule 
generalization 
specification 
previous theorem 
detachment (lines 9,8) 
This is the first disaster. The other one is via faulty specification. 
(1) Va:a=a 
(2) Sa=Sa 
(3) 3b:b=Sa 
(4) 
Va:3b:b=Sa 
(5) 
3b:b=Sb 
previous theorem 
specification 
existence 
generalization 
specification (Wrong!) 
So now you can see why those restrictions are needed. 
Here is a simple puzzle: translate (if you have not already done so) 
Peano's fourth postulate into TNT-notation, and then derive that string as 
a theorem. 
220 
Typographical Number Theory 

Something Is Missing 
Now if you experiment around for a while with the rules and axioms of 
TNT so far presented, you will find that you can produce the following 
pyramidal family of theorems (a set of strings all cast from an identical mold, 
differing from one another only in that the numerals 0, SO, SSO, and so on 
have been stuffed in): 
(0+0)=0 
(O+SO)=SO 
(O+SSO)=SSO 
(O+SSSO)=SSSO 
(O+SSSSO)=SSSSO 
etc. 
As a matter of fact, each of the theorems in this family can be derived from 
the one directly above it, in only a couple of lines. Thus it is a sort of 
"cascade" of theorems, each one triggering the next. (These theorems are 
very reminiscent of the pq-theorems, where the middle and right-hand 
groups of hyphens grew simultaneously.) 
Now there is one string which we can easily write down, and which 
summarizes the passive meaning of them all, taken together. That univer-
sally quantified summarizing string is this: 
Va:(O+a)=a 
Yet with the rules so far given, this string eludes production. Try to 
produce it yourself if you don't believe me. 
You may think that we should immediately remedy the situation with 
the following 
(PROPOSED) RULE OF ALL: If all the strings in a pyramidal family are theo-
rems, then so is the universally quantified string which summarizes 
them. 
The problem with this rule is that it cannot be used in the M-mode. Only 
people who are thinking about the system can ever know that an infinite set 
of strings are all theorems. Thus this is not a rule that can be stuck inside 
any formal system. 
w-Incomplete Systems and Undecidable Strings 
So we find ourselves in a strange situation, in which we can typographically 
produce theorems about the addition of any specific numbers, but even such 
a simple string as the one above, which expresses a property of addition in 
general, is not a theorem. You might think that is not all that strange, since 
we were in precisely that situation with the pq-system. However, the pq-
system had no pretensions about what it ought to be able to do; and in fact 
Typographical Number Theory 
221 

there was no way to express general statements about addition in its sym-
bolism, let alone prove them. The equipment simply was not there, and it 
did not even occur to us to think that the system was defective. Here, 
however, the expressive capability is far stronger, and we have correspond-
ingly higher expectations of TNT than of the pq-system. If the string above 
is not a theorem, then we will have good reason to consider TNT to be 
defective. As a matter of fact, there is a name for systems with this kind of 
defect-they are called w-incomplete. (The prefix 'w'-'omega'- comes 
from the fact that the totality of natural numbers is sometimes denoted by 
'w'.) Here is the exact definition: 
A system is w-incomplete if all the strings in a pyramidal family are 
theorems, but the universally quantified summarizing string is not 
a theorem. 
Incidentally, the negation of the above summarizing string-
-Va:(O+a) =a 
-is also a nontheorem of TNT. This means that the original string is 
undecidable within the system. If one or the other were a theorem, then we 
would say that it was decidable. Although it may sound like a mystical term, 
there is nothing mystical about undecidability within a given system. It is 
only a sign that the system could be extended. For example, within absolute 
geometry, Euclid's fifth postulate is undecidable. It has to be added as an 
extra postulate of geometry, to yield Euclidean geometry; or conversely, its 
negation can be added, to yield non-Euclidean geometry. If you think back 
to geometry, you will remember why this curious thing happens. It is 
because the four postulates of absolute geometry simply do not pin down 
the meanings of the terms "point" and "line", and there is room for different 
extensions of the notions. The points and lines of Euclidean geometry 
provide one kind of extension of the notions of "point" and "line"; the 
POINTS and LINES of non-Euclidean geometry, another. However, using 
the pre-flavored words "point" and "line" tended, for two millennia, to 
make people believe that those words were necessarily univalent, capable of 
only one meaning. 
Non-Euclidean TNT 
We are now faced with a similar situation, involving TNT. We have 
adopted a notation which prejudices us in certain ways. For instance, usage 
of the symbol '+' tends to make us think that every theorem with a plus sign 
in it ought to say something known and familiar and "sensible" about the 
known and familiar operation we call "addition". Therefore it would run 
against the grain to propose adding the following "sixth axiom": 
-Va:(O+a)=a 
222 
Typographical Number Theory 

It doesn't jibe with what we believe about addition. But it is one possible 
extension of TNT, as we have so far formulated TNT. The system which 
uses this as its sixth axiom is a consistent system, in the sense of not having 
two theorems of the form x and - x. However, when you juxtapose this 
"sixth axiom" with the pyramidal family of theorems shown above, you will 
probably be bothered by a seeming inconsistency between the family and 
the new axiom. But this kind of inconsistency is not so damaging as the 
other kind (where x and - x are both theorems). In fact, it is not a true 
inconsistency, because there is a way of interpreting the symbols so that 
everything comes out all right. 
w-Inconsistency Is Not the Same as Inconsistency 
This kind of inconsistency, created by the opposition of (1) a pyramidal 
family of theorems which collectively assert that all natural numbers have 
some property, and (2) a single theorem which seems to assert that not all 
numbers have it, is given the name of w-inconsistency. An w-inconsistent 
system is more like the at-the-outset-distasteful-but-in-the-end-acceptable 
non-Euclidean geometry. In order to form a mental model of what is going 
on, you have to imagine that there are some "extra", unsuspected 
numbers-let us not call them "natural", but supernatural numbers-which 
have no numerals. Therefore, facts about them cannot be represented in 
the pyramidal family. (This is a little bit like Achilles' conception of 
GOD-as a sort of "superdjinn", a being greater than any of the djinns. 
This was scoffed at by the Genie, but it is a reasonable image, and may help 
you to imagine supernatural numbers.) 
What this tells us is that the axioms and rules of TNT, as so far 
presented, do not fully pin down the interpretations for the symbols of 
TNT. There is still room for variation in one's mental model of the notions 
they stand for. Each of the various possible extensions would pin down 
some of the notions further; but in different ways. Which symbols would 
begin to take on "distasteful" passive meanings, if we added the "sixth 
axiom" given above? Would all of the symbols become tainted, or would 
some of them still mean what we want them to mean? I will let you think 
about that. We will encounter a similar question in Chapter XIV, and 
discuss the matter then. In any case, we will not follow this extension now, 
but instead go on to try to repair the w-incompleteness of TNT. 
The Last Rule 
The problem with the "Rule of All" was that it required knowing that all the 
lines of an infinite pyramidal family are theorems-too much for a finite 
being. But suppose that each line of the pyramid can be derived from its 
predecessor in a patterned way. Then there would be afinite reason account-
ing for the fact that all the strings in the pyramid are theorems. The trick, 
then, is to find the pattern that causes the cascade, and show that that 
Typographical Number Theory 
223 

pattern is a theorem in itself. That is like proving that each djinn passes a 
message to its meta, as in the children's game of "Telephone". The other 
thing left to show is that Genie starts the cascading message-that is, to 
establish that the first line of the pyramid is a theorem. Then you know that 
GOD will get the messagel 
In the particular pyramid we were looking at, there is a pattern, 
captured by lines 4-9 of the derivation below. 
(1) 
Va:Vb:(a+Sb)=S(a+b) 
(2) 
Vb:(O+Sb)=S(O+b) 
(3) (O+Sb)=S(O+b)

The premise is (O+b)=b; the outcome is (O+Sb)=Sb. 
The first line of the pyramid is also a theorem; it follows directly from 
Axiom 2. All we need now is a rule which lets us deduce that the string 
which summarizes the entire pyramid is itself a theorem. Such a rule will be 
a formalized statement of the fifth Peano postulate. 
To express that rule, we need a little notation. Let us abbreviate a 
well-formed formula in which the variable a is free by the following nota-
tion: 
X{a} 
(There may be other free variables, too, but that is irrelevant.) Then the 
notation X{Sa/a} will stand for that string but with every occurrence of a 
replaced by Sa. Likewise, X{O/a} would stand for the same string, with each 
appearance of a replaced by O. 
A specific example would be to let X{a} stand for the string in ques-
tion: (O+a)=a. Then X{Sa/a} would represent the string (O+Sa)=Sa, and 
X{O/a} would represent (0+0)=0. (Warning: This notation is not part of 
TNT; it is for our convenience in talking about TNT.) 
With this new notation, we can state the last rule of TNT quite pre-
cisely: 
RULE OF INDUCTION: 
Suppose u is a variable, and X{u} is a well-formed 
formula in which u occurs free. If both Vu:<X{u}~X{Su/u}> and 
X{O/u} are theorems, then Vu: X{u} is also a theorem. 
This is about as close as we can come to putting Peano's fifth postulate into 
TNT. Now let us use it to show that Va:(O+a)=a is indeed a theorem in 
TNT. Emerging from the fantasy in our derivation above, we can apply the 
fantasy rule, to give us

This is the first of the two input theorems required by the induction rule. 
The other requirement is the first line of the pyramid, which we have. 
Therefore, we can apply the rule of induction, to deduce what we wanted: 
Vb:(O+b)=b 
Specification and generalization will allow us to change the variable from b 
to a; thus Va;(O+a)=a is no longer an undecidable string of TNT. 
A Long Derivation 
Now I wish to present one longer derivation in TNT, so that you can see 
what one is like, and also because it proves a significant, if simple, fact of 
number theory.

Tension and Resolution in TNT 
TNT has proven the commutativity of addition. Even if you do not follow 
this derivation in detail, it is important to realize that. like a piece of music. 
it has its own natural "rhythm". It is not just a random walk that happens to 
have landed on the desired last line. I have inserted "breathing marks" to 
show some of the "phrasing" of this derivation. Line 28 in particular is a 
turning point in the derivation. something like the halfway point in an 
AABB type of piece, where you resolve momentarily, even if not in the tonic 
key. Such important intermediate stages are often called "lemmas". 
It is easy to imagine a reader starting at line 1 of this derivation. 
ignorant of where it is to end up. and getting a sense of where it is going as 
he sees each new line. This would set up an inner tension. very much like 
the tension in a piece of music caused by chord progressions that let you 
know what the tonality is. without resolving. Arrival at line 28 would 
confirm the reader's intuition and give him a momentary feeling of satisfac-
tion while at the same time strengthening his drive to progress towards 
what he presumes is the true goal. 
Now line 49 is a critically important tension-increaser, because of the 
"almost-there" feeling which it induces. It would be extremely unsatisfac-
tory to leave off there! From there on. it is almost predictable how things 
must go. But you wouldn't want a piece of music to quit on you just when it 
had made the mode of resolution apparent. You don't want to imagine the 
ending-you want to hear the ending. Likewise here, we have to carry 
things through. Line 55 is inevitable. and sets up all the final tensions. 
which are resolved by Line 56. 
This is typical of the structure not only of formal derivations. but also 
of informal proofs. The mathematician's sense of tension is intimately 
related to his sense of beauty, and is what makes mathematics worthwhile 
doing. Notice. however. that in TNT itself, there seems to be no reflection 
of these tensions. In other words. TNT doesn't formalize the notions of 
tension and resolution. goal and subgoal, "naturalness" and "inevitability", 
any more than a piece of music is a book about harmony and rhythm. 
Could one devise a much fancier typographical system which is aware of the 
tensions and goals inside derivations? 
Typographical Number Theory 
227 

Formal Reasoning vs. Informal Reasoning 
I would have preferred to show how to derive Euclid's Theorem (the 
infinitude of primes) in TNT, but it would probably have doubled the 
length of the book. Now after this theorem, the natural direction to go 
would be to prove the associativity of addition, the commutativity and 
associativity of multiplication, and the distributivity of multiplication over 
addition. These would give a powerful base to work from. 
As it is now formulated, TNT has reached "critical mass" (perhaps a 
strange metaphor to apply to something called "TNT"). It is of the same 
strength as the system of Principia Mathematica; in TNT one can now prove 
every theorem which you would find in a standard treatise on number 
theory. Of course, no one would claim that deriving theorems in TNT is 
the best way to do number theory. Anybody who felt that way would fall in 
the same class of people as those who think that the best way to know what 
1000 x 1000 is, is to draw a 1000 by 1000 grid, and count all the squares in 
it ... No; after total formalization, the only way to go is towards relaxation 
of the formal system. Otherwise, it is so enormously unwieldy as to be, for 
all practical purposes, useless. Thus, it is important to embed TNT within a 
wider context, a context which enables new rules of inference to be derived, 
so that derivations can be speeded up. This would require formalization of 
the language in which rules of inference are expressed-that is, the 
metalanguage. And one could go considerably further. However, none of 
these speeding-up tricks would make TNT any more powerful; they would 
simply make it more usable. The simple fact is that we have put into TNT 
every mode of thought that number theorists rely on. Embedding it in ever 
larger contexts will not enlarge the space of theorems; it will just make 
working in TNT-or in each "new, improved version"-look more like 
doing conventional number theory. 
Number Theorists Go out of Business 
Suppose that you didn't have advance knowledge that TNT will turn out to 
be incomplete, but rather, expected that it is complete-that is, that every 
true statement expressible in the TNT-notation is a theorem. In that case, 
you could make a decision procedure for all of number theory. The 
method would be easy: if you want to know if N-statement X is true or 
false, code it into TNT-sentence x. Now if X is true, completeness says that 
x is a theorem; and conversely, if not-X is true, then completeness says that 
- x is a theorem. So either x or - x must be a theorem, since either X or 
not-X is true. Now begin systematically enumerating all the theorems of 
TNT, in the way we did for the MIU-system and pq-system. You must 
come to x or - x after a while; and whichever one you hit tells you which of 
X and not-X is true. (Did you follow this argument? It crucially depends on 
your being able to hold separate in your mind the formal system TNT and 
its informal counterpart N. Make sure you understand it.) Thus, in princi-
228 
Typographical Number Theory 

pIe, if TNT were complete, number theorists would be put out of businesf>: 
any question in their field could be resolved, with sufficient time, in a 
purely mechanical way. As it turns out, this is impossible, which, depending 
on your point of view, is a cause either for rejoicing, or for mourning. 
Hilbert's Program 
The final question which we will take up in this Chapter is whether we 
should have as much faith in the consistency of TNT as we did in the 
consistency of the Propositional Calculus; and, if we don't, whether it is 
possible to increase our faith in TNT, by proving it to be consistent. One 
could make the same opening statement on the "obviousness" of TNT's 
consistency as Imprudence did in regard to the Propositional Calculus-
namely, that each rule embodies a reasoning principle which we fully 
believe in, and therefore to question the consistency of TNT is to question 
our own sanity. To some extent, this argument still carries weight-but not 
quite so much weight as before. There are just too many rules of inference, 
and some of them just might be slightly "off". Furthermore, how do we 
know that this mental model we have of some abstract entities called 
"natural numbers" is actually a coherent construct? Perhaps our own 
thought processes, those informal processes which we have tried to capture 
in the formal rules of the system, are themselves inconsistent! It is of course 
not the kind of thing we expect, but it gets more and more conceivable that 
our thoughts might lead us astray, the more complex the subject matter 
gets-and natural numbers are by no means a trivial subject matter. So 
Prudence's cry for a proof of consistency has to be taken more seriously in 
this case. It's not that we seriously doubt that TNT could be inconsistent-
but there is a little doubt, a flicker, a glimmer of a doubt in our minds, and a 
proof would help to dispel that doubt. 
But what means of proof would we like to see used? Once again, we are 
faced with the recurrent question of circularity. If we use all the same 
equipment in a proof about our system as we have inserted into it, what will 
we have accomplished? If we could manage to convince ourselves of the 
consistency of TNT, but by using a weaker system of reasoning than TNT, 
we will have beaten the circularity objection! Think of the way a heavy rope 
is passed between ships (or so I read when I was a kid): first a light arrow is 
fired across the gap, pulling behind it a thin rope. Once a connection has 
been established between the two ships this way, then the heavy rope can be 
pulled across the gap. If we can use a "light" system to show that a "heavy" 
system is consistent, then we shall have really accomplished something. 
Now on first sight one might think there is a thin rope. Our goal is to 
prove that TNT has a certain typographical property (consistency): that no 
theorems of the form x and - x ever occur. This is similar to trying to show 
that MU is not a theorem of the MIU-system. Both are statements about 
typographical properties of symbol-manipulation systems. The visions of a 
thin rope are based on the presumption thatfacts about number theory won't be 
Typographical Number Theory 
229 

needed in proving that such a typographical property holds. In other words, 
if properties of integers are not used-or if only a few extremely simple 
ones are used-then we could achieve the goal of proving TNT consistent, 
by using means which are weaker than its own internal modes of reasoning. 
This is the hope which was held by an important school of mathemati-
cians and logicians in the early part of this century, led by David Hilbert. 
The goal was to prove the consistency of formalizations of number theory 
similar to TNT by employing a very restricted set of principles of reasoning 
called "finitistic" methods of reasoning. These would be the thin rope. 
Included among finitistic methods are all of propositional reasoning, as 
embodied in the Propositional Calculus, and additionally some kinds of 
numerical reasoning. But Coders work showed that any effort to pull the 
heavy rope of TNT's consistency across the gap by using the thin rope of 
finitistic methods is doomed to failure. Codel showed that in order to pull 
the heavy rope across the gap, you can't use a lighter rope; there just isn't a 
strong enough one. Less metaphorically, we can say: Any system that is strong 
enough to prove TNT's consistency is at least as strong as TNT itself. And so 
circularity is inevitable.

The Tortoise and Achilles have just been to hear a lecture on the origins of 
the Genetic Code, and are now drinking some tea at Achilles' home. 
Achilles: 
I have something terrible to confess, Mr. T. 
Tortoise: 
What is it, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Despite the fascinating subject matter of that lecture, I drifted off 
to sleep a time or two. But in my drowsy state, I still was semi-aware of 
the words coming into my ears. One strange image that floated up 
from my lower levels was that 'A' and 'T', instead of standing for 
"adenine" and "thymine", stood for my name and yours-and that 
double-strands of DNA had tiny copies of me and you along their 
backbones, always paired up, just as adenine and thymine always are. 
Isn't that a strange symbolic image? 
Tortoise: 
Phooey! Who believes in that silly kind of stuff? Anyway, what 
about 'C' and 'G'? 
Achilles: 
Well, I suppose 'C' could stand for Mr. Crab, instead of for 
cytosine. I'm not sure about 'G', but I'm sure one could think of 
something. Anyway, it was amusing to imagine my DNA being filled 
with minuscule copies of you-as well as tiny copies of myself, for that 
matter. Just think of the infinite regress THAT leads to! 
Tortoise: 
I can see you were not paying too much attention to the lecture. 
Achilles: 
No, you're wrong. I was doing my best, only I had a hard time 
keeping fancy separated from fact. After all, it is such a strange 
netherworld that those molecular biologists are exploring. 
Tortoise: 
How do you mean? 
Achilles: 
Molecular biology is filled with peculiar convoluted loops which I 
can't quite understand, such as the way that folded proteins, which are 
coded fo!' in DNA, can loop back and manipulate the DNA which they 
came from, possibly even destroying it. Such strange loops always 
confuse the daylights out of me. They're eerie, in a way. 
Tortoise: 
I find them quite appealing. 
Achilles: 
You would, of course-they're just down your alley. But as for 
me, sometimes I like to retreat from all this analytic thought and just 
meditate a little, as an antidote. It clears my mind of all those confusing 
loops and incredible complexities which we were hearing about to-
night. 
Tortoise: 
Fancy that. I wouldn't have guessed that you were a meditator. 
Achilles: 
Did I never tell you that I am studying Zen Buddhism? 
Tortoise: 
Heavens, how did you come upon that? 
Achilles: 
I have always had a yen for the yin and yang, you know--the 
A Mu Offering 
231 

whole Oriental mysticism trip, with the I Ching, gurus, and whatnot. So 
one day I'm thinking to myself, "Why not Zen too?" And that's how it 
all began. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, splendid. Then perhaps I can finally become enlightened. 
Achilles: 
Whoa, now. Enlightenment is not the first step on the road to 
Zen; if anything, it's the last one! Enlightenment is not for novices like 
you, Mr. T! 
Tortoise: 
I see we have had a misunderstanding. By "enlightenment", I 
hardly meant something so weighty as is meant in Zen. All I meant is 
that I can perhaps become enlightened as to what Zen is all about. 
Achilles: 
For Pete's sake, why didn't you say so? Well, I'd be only too happy 
to tell you what I know of Zen. Perhaps you might even be tempted to 
become a student of it, like me. 
Tortoise: 
Well, nothing's impossible. 
Achilles: 
You could study with me under my master, Okanisama-the 
seventh patriarch. 
Tortoise: 
Now what in the world does that mean? 
Achilles: 
You have to know the hi!'otory of Zen to understand that. 
Tortoise: 
Would you tell me a little of the history of Zen, then? 
Achilles: 
An excellent idea. Zen is a kind of Buddhism which was founded 
by a monk named Bodhidharma, who left India and went to China 
around the sixth century. Bodhidharma was the first patriarch. The 
sixth one was Eno. (I've finally got it straight now!) 
Tortoise: 
The sixth patriarch was Zeno, eh? I find it strange that he, of all 
people, would get mixed up in this business. 
Achilles: 
I daresay you underestimate the value of Zen. Listen just a little 
more, and maybe you'll come to appreciate it. As I was saying, about 
five hundred years later, Zen was brought to Japan, and it took hold 
very well there. Since that time it has been one of the principal reli-
gions in Japan. 
Tortoise: 
Who is this Okanisama, the "seventh patriarch"? 
Achilles: 
He is my master, and his teachings descend directly from those of 
the sixth patriarch. He has taught me that reality is one, immutable, 
and unchanging; all plurality, change, and motion are mere illusions 
of the senses. 
Tortoise: 
Sure enough, that's Zeno, a mile away. But however did he come 
to be tangled up in Zen? Poor fellow! 
Achilles: 
Whaaat? I wouldn't put it that way. If ANYONE is tangled up, it's 
... But that's another matter. Anyway, I don't know the answer to 
your question. Instead, let me tell you something of the teachings of 
my master. I have learned that in Zen, one seeks enlightenment, or 
SATORI-the state of "No-mind". In this state, one does not think about 
the world-one just IS. I have also learned that a student of Zen is not 
supposed to "attach" to any object or thought or person-which is to 
say, he must not believe in, or depend on, any absolute-not even this 
philosophy of nonattachment. 
232 
A M u Offering 

Tortoise: 
Hmm ... Now THERE'S something I could like about Zen. 
Achilles: 
I had a hunch you'd get attached to it. 
Tortoise: 
But tell me: if Zen rejects intellectual activity, does it make sense 
to intellectualize about Zen, to study it rigorously? 
Achilles: 
That matter has troubled me quite a bit. But I think I have finally 
worked out an answer. It seems to me that you may begin approaching 
Zen through any path you know-even if it is completely antithetical to 
Zen. As you approach it, you gradually learn to stray from that path. 
The more you stray from the path, the closer you get to Zen. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, it all begins to sound so clear now. 
Achilles: 
My favorite path to Zen is through the short, fascinating, and 
weird Zen parables called "koans". 
Tortoise: 
What is a koan? 
Achilles: 
A koan is a story about Zen masters and their students. Some-
times it is like a riddle; other times like a fable; and other times like 
nothing you've ever heard before. 
Tortoise: 
Sounds rather intriguing. Would you say that to read and enjoy 
koans is to practice Zen? 
Achilles: 
I doubt it. However, in my opinion, a delight in koans comes a 
million times closer to real Zen than reading volume after volume 
about Zen, written in heavy philosophical jargon. 
Tortoise: 
I would like to hear a koan or two. 
Achilles: 
And I would like to tell you one-or a few. Perhaps I should 
begin with the most famous one of all. Many centuries ago, there was a 
Zen master named Joshii, who lived to be 119 years old. 
Tortoise: 
A mere youngster! 
Achilles: 
By your standards, yes. Now one day while Joshii and another 
monk were standing together in the monastery, a dog wandered by. 
The monk asked Joshii, "Does a dog have Buddha-nature, or not?" 
Tortoise: 
Whatever that is. So tell me-what did Joshii reply? 
Achilles: 
'MU'. 
Tortoise: 
'MU'? What is this 'MU'? What about the dog? What about 
Buddha-nature? What's the answer? 
Achilles: 
Oh, but 'MU' is Joshii's answer. By saying 'MU', Joshii let the 
other monk know that only by not asking such questions can one know 
the answer to them. 
Tortoise: 
Joshii "unasked" the question. 
Achilles: 
Exactly! 
Tortoise: 
'MU' sounds like a handy thing to have around. I'd like to unask 
a question or two, sometimes. I guess I'm beginning to get the hang of 
Zen. Do you know any other koans, Achilles? I would like to hear some 
more. 
Achilles: 
My pleasure. I can tell you a pair of koans which go together. 
Only ... 
Tortoise: 
What's the matter? 
A Mu Offering 
233 

Achilles: 
Well, there is one problem. Although both are widely told koans, 
my master has cautioned me that only one of them is genuine. And 
what is more, he does not know which one is genuine, and which one is 
a fraud. 
Tortoise: 
Crazy! Why don't you tell them both to me and we can speculate 
to our hearts' content! 
Achilles: 
All right. One of the alleged koans goes like this: 
A monk asked Baso: "What is Buddha?" 
Baso said: "This mind is Buddha." 
Tortoise: 
Hmm ... "This mind is Buddha"? Sometimes I don't quite 
understand what these Zen people are getting at. 
Achilles: 
You might prefer the other alleged koan then. 
Tortoise: 
How does it run? 
Achilles: 
Like this: 
A monk asked Baso: "What is Buddha?" 
Baso said: "This mind is not Buddha." 
Tortoise: 
My, my! If my shell isn't green and not green! I like that! 
Achilles: 
Now, Mr. T -you're not supposed to just "like" koans. 
Tortoise: 
Very well, then-I don't like it. 
Achilles: 
That's better. Now as I was saying, my master believes only one of 
the two is genuine. 
Tortoise: 
I can't imagine what led him to such a belief. But anyway, I 
suppose it's all academic, since there's no way to know if a koan is 
genuine or phony. 
Achilles: 
Oh, but there you are mistaken. My master has shown us how to 
do it. 
Tortoise: 
Is that so? A decision procedure for genuineness of koans? I 
should very much like to hear ahout THAT. 
Achilles: It is a fairly complex ritual, involving two stages. In the first stage, 
you must TRANSLATE the koan in question into a piece of string, folded 
all around in three dimensions. 
Tortoise: 
That's a curious thing to do. And what is the second stage? 
Achilles: 
Oh, that's easy-all you need to do is determine whether the 
string has Buddha-nature, or not! If it does, then the koan is 
genuine-if not, the koan is a fraud. 
Tortoise: 
Hmm ... It sounds as if all you've done is transfer the need for a 
decision procedure to another domain. Now it's a decision procedure 
for Buddha-nature that you need. What next? After all, if you can't 
even tell whether a DOG has Buddha-nature or not, how can you expect 
to do so for every possible folded string? 
Achilles: 
Well, my master explained to me that shifting between domains 
can help. It's like switching your point of view. Things sometimes look 
complicated from one angle, but simple from another. He gave the 
example of an orchard, in which from one direction no order is 
234 
A M u Offering 

FIGURE 45. La Mezquita, by M. C. Escher (bln,ck and white chalk, 1936). 
apparent, but from special angles, beautiful regularity emerges. 
You've reordered the same information by changing your way of 
looking at it. 
Tortoise: 
I see. So perhaps the genuineness of a koan is concealed some-
how very deeply inside it, but if you translate it into a string it manages 
in some way to float to the surface? 
Achilles: 
That's what my master has discovered. 
Tortoise: 
Then I would very much like to learn about the technique. But 
first, tell me: how can you turn a koan (a sequence of words) into a 
folded string (a three-dimensional object)? They are rather different 
kinds of entities. 
Achilles: 
That is one of the most mysterious things I have learned in Zen. 
There are two steps: "transcription" and "translation". TRANSCRIBING 
a koan involves writing it in a phonetic alphabet, which contains only 
four geometric symbols. This phonetic rendition of the koan is called 
the MESSENGER. 
Tortoise: 
What do the geometric symbols look like? 
Achilles: 
They are made of hexagons and pentagons. Here is what they 
A M u Offering 
235 

look like (picks up a nearby napkin, and draws for the Tortoise these four 
figures): oococo 
Tortoise: 
They are mysterious-looking. 
Achilles: 
Only to the uninitiated. Now once you have made the messenger, 
you rub your hands in some ribo, and-
Tortoise: 
Some ribo? Is that a kind of ritual anointment? 
Achilles: 
Not exactly. It is a special sticky preparation which makes the 
string hold its shape, when folded up. 
Tortoise: 
What is it made of? 
Achilles: 
I don't know, exactly. But it feels sort of gluey, and it works 
exceedingly well. Anyway, once you have some ribo on your hands, 
you can TRANSLATE the sequence of symbols in the messenger into 
certain kinds of folds in the string. It's as simple as that. 
Tortoise: 
Hold on! Not so fast! How do you do that? 
Achilles: 
You begin with the string entirely straight. Then you go to one 
end and start making folds of various types, according to the geometric 
symbols in the messenger. 
I 
Tortoise: 
So each of those geometric symbols stands for a different way to 
curl the string up? 
Achilles: 
Not in isolation. You take them three at a time, instead of one at a 
time. You begin at one end of the string, and one end of the mes-
senger. What to do with the first inch of the string is determined by the 
first three geometric symbols. The next three symbols tell you how to 
fold the second inch of string. And so you inch your way along the 
string and simultaneously along the messenger, folding each little 
segment of string until you have exhausted the messenger. If you have 
properly applied some ribo, the string will keep its folded shape, and 
what you thereby produce is the translation of the koan into a string. 
Tortoise: 
The procedure has a certain elegance to it. You must get some 
wild-looking strings that way. 
Achilles: 
That's for sure. The longer koans translate into quite bizarre 
shapes. 
Tortoise: 
I can imagine. But in order to carry out the translation of the 
messenger into the string, you need to know what kind of fold each 
triplet of geometric symbols in the messenger stands for. How do you 
know this? Do you have a dictionary? 
Achilles: Yes-there is a venerated book which lists the "Geometric Code". 
236 
If you don't have a copy of this book, of course, you can't translate a 
koan into a string. 
A M u Offering 

Tortoise: 
Evidently not. What is the origin of the Geometric Code? 
Achilles: 
It came from an ancient master known as "Great Tutor" who my 
master says is the only one ever to attain the Enlightenment 'Yond 
Enlightenment. 
Tortoise: 
Good gravy! As if one level of the stuff weren't enough. But then 
there are gluttons of every sort-why not gluttons for enlightenment? 
Achilles: 
Do you suppose that "Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment" 
stands for "EYE"? 
Tortoise: 
In my opinion, it's rather doubtful that it stands for you, Achilles. 
More likely, it stands for "Meta-Enlightenment"-"ME", that is. 
Achilles: 
For you? Why would it stand for you? You haven't even reached 
the FIRST stage of enlightenment, let alone the-
Tortoise: 
You never know, Achilles. Perhaps those who have learned the 
lowdown on enlightenment return to their state before enlightenment. 
I've always held that "twice enlightened is unenlightened." But let's get 
back to the Grand Tortue-uh, I mean the Great Tutor. 
Achilles: 
Little is known of him, except that he also invented the Art of Zen 
Strings. 
Tortoise: 
What is that? 
Achilles: 
It is an art on which the decision procedure for Buddha-nature is 
based. I shall tell you about it. 
Tortoise: 
I would be fascinated. There is so much for novices like me to 
absorb! 
Achilles: There is even reputed to be a koan which tells how the Art of Zen 
Strings began. But unfortunately, all this has long since been lost in the 
sands of time, and is no doubt gone forever. Which may be just as well, 
for otherwise there would be imitators who would take on the master's 
name, and copy him in other ways. 
Tortoise: 
But wouldn't it be a good thing if all students of Zen copied that 
most enlightened master of all, the Great Tutor? 
Achilles: 
Let me tell you a koan about an imitator. 
Zen master Gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a question 
about Zen. A young novice began to imitate him in this way. When Gutei 
was told about the novice's imitation, he sent for him and asked him if it 
were true. The novice admitted it was so. Cutei asked him if he under-
stood. In reply the novice held up his index finger. Gutei promptly cut it 
off. The novice ran from the room, howling in pain. As he reached the 
threshold, Cutei called, "Boy!" When the novice turned, Cutei raised his 
index finger. At that instant the novice was enlightened. 
Tortoise: 
Well, what do you know! Just when I thought Zen was all about 
Joshu and his shenanigans, now I find out that Gutei is in on the 
merriment too. He seems to have quite a sense of humor. 
Achilles: 
That koan is very serious. I don't know how you got the idea that 
it is humorous. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps Zen is instructive because it is humorous. I would guess 
A Mu Offering 
237 

that if you took all such stories entirely seriously, you would miss the 
point as often as you would get it. 
Achilles: 
Maybe there's something to your Tortoise-Zen. 
Tortoise: 
Can you answer just one question for me? I would like to know 
this: Why did Bodhidharma come from India into China? 
Achilles: 
Oho! Shall I tell you whatJoshii said when he was asked that very 
question? 
Tortoise: 
Please do. 
Achilles: 
He replied, "That oak tree in the garden." 
Tortoise: 
Of course; that's just what I would have said. Except that I would 
have said it in answer to a different question-namely, "Where can I 
find some shade from the midday sun?" 
Achilles: 
Without knowing it, you have inadvertently hit upon one of the 
basic questions of all Zen. That question, innocent though it sounds, 
actually means, "What is the basic principle of Zen?" 
Tortoise: 
How extraordinary. I hadn't the slightest idea that the central 
aim of Zen was to find some shade. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no-you've misunderstood me entirely. I wasn't referring to 
THAT question. I meant your question about why Bodhidharma came 
from India into China. 
Tortoise: 
I see. Well, I had no idea that I was getting into such deep waters. 
But let's come back to this curious mapping. I gather that any koan can 
be turned into a folded string by following the method you outlined. 
Now what about the reverse process? Can any folded string be read in 
such a way as to yield a koan? 
Achilles: 
Well, in a way. However ... 
Tortoise: 
What's wrong? 
Achilles: 
You're just not supposed to do it that way 'round. It would violate 
the Central Dogma of Zen strings, you see, which is contained in this 
picture (picks up a napkin and draws): 
koan

You're not supposed to go against the arrows-especially not the 
second one. 
Tortoise: 
Tell me, does this Dogma have Buddha-nature, or not? Come to 
think of it, I think I'll unask the question. Is that all right? 
Achilles: 
I am glad you unasked the question. But-I'll let you in on a 
secret. Promise you won't tell anyone? 
Tortoise: 
Tortoise's honor. 
Achilles: 
Well, once in a while, I actually do go against the arrows. I get 
sort of an illicit thrill out of it, I guess. 
Tortoise: 
Why, Achilles! I had no idea you would do something so irrever-
ent! 
Achilles: 
I've never confessed it to anyone before-not even Okanisama. 
238 
A Mu Offering 

Tortoise: 
So tell me, what happens when you go against the arrows in the 
Central Dogma? Does that mean you begin with a string and make a 
koan? 
Achilles: 
Sometimes-but some weirder things can happen. 
Tortoise: 
Weirder than producing koans? 
Achilles: 
Yes ... When you untranslate and untranscribe, you get SOME-
THING, but not always a koan. Some strings, when read out loud this 
way, only give nonsense. 
Tortoise: 
Isn't that just another name for koans? 
Achilles: 
You clearly don't have the true spirit of Zen yet. 
Tortoise: 
Do you always get stories, at least? 
Achilles: 
Not always-sometimes you get nonsense syllables, other times 
you get ungrammatical sentences. But once in a while you get what 
seems to be a koan. 
. 
Tortoise: 
It only SEEMS to be one? 
Achilles: 
Well, it might be fraudulent, you see. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, of course. 
Achilles: 
I call those strings which yield apparent koans "well-formed" 
strings. 
Tortoise: 
Why don't you tell me about the decision procedure which allows 
you to distinguish phony koans from the genuine article? 
Achilles: 
That's what I was heading towards. Given the koan, or non-koan, 
as the case may be, the first thing is to translate it into the three-
dimensional string. All that's left is to find out if the string has 
Buddha-nature or not. 
Tortoise: 
But how do you do THAT? 
Achilles: 
Well, my master has said that the Great Tutor was able, by just 
glancing at a string, to tell if it had Buddha-nature or not. 
Tortoise: 
But what if you have not reached the stage of the Enlightenment 
'Yond Enlightenment? Is there no other way to tell if a string has 
Buddha-nature? 
Achilles: 
Yes, there is. And this is where the Art of Zen Strings comes in. It 
is a technique for making innumerably many strings, all of which have 
Buddha-nature. 
Tortoise: 
You don't say! And is there a corresponding way of making 
strings which DON'T have Buddha-nature? 
Achilles: 
Why would you want to do that? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, I just thought it might be useful. 
Achilles: 
You have the strangest taste. Imagine! Being more interested in 
things that DON'T have Buddha-nature than things that DO! 
Tortoise: Just chalk it up to my unenlightened state. But go on. Tell me 
how to make a string which DOES have Buddha-nature. 
Achilles: 
Well, you must begin by draping a loop of string over your hands 
in one of five legal starting positions, such as this one ... (Picks up a 
string and drapes it in a simple loop between a finger on each hand.) 
A Mu Offering 
239 

Tortoise: 
What are the other four legal starting positions? 
Achilles: 
Each one is a position considered to be a SELF-EVIDENT manner 
of picking up a string. Even novices often pick up strings in those 
positions. And these five strings all have Buddha-nature. 
Tortoise: 
Of course. 
Achilles: Then there are some String Manipulation Rules, by which you 
can make more complex string figures. In particular, you are allowed 
to modify your string by doing certain basic motions of the hands. For 
instance, you can reach across like this-and pull like this-and twist 
like this. With each operation you are changing the overall configura-
tion of the string draped over your hands. 
Tortoise: 
Why, it looks just like making cat's-cradles and such string 
figures! 
Achilles: 
That's right. Now as you watch, you'll see that some of these rules 
make the string more complex; some simplify it. But whichever way 
you go, as long as you follow the String Manipulation Rules, every 
string you produce will have Buddha-nature. 
Tortoise: 
That is truly marvelous. Now what about the koan concealed 
inside this string you've just made? Would it be genuine? 
Achilles: 
Why, according to what I've learned, it must. Since I made it 
according to the Rules, and began in one of the five self-evident 
positions, the string must have Buddha-nature, and consequently it 
must correspond to a genuine koan. 
Tortoise: 
Do you know what the koan is? 
Achilles: 
Are you asking me to vIolate the Central Dogma? Oh, you 
naughty fellow! 
(And with furrowed brow and code book in hand, Achilles points along the 
string inch by inch, recording each fold by a triplet of geometric symbols of 
the strange phonetic alphabet for Mans, until he has nearly a napkinful.) 
Done! 
Tortoise: 
Terrific. Now let's hear it. 
All right. 
Achilles: 
A traveling monk asked an old woman the road to Taizan, a popular 
temple supposed to give wisdom to the one who worships there. The old 
woman said: "Go straight ahead." After the monk had proceeded a few 
steps, she said to herself, "He also is a common church-goer." Someone 
told this incident to Joshii, who said: "Wait until I investigate." The next 
day he went and asked the same question, and the old woman gave the 
same answer. Joshii remarked: "I have investigated that old woman." 
Tortoise: 
Why, with his flair for investigations, it's a shame that Joshii 
never was hired by the FBI. Now tell me-what you did, I could also 
do, if I followed the Rules from the Art of Zen Strings, right? 
Achilles: 
Right. 
Tortoise: 
Now would I have to perform the operations in just the same 
ORDER as you did? 
240 
A Mu Offering 

Achilles: 
No, any old order will do. 
Tortoise: 
Of course, then I would get a different string, and consequently 
a different koan. Now would I have to perform the same NUMBER of 
steps as you did? 
Achilles: 
By no means. Any number of steps is fine. 
Tortoise: 
Well, then there are an infinite number of strings with Buddha-
nature-and consequently an infinite number of genuine koans! How 
do you know there is any string which CAN'T be made by your Rules? 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes-back to things which lack Buddha-nature. It just so 
happens that once you know how to make strings WITH Buddha-
nature, you can also make strings WITHOUT Buddha-nature. That is 
something which my master drilled into me right at the beginning. 
Tortoise: 
Wonderful! How does it work? 
Achilles: 
Easy. Here, for example-I'll make a string which lacks 
Buddha-nature ... 
(He picks up the string out of which the preceding Man was "pulled", and 
ties a little teeny knot at one end of it, pulling it tight with his thumb and 
forefinger.) 
This is it-no Buddha-nature here. 
Tortoise: 
Very illuminating. All it takes is adding a knot? How do you 
know that the new string lacks Buddha-nature? 
Achilles: 
Because of this fundamental property of Buddha-nature: when 
two well-formed strings are identical but for a knot at one end, then 
only ONE of them can have Buddha-nature. It's a rule of thumb which 
my master taught me. 
Tortoise: 
I'm just wondering about something. Are there some strings with 
Buddha-nature which you CAN'T reach by following the Rules of Zen 
Strings, no matter in what order? 
Achilles: 
I hate to admit it, but I am a little confused on this point myself. 
At first my master gave the strongest impression that Buddha-nature 
in a string was DEFINED by starting in one of the five legal starting 
positions, and then developing the string according to the allowed 
Rules. But then later, he said something about somebody-or-other's 
"Theorem". I never got it straight. Maybe I even misheard what he 
said. But whatever he said, it put some doubt in my mind as to whether 
this method hits ALL strings with Buddha-nature. To the best of my 
knowledge, at least, it does. But Buddha-nature is a pretty elusive 
thing, you know. 
Tortoise: 
I gathered as much, from Joshu's 'MU'. I wonder ... 
Achilles: 
What is it? 
Tortoise: 
I was just wondering about those two koans-I mean the koan 
and its un-koan-the ones which say "This mind is Buddha" and "This 
mind is not Buddha"-what do they look like, when turned into strings 
via the Geometric Code? 
Achilles: 
I'd be glad to show you.

(He writes down the phonetic transcriptions, and then pulls from his pocket 
a couple of pieces of string, which he carefully folds inch by inch,following 
the triplets of symbols written in the strange alphabet. Then he places the 
finished strings side by side.) 
You see, here is the difference. 
Tortoise: 
They are very similar, indeed. Why, I do believe there is only one 
difference between them: it's that one of them has a little knot on its 
end! 
Achilles: 
By Josh", you're right. 
Tortoise: 
Aha! Now I understand why your master is suspicious. 
You do? 
Achilles: 
Tortoise: 
According to your rule of thumb, AT MOST ONE of such a pair can 
have Buddha-nature, so you know right away that one of the koans 
must be phony. 
Achilles: 
But that doesn't tell which one is phony. I've worked, and so has 
my master, at trying to produce these two strings by following the 
String Manipulation Rules, but to no avail. Neither one ever turns up. 
It's quite frustrating. Sometimes you begin to wonder ... 
Tortoise: 
You mean, to wonder if either one has Buddha-nature? Perhaps 
neither of them has Buddha-nature-and neither koan is genuine! 
Achilles: 
I never carried my thoughts as far as that-but you're right-it's 
possible, I guess. But I think you should not ask so many questions 
about Buddha-nature. The Zen master Mumon always warned his 
pupils of the danger of too many questions. 
Tortoise: 
All right-no more questions. Instead, I have a sort of hankering 
to make a string myself. It would be amusing to see if what I come up 
with is well-formed or not. 
Achilles: 
That could be interesting. Here's a piece of string. (He passes one 
to the Tortoise.) 
Tortoise: 
Now you realize that I don't have the slightest idea what to do. 
We'll just have to take potluck with my awkward production, which will 
follow no rules and will probably wind up being completely unde-
cipherable. (Grasps the loop between his feet and, with a few simple manipula-
tions, creates a complex string which he prriffers wordlessly to Achilles. At that 
moment, Achilles' face lights up.) 
Achilles: Jeepers creepers! I'll have to tryout your method myself. I have 
never seen a string like this! 
Tortoise: 
I hope it is well-formed. 
Achilles: 
I see it's got a knot at one end. 
Tortoise: 
Oh-just a moment! May I have it back? I want to do one thing to 
it. 
Achilles: 
Why, certainly. Here you are. 
242 
(Hands it back to the Tortoise, who ties another knot at the same end. Then 
the Tortoise gives a sharp tug, and suddenly both knots disappear!) 
A Mu Offering 

Achilles: 
What happened? 
Tortoise: 
I wanted to get rid of that knot. 
Achilles: 
But instead of untying it, you tied another one, and then BOTH 
disappeared! Where did they go? 
Tortoise: 
Tumbolia, of course. That's the Law of Double Nodulation. 
(Suddenly, the two knots reappear from out if nowhere-that is to say, 
Tumbolia.) 
Achilles: 
Amazing. They must lie in a fairly accessible layer of Tumbolia if 
_ they can pop into it and out of it so easily. Or is all of Tumbolia equally 
inaccessible? 
Tortoise: 
I couldn't say. However, it does occur to me that burning the 
string would make it quite improbable for the knots to come back. In 
such a case, you could think of them as being trapped in a deeper layer 
of Tumbolia. Perhaps there are layers and layers of Tumbolia. But 
that's neither here nor there. What I would like to know is how my 
string sounds, if you turn it back into phonetic symbols. (As he hands it 
back, once again, the knots pop into oblivion.) 
Achilles: 
I always feel so guilty about violating the Central Dogma ... 
(Takes out his pen and code book, and carefully jots down the many symbol-
triplets which correspond to the curvy involutions of the Tortoise's string; and 
when he is finished, he clears his voice.) Ahem. Are you ready to hear what 
you have wrought? 
Tortoise: 
I'm willing if you're willing. 
Achilles: 
All right. It goes like this: 
A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one 
who had ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by 
asking whether various objects had Buddha-nature or not. To such ques-
tions Tortue invariably sat silent. The monk had already asked about a 
bean, a lake, and a moonlit night. One day, he brought to Tortue a piece 
of string, and asked the same question. In reply, the Grand Tortue 
grasped the loop between his feet and-
Tortoise: 
Between his feet? How odd! 
Achilles: 
Why should YOU find that odd? 
Tortoise: 
Well, ah ... you've got a point there. But please go on! 
Achilles: 
All right. 
The Grand Tortue grasped the loop between his feet and, with a few 
simple manipulations, created a complex string which he proffered 
wordlessly to the monk. At that moment, the monk was enlightened. 
Tortoise: 
I'd rather be twice-enlightened, personally. 
Achilles: 
Then it tells how to make the Grand Tortue's string, if you begin 
with a string draped over your feet. I'll skip those boring details. It 
concludes this way: 
From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue. Instead, he made string 
after string by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own 
disciples, who passed it on to theirs. 
A Mu Offering 
243 

Tortoise: 
Quite a yarn. It's hard to believe it was really hidden inside my 
string. 
Achilles: 
Yet it was. Astonishingly, you seem to have created a well-formed 
string right off the bat. 
Tortoise: 
But what did the Grand Tortue's string look like? That's the 
main point of this koan, I'd suppose. 
Achilles: 
I doubt it. One shouldn't "attach" to small details like that inside 
koans. It's the spirit of the whole koan that counts, not little parts of it. 
Say, do you know what I just realized? I think, crazy though it sounds, 
that you may have hit upon that long-lost koan which describes the 
very origin of the Art of Zen Strings! 
Tortoise: 
Oh, that would almost be too good to have Buddha-nature. 
Achilles: 
But that means that the great master-the only one who ever 
reached the mystical state of the Enlightenment 'Yond 
Enlightenment-was named 'Tortue", not "Tutor". What a droll 
name! 
Tortoise: 
I don't agree. I think it's a handsome name. I still want to know 
how Tortue's string looked. Can you possibly recreate it from the 
description given in the koan? 
Achilles: 
I could try ... Of course, I'll have to use my feet, too, since it's 
described in terms of foot motions. That's pretty unusual. But I think I 
can manage it. Let me give it a go. (He picks up the koan and a piece of 
string, and for a few minutes twists and bends the string in arcane ways until he 
has the finished product.) Well, here it is. Odd, how familiar it looks. 
Tortoise: 
Yes, isn't that so? I wonder where I saw it before? 
Achilles: 
I know! Why, this is YOVR string, Mr. T! Or is it? 
Tortoise: 
Certainly not. 
Achilles: 
Of course not-it's the string which you first handed to me, 
before you took it back to tie an extra knot in it. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, yes-indeed it is. Fancy that. I wonder what that implies. 
Achilles: 
It's strange, to say the least. 
Tortoise: 
Do you suppose my k6an is genuine? 
Achilles: 
Wait just a moment ... 
Tortoise: 
Or that my string has Buddha-nature? 
Achilles: 
Something about your string is beginning to trouble me, Mr. 
Tortoise. 
Tortoise (looking most pleased with himself and paying no attention to 
Achilles): 
And what about Tortue's string? Does it have Buddha-
nature? There are a host of questions to ask! 
Achilles: 
I would be scared to ask such questions, Mr. T. There is some-
thing mighty funny going on here, and I'm not sure I like it. 
Tortoise: 
I'm sorry to hear it. I can't imagine what's troubling you. 
Achilles: 
Well, the best way I know to explain it is to quote the words of 
another old Zen master, Kyogen. Kyogen said: 
244 
A Mu Offering 

Zen is like a man hanging in a tree by his teeth over a precipice. His hands 
grasp no branch, his feet rest on no limb, and under the tree another 
person asks him: "Why did Bodhidharma come to China from India?" If 
the man in the tree does not answer, he fails; and if he does answer, he 
falls and loses his life. Now what shall he do? 
Tortoise: 
That's clear; he should give up Zen, and take up molecular 
biology.

CHAPTER IX 
Murnon and G6dei 
What Is Zen? 
I'M NOT SURE I know what Zen is. In a way, I think I understand it very 
well; but in a way, I also think I can never understand it at all. Ever since my 
freshman English teacher in college read J6shu's MU out loud to our class, 
I have struggled with Zen aspects of life, and probably I will never cease 
doing so. To me, Zen is intellectual quicksand-anarchy, darkness, 
meaninglessness, chaos. It is tantalizing and infuriating. And yet it is 
humorous, refreshing, enticing. Zen has its own special kind of meaning, 
brightness, and clarity. I hope that in this Chapter, I can get some of this 
cluster of reactions across to you. And then, strange though it may seem, 
that will lead us directly to Godelian matters. 
One of the basic tenets of Zen Buddhism is that there is no way to 
characterize what Zen is. No matter what verbal space you try to enclose 
Zen in, it resists, and spills over. It might seem, then, that all efforts to 
explain Zen are complete wastes of time. But that is not the attitude of Zen 
masters and students. For instance, Zen k6ans are a central part of Zen 
study, verbal though they are. K6ans are supposed to be "triggers" which, 
though they do not contain enough information in themselves to impart 
enlightenment, may possibly be sufficient to unlock the mechanisms inside 
one's mind that lead to enlightenment. But in general, the Zen attitude is 
that words and truth are incompatible, or at least that no words can capture 
truth. 
Zen Master Murnon 
Possibly in order to point this out in an extreme way, the monk Mumon 
("No-gate"), in the thirteenth century, compiled forty-eight k6ans, follow-
ing each with a commentary and a small "poem". This work is called "The 
Gateless Gate" or the M umonkan ("1'\ o-gate barrier"). I t is interesting to note 
that the lives of Mumon and Fibonacci coincided almost exactly: Mumon 
living from 1183 to 1260 in China, Fibonacci from 1180 to 1250 in Italy. To 
those who would look to the Mumonkan in hopes of making sense of, or 
"understanding", the k6ans, the Mumonkan may come as a rude shock, for 
the comments and poems are entirely as opaque as the k6ans which they 
are supposed to clarify. Take this, for example:'

FIGURE 46. Three Worlds, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, /955). 

Koan: 
Hogen of Seiryo monastery was about to lecture before dinner when he 
noticed that the bamboo screen, lowered for meditation, had not been rolled 
up. He pointed to it. Two monks arose wordlessly from the audience and 
rolled it up. Hogen, observing the physical moment, said, "The state of the 
first monk is good, not that of the second." 
Mumon's Commentary: 
I want to ask you: which of those two monks gained and which lost? If any of 
you has one eye, he will see the failure on the teacher's part. However, I am 
not discussing gain and loss. 
Mumon's Poem: 
When the screen is rolled up the great sky opens, 
Yet the sky is not attuned to Zen. 
It is best to forget the great sky 
And to retire from every wind. 
Or then again, there is this one: 2 
Koan: 
Goso said: "When a buffalo goes out of his enclosure to the edge of the abyss, 
his horns and his head and his hoof~ all pass through, but why can't the tail 
also pass?" 
Mumon's Commentary: 
If anyone can open one eye at this point and say a word of Zen, he is qualified 
to repay the four gratifications, and. not only that, he can save all sentient 
beings under him. But if he cannot say such a word of Zen, he should turn 
back to his tail. 
Mumon's Poem: 
If the buffalo runs, he will fall into the trench; 
If he returns, he will he butchered. 
That little tail 
Is a very strange thing. 
I think you will have to admit that Mumon does not exactly clear everything 
up. One might say that the metalanguage (in which Mumon writes) is not 
very different from the object language (the language of the koan). Accord-
ing to some, Mumon's comments are intentionally idiotic, perhaps meant to 
show how useless it is to spend one's time in chattering about Zen. How-
ever, Mumon's comments can be taken on more than one level. For in-
stance, consider this: 3 
Koan: 
A monk asked Nansen: "Is there a teaching no master ever taught before?" 
Nansen said: "Yes, there is." 
"What is it?" asked the monk. 
Nansen replied: "It is not mind, it is not Buddha, it is not things."

Mumon's Commentary: 
Old Nansen gave away his treasure-words. He must have been greatly upset. 
Mumon's Poem: 
Nansen was too kind and lost his treasure. 
Truly, words have no power. 
Even though the mountain becomes the sea, 
Words cannot open another's mind. 
In this poem Mumon seems to be saying something very central to Zen, and 
not making idiotic statements. Curiously, however, the poem is self-
referential, and thus it is a comment not only on Nansen's words, but also 
on its own ineffectiveness. This type of paradox is quite characteristic of 
Zen. It is an attempt to "break the mind of logic". You see this paradoxical 
quality in the k6an, as well. Concerning Mumon's commentary, do you 
think that Nansen was really so sure of his answer? Or did the "correctness" 
of his answer matter at all? Or does correctness play any role in Zen? What 
is the difference between correctness and truth, or is there any? What if 
Nansen had said, "No, there is not any such teaching"? Would it have made 
any difference? Would his remark have been immortalized in a k6an?

Another World, by M. C. Escher (wood-engraving, 1947). 
Here is another koan which aims to break the mind of logic: 4 
The student Doko came to a Zen master, and said: "I am seeking the truth. In 
what state of mind should I train my~elf, so as to find it?" 
Said the master, "There is no mind, so you cannot put it in any state. There 
is no truth, so you cannot train yourself for it." 
"If there is no mind to train, and no truth to find, why do you have these 
monks gather before you every day to study Zen and train themselves for this 
study?" 
"But I haven't an inch of room here," said the master, "so how could the 
monks gather? I have no tongue, so how could I call them together or teach 
them?" 
250 
Mumon and G6del 

"Oh, how can you lie like this?" asked Doko. 
"But if I have no tongue to talk to others, how can I lie to you?" asked the 
master. 
Then Doko said sadly, "I cannot follow you. I cannot understand you." 
"I cannot understand myself," said the master. 
If any koan serves to bewilder, this one does. And most likely, causing 
bewilderment is its precise purpose, for when one is in a bewildered state, 
one's mind does begin to operate nonlogically, to some extent. Only by 
stepping outside of logic, so the theory goes, can one make the leap to 
enlightenment. But what is so bad about logic? Why does it prevent the leap 
to enlightenment? 
Zen's Struggle Against Dualism 
To answer that, one needs to understand something about what en-
lightenment is. Perhaps the most concise summary of enlightenment would 
be: transcending dualism. Now what is dualism? Dualism is the conceptual 
division of the world into categories. Is it possible to transcend this very 
natural tendency? By prefixing the word "division" by the word "concep-
tual", I may have made it seem that this is an intellectual or conscious 
effort, and perhaps thereby given the impression that dualism could be 
overcome simply by suppressing thought (as if to suppress thinking actually 
were simple!). But the breaking of the world into categories takes place far 
below the upper strata of thought; in fact, dualism is just as much a 
perceptual division of the world into categories as it is a conceptual division. 
In other words, human perception is by nature a dualistic phenomenon-
which makes the quest for enlightenment an uphill struggle, to say the 
least. 
At the core of dualism, according to Zen, are words-just plain words. 
The use of words is inherently dualistic, since each word represents, quite 
obviously, a conceptual category. Therefore, a major part of Zen is the fight 
against reliance on words. To combat the use of words, one of the best 
devices is the koan, where words are so deeply abused that one's mind is 
practically left reeling, if one takes the koans seriously. Therefore it is 
perhaps wrong to say that the enemy of enlightenment is logic; rather, it is 
dualistic, verbal thinking. In fact, it is even more basic than that: it is 
perception. As soon as you perceive an object, you draw a line between it 
and the rest of the world; you divide the world, artificially, into parts, and 
you thereby miss the Way. 
Here is a koan which demonstrates the struggle against words: 5 
Koan: 
Shuzan held out his short staff and said: "If you call this a short staff, you 
oppose its reality. If you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact. Now 
what do you wish to call this?" 
Mumon and Godel 
251 

FIGURE 49. 
Day and Night, by M. C. Escher (woodcut, 1938). 
Mumon's Commentary: 
If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality. If you do not call it a short 
staff, you ignore the fact. It cannot be expressed with words and it cannot be 
expressed without words. Now say quickly what it is. 
Mumon's Poem: 
Holding out the short staff, 
He gave an order of life or death. 
Positive and negative interwoven, 
Even Buddhas and patria"chs cannot escape this attack. 
("Patriarchs" refers to six venerated founders of Zen Buddhism, of whom 
Bodhidharma is the first, and Eno is the sixth.) 
Why is calling it a short staff opposing its reality? Probably because 
such a categorization gives the appearance of capturing reality, whereas the 
surface has not even been scratched by such a statement. It could be 
compared to saying "5 is a prime number". There is so much more-an 
infinity of facts-that has been omitted. On the other hand, not to call it a 
staff is, indeed, to ignore that particular fact, minuscule as it may be. Thus 
words lead to some truth-some falsehood, perhaps, as well-but certainly 
not to all truth. Relying on words to lead you to the truth is like relying on 
an incomplete formal system to lead you to the truth. A formal system will 
give you some truths, but as we shall soon see, a formal system-no matter 
how powerful-cannot lead to all truths. The dilemma of mathematicians 
is: what else is there to rely on, but formal systems? And the dilemma of 
252 
Mumon and Godel 

Zen people is: what else is there to rely on, but words? Mumon states the 
dilemma very clearly: "It cannot be expressed with words and it cannot be 
expressed without words." 
Here is Nansen, once again: 6 
Joshii asked the teacher Nansen. "What is the true Way?" 
Nansen answered, "Everyday way is the true Way:' 
Joshii asked, "Can I study it?" 
Nansen answered, "The more you study, the further from the Way." 
Joshii asked, "If I don't study it, how can I know it?" 
Nansen answered, "The Way does not belong to things seen: nor to things 
unseen. It does not belong to things known: nor to things unknown. Do not 
seek it, study it, or name it. To find yourself on it, open yourself wide as the 
sky." 
[See Fig. 50.] 
FIGURE 50. 
Rind, by M. C. Escher (wood-engraving, 1955). 

This curious statement seems to abound with paradox. It is a little 
reminiscent of this surefire cure for hiccups: "Run around the house three 
times without thinking of the word 'wolf'." Zen is a philosophy which seems 
to have embraced the notion that the road to ultimate truth, like the only 
surefire cure for hiccups, may bristle with paradoxes. 
Ism, The Un-Mode, and Unmon 
If words are bad, and thinking is bad, what is good? Of course, to ask this is 
already horribly dualistic, but we art~ making no pretense of being faithful 
to Zen in discussing Zen-so we can try to answer the question seriously. I 
have a name for what Zen strives for: ism. Ism is an antiphilosophy, a way of 
being without thinking. The masters of ism are rocks, trees, clams; but it is 
the fate of higher animal species to have to strive for ism, without ever 
being able to attain it fully. Still, one is occasionally granted glimpses of ism. 
Perhaps the following koan offers such a glimpse: 7 
Hyakujo wished to send a monk to open a new monastery. He told his pupils 
that whoever answered a question most ably would be appointed. Placing a 
water vase on the ground, he asked: "Who can say what this is without calling 
its name?" 
The chief monk said: "No one can call it a wooden shoe." 
Isan, the cooking monk, tipped mer the vase with his foot and went out. 
Hyakujo smiled and said; "The chief monk loses." And Isan became the 
master of the new monastery. 
To suppress perception, to suppress logical, verbal, dualistic 
thinking-this is the essence of Zen, the essence of ism. This is the Un-
mode-not Intelligent, not Mechanical, just "Un". Joshii was in the Un-
mode, and that is why his 'MU' unasks the question. The Un-mode came 
naturally to Zen Master Unmon: 8 
One day Unmon said to his disciples, "This staff of mine has transformed 
itself into a dragon and has swallowed up the universe! Oh, where are the 
rivers and mountains and the great earth?" 
Zen is holism, carried to its logical extreme. If holism claims that things 
can only be understood as wholes, not as sums of their parts, Zen goes one 
further, in maintaining that the world cannot be broken into parts at all. To 
divide the world into parts is to be deluded, and to miss enlightenment. 
A master was asked the question, "What is the Way?" by a curious monk. 
"It is right before your eyes," said the master. 
"Why do 1 not see it for myself?" 
"Because you are thinking of yourself." 
"What about you: do you see it?" 
"So long as you see double, saying 'I don't', and 'you do', and so on, your 
eyes are clouded," said the master. 
"When there is neither 'I' nor 'You', can one see it?" 
"When there is neither 'I' nor 'You', who is the one that wants to see it?"9 
254 
Murnon and G6del 

Apparently the master wants to get across the idea that an enlightened 
state is one where the borderlines between the self and the rest of the 
universe are dissolved. This would truly be the end of dualism, for as he 
says, there is no system left which has any desire for perception. But what is 
that state, if not death? How can a live human being dissolve the border-
lines between himself and the outside world? 
Zen and TumboIia 
The Zen monk Bassui wrote a letter to one of his disciples who was about to 
die, and in it he said: "Your end which is endless is as a snowflake dissolving 
in the pure air." The snowflake, which was once very much a discernible 
subsystem of the universe, now dissolves into the larger system which once 
held it. Though it is no longer present as a distinct subsystem, its essence is 
somehow still present, and will remain so. It floats in Tumbolia, along with 
hiccups that are not being hiccuped and characters in stories that are not 
being read ... That is how I understand Bassui's message. 
Zen recognizes its own limitations, just as mathematicians have learned 
to recognize the limitations of the axiomatic method as a method for 
attaining truth. This does not mean that Zen has an answer to what lies 
beyond Zen any more than mathematicians have a clear understanding of 
the forms of valid reasoning which lie outside of formalization. One of the 
clearest Zen statements about the borderlines of Zen is given in the follow-
ing strange koan, very much in the spirit of Nansen: 10 
T6zan said to his monks, "You monks should know there is an even higher 
understanding in Buddhism." A monk stepped forward and asked, "What is 
the higher Buddhism?" T6zan answered, "It is not Buddha." 
There is always further to go; enlightenment is not the end-all of Zen. 
And there is no recipe which tells how to transcend Zen; the only thing one 
can rely on for sure is that Buddha is not the way. Zen is a system and 
cannot be its own metasystem; there is always something outside of Zen, 
which cannot be fully understood or described within Zen. 
Escher and Zen 
In questioning perception and posing absurd answerless riddles, Zen has 
company, in the person of M. C. Escher. Consider Day and Night (Fig. 49), a 
masterpiece of "positive and negative interwoven" (in the words of Mu-
mon). One might ask, "Are those really birds, or are they really fields? Is 
it really night, or day?" Yet we all know there is no point to such questions. 
The picture, like a Zen koan, is trying to break the mind of logic. Escher 
also delights in setting up contradictory pictures, such as Another World 
Murnon and G6del 
255 

FIGURE 51. 
Puddle, by .W. C. Escher (woodcut, 1952). 
(Fig. 48)-pictures that play with reality and unreality the same way as Zen 
plays with reality and unreality. Should one take Escher seriously? Should 
one take Zen seriously? 
There is a delicate, haiku-like study of reflections in Dewdrop (Fig. 47); 
and then there are two tranquil images of the moon reflected in still waters: 
Puddle (Fig. 51), and Rippled Surface (Fig. 52). The reflected moon is a 
theme which recurs in various koans. Here is an example: II 
Chiyono studied Zen for many years under Bukko of Engaku. Still, she could 
not attain the fruits of meditation. At last one moonlit night she was carrying 
water in an old wooden pail girded with bamboo. The bamboo broke, and the 
bottom fell out of the pail. At that moment, she was set free. Chiyono said, 
"No more water in the pail, no mort~ moon in the water." 
Three Worlds: an Escher picture (Fig. 46), and the subject of a Zen 
koan: 12 
A monk asked Ganto, "When the three worlds threaten me, what shall I do?" 
Ganto answered, "Sit down." "I do not understand," said the monk. Ganto 
said, "Pick up the mountain and bring it to me. Then I will tell you." 
256 
Mumon and Godel 

Hemiolia and Escher 
In Verbum (Fig. 149), oppositions are made into unities on several levels. 
Going around we see gradual transitions from black birds to white birds to 
black fish to white fish to black frogs to white frogs to black birds ... After 
six steps, back where we started!Js this.a reconciliation of the dichotomy of 
black and white? Or of the trichotomy of birds, fish, and frogs? Or is it a 
sixfold unity made from the opposition of the evenness of 2 and the 
oddness of 3? In music, six notes of equal time value create a rhythmic 
ambiguity-are they 2 groups of 3, or 3 groups of 2? This ambiguity has a 
name: hemiolia. Chopin was a master of hemiolia: see his Waltz op. 42, or 
his Etude op. 25, no. 2. In Bach, there is the Tempo di Menuetto from the 
keyboard Partita no. 5, or the incredible Finale of the first Sonata for 
unaccompanied violin, in G Minor. 
As one glides inward toward the center of Verbum, the distinctions 
gradually blur, so that in the end there remains not three, not two, but one 
single essence: "VERBUM", which glows with brilliancy-perhaps a symbol of 
enlightenment. Ironically, "verbum" not only is a word, but means 
"word"-not exactly the most compatible notion with Zen. On the other 
hand, "verbum" is the only word in the picture. And Zen master Tozan 
once said, "The complete Tripitaka can be expressed in one character." 
("Tripitaka", meaning "three baskets", refers to the complete texts of the 
original Buddhist writings.) What kind of decoding-mechanism, I wonder, 
would it take to suck the three baskets out of one character? Perhaps one 
with two hemispheres.

Rippled Surface, by M. C. Escher (lino-cut, 1950). 

FIGURE 53. Three Spheres II, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1946). 
Indra's Net 
Finally, consider Three Spheres II (Fig. 53), in which every part of the world 
seems to contain, and be contained in, every other part: the writing table 
reflects the spheres on top of it, the spheres reflect each other, as well as the 
writing table, the drawing of them, and the artist drawing it. The endless 
connections which all things have to each other is only hinted at here, yet 
the hint is enough. The Buddhist allegory of "Indra's Net" tells of an 
endless net of threads throughout the universe, rhe horizontal threads 
running through space, the vertical ones through time. At every crossing of 
threads is an individual, and every individual is a crystal bead. The great 
light of "Absolute Being" illuminates and penetrates every crystal bead; 
moreover, every crystal bead reflects not only the light from every other 
crystal in the net-but also every reflection of every reflection throughout 
the universe. 
To my mind, this brings forth an image of renormalized particles: in 
every electron, there are virtual photons, positrons, neutrinos, muons ... ; 
in every photon, there are virtual electrons, protons, neutrons, pions ... ; 
in every pion, there are ... 
But then another image rises: that of people, each one reflected in the 
minds of many others, who in turn are mirrored in yet others, and so on. 
Both of these images could be represented in a concise, elegant way by 
using Augmented Transition Networks. In the case of particles, there 
would be one network for each category of particle; in the case of people, 
258 
Murnon and G6del 

one for each person. Each one would contain calls to many others, thus 
creating a virtual cloud of A TN's around each A TN. Calling one would 
create calls on others, and this process might cascade arbitrarily far, until it 
bottomed out. 
Murnon on MU 
Let us conclude this brief excursion into Zen by returning to Mumon. Here 
IS his comment on Joshii's MU: 13 
To realize Zen one has to pass through the barrier of the patriarchs. En-
lightenment always comes after the road of thinking is blocked. If you do not 
pass the barrier of the patriarchs or if your thinking road is not blocked, 
whatever you think, whatever you do, is like a tangling ghost. You may ask: 
"What is a barrier of a patriarch?" This one word, 'MU', is it. 
This is the barrier of Zen. If you pass through it, you will see Joshu face to 
face. Then you can work hand in hand with the whole line of patriarchs. Is 
this not a pleasant thing to do? 
If you want to pass this barrier, you must work through every bone in your 
body, through every pore of your skin, filled with this question: "What is 
'MU'?" and carry it day and night. Do not believe it is the common negative 
symbol meaning nothing. It is not nothingness, the opposite of existence. If 
you really want to pass this barrier, you should feel like drinking a hot iron 
ball that you can neither swallow nor spit out. 
Then your previous lesser knowledge disappears. As a fruit ripening in 
season, your subjectivity and objectivity naturally become one. It is like a 
dumb man who has had a dream. He knows about it but he cannot tell it. 
When he enters this condition his ego-shell is crushed and he can shake the 
heaven and move the earth. He is like a great warrior with a sharp sword. If a 
Buddha stands in his way, he will cut him down; if a patriarch offers him any 
obstacle, he will kill him; and he will be free in his way of birth and death. He 
can enter any world as if it were his own playground. I will tell you how to do 
this with this koan: 
Just concentrate your whole energy into this MU, and do not allow any 
discontinuation. When you enter this MU and there is no discontinuation, 
your attainment will be as a candle burning and illuminating the whole 
universe. 
From Murnon to the MU-puzzle 
From the ethereal heights of Joshii's MU, we now descend to the prosaic 
lowlinesses of Hofstadter's MU ... I know that you have already concen-
trated your whole energy into this MU (when you read Chapter I). So now I 
wish to answer the question which was posed there: 
Has MU theorem-nature, or not? 
The answer to this question is not an evasive MU; rather, it is a resounding 
NO. In order to show this, we will take advantage of dualistic, logical 
thinking. 
Murnon and G6del 
259 

We made two crucial observations in Chapter I: 
(1) 
that the MU-puzzle has depth largely because it involves the 
interplay of lengthening and shortening rules; 
(2) 
that hope nevertheless exists for cracking the problem by 
employing a tool which is in some sense of adequate depth to 
handle matters of that complexity: the theory of numbers. 
We did not analyze the MU-puzzle in those terms very carefully in Chapter 
I; we shall do so now. And we will see how the second observation (when 
generalized beyond the insignificant MIU-system) is one of the most fruit-
ful realizations of all mathematics, and how it changed mathematicians' 
view of their own discipline. 
For your ease of reference, here is a recapitulation of the MI U-system: 
SYMBOLS: 
M, I, U 
AXIOM: 
MI 
RULES: 
1. 
II. 
III. 
IV. 
If xl is a theorem, so is xiU. 
If Mx is a theorem, so is Mxx. 
In any theorem, III can be replaced by U. 
UU can be dropped from any theorem. 
Murnon Shows Us How to Solve the MU-puzzle 
According to the observations abme, then, the MU-puzzle is merely a 
puzzle about natural numbers in typographical disguise. If we could only 
find a way to transfer it to the domain of number theory, we might be able 
to solve it. Let us ponder the words of Mumon, who said, "If any of you has 
one eye, he will see the failure on the teacher's part." But why should it 
matter to have one eye? 
If you try counting the number of J's contained in theorems, you will 
soon notice that it seems never to be O. In other words, it seems that no 
matter how much lengthening and ~hortening is involved, we can never 
work in such a way that aliI's are eliminated. Let us call the number ofl's in 
any string the I-count of that string. Note that the I-count of the axiom MI is 
1. We can do more than show that the I-count can't be O-we can show that 
the I-count can never be any multiple of 3. 
To begin with, notice that rules I and IV leave the I-count totally 
undisturbed. Therefore we need onl}' think about rules II and III. As far as 
rule III is concerned, it diminishes the I-count by exactly 3. After an 
application of this rule, the I-count of the output might conceivably be a 
multiple of 3-but only if the I-count of the input was also. Rule III, in 
short, never creates a multiple of 3 from scratch. It can only create one 
when it began with one. The same holds for rule II, which doubles the 
260 
Murnon and G6del 

I-count. The reason is that if 3 divides 2n, then-because 3 does not divide 
2-it must divide n (a simple fact from the theory of numbers). Neither 
rule II nor rule III can create a multiple of 3 from scratch. 
But this is the key to the MU-puzzle! Here is what we know: 
(1) 
The I-count begins at 1 (not a multiple of 3); 
(2) 
Two of the rules do not affect the I-count at all; 
(3) The two remaining rules which do affect the I-count do so in 
such a way as never to create a multiple of 3 unless given one 
initially. 
The conclusion-and a typically hereditary one it is, too--is that the 
I-count can never become any multiple of 3. In particular, 0 is a forbidden 
value of the I-count. Hence, MU is not a theorem of the MIU-system. 
Notice that, even as a puzzle about I-counts, this problem was still 
plagued by the crossfire of lengthening and shortening rules. Zero became 
the goal; I-counts could increase (rule II), could decrease (rule III). Until 
we analyzed the situation, we might have thought that, with enough switch-
ing back and forth between the rules, we might eventually hit O. Now, 
thanks to a simple number-theoretical argument, we know that that is 
impossible. 
Godel-Numbering the MIU-System 
Not all problems of the the type which the MU-puzzle symbolizes are so 
easy to solve as this one. But we have seen that at least one such puzzle 
could be embedded within, and solved within, number theory. We are now 
going to see that there is a way to embed all problems about any formal 
system, in number theory. This can happen thanks to the discovery, by 
G6del, of a special kind of isomorphism. To illustrate it, I will use the 
MIU-system. 
We begin by considering the notation of the MIU-system. We shall 
map each symbol onto a new symbol: 
M ¢~ 3 
I ¢~ 1 
U ¢~ 0 
The correspondence was chosen arbitrarily; the only rhyme or reason to it 
is that each symbol looks a little like the one it is mapped onto. Each 
number is called the Cadet number of the corresponding letter. Now I am 
sure you can guess what the G6del number of a multiletter string will be: 
Murnon and G6del 
MU ¢~ 30 
MIIU ¢~ 3110 
etc. 
261 

It is easy. Clearly this mapping b(~tween notations is an information-
preserving transformation; it is like playing the same melody on two differ-
ent instruments. 
Let us now take a look at a typical derivation in the MIU-system, 
written simultaneously in both notations: 
(1)

The left-hand column is obtained by applying our four familiar typograph-
ical rules. The right-hand column, too, could be thought of as having been 
generated by a similar set of typographical rules. Yet the right-hand col-
umn has a dual nature. Let me explain what this means. 
Seeing Things Both Typographically and Arithmetically 
We could say of the fifth string ('3010') that it was made from the fourth, by 
appending a '0' on the right; on the other hand we could equally well view 
the transition as caused by an arithmetical operation-multiplication by 10, 
to be exact. When natural numbers are written in the decimal system, 
multiplication by 10 and putting a '0' on the right are indistinguishable 
operations. We can take advantage of this to write an arithmetical rule which 
corresponds to typographical rule I: 
ARITHMETICAL RULE Ia: 
A number whose decimal expansion ends on the 
right in '1' can be multiplied by 10. 
We can eliminate the reference to the symbols in the decimal expansion by 
arithmetically describing the rightmost digit: 
ARITHMETICAL RULE Ib: 
A number whose remainder when divided by 10 
is 1, can be multiplied by 10. 
Now we could have stuck with a purely typographical rule, such as the 
following one: 
TYPOGRAPHICAL RULE I: 
From any theorem whose rightmost symbol is '1' a 
new theorem can be made, by appending '0' to the right of that '1'. 
They would have the same effect. This is why the right-hand column has a 
"dual nature": it can be viewed either as a series of typographical opera-
262 
Murnon and Godel 

tions changing one pattern of symbols into another, or as a series of 
arithmetical operations changing one magnitude into another. But there 
are powerful reasons for being more interested in the arithmeticaL version. 
Stepping out of one purely typographical system into another isomorphic 
typographical system is not a very exciting thing to do; whereas stepping 
clear out of the typographical domain into an isomorphic part of number 
theory has some kind of unexplored potential. It is as if somebody had 
known musical scores all his life, but purely visually-and then, all of a 
sudden, someone introduced him to the mapping between sounds and 
musical scores. What a rich, new world! Then again, it is as if somebody had 
been familiar with string figures all his life, but purely as string figures, 
devoid of meaning-and then, all of a sudden, someone introduced him to 
the mapping between stories and strings. What a revelation! The discovery 
of Godel-numbering has been likened to the discovery, by Descartes, of the 
isomorphism between curves in a plane and equations in two variables: 
incredibly simple, once you see it-and opening onto a vast new world. 
Before we jump to conclusions, though, perhaps you would like to see 
a more complete rendering of this higher level of the isomorphism. It is a 
very good exercise. The idea is to give an arithmetical rule whose action is 
indistinguishable from that of each typographical rule of the MIU-system. 
A solution is given below. In the rules, m and k are arbitrary 
natural numbers, and n is any natural number which is less than 10 m • 
RULE 1: 
If we have made 10m + 1, then we can make 10 x (10m + 1). 
Example: 
Going from line 4 to line 5. Here, m = 30. 
RULE 2: 
If we have made 3 x 10 m + n, then we can make 
lorn x (3 x 10 m + n) + n. 
Example: 
Going from line 1 to line 2, where both m and n 
equal 1. 
RULE 3: 
If we have made k x 10 m+:l + III x 10 m + n, then we can 
make k x lO m+ 1 + n. 
Example: 
Going from line 3 to line 4. Here, m and n are 1, 
and k is 3. 
RULE 4: 
If we have made k x 10 m + 2 + n, then we can make 
k x 10 m + n. 
Example: 
Going from line 6 to line 7. Here, m = 2, n = 10, 
and k = 301. 
Let us not forget our axiom! Without it we can go nowhere. Therefore, let 
us postulate that: 
We can make 31. 
Now the right-hand column can be seen as a full-fledged arithmetical 
process, in a new arithmetical system which we might call the 31 O-system:

Notice once again that the leng1.hening and shortening rules are ever 
with us in this "310-system"; they have merely been transposed into the 
domain of numbers, so that the Godel numbers go up and down. If you 
look carefully at what is going on, you will discover that the rules are based 
on nothing more profound than the idea that shifting digits to left and 
right in decimal representations of integers is related to multiplications and 
divisions by powers of 10. This simple observation finds its generalization 
in the following 
CENTRAL PROPOSITION: 
If there is a typographical rule which tells 
how certain digits are to be shifted, changed, dropped, or inserted 
in any number represented decimally, then this rule can be rep-
resented equally well by an arithmetical counterpart which in-
volves arithmetical operations with powers of 10 as well as addi-
tions, subtractions, and so forth. 
More briefly: 
Typographical rules for manipulating numerals are actually 
arithmetical rules for operating on numbers. 
This simple observation is at the heart of Godel's method, and it will have 
an absolutely shattering effect. It tells us that once we have a Godel-
numbering for any formal system, we can straightaway form a set of 
arithmetical rules which complete the Godel isomorphism. The upshot is 
that we can transfer the study of any formal system-in fact the study of all 
formal systems-into number theory. 
MIU-Producible Numbers 
Just as any set of typographical rules generates a set of theorems, a corre-
sponding set of natural numbers will be generated by repeated applications 
of arithmetical rules. These producible numbers play the same role inside 
number theory as theorems do inside any formal system. Of course, differ-
ent numbers will be producible, depending on which rules are adopted. 
"Producible numbers" are only producible relative to a system of arithmetical 
rules. For example, such numbers as 31, 3010010, 3111, and so forth 
could be called MIU-producible numbers-an ungainly name, which might 
be shortened to MIU-numbers, symbolizing the fact that those numbers are 
the ones that result when you transcribe the MIU-system into number 
theory, via Godel-numbering. If we were to Godel-number the pq-system 
264 
Murnon and Godel 

and then "arithmetize" its rules, we could call the producible numbers 
"pq-numbers"-and so on. 
Note that the producible numbers (in any given system) are defined by 
a recursive method: given numbers which are known to be producible, we 
have rules telling how to make more producible numbers. Thus, the class 
of numbers known to be producible is constantly extending itself, in much 
the same way that the list of Fibonacci numbers, or Q-numbers, does. The 
set of producible numbers of any system is a recursively enumerable set. What 
about its complement-the set of nonproducible numbers? Is that set 
always recursively enumerable? Do numbers which are nonproducible 
share some common arithmetical feature? 
This is the sort of issue which arises when you transpose the study of 
formal systems into number theory. For each system which is arithmetized, 
one can ask, "Can we characterize producible numbers in a simple way?" 
"Can we characterize non producible numbers in a recursively enumerable 
way?" These are difficult questions of number theory. Depending on the 
system which has been arithmetized, such questions might prove too hard 
for us to resolve. But if there is any hope for solving such problems, it 
would have to reside in the usual kind of step-by-step reasoning as it applies 
to natural numbers. And that, of course, was put in its quintessential form 
in the previous Chapter. TNT seemed, to all appearances, to have captured 
all valid mathematical thinking processes in one single, compact system. 
Answering Questions about Producible Numbers 
by Consulting TNT 
Could it be, therefore, that the means with which to answer any question 
about any formal system lies within just a single formal system-TNT? It 
seems plausible. Take, for instance, this question: 
Is MU a theorem of the MIU-system? 
Finding the answer is equivalent to determining whether 30 is a MIU-
number or not. Because it is a statement of number theory, we should 
expect that, with some hard work, we could figure out how to translate the 
sentence "30 is a MIU-number" into TNT-notation, in somewhat the same 
way as we figured out how to translate other number-theoretical sentences 
into TNT-notation. I should immediately caution the reader that such a 
translation, though it does exist, is immensely complex. If you recall, I 
pointed out in Chapter VIII that even such a simple arithmetical predicate 
as "b is a power of 10" is very tricky to code into TNT-notation-and the 
predicate "b is a MIU-number" is a lot more complicated than that! StiIl, it 
can be found; and the numeral SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSO can 
be substituted for every b. This will result in a MONstrous string of TNT, a 
string of TNT which speaks about the MU-puzzle. Let us therefore call that 
string "MUMON". Through MUMON and strings like it, TNT is now 
capable of speaking "in code" about the MIU-system. 
Murnon and G6del 
265 

The Dual Nature of MUMON 
In order to gain some benefit from this peculiar transformation of the 
original question, we would have to ~eek the answer to a new question: 
Is MUMON a theorem of TNT? 
All we have done is replace one relatively short string (MU) by another (the 
monstrous MUMON), and a simple formal system (the MIU-system) by a 
complicated one (TNT). It isn't likely that the answer will be any more 
forthcoming even though the question has been reshaped. In fact, TNT 
has a full complement of both lengthening and shortening rules, and the 
reformulation of the question is likely to be far harder than the original. 
One might even say that looking at MU via MUMON is an intentionally 
idiotic way of doing things. However, MUMON can be looked at on more 
than one level. 
In fact, this is an intriguing point: MUMON has two different passive 
meanings. Firstly, it has the one which was given before: 
30 is a MIU-number. 
But secondly, we know that this statcment is tied (via isomorphism) to the 
statement 
MU is a theorem of the MIU-system. 
So we can legitimately quote this lattcr as the second passive meaning of 
MUMON. It may seem very strange because, after all, MUMON contains 
nothing but plus signs, parentheses, and so forth-symbols of TNT. How 
can it possibly express any statement with other than arithmetical content? 
The fact is, it can. Just as a single musical line may serve as both 
harmony and melody in a single piece; just as "BACH" may be interpreted 
as both a name and a melody; just a~ a single sentence may be an accurate 
structural description of a picture by Escher, of a section of DNA, of a piece 
by Bach, and of the dialogue in which the sentence is embedded, so 
MUMON can be taken in (at least) two entirely different ways. This state of 
affairs comes about because of two facts: 
Fact 1. 
Statements such as "MU is a theorem" can be coded into 
number theory via Godel's isomorphism. 
Fact 2. Statements of number theory can be translated into 
TNT. 
It could be said that MUMON is, by Fact 1, a coded message, where the 
symbols of the code are, by Fact 2, just symbols of TNT. 
266 
Murnon and Godel 

Codes and Implicit Meaning 
Now it could be objected here that a coded message, unlike an uncoded 
message, does not express anything on its own-it requires knowledge of 
the code. But in reality there is no such thing as an uncoded message. 
There are only messages written in more familiar codes, and messages 
written in less familiar codes. If the meaning of a message is to be revealed, 
it must be pulled out of the code by some sort of mechanism, or isomor-
phism. It may be difficult to discover the method by which the decoding 
should be done; but once that method has been discovered, the message 
becomes transparent as water. When a code is familiar enough, it ceases 
appearing like a code; one forgets that there is a decoding mechanism. The 
message is identified with its meaning. 
Here we have a case where the identification of message and meaning 
is so strong that it is hard for us to conceive of an alternate meaning 
residing in the same symbols. Namely, we are so prejudiced by the symbols 
of TNT towards seeing number-theoretical meaning (and only number-
theoretical meaning) in strings of TNT, that to conceive of certain strings 
of TNT as statements about the MIU-system is quite difficult. But Godel's 
isomorphism compels us to recognize this second level of meaning In 
certain strings of TNT. 
Decoded in the more familiar way, MUMON bears the message: 
30 is a MIU-number. 
This is a statement of number theory, gotten by interpreting each sign in 
the conventional way. 
But in discovering Godel-numbering and the whole isomorphism built 
upon it, we have in a sense broken a code in which messages about the 
MIU-system are written in strings of TNT. Godel's isomorphism is a new 
information-revealer, just as the decipherments of ancient scripts were 
information-revealers. Decoded by this new and less familiar mechanism, 
MUMON bears the message 
MU is a theorem of the MIU-system. 
The moral of the story is one we have heard before: that meaning is an 
automatic by-product of our recognition of any isomorphism; therefore 
there are at least two passive meanings of MUMON-maybe more! 
The Boomerang: Godel-Numbering TNT 
Of course things do not stop here. We have only begun realizing the 
potential of Godel's isomorphism. The natural trick would be to turn 
TNT's capability of mirroring other formal systems back on itself, as the 
Tortoise turned the Crab's phonographs against themselves, and as his 
Goblet G turned against itself, in destroying itself. In order to do this, we 
Murnon and Godel 
267 

will have to Godel-number TNT itself, just as we did the MIU-system, and 
then "arithmetize" its rules of inference. The Godel-numbering is easy to 
do. For instance, we could make the following correspondence:

Each symbol of TNT is matched up with a triplet composed of the 
digits 1,2,3, and 6, in a manner chosen for mnemonic value. I shall call 
each such triplet of digits a Gadel codon, or codon for short. Notice that I 
have given no codon for b, C, d, or e; we are using austere TNT. There is a 
hidden motivation for this, which you will find out about in Chapter XVI. 
I will explain the bottom entry, "punctuation", in Chapter XIV. 
Now we can rewrite any string or rule of TNT in the new garb. Here, 
for instance, is Axiom 1 in the two notations, the old below the new: 
626,262,636,223,123,262, 111,666 
'VaS a 
0 
Conveniently, the standard convention of putting in a comma every third 
digit happens to coincide with our codons, setting them off for "easy" 
legibility. 
Here is the Rule of Detachment, in the new notation: 
RULE: 
If x and 212x633y213 are both theorems, then y is a theorem. 
Finally, here is an entire derivation taken from last Chapter, given in 
austere TNT and also transcribed into the new notation:

transitivity 
Notice that I changed the name of the "Add S" rule to "Insert '123"', since 
that is the typographical operation which it now legitimizes. 
This new notation has a pretty strange feel to it. You lose all sense of 
meaning; but if you had been brought up on it, you could read strings in 
this notation as easily as you do TNT. You would be able to look and, at a 
glance, distinguish well-formed formulas from ill-formed ones. Naturally, 
since it is so visual, you would think of this as a typographical operation-
but at the same time, picking out well-formed formulas in this notation is 
picking out a special class of integers, which have an arithmetical definition, 
too. 
Now what about "arithmetizing" all the rules of inference? As matters 
stand, they are all still typographical rules. But wait! According to the 
Central Proposition, a typographical rule is really equivalent to an 
arithmetical rule. Inserting and moving digits in decimally represented 
numbers is an arithmetical operation, which can be carried out typographi-
cally. Just as appending a '0' on the end is exactly the same as multiplying by 
10, so each rule is a condensed way of describing a messy arithmetical 
operation. Therefore, in a sense, we do not even need to look for equiva-
lent arithmetical rules, because all of the rules are already arithmetical! 
TNT-Numbers: A Recursively Enumerable Set of Numbers 
Looked at this way, the preceding derivation of the theorem 
"362,123,666,112,123,666,323,111,123,123,666" is a sequence of highly 
convoluted number-theoretical transformations, each of which acts on one 
or more input numbers, and yields an output number, which is, as before, 
called a producible number, or, to be more specific, a TNT-number. Some of 
the arithmetical rules take an old TNT-number and increase it in a particu-
lar way, to yield a new TNT-number; some take an old TNT-number and 
decrease it; other rules take two TNT-numbers, operate on each of them in 
some odd way, and then combine the results into a new TNT-number-
and so on and so forth. And instead of starting with just one known 
TNT-number, we have five initial TNT-numbers-one for each (austere) 
axiom, of course. Arithmetized TNT is actually extremely similar to the 
Murnon and Godel 
269 

arithmetized MIU-system, only there are more rules and axioms, and to 
write out arithmetical equivalents explicitly would be a big bother-and 
quite unenlightening, incidentally. If you followed how it was done for the 
MIU-system, there ought to be no doubt on your part that it is quite 
analogous here. 
There is a new number-theoretical predicate brought into being by 
this "Godelization" of TNT: the predicate 
a is a TNT-number. 
For example, we know from the preceding derivation that 
362,123,666,112,123,666,323,111,123,123,666 is a TNT-number, while 
on the other hand, presumably 123,666,111,666 is not a TNT-number. 
Now it occurs to us that this new number-theoretical predicate is 
expressible by some string of TNT with one free variable, say a. We could put 
a tilde in front, and that string would express the complementary notion 
a is not a TNT-number. 
Now if we replaced all the occurrences of a in this second string by the 
TNT-numeral for 123,666,111,666-a numeral which would contain 
exactly 123,666, III ,666 5's, much too long to write out-we would have a 
TNT-string which, just like MUMON, is capable of being interpreted on 
two levels. In the first place, that string would say 
123,666,111,666 is not a TNT-number. 
But because of the isomorphism which links TNT-numbers to theorems of 
TNT, there would be a second-level meaning of this string, which is: 
50=0 is not a theorem of TNT. 
TNT Tries to Swallow Itself 
This unexpected double-entendre demonstrates that TNT contains strings 
which talk about other strings of TNT. In other words, the metalanguage 
in which we, on the outside, can speak about TNT, is at least partially 
imitated inside TNT itself. And this is not an accidental feature of TNT; it 
happens because the architecture of any formal system can be mirrored 
inside N (number theory). It is just as inevitable a feature of TNT as are the 
vibrations induced in a record player when it plays a record. It seems as if 
vibrations should come from the outside world-for instance, from jump-
ing children or bouncing balls; but a side effect of producing sounds-and 
an unavoidable one-is that they wrap around and shake the very 
mechanism which produces them. It is no accident; it is a side effect which 
cannot be helped. It is in the nature of record players. And it is in the 
nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is 
embedded within it. 
270 
Murnon and Godel 

We can dignify this observation by calling it the Central Dogma of 
Mathematical Logic, and depicting it in a two-step diagram: 
TNT 
~ N 
~ meta-TNT 
In words: a string of TNT has an interpretation in N; and a statement of N 
may have a second meaning as a statement about TNT. 
G: 
A String Which Talks about Itself in Code 
This much is intriguing yet it is only half the story. The rest of the story 
involves an intensification of the self-reference. We are now at the stage 
where the Tortoise was when he realized that a record could be made 
which would make the phonograph playing it break-but now the question 
is: "Given a record player, how do you actually figure out what to put on 
the record?" That is a tricky matter. 
We want to find a string of TNT-which we'll call 'G'-which is about 
itself, in the sense that one of its passive meanings is a sentence about G. In 
particular the passive meaning will turn out to be 
"G is not a theorem of TNT." 
I should quickly add that G also has a passive meaning which is a statement of 
number theory; just like MUMON it is susceptible to being construed in (at 
least) two different ways. The important thing is that each passive meaning 
is valid and useful and doesn't cast doubt on the other passive meaning in 
any way. (The fact that a phonograph playing a record can induce vibra-
tions in itself and in the record does not diminish in any way the fact that 
those vibrations are musical sounds!) 
G's Existence Is What Causes TNT's Incompleteness 
The ingenious method of creating G, and some important concepts relat-
ing to TNT, will be developed in Chapters XIII and XIV; for now it isjust 
interesting to glance ahead, a bit superficially, at the consequences of 
finding a self-referential piece of TNT. Who knows? It might blow up! In a 
sense it does. We focus down on the obvious question: 
Is G a theorem of TNT, or not? 
Let us be sure to form our own opinion on this matter, rather than rely on 
G's opinion about itself. After all, G may not understand itself any better 
than a Zen master understands himself. Like MUMON, G may express a 
falsity. Like MU, G may be a nontheorem. We don't need to believe every 
possible string of TNT-only its theorems. Now let us use our power of 
reasoning to clarify the issue as best we can at this point. 
We will make our usual assumption: that TNT incorporates valid 
Murnon and Godel 
271 

methods of reasoning, and therefore that TNT never has falsities for 
theorems. In other words, anything which is a theorem of TNT expresses a 
truth. So if G were a theorem, it would express a truth, namely: "G is not a 
theorem". The full force of its self-reference hits us. By being a theorem, G 
would have to be a falsity. Relying on our assumption that TNT never has 
falsities for theorems, we'd be forced to conclude that G is not a theorem. 
This is all right; it leaves us, however, with a lesser problem. Knowing that 
G is not a theorem, we'd have to concede that G expresses a truth. Here is a 
situation in which TNT doesn't live up to our expectations-we have found 
a string which expresses a true statement yet the string is not a theorem. 
And in our amazement, we shouldn't lose track of the fact that G has an 
arithmetical interpretation, too-which allows us to summarize our 
findings this way: 
A string of TNT has been found; it expresses, unambiguously, a 
statement about certain arithmetical properties of natural num-
bers; moreover, by reasoning outside the system we can determine 
not only that the statement is a true one, but also that the string 
fails to be a theorem of TNT. And thus, if we ask TNT whether 
the statement is true, TNT says neither yes nor no. 
Is the Tortoise's string in the Mu Offering the analogue ofG? Not quite. 
The analogue of the Tortoise's string is -G. Why is this so? Well, let us 
think a moment about what -G says. It must say the opposite of what G 
says. G says, "G is not a theorem of TNT", so -G must say "G is a theorem". 
We could rephrase both G and -G this way: 
G: 
"I am not a theorem (of TNT)." 
-G: "My negation is a theorem (of TNT)." 
It is -G which is parallel to the Tortoise's string, for that string spoke not 
about itself, but about the string which the Tortoise first proffered to 
Achilles-which had an extra knot on it (or one too few, however you want 
to look at it). 
Murnon Has the Last Word 
Mumon penetrated into the Mystery of the Undecidable as clearly as 
anyone, in his concise poem on J6shli's MU: 
272 
Has a dog Buddha-nature? 
This is the most serious question of all. 
If you say yes or no, 
You lose your own Buddha-nature. 
Murnon and G6del 

PART II 

Prelude • • • 
Achilles and the Tortoise have come to the residence of their friend the 
Crab, to make the acquaintance of one of his friends, the Anteater. The 
introductions having been made, the four of them settle down to tea. 
Tortoise: 
We have brought along a little something for you, Mr. Crab. 
Crab: 
That's most kind of you. But you shouldn't have. 
Tortoise: Just a token of our esteem. Achilles, would you like to give it to 
Mr. C? 
Achilles: 
Surely. Best wishes, Mr. Crab. I hope you enjoy it. 
(Achilles hands the Crab an elegantly wrapped present, square and very 
thin. The Crab begins unwrapping it.) 
Anteater: 
I wonder what it could be. 
Crab: 
We'll soon find out. (Completes the unwrapping, and pulls out the gift.) 
Two records! How exciting! But there's no label. Uh-oh-is this 
another of your "specials", Mr. T? 
Tortoise: 
If you mean a phonograph-breaker, not this time. But it is in fact 
a custom-recorded item, the only one of its kind in the entire world. In 
fact, it's never even been heard before--except, of course, when Bach 
played it. 
Crab: 
When Bach played it? What do you mean, exactly? 
Achilles: 
Oh, you are going to be fabulously excited, Mr. Crab, when 
Mr. T tells you what these records in fact are. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, you go ahead and tell him, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
May I? Oh, boy! I'd better consult my notes, then. (Pulls out a 
small filing card, and clears his voice.) Ahem. Would you be interested in 
hearing about the remarkable new result in mathematics, to which 
your records owe their existence? 
Crab: 
My records derive from some piece of mathematics? How curious! 
Well, now that you've provoked my interest, I must hear about it. 
Achilles: 
Very well, then. (Pauses for a moment to sip his tea, then resumes.) 
Have you heard of Fermat's infamous "Last Theorem"? 
Anteater: 
I'm not sure ... It sounds strangely familiar, and yet I can't quite 
place it. 
Achilles: 
It's a very simple idea. Pierre de Fermat, a lawyer by vocation but 
mathematician by avocation, had been reading in his copy of the classic 
text Arithmetica by Diophantus, and came across a page containing the 
equation 
Prelude . .. 
275 


He immediately realized that this equation has infinitely many solu-
tions a, b, c, and then wrote in the margin the following notorious 
comment: 
The equation 
an+bn=c n 
has solutions in positive integers a, b, c, and n only when n = 2 (and 
then there are infinitely many triplets a, b, c which satisfy the equa-
tion); but there are no solutions for n > 2. I have discovered a truly 
marvelous proof of this statement, which, unfortunately, this margin 
is too small to contain. 
Ever since that day, some three hundred years ago, mathematicians 
have been vainly trying to do one of two things: either to prove 
Fermat's claim, and thereby vindicate Fermat's reputation, which, al-
though very high, has been somewhat tarnished by skeptics who think 
he never really found the proof he claimed to have found--or else to 
refute the claim, by finding a counterexample: a set of four integers 
a, b, c, and n, with n > 2, which satisfy the equation. Until very 
recently, every attempt in either direction had met with failure. To be 
sure, the Theorem has been proven for many specific values of n-in 
particular, all n up to 125,000. 
Anteater: 
Shouldn't it be called a "Conjecture" rather than a "Theorem", if 
it's never been given a proper proof? 
Achilles: 
Strictly speaking, you're right, but tradition has kept it this way. 
Crab: 
Has someone at last managed to resolve this celebrated question? 
Achilles: 
Indeed! In fact, Mr. Tortoise has done so, and as usual, by a 
wizardly stroke. He has not only found a PROOF of Fermat's Last 
Theorem (thus justifying its name as well as vindicating Fermat), but 
also a COUNTEREXAMPLE, thus showing that the skeptics had good 
intuition! 
Crab: 
Oh my gracious! That is a revolutionary discovery. 
Anteater: 
But please don't leave us in suspense. What magical integers are 
they, that satisfy Fermat's equation? I'm especially curious about the 
value of n. 
Achilles: 
Oh, horrors! I'm most embarrassed! Can you believe this? I left 
the values at home on a truly colossal piece of paper. Unfortunately it 
was too huge to bring along. I wish I had them here to show to you. If 
it's of any help to you, I do remember one thing-the value of n is the 
only positive integer which does not occur anywhere in the continued 
fraction for 1T. 
Crab: 
Oh, what a shame that you don't have them here. But there's no 
reason to doubt what you have told us.

Anteater: 
Anyway, who needs to see n written out decimally? Achilles has 
just told us how to find it. Well, Mr. T, please accept my hearty 
felicitations, on the occasion of your epoch-making discovery! 
Tortoise: 
Thank you. But what I feel is more important than the result 
itself is the practical use to which my result immediately led. 
Crab: 
I am dying to hear about it, since I always thought number theory 
was the Queen of Mathematin.-the purest branch of mathematics-
the one branch of mathematics which has NO applications! 
Tortoise: 
You're not the only one with that belief, but in fact it is quite 
impossible to make a blanket statement about when or how some 
branch-or even some individual Theorem-of pure mathematics will 
have important repercussiom outside of mathematics. It is quite 
unpredictable-and this case is a perfect example of that phenome-
non. 
Achilles: 
Mr. Tortoise's double-barreled result has created a breakthrough 
in the field of acoustico-retrieval! 
Anteater: 
What is acoustico-retrieyal? 
Achilles: 
The name tells it all: it is the retrieval of acoustic information 
from extremely complex sources. A typical task of acoustico-retrieval is 
to reconstruct the sound which a rock made on plummeting into a lake 
from the ripples which spread out over the lake's surface. 
Crab: 
Why, that sounds next to impossible! 
Achilles: 
Not so. It is actually quite similar to what one's brain does, when it 
reconstructs the sound made in the vocal cords of another person from 
the vibrations transmitted by the eardrum to the fibers in the cochlea. 
Crab: 
I see. But I still don't see where number theory enters the picture, 
or what this all has to do with my new records. 
278 
Prelude . .. 

Achilles: 
Well, in the mathematics of acoustico-retrieval, there arise many 
questions which have to do with the number of solutions of certain 
Diophantine equations. Now Mr. T has been for years trying to find a 
way of reconstructing the sounds of Bach playing his harpsichord, 
which took place over two hundred years ago, from calculations involv-
ing the motions of all the molecules in the atmosphere at the present 
time. 
Anteater: 
Surely that is impossible! They are irretrievably gone, gone 
forever! 
Achilles: 
Thus think the naive ... But Mr. T has devoted many years to 
this problem, and came to the realization that the whole thing hinged 
on the number of solutions to the equation 
an + b n = en 
in positive integers, with n > 2. 
Tortoise: 
I could explain, of course, just how this equation arises, but I'm 
sure it would bore you. 
Achilles: 
It turned out that acoustico-retrieval theory predicts that the 
Bach sounds can be retrieved from the motion of all the molecules in 
the atmosphere, provided that EITHER there exists at least one solution 
to the equation-
Crab: 
Amazing! 
Anteater: 
Fantastic! 
Tortoise: 
Who would have thought! 
Achilles: 
I was about to say, "provided that there exists EITHER such a 
solution OR a proof that there are NO solutions!" And therefore, Mr. T, 
in careful fashion, set about working at both ends of the problem, 
simultaneously. As it turns out, the discovery of the counterexample 
was the key ingredient to finding the proof, so the one led directly to 
the other. 
Crab: 
How could that be? 
Tortoise: 
Well, you see, I had shown that the structural layout of any proof 
of Fermat's Last Theorem-if one existed-could be described by an 
elegant formula, which, it so happened, depended on the values of a 
solution to a certain equation. When I found this second equation, to 
my surprise it turned out to be the Fermat equation. An amusing 
accidental relationship between form and content. So when I found 
the counterexample, all I needed to do was to use those numbers as a 
blueprint for constructing my proof that there were no solutions to the 
equation. Remarkably simple, when you think about it. I can't imagine 
why no one had ever found the result before. 
Achilles: 
As a result of this unanticipatedly rich mathematical success, 
Mr. T was able to carry out the acoustico-retrieval which he had so 
long dreamed of. And Mr. Crab's present here represents a palpable 
realization of all this abstract work. 
Prelude . .. 
279 

Crab: 
Don't tell me it's a recording of Bach playing his own works for 
harpsichord! 
Achilles: 
I'm sorry, but I have to, for that is indeed just what it is! This is a 
set of two records of Johann Sebastian Bach ~laying all of his Well-
Tempered Clavier. Each record contains one of the two volumes of the 
Well-Tempered Clavier; that is to say, each record contains 24 preludes 
and fugues-one in each major and minor key. 
Crab: 
Well, we must absolutely put one of these priceless records on, 
immediately! And how can I e\er thank the two of you? 
Tortoise: 
You have already thanked us plentifully, with this delicious tea 
which you have prepared. 
(The Crab slides one of the records out of its jacket, and puts it on. The 
sound of an incredibly masterful harpsichordistfills the room, in the highest 
imaginable fidelity. One even hears.,.--or is it one's imagination? -the soft 
sounds of Bach singing to him,ell as he plays . .. ) 
Crab: 
Would any of you like to follow along in the score? I happen to have 
a unique edition of the Well-Tempered Clavier, specially illuminated by a 
teacher of mine who happens also to be an unusually fine calligrapher. 
Tortoise: 
I would very much enjoy that. 
(The Crab goes to his elegant glws··enclosed wooden bookcase, opens the 
doors, and draws out two large volumes.) 
Crab: 
Here you are, Mr. Tortoise. I've never really gotten to know all the 
beautiful illustrations in this edition. Perhaps your gift will provide the 
needed impetus for me to do so. 
Tortoise: 
I do hope so. 
Anteater: 
Have you ever noticed how in these pieces the prelude always 
sets the mood perfectly for the following fugue? 
Crab: 
Yes. Although it may be hard to put it into words, there is always 
some subtle relation between the two. Even if the prelude and fugue 
do not have a common melodic subject, there is nevertheless always 
some intangible abstract quality which underlies both of them, binding 
them together very strongly. 
Tortoise: 
And there is something very dramatic about the few moments of 
silent suspense hanging between prelude and fugue-that moment 
where the the theme of the fugue is about to ring out, in single tones, 
and then to join with itself in e\ er-increasingly complex levels of weird, 
exquisite harmony. 
Achilles: 
I know just what you mean. There are so many preludes and 
fugues which I haven't yet gotten to know, and for me that fleeting 
interlude of silence is very exciting; it's a time when I try to second-
guess old Bach. For example, I always wonder what the fugue's tempo 
will be: allegro, or adagio? Will it be in 6/8, or 4/4? Will it have three 
voices, or five-or four? And then, the first voice starts ... Such an 
exquisite moment. 
280 
Prelude . .. 

Crab: 
Ah, yes, well do I remember those long-gone days of my youth, the 
days when I thrilled to each new prelude and fugue, filled with the 
excitement of their novelty and beauty and the many unexpected 
surprises which they conceal. 
Achilles: 
And now? Is that thrill all gone? 
Crab: 
It's been supplanted by familiarity, as thrills always will be. But in 
that familiarity there is also a kind of depth, which has its own compen-
sations. For instance, I find that there are always new surprises which I 
hadn't noticed before. 
Achilles: 
Occurrences of the theme which you had overlooked? 
Crab: 
Perhaps-especially when it is inverted and hidden among several 
other voices, or where it seems to come rushing up from the depths, 
out of nowhere. But there are also amazing modulations which it is 
marvelous to listen to over and over again, and wonder how old Bach 
dreamt them up. 
Achilles: 
I am very glad to hear that there is something to look forward to, 
after I have been through the first flush of infatuation with the Well-
Tempered Clavier-although it also makes me sad that this stage could 
not last forever and ever. 
Crab: 
Oh, you needn't fear that your infatuation will totally die. One of 
the nice things about that sort of youthful thrill is that it can always be 
resuscitated, just when you thought it was finally dead. It just takes the 
right kind of triggering from the outside. 
Achilles: 
Oh, really? Such as what? 
Crab: 
Such as hearing it through the ears, so to speak, of someone to 
whom it is a totally new experience-someone such as you, Achilles. 
Somehow the excitement transmits itself, and I can feel thrilled again. 
Achilles: 
That is intriguing. The thrill has remained dormant somewhere 
inside you, but by yourself, you aren't able to fish it up out of your 
subconscious. 
Crab: 
Exactly. The potential of reliving the thrill is "coded", in some 
unknown way, in the structure of my brain, but I don't have the power 
to summon it up at will; I have to wait for chance circumstance to 
trigger it. 
Achilles: 
I have a question about fugues which I feel a little embarrassed 
about asking, but as I amjusta novice at fugue-listening, I was wonder-
ing if perhaps one of you seasoned fugue-listeners might help me in 
learning ... ? 
Tortoise: 
I'd certainly like to offer my own meager knowledge, if it might 
prove of some assistance. 
Achilles: 
Oh, thank you. Let me come at the question from an angle. Are 
you familiar with the print called Cube with Magic Ribbons, by M. C. 
Escher? 
Tortoise: 
In which there are circular bands having bubble-like distortions 
which, as soon as you've decided that they are bumps, seem 'to turn into 
dents-and vice versa? 
Prelude . .. 
281 

FIGURE 56. 
Cube with Magic Ribbons, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1957). 
Achilles: 
Exactly. 
Crab: 
I remember that picture. Those little bubbles always seem to flip 
back and forth between being concave and convex, depending on the 
direction that you approach them from. There's no way to see them 
simultaneously as concave AND convex-somehow one's brain doesn't 
allow that. There are two mutually exclusive "modes" in which one can 
perceive the bubbles. 
Achilles: Just so. Well, I seem to have discovered two somewhat analogous 
modes in which I can listen to a fugue. The modes are these: either to 
follow one individual voice at a time, or to listen to the total effect of all 
of them together, without trying to disentangle one from another. I 
have tried out both of these modes, and, much to my frustration, each 
one of them shuts out the other. It's simply not in my power to follow 
the paths of individual voices and at the same time to hear the whole 
effect. I find that I flip back and forth between one mode and the 
other, more or less spontaneously and involuntarily. 
282 
Prelude . .. 

Anteater: Just as when you look at the magic bands, eh? 
Achilles: 
Yes. I was just wondering ... does my description of these two 
modes of fugue-listening brand me unmistakably as a naive, inexperi-
enced listener, who couldn't even begin to grasp the deeper modes of 
perception which exist beyond his ken? 
Tortoise: 
No, not at all, Achilles. I can only speak for myself, but I too find 
myself shifting back and forth from one mode to the other without 
exerting any conscious control over which mode should be dominant. I 
don't know if our other companions here have also,experienced any-
thing similar. 
Crab: 
Most definitely. It's quite a tantalizing phenomenon, since you feel 
that the essence of the fugue is Hitting about you, and you can't quite 
grasp all of it, because you can't quite make yourself function both 
ways at once. 
Anteater: 
Fugues have that interesting property, that each of their voices is 
a piece of music in itself; and thus a fugue might be thought of as a 
collection of several distinct pieces of music, all based on one single 
theme, and all played simultaneously. And it is up to the listener (or his 
subconscious) to decide whether it should be perceived as a unit, or as a 
collection of independent parts, all of which harmonize. 
Achilles: 
You say that the parts are "independent", yet that can't be liter-
ally true. There has to be some coordination between them, otherwise 
when they were put together one would just have an unsystematic 
clashing of tones-and that is as far from the truth as could be. 
Anteater: 
A better way to state it might be this: if you listened to each voice 
on its own, you would find that it seemed to make sense all by itself. It 
could stand alone, and that is the sense in which I meant that it is 
independent. But you are quite right in pointing out that each of these 
individually meaningful lines fuses with the others in a highly nonran-
dom way, to make a graceful totality. The art of writing a beautiful 
fugue lies precisely in this ability, to manufacture several different 
lines, each one of which gives the illusion of having been written for its 
own beauty, and yet which when taken together form a whole, which 
does not feel forced in any way. Now, this dichotomy between hearing 
a fugue as a whole, and hearing its component voices, is a particular 
example of a very general dichotomy, which applies to many kinds of 
structures built up from lower levels. 
Achilles: 
Oh, really? You mean that my two "modes" may have some more 
general type of applicability, in situations other than fugue-listening? 
Anteater: 
Absolutely. 
Achilles: 
I wonder how that could be. I guess it has to do with alternating 
between perceiving something as a whole, and perceiving it as a collec-
tion of parts. But the only place I have ever run into that dichotomy is 
in listening to fugues. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, my, look at this! I just turned the page while following the 
music, and came across this magnificent illustration facing the first 
page of the fugue. 
Prelude . .. 
283 

Crab: 
I have never seen that illustration before. Why don't you pass it 
'round? 
(The Tortoise passes the book around. Each of the foursome looks at it in a 
characteristic way---this one from afar, that one from close up, everyone 
tipping his head this way and that in puzzlement. Finally it has made the 
rounds, and returns to the Tortoise, who peers at it rather intently.) 
Achilles: 
Well, I guess the prelude isjust about over. I wonder if, as I listen 
to this fugue, I will gain any more insight into the question, "What is 
the right way to listen to a fugue: as a whole, or as the sum of its parts?" 
TTortoise: 
Listen carefully, and you will!

CHAPTER X 
Levels of Description, 
and Computer Systems 
Levels of Description 
GODEL'S STRING G, and a Bach fugue: they both have the property that 
they can be understood on different levels. We are all familiar with this 
kind of thing; and yet in some cases it confuses us, while in others we 
handle it without any difficulty at all. For example, we all know that we 
human beings are composed of an enormous number of cells (around 
twenty-five trillion), and therefore that everything we do could in principle 
be described in terms of cells. Or it could even be described on the level of 
molecules. Most of us accept this in a rather matter-of-fact way; we go to 
the doctor, who looks at us on lower levels than we think of ourselves. We 
read about DNA and "genetic engineering" and sip our coffee. We seem to 
have reconciled these two inconceivably different pictures of ourselves 
simply by disconnecting them from each other. We have almost no way to 
relate a microscopic description of ourselves to that which we feel ourselves 
to be, and hence it is possible to store separate representations of ourselves 
in quite separate "compartments" of our minds. Seldom do we have to flip 
back and forth between these two concepts of ourselves, wondering "How 
can these two totally different things be the same me?" 
Or take a sequence of images on a television screen which shows 
Shirley MacLaine laughing. When we watch that sequence, we know that 
we are actually looking not at a woman, but at sets of flickering dots on a flat 
surface. We know it, but it is the furthest thing from our mind. We have 
these two wildly opposing representations of what is on the screen, but that 
does not confuse us. We can just shut one out, and pay attention to the 
other-which is what all of us do. Which one is "more real"? It depends on 
whether you're a human, a dog, a computer, or a television set. 
Chunking and Chess Skill 
One of the major problems of Artificial Intelligence research is to figure 
out how to bridge the gap between these two descriptions; how to construct 
a system which can accept one level of description, and produce the other. 
One way in which this gap enters Artificial Intelligence is well illustrated by 
the progress in knowledge about how to program a computer to play good 
chess. It used to be thought-in the 1950's and on into the 1960's-that the 
Levels of Description. and Computer Systems 
285 

trick to making a machine play well was to make the machine look further 
ahead into the branching network of possible sequences of play than any 
chess master can. However, as this goal gradually became attained, the level 
of computer chess did not have any sudden spurt, and surpass human 
experts. In fact, a human expert can quite soundly and confidently trounce 
the best chess programs of this day. 
The reason for this had actually been in print for many years. In the 
1940's, the Dutch psychologist Adriaan de Groot made studies of how chess 
novices and chess masters perceive a chess situation. Put in their starkest 
terms, his results imply that chess masters perceive the distribution of 
pieces in chunks. There is a higher-level description of the board than the 
straightforward "white pawn on K5, black rook on Q6" type of description, 
and the master somehow produces such a mental image of the board. This 
was proven by the high speed with which a master could reproduce an 
actual position taken from a game, compared with the novice's plodding 
reconstruction of the position, after both of them had had five-second 
glances at the board. Highly revealing was the fact that masters' mistakes 
involved placing whole groups of pieces in the wrong place, which left the 
game strategically almost the same, but to a novice's eyes, not at all the 
same. The clincher was to do the same experiment but with pieces ran-
domly assigned to the squares on the board, instead of copied from actual 
games. The masters were found to be simply no better than the novices in 
reconstructing such random boards. 
The conclusion is that in normal chess play, certain types of situation 
recur-certain patterns-and it is to those high-level patterns that the 
master is sensitive. He thinks on a d!fferent level from the novice; his set of 
concepts is different. Nearly everyone is surprised to find out that in actual 
play, a master rarely looks ahead any further than a novice does-and 
moreover, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves! 
The trick is that his mode of perceivmg the board is like a filter: he literally 
does not see bad moves when he looks at a chess situation-no more than chess 
amateurs see illegal moves when they look at a chess situation. Anyone who 
has played even a little chess has organized his perception so that diagonal 
rook-moves, forward captures by pawns, and so forth, are never brought to 
mind. Similarly, master-level players have built up higher levels of organi-
zation in the way they see the board; consequently, to them, bad moves are 
as unlikely to come to mind as illegal moves are~ to most people. This might 
be called implicit pruning of the giant branching tree of possibilities. By 
contrast, explicit pruning would involve thinking of a move, and after super-
ficial examination, deciding not to pursue examining it any further. 
The distinction can apply just as well to other intellectual activities-
for instance, doing mathematics. A gifted mathematician doesn't usually 
think up and tryout all sorts of false pathways to the desired theorem, as 
less gifted people might do; rather, he just "smells" the promising paths, 
and takes them immediately. 
Computer chess programs which rely'on looking ahead have not been 
taught to think on a higher level; the strategy has just been to use brute 
286 
Levels of Description. and Computer Systems 

force look-ahead, hoping to crush all types of opposition. But it has not 
worked. Perhaps someday, a look-ahead program with enough brute force 
will indeed overcome the best human players-but that will be a small 
intellectual gain, compared to the revelation that intelligence depends 
crucially on the ability to create high-level descriptions of complex arrays, 
such as chess boards, television screens, printed pages, or paintings. 
Similar Levels 
Usually, we are not required to hold more than one level of understanding 
of a situation in our minds at once. Moreover, the different descriptions of 
a single system are usually so conceptually distant from each other that, as 
was mentioned earlier, there is no problem in maintaining them both; they 
are just maintained in separate mental compartments. What is confusing, 
though, is when a single system admits of two or more descriptions on 
different levels which nevertheless resemble each other in some way. Then 
we find it hard to avoid mixing levels when we think about the system, and 
can easily get totally lost. 
Undoubtedly this happens when we think about our own 
psychology-for instance, when we try to understand people's motivations 
for various actions. There are many levels in the human mental 
structure-certainly it is a system which we do not understand very well yet. 
But there are hundreds of rival theories which tell why people act the way 
they do, each theory based on some underlying assumptions about how far 
down in this set of levels various kinds of psychological "forces" are found. 
Since at this time we use pretty much the same kind of language for all 
mental levels, this makes for much level-mixing and most certainly for 
hundreds of wrong theories. For instance, we talk of "drives"-for sex, for 
power, for fame, for love, etc., etc.-without knowing where these drives 
come from in the human mental structure. Without belaboring the point, I 
simply wish to say that our confusion about who we are is certainly related 
to the fact that we consist of a large set of levels, and we use overlapping 
language to describe ourselves on all of those levels. 
Computer Systems 
There is another place where many levels of description coexist for a single 
system, and where all the levels are conceptually quite close to one another. 
I am referring to computer systems. When a computer program is run-
ning, it can be viewed on a number of levels. On each level, the description 
is given in the language of computer science, which makes all the descrip-
tions similar in some ways to each other-yet there are extremely important 
differences between the views one gets on the different levels. At the lowest 
level, the description can be so complicated that it is like the dot-description 
of a television picture. For some purposes, however, this is by far the most 
important view. At the highest level, the description is greatly chunked, and 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
287 

takes on a completely different feeL despite the fact that many of the same 
concepts appear on the lowest and highest levels. The chunks on the 
high-level description are like the chess expert's chunks, and like the 
chunked description of the image on the screen: they summarize in capsule 
form a number of things which on lower levels are seen as separate. (See 
Fig. 57.) Now before things become too abstract, let us pass on to the

The idea of "chunking": a group of items is reperceived as a single "chunk". 
The chunk's boundnry is a little like a cell membrane or a national border: it establishes a 
separate identity for the cluster within. AC/:ording to context, one may wish to ignore the

concrete facts about computers, beginning with a very quick skim of what a 
computer system is like on the lowest leveL The lowest level? Well, not 
really, for I am not going to talk about elementary particles-but it is the 
lowest level which we wish to think about. 
At the conceptual rock-bottom of a computer, we find a memory, a 
central processing unit (CPU), and some input-output (I/O) devices. Let us first 
describe the memory. It is divided up into distinct physical pieces, called 
words. For the sake of concreteness, let us say there are 65,536 words of 
memory (a typical number, being 2 to the 16th power). A word is further 
divided into what we shall consider the atoms of computer science-bits. 
The number of bits in a typical word might be around thirty-six. Physically, 
a bit is just a magnetic "switch" that can be in either of two positions. 
lololxlolxlxlxlolxlololxlxlololxlolxlxlxlxlxlxlolxlxlololxlxlxlololololol 
--- a word of 36 bits ---
288 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

You could call the two positions "up" and "down", or "x" and "0", or "1" 
and "0" ... The third is the usual convention. It is perfectly fine, but it has 
the possibly misleading effect of making people think that a computer, 
deep down, is storing numbers. This is not true. A set of thirty-six bits does 
not have to be thought of as a number any more than two bits has to be 
thought of as the price of an ice cream cone. Just as money can do various 
things depending on how you use it, so a word in memory can serve many 
functions. Sometimes, to be sure, those thirty-six bits will indeed represent 
a number in binary notation. Other times, they may represent thirty-six 
dots on a television screen. And other times, they may represent a few 
letters of text. How a word in memory is to be thought of depends entirely 
on the role that this word plays in the program which uses it. It may, of 
course, play more than one role-like a note in a canon. 
Instructions and Data 
There is one interpretation of a word which I haven't yet mentioned, and 
that is as an instruction. The words of memory contain not only data to be 
acted on, but also the program to act on the data. There exists a limited 
repertoire of operations which can be carried out by the central processing 
unit-the CPU-and part of a word, usually its first several bits-is inter-
pretable as the name of the instruction-type which is to be carried out. 
What do the rest of the bits in a word-interpreted-as-instruction stand for? 
Most often, they tell which other words in memory are to be acted upon. In 
other words, the remaining bits constitute a pointer to some other word (or 
words) in memory. Every word in memory has a distinct location, like a 
house on a street; and its location is called its address. Memory may have one 
"street", or many "streets"-they are called "pages". So a given word is 
addressed by its page number (if memory is paged) together with its 
position within the page. Hence the "pointer" part of an instruction is the 
numerical address of some word(s) in memory. There are no restrictions 
on the pointer, so an instruction may even "point" at itself, so that when it is 
executed, it causes a change in itself to be made. 
How does the computer know what instruction to execute at any given 
time? This is kept track of in the CPU. The CPU has a special pointer which 
points at (i.e., stores the address of) the next word which is to be interpret-
ed as an instruction. The CPU fetches that word from memory, and copies 
it electronically into a special word belonging to the CPU itself. (Words in 
the CPU are usually not called "words", but rather, registers.) Then the CPU 
executes that instruction. Now the instruction may call for any of a large 
number of types of operations to be carried out. Typical ones include: 
ADD the word pointed to in the instruction, to a register. 
(In this case, the word pointed to is obviously interpreted as a 
number.) 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
289 

PRINT the word pointed to in the instruction, as letters. 
(In this case, the word is obviously interpreted not as a 
number, but as a string of letters.) 
JUMP to the word pointed to iII the instruction. 
(In this case, the CPU is being told to interpret that particular 
word as its next instruction.) 
Unless the instruction explicitly dictates otherwise, the CPU will pick 
up the very next word and interpret it as an instruction. In other words, the 
CPU assumes that it should move down the "street" sequentially, like a 
mailman, interpreting word after word as an instruction. But this sequen-
tial order can be broken by such instructions as the JUMP instruction, and 
others. 
Machine Language vs. Assembly language 
This is a very brief sketch of machine language. I n this language, the types of 
operations which exist constitute a finite repertoire which cannot be ex-
tended. Thus all programs, no matter how large and complex, must be 
made out of compounds of these types of instructions. Looking at a pro-
gram written in machine language is vaguely comparable to looking at a 
DNA molecule atom by atom. If you glance back to Fig. 41, showing the 
nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule-and then if you consider that 
each nucleotide contains two dozen atoms or so-and if you imagine trying 
to write the DNA, atom by atom, for a small virus (not to mention a human 
being!)-then you will get a feeling for what it is like to write a complex 
program in machine language, and what it is like to try to grasp what is 
going on in a program if you have access only to its machine language 
description. 
It must be mentioned, however, that computer programming was 
originally done on an even lower level, i.f possible, than that of machine 
language-namely, connecting wires to each other, so that the proper 
operations were "hard-wired" in. This is so amazingly primitive by modern 
standards that it is painful even to imagine. Yet undoubtedly the people 
who first did it experienced as much exhilaration as the pioneers of mod-
ern computers ever do ... 
We now wish to move to a higher level of the hierarchy of levels of 
description of programs. This is the a5sembly language level. There is not a 
gigantic spread between assembly language and machine language; indeed, 
the step is rather gentle. In essence, there is a one-to-one correspondence 
between assembly language instructions and machine language instruc-
tions. The idea of assembly language is to "chunk" the individual machine 
language instructions, so that instead of writing the sequence of bits 
"010111000" when you want an instruction which adds one number to 
another, you simply write ADD, and then instead of giving the address in 
binary representation, you can refer to the word in memory by a name.

Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

Therefore, a program in assembly language is very much like a machine 
language program made legible to humans. You might compare the 
machine language version of a program to a TNT -derivation done in the 
obscure Godel-numbered notation, and the assembly language version to 
the isomorphic TNT-derivation, done in the original TNT-notation, which 
is much easier to understand. Or, going back to the DNA image, we can 
liken the difference between machine language and assembly language to 
the difference between painfully specifying each nucleotide, atom by atom, 
and specifying a nucleotide by simply giving its name (i.e., 'A', 'G', 'C', or 
'T). There is a tremendous saving of labor in this very simple "chunking" 
operation, although conceptually not much has been changed. 
Programs That Translate Programs 
Perhaps the central point about assembly language is not its differences 
from machine language, which are not that enormous, but just the key idea 
that programs could be written on a different level at all! Just think about 
it: the hardware is built to "understand" machine language programs-se-
quences of bits-but not letters and decimal numbers. What happens when 
hardware is fed a program in assembly language? It is as if you tried to get a 
cell to accept a piece of paper with the nucleotide sequence written out in 
letters of the alphabet, instead of in chemicals. What can a cell do with a 
piece of paper? What can a computer do with an assembly language 
program? 
And here is the vital point: someone can write, in machine language, a 
translation program. This program, called an assembler, accepts mnemonic 
instruction names, decimal numbers, and other convenient abbreviations 
which a programmer can remember easily, and carries out the conversion 
into the monotonous but critical bit-sequences. After the assembly lan-
guage program has been assembled (i.e., translated), it is run-or rather, its 
machine language equivalent is run. But this is a matter of terminology. 
Which level program is running? You can never go wrong if you say that 
the machine language program is running, for hardware is always involved 
when any program runs-but it is also quite reasonable to think of the 
running program in terms of assembly language. For instance, you might 
very well say, "Right now, the CPU is executing a JUMP instruction", 
instead of saying, "Right now, the CPU is executing a '111010000' instruc-
tion". A pianist who plays the notes G-E-B E-G-B is also playing an arpeg-
gio in the chord of E minor. There is no reason to be reluctant about 
describing things from a higher-level point of view. So one can think of the 
assembly language program running concurrently with the machine lan-
guage program. We have two modes of describing what the CPU is doing.

Higher-Level Languages, Compilers, and Interpreters 
The next level of the hierarchy carries much further the extremely power-
ful idea of using the computer itself to translate programs from a high level 
into lower levels. After people had programmed in assembly language for a 
number of years, in the early 1950's, they realized that there were a 
number of characteristic structures which kept reappearing in program 
after program. There seemed to be, just as in chess, certain fundamental 
patterns which cropped up naturally when human beings tried to formu-
late algorithms-exact descriptions of processes they wanted carried out. In 
other words, algorithms seemed to have certain higher-level components, 
in terms of which they could be much more easily and esthetically specified 
than in the very restricted machine language, or assembly language. Typi-
cally, a high-level algorithm component consists not of one or two machine 
language instructions, but of a whole collection of them, not necesssarily all 
contiguous in memory. Such a component could be represented in a 
higher-level language by a single item-a chunk. 
Aside from standard chunks-the newly discovered components out 
of which all algorithms can be built--people realized that almost all pro-
grams contain even larger chunks---superchunks, so to speak. These 
superchunks differ from program to program, depending on the kinds of 
high-level tasks the program is supposed to carry out. We discussed super-
chunks in Chapter V, calling them by their usual names: "subroutines" and 
"procedures". It was clear that a most powerful addition to any program-
ming language would be the ability to define new higher-level entities in 
terms of previously known ones, and then to call them by name. This would 
build the chunking operation right into the language. Instead of there 
being a determinate repertoire of instructions out of which all programs 
had to be explicitly assembled, the programmer could construct his own 
modules, each with its own name, each usable anywhere inside the pro-
gram, just as if it had been a built-in feature of the language. Of course, 
there is no getting away from the fact that down below, on a machine 
language level, everything would still be composed of the same old machine 
language instructions, but that would not be explicitly visible to the high-
level programmer; it would be implicit. 
The new languages based on the50e ideas were called compiler languages. 
One of the earliest and most elegant was called "Algol", for "Algorithmic 
Language". Unlike the case with assembly language, there is no 
straightforward one-to-one correspondence between statements in Algol 
and machine language instructions. To be sure, there is still a type of 
mapping from Algol into machine language, but it is far more "scrambled" 
than that between assembly language and machine language. Roughly 
speaking, an Algol program is to its machine language translation as a word 
problem in an elementary algebra text is to the equation it translates into. 
(Actually, getting from a word problem to an equation is far more complex, 
but it gives some inkling of the types of "unscrambling" that have to be 
carried out in translating from a high-level language to a lower-level lan-
292 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

guage.) In the mid-1950's, successful programs called compilers were written 
whose function was to carry out the translation from compiler languages to 
machine language. 
Also, interpreters were invented. Like compilers, interpreters translate 
from high-level languages into machine language, but instead of translat-
ing all the statements first and then executing the machine code, they read 
one line and execute it immediately. This has the advantage that a user 
need not have written a complete program to use an interpreter. He may 
invent his program line by line, and test it out as he goes along. Thus, an 
interpreter is to a compiler as a simultaneous interpreter is to a translator 
of a written speech. One of the most important and fascinating of all 
computer languages is LISP (standing for "List Processing"), which was 
invented by John McCarthy around the time Algol was invented. Sub-
sequently, LISP has enjoyed great popularity with workers in Artificial 
Intelligence. 
There is one interesting difference between the way interpreters work 
and compilers work. A compiler takes input (a finished Algol program, for 
instance) and produces output (a long sequence of machine language 
instructions). At this point, the compiler has done its duty. The output is 
then given to the computer to run. By contrast, the interpreter is constantly 
running while the programmer types in one LISP statement after another, 
and each one gets executed then and there. But this doesn't mean that each 
statement gets first translated, then executed, for then an interpreter 
would be nothing but a line-by-line compiler. Instead, in an interpreter, the 
operations of reading a new line, "understanding" it, and executing it are 
intertwined: they occur simultaneously. 
Here is the idea, expanded a little more. Each time a new line of LISP 
is typed in, the interpreter tries to process it. This means that the interpret-
er jolts into action, and certain (machine language) instructions inside it get 
executed. Precisely which ones get executed depends on the LISP statement 
itself, of course. There are many JUMP instructions inside the interpreter, 
so that the new line of LISP may cause control to move around in a 
complex way-forwards, backwards, then forwards again, etc. Thus, each 
LISP statement gets converted into a "pathway" inside the interpreter, and 
the act of following that pathway achieves the desired effect. 
Sometimes it is helpful to think of the LISP statements as mere pieces 
of data which are fed sequentially to a constantly running machine lan-
guage program (the LISP interpreter). When you think of things this way, 
you get a different image of the relation between a program written in a 
higher-level language and the machine which is executing it. 
Bootstrapping 
Of course a compiler, being itself a program, has to be written in some 
language. The first compilers were written in assembly language, rather 
than machine language, thus taking full advantage of the already ac-
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
293 

complished first step up from machine language. A summary of these 
rather tricky concepts is presented in Figure 58. 
FIGURE 58. Assemblers and compilers 
are both translators into machine language. 
This is indicated by the solid lines. 
Moreover, since they are themselves pro-
grams, they are originally written in a lan-
guage also. The wavy lines indicate that a 
compiler can be written in assembly lan-
guage, and an assembler in machine lan-
guage. 
Now as sophistication increased, people realized that a partially written 
compiler could be used to compile extensions of itself. In other words, once 
a certain minimal core of a compiler had been written, then that minimal 
compiler could translate bigger compilers into machine language-which 
in turn could translate yet bigger compilers, until the final, full-blown 
compiler had been compiled. This process is affectionately known as 
"bootstrapping"-for obvious reasons (at least if your native language is 
English it is obvious). It is not so different from the attainment by a child of 
a critical level of fluency in his native language, from which point on his 
vocabulary and fluency can grow by leaps and bounds, since he can use 
language to acquire new language. 
Levels on Which to Describe Running Programs 
Compiler languages typically do not reflect the structure of the machines 
which will run programs written in them. This is one of their chief advan-
tages over the highly specialized assembly and machine languages. Of 
course, when a compiler language program is translated into machine 
language, the resulting program is machine-dependent. Therefore one can 
describe a program which is being executed in a machine-independent way 
or a machine-dependent way. It is like referring to a paragraph in a book 
by its subject matter (publisher-independent), or its page number and 
position on the page (publisher-dependent). 
As long as a program is running correctly, it hardly matters how you 
descrihe it or think of its functioning. It is when something goes wrong that 
294 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

it is important to be able to think on different levels. If, for instance, the 
machine is instructed to divide by zero at some stage, it will come to a halt 
and let the user know of this problem, by telling where in the program the 
questionable event occurred. However, the specification is often given on a 
lower level than that in which the programmer wrote the program. Here 
are three parallel descriptions of a program grinding to a halt: 
Machine Language Level: 
"Execution of the program stopped 
In location 
1110010101110111" 
Assembly Language Level: 
"Execution of the program stopped when the DIV (divide) 
instruction was hit" 
Compiler Language Level: 
"Execution of the program stopped during evaluation of the 
algebraic expression '(A + B)/Z' " 
One of the greatest problems for systems programmers (the people who 
write compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and other programs to be used by 
many people) is to figure out how to write error-detecting routines in such 
a way that the messages which they feed to the user whose program has a 
"bug" provide high-level, rather than low-level, descriptions of the prob-
lem. It is an interesting reversal that when something goes wrong in a 
genetic "program" (e.g., a mutation), the "bug" is manifest only to people 
on a high level-namely on the phenotype level, not the genotype level. 
Actually, modern biology uses mutations as one of its principal windows 
onto genetic processes, because of their multilevel traceability. 
Microprogramming and Operating Systems 
In modern computer systems, there are several other levels of the hierar-
chy. For instance, some systems-often the so-called "microcomputers"-
come with machine language instructions which are even more rudimen-
tary than the instruction to add a number in memory to a number in a 
register. It is up to the user to decide what kinds of ordinary machine-level 
instructions he would like to be able to program in; he "microprograms" 
these instructions in terms of the "micro-instructions" which are available. 
Then the "higher-level machine language" instructions which he has de-
signed may be burned into the circuitry and become hard-wired, although 
they need not be. Thus microprogramming allows the user to step a little 
below the conventional machine language level. One of the consequences is 
that a computer of one manufacturer can be hard-wired (via micropro-
gramming) so as to have the same machine language instruction set as a 
computer of the same, or even another, manufacturer. The micropro-
grammed computer is said to be "emulating" the other computer. 
Then there is the level of the operating system, which fits between the 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
295 

machine language program and whatever higher level the user is pro-
gramming in. The operating system is itself a program which has the 
functions of shielding the bare machine from access by users (thus protect-
ing the system), and also of insulating the programmer from the many 
extremely intricate and messy problems of reading the program, calling a 
translator, running the translated program, directing the output to the 
proper channels at the proper time, and passing control to the next user. If 
there are several users "talking" to the same CPU at once, then the operat-
ing system is the program that shifts attention from one to the other in 
some orderly fashion. The complexities of operating systems are formida-
ble indeed, and I shall only hint at them by the following analogy. 
Consider the first telephone sy~tem. Alexander Graham Bell could 
phone his assistant in the next room: electronic transmission of a voice! 
Now that is like a bare computer minus operating system: electronic com-
putation! Consider now a modern telephone system. You have a choice of 
other telephones to connect to. Not only that, but many different calls can 
be handled simultaneously. You can add a prefix and dial into different 
areas. You can call direct, through the operator, collect, by credit card, 
person-to-person, on a conference call. You can have a call rerouted or 
traced. You can get a busy signal. You can get a siren-like signal that says 
that the number you dialed isn't "well-formed", or that you have taken too 
in long in dialing. You can install a local switchboard so that a group of 
phones are all locally connected-etc., etc. The list is amazing, when you 
think of how much flexibility there is, particularly in comparison to the 
erstwhile miracle of a "bare" telephone. Now sophisticated operating sys-
tems carry out similar traffic-handling and level-switching operations with 
respect to users and their programs. It is virtually certain that there are 
somewhat parallel things which take place in the brain: handling of many 
stimuli at the same time; decisions of what should have priority over what 
and for how long; instantaneous "interrupts" caused by emergenCies or 
other unexpected occurrences; and !>o on. 
Cushioning the User and Protecting the System 
The many levels in a complex computer system have the combined effect of 
"cushioning" the user, preventing him from having to think about the 
many lower-level goings-on which are most likely totally irrelevant to him 
anyway. A passenger in an airplane does not usually want to be aware of the 
levels of fuel in the tanks, or the wind speeds, or how many chicken dinners 
are to be served, or the status of the rest of the air traffic around the 
destination-this is all left to employees on different levels of the airlines 
hierarchy, and the passenger simply gets from one place to another. Here 
again, it is when something goes wrong-such as his baggage not arriving-
that the passenger is made aware of the confusing system of levels under-
neath him. 
296 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

Are Computers Super-Flexible or Super-Rigid? 
One of the major goals of the drive to higher levels has always been to make 
as natural as possible the task of communicating to the computer what you 
want it to do. Certainly, the high-level constructs in compiler languages are 
closer to the concepts which humans naturally think in, than are lower-level 
constructs such as those in machine language. But in this drive towards ease 
of communication, one aspect of "naturalness" has been quite neglected. 
That is the fact that interhuman communication is far less rigidly con-
strained than human-machine communication. For instance, we often pro-
duce meaningless sentence fragments as we search for the best way to 
express something, we cough in the middle of sentences, we interrupt each 
other, we use ambiguous descriptions and "improper" syntax, we coin 
phrases and distort meanings-but our message still gets through, mostly. 
With programming languages, it has generally been the rule that there is a 
very strict syntax which has to be obeyed one hundred per cent of the time; 
there are no ambiguous words or constructions. Interestingly, the printed 
equivalent of coughing (i.e., a nonessential or irrelevant comment) is al-
lowed, but only provided it is signaled in advance by a key word (e.g., 
COMMENT), and then terminated by another key word (e.g., a semicolon). 
This small gesture towards flexibility has its own little pitfall, ironically: if a 
semicolon (or whatever key word is used for terminating a comment) is 
used inside a comment, the translating program will interpret that semico-
lon as signaling the end of the comment, and havoc will ensue. 
If a procedure named INSIGHT has been defined and then called 
seventeen times in the program, and the eighteenth time it is misspelled as 
INSIHGT, woe to the programmer. The compiler will balk and print a 
rigidly unsympathetic error message, saying that it has never heard of 
INSIHGT. Often, when such an error is detected by a compiler, the compiler 
tries to continue, but because of its lack of insihgt, it has not understood 
what the programmer meant. In fact, it may very well suppose that some-
thing entirely different was meant, and proceed under that erroneous 
assumption. Then a long series of error messages will pepper the rest of the 
program, because the compiler-not the programmer-got confused. 
Imagine the chaos that would result if a simultaneous English-Russian 
interpreter, upon hearing one phrase of French in the English, began 
trying to interpret all the remaining English as French. Compilers often get 
lost in such pathetic ways. C'est La vie. 
Perhaps this sounds condemnatory of computers, but it is not meant to 
be. In some sense, things had to be that way. When you stop to think what 
most people use computers for, you realize that it is to carry out very 
definite and precise tasks, which are too complex for people to do. If the 
computer is to be reliable, then it is necessary that it should understand, 
without the slightest chance of ambiguity, what it is supposed to do. It is 
also necessary that it should do neither more nor less than it is explicitly 
instructed to do. If there is, in the cushion underneath the programmer, a 
program whose purpose is to "guess" what the programmer wants or 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
297 

means, then it is quite conceivable that the programmer could try to 
communicate his task and be totally misunderstood. So it is important that 
the high-level program, while comfortable for the human, still should be 
unambiguous and precise. 
Second-Guessing the Programmer 
Now it is possible to devise a programming language-and a program 
which translates it into the lower levels-which allows some sorts of impre-
cision. One way of putting it would be to say that a translator for such a 
programming language tries to make sense of things which are done 
"outside of the rules of the language". But if a language allows certain 
"transgressions", then transgressions of that type are no longer true trans-
gressions, because they have been included inside the rules! If a program-
mer is aware that he may make certain types of misspelling, then he may 
use this feature of the language deliberately, krlowing that he is actually 
operating within the rigid rules of the language, despite appearances. In 
other words, if the user is aware of all the flexibilities programmed into the 
translator for his convenience, then he knows the bounds which he cannot 
overstep, and therefore, to him, the translator still appears rigid and 
inflexible, although it may allow him much more freedom than early 
versions of the language, which did not incorporate "automatic compensa-
tion for human error". 
With "rubbery" languages of that type, there would seem to be two 
alternatives: (1) the user is aware of the built-in flexibilities of the language 
and its translator; (2) the user is unaware of them. In the first case, the 
language is still usable for communicating programs precisely, because the 
programmer can predict how the computer will interpret the programs he 
writes in the language. In the second case, the "cushion" has hidden 
features which may do things that are unpredictable (from the vantage 
point of a user who doesn't know the inner workings of the translator). 
This may result in gross misinterpretations of programs, so such a lan-
guage is unsuitable for purposes where computers are used mainly for 
their speed and reliability. 
Now there is actually a third alternative: (3) the user is aware of the 
built-in flexibilities of the language and its translator, but there are so many 
of them and they interact with each other in such a complex way that he 
cannot tell how his programs will be interpreted. This may well apply to the 
person who wrote the translating program; he certainly knows its insides as 
well as anyone could-but he still may not be able to anticipate how it will 
react to a given type of unusual construction. 
One of the major areas of research in Artificial Intelligence today is 
called automatic programming, which is concerned with the development of 
yet higher-level languages-languages whose translators are sophisticated, 
in that they can do at least some of the following impressive things: 
generalize from examples, correct some misprints or grammatical errors, 
298 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

try to make sense of ambiguous descriptions, try to second-guess the user 
by having a primitive user model, ask questions when things are unclear, 
use English itself, etc. The hope is that one can walk the tightrope between 
reliability and flexibility. 
AI Advances Are Language Advances 
It is striking how tight the connection is between progress in computer 
science (particularly Artificial Intelligence) and the development of new 
languages. A clear trend has emerged in the last decade: the trend to 
consolidate new types of discoveries in new languages. One key for the 
understanding and creation of intelligence lies in the constant development 
and refinement of the languages in terms of which processes for symbol 
manipulation are describable. Today, there are probably three or four 
dozen experimental languages which have been developed exclusively for 
Artificial Intelligence research. It is important to realize that any program 
which can be written in one of these languages is in principle program-
mable in lower-level languages, but it would require a supreme effort for a 
human; and the resulting program would be so long that it would exceed 
the grasp of humans. It is not that each higher level extends the potential of 
the computer; the full potential of the computer already exists in its 
machine language instruction set. It is that the new concepts in a high-level 
language suggest directions and perspectives by their very nature. 
The "space" of all possible programs is so huge that no one can have a 
sense of what is possible. Each higher-level language is naturally suited for 
exploring certain regions of "program space"; thus the programmer, by 
using that language, is channeled into those areas of program space. He is 
notforced by the language into writing programs of any particular type, but 
the language makes it easy for him to do certain kinds of things. Proximity 
to a concept, and a gentle shove, are often all that is needed for a major 
discovery-and that is the reason for the drive towards languages of ever 
higher levels. 
Programming in different languages is like composing pieces in dif-
ferent keys, particularly if you work at the keyboard. If you have learned or 
written pieces in many keys, each key will have its own special emotional 
aura. Also, certain kinds of figurations "lie in the hand" in one key but are 
awkward in another. So you are channeled by your choice of key. In some 
ways, even enharmonic keys, such as C-sharp and D-flat, are quite distinct 
in feeling. This shows how a notational system can playa significant role in 
shaping the final product. 
A "stratified" picture of AI is shown in Figure 59, with machine 
components such as transistors on the bottom, and "intelligent programs" 
on the top. The picture is taken from the book Artificial Intelligence by 
Patrick Henry Winston, and it represents a vision of AI shared by nearly all 
AI workers. Although I agree with the idea that AI must be stratified in 
some such way, I do not think that, with so few layers, intelligent programs

can be reached. Between the machine language level and the level where 
true intelligence will be reached, I am convinced there will lie perhaps 
another dozen (or even several dozen:) layers, each new layer building on 
and extending the flexibilities of the layer below. What they will be like we 
can hardly dream of now ... 
The Paranoid and the Operating System 
The similarity of all levels in a computer system can lead to some strange 
level-mixing experiences. I once watched a couple of friends-both com-
puter novices-playing with the program "PARRY" on a terminal. PARRY 
is a rather infamous program which simulates a paranoid in an extremely 
rudimentary way, by spitting out canned phrases in English chosen from a 
wide repertoire; its plausibility is due to its ability to tell which of its stock 
phrases might sound reasonable in response to English sentences typed to 
it by a human. 
At one point, the response time got very sluggish-PARRY was taking 
very long to reply-and I explained to my friends that this was probably 
because of the heavy load on the time-sharing system. I told them they 
could find out how many users were logged on, by typing a special "con-
trol" character which would go directly to the operating system, and would 
be unseen by PARRY. One of my friends pushed the control character. In a 
flash, some internal data about the operating system's status overwrote 
some of PARRY's words on the screen. PARRY knew nothing of this: it is a 
program with "knowledge" only of horse racing and bookies-not operat-
ing systems and terminals and special control characters. But to my friends, 
both PARRY and the operating system were just "the computer"-a mys-
terious, remote, amorphous entity that responded to them when they 
typed. And so it made perfect sense when one of them blithely typed, in 
English, "Why are you overtyping what's on the screen?" The idea that 
PARRY could know nothing about the operating system it was running 
300 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

under was not clear to my friends. The idea that "you" know all about 
"yourself" is so familiar from interaction with people that it was natural to 
extend it to the computer-after all, it was intelligent enough that it could 
"talk" to them in English! Their question was not unlike asking a person, 
"Why are you making so few red blood cells today?" People do not know 
about that level-the "operating system level"-of their bodies. 
The main cause of this level-confusion was that communication with all 
levels of the computer system was taking place on a single screen, on a 
single terminal. Although my friends' naivete might seem rather extreme, 
even experienced computer people often make similar errors when several 
levels of a complex system are all present at once on the same screen. They 
forget "who" they are talking to, and type something which makes no sense 
at that level, although it would have made perfect sense on another level. It 
might seem desirable, therefore, to have the system itself sort out the 
levels-to interpret commands according to what "makes sense". Unfortu-
nately, such interpretation would require the system to have a lot of 
common sense, as well as perfect knowledge of the programmer's overall 
intent-both of which would require more artificial intelligence than exists 
at the present time. 
The Border between Software and Hardware 
One can also be confused by the flexibility of some levels and the rigidity of 
others. For instance, on some computers there are marvelous text-editing 
systems which allow pieces of text to be "poured" from one format into 
another, practically as liquids can be poured from one vessel into another. 
A thin page can turn into a wide page, or vice versa. With such power, you 
might expect that it would be equally trivial to change from one font to 
another-say from roman to italics. Yet there may be only a single font 
available on the screen, so that such changes are impossible. Or it may be 
feasible on the screen but not printable by the printer-or the other way 
around. After dealing with computers for a long time, one gets spoiled, and 
thinks that everything should be programmable: no printer should be so 
rigid as to have only one character set, or even a finite repertoire of 
them-typefaces should be user-specifiable! But once that degree of flexi-
bility has been attained, then one may be annoyed that the printer cannot 
print in different colors of ink, or that it cannot accept paper of all shapes 
and sizes, or that it does not fix itself when it breaks ... 
The trouble is that somewhere, all this flexibility has to "bottom out", 
to use the phrase from Chapter V. There must be a hardware level which 
underlies it all, and which is inflexible. It may lie deeply hidden, and there 
may be so much flexibility on levels above it that few users feel the 
hardware limitations-but it is inevitably there. 
What is this proverbial distinction between software and hardware? It is 
the distinction between programs and machines-between long compli-
cated sequences of instructions, and the physical machines which carry 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 
301 

them out. I like to think of software as "anything which you could send over 
the telephone lines", and hardware as "anything else". A piano is hardware, 
but printed music is software. A telephone set is hardware, but a telephone 
number is software. The distinction is a useful one, but not always so 
clear-cut. 
We humans also have "software" and "hardware" aspects, and the 
difference is second nature to us. We are used to the rigidity of our 
physiology: the fact that we cannot, at will, cure ourselves of diseases, or 
grow hair of any color-to mention just a couple of simple examples. We 
can, however, "reprogram" our minds so that we operate in new conceptual 
frameworks. The amazing flexibility of our minds seems nearly irreconcil-
able with the notion that our brains must be made out of fixed-rule 
hardware, which cannot be reprogrammed. We cannot make our neurons 
fire faster or slower, we cannot rewire our brains, we cannot redesign the 
interior of a neuron, we cannot make any choices about the hardware-and 
yet, we can control how we think. 
But there are clearly aspects of thought which are beyond our control. 
We cannot make ourselves smarter by an act of will; we cannot learn a new 
language as fast as we want; we cannot make ourselves think faster than we 
do; we cannot make ourselves think about several things at once; and so on. 
This is a kind of primordial self-knowledge which is so obvious that it is 
hard to see it at all; it is like being conscious that the air is there. We never 
really bother to think about what might cause these "defects" of our minds: 
namely, the organization of our brains. To suggest ways of reconciling the 
software of mind with the hardware of brain is a main goal of this book. 
Intermediate Levels and the Weather 
We have seen that in computer systems, there are a number of rather 
sharply defined strata, in terms of anyone of which the operation of a 
running program can be described. Thus there is not merely a single low 
level and a single high level-there are all degrees of lowness and highness. 
Is the existence of intermediate levels a general feature of systems which 
have low and high levels? Consider, for example, the system whose 
"hardware" is the earth's atmosphere (not very hard, but no matter), and 
whose "software" is the weather. Keeping track of the motions of all of the 
molecules simultaneously would be a very low-level way of "understanding" 
the weather, rather like looking at a huge, complicated program on the 
machine language level. Obviously it i,~ way beyond human comprehension. 
But we still have our own peculiarly human ways of looking at, and 
describing, weather phenomena. Our chunked view of the weather is based 
on very high-level phenomena, such as: rain, fog, snow, hurricanes, cold 
fronts, seasons, pressures, trade winds, the jet stream, cumulo-nimbus 
clouds, thunderstorms, inversion layers, and so on. All of these phenomena 
involve astronomical numbers of molecules, somehow behaving in concert 
so that large-scale trends emerge. This is a little like looking at the weather 
in a compiler language. 
302 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

Is there something analogous to looking at the weather in an 
intermediate-level language, such as assembly language? For instance, are 
there very small local "mini-storms", something like the small whirlwinds 
which one occasionally sees, whipping up some dust in a swirling column a 
few feet wide, at most? Is a local gust of wind an intermediate-level chunk 
which plays a role in creating higher-level weather phenomena? Or is there 
just no practical way of combining knowledge of such kinds of phenomena 
to create a more comprehensive explanation of the weather? 
Two other questions come to my mind. The first is: "Could it be that 
the weather phenomena which we perceive on our scale-a tornado, a 
drought-are just intermediate-level phenomena: parts of vaster, slower 
phenomena?" If so, then true high-level weather phenomena would be 
global, and their time scale would be geological. The Ice Age would be a 
high-level weather event. The second question is: "Are there intermediate-
level weather phenomena which have so far escaped human perception, 
but which, if perceived, could give greater insight into why the weather is as 
it is?" 
From Tornados to Quarks 
This last suggestion may sound fanciful, but it is not all that far-fetched. We 
need only look to the hardest of the hard sciences-physics-to find pecu-
liar examples of systems which are explained in terms of interacting "parts" 
which are themselves invisible. In physics, as in any other discipline, a system 
is a group of interacting parts. In most systems that we know, the parts 
retain their identities during the interaction, so that we still see the parts 
inside the system. For example, when a team of football players assembles, 
the individual players retain their separateness-they do not melt into 
some composite entity, in which their individuality is lost. Still-and this is 
important-some processes are going on in their brains which are evoked 
by the team-context, and which would not go on otherwise, so that in a 
minor way, the players change identity when they become part of the larger 
system, the team. This kind of system is called a nearly decomposable system 
(the term comes from H. A. Simon's article "The Architecture of Complex-
ity"; see the Bibliography). Such a system consists of weakly interacting 
modules, each of which maintains its own private identity throughout the 
interaction but by becoming slightly different from how it is when outside 
of the system, contributes to the cohesive behavior of the whole system. 
The systems studied in physics are usually of this type. For instance, an 
atom is seen as made of a nucleus whose positive charge captures a number 
of electrons in "orbits", or bound states. The bound electrons are very 
much like free electrons, despite their being internal to a composite object. 
Some systems studied in physics offer a contrast to the relatively 
straightforward atom. Such systems involve extremely strong interactions, 
as a result of which the parts are swallowed up into the larger system, and 
lose some or all of their individuality. An example of this is the nucleus of 
an atom, which is usually described as being "a collection of protons and 
Levels of DescrIption, and Computer Systems 
303 

neutrons". But the forces which pull the component particles together are 
so strong that the component particles do not survive in anything like their 
"free" form (the form they have when outside a nucleus). And in fact a 
nucleus acts in many ways as a single particle, rather than as a collection of 
interacting particles. When a nucleus is split, protons and neutrons are 
often released, but also other particles, such as pi-mesons and gamma rays, 
are commonly produced. Are all those different particles physically present 
inside a nucleus before it is split, or are they just "sparks" which fly off 
when the nucleus is split? It is perhaps not meaningful to try to give an 
answer to such a question. On the level of particle physics, the difference 
between storing the potential to make "sparks" and storing actual subparti-
cles is not so clear. 
A nucleus is thus one system whose "parts", even though they are not 
visible while on the inside, can be pulled out and made visible. However, 
there are more pathological cases, such as the proton and neutron seen as 
systems themselves. Each of them has been hypothesized to be constituted 
from a trio of "quarks"-hypothetical particles which can be combined in 
twos or threes to make many known fundamental particles. However, the 
interaction between quarks is so strong that not only can they not be seen 
inside the proton and neutron, but they cannot even be pulled out at all! 
Thus, although quarks help to give a theoretical understanding of certain 
properties of protons and neutrons, their own existence may perhaps 
never be independently established. Here we have the antithesis of a 
"nearly decomposable system"-it is a system which, if anything, is "nearly 
indecomposable". Yet what is curious is that a quark-based theory of 
protons and neutrons (and other particles) has considerable explanatory 
power, in that many experimental results concerning the particles which 
quarks supposedly compose can be accounted for quite well, quantitatively, 
by using the "quark model". 
Superconductivity: A "Paradox" of Renormalization 
In Chapter V we discussed how renormalized particles emerge from their 
bare cores, by recursively compounded interactions with virtual particles. A 
renormalized particle can be seen either as this complex mathematical 
construct, or as the single lump which it is, physically. One of the strangest 
and most dramatic consequences of this way of describing particles is the 
explanation it provides for the famous phenomenon of superconductivity: 
resistance-free flow of electrons in certain solids, at extremely low tempera-
tures. 
It turns out that electrons in solids are renormalized by their interac-
tions with strange quanta of vibration called phonons (themselves renor-
malized as well!). These renormalized electrons are called polarons. Calcula-
tion shows that at very low temperatures, two oppositely spinning polarons 
will begin to attract each other, and can actually become bound together in 
a certain way. Under the proper conditions, all the current-carrying polar-
304 
Levels of DescrIptIon, and Computer Systems 

ons will get paired up, forming Cooper pairs. Ironically, this pairing comes 
about precisely because electrons-the bare cores of the paired polarons-
repel each other electrically. In contrast to the electrons, each Cooper pair 
feels neither attracted to nor repelled by any other Cooper pair, and 
consequently it can can slip freely through a metal as if the metal were a 
vacuum. If you convert the mathematical description of such a metal from 
one whose primitive units are polarons into one whose primitive units are 
Cooper pairs, you get a considerably simplified set of equations. This 
mathematical simplicity is the physicist's way of knowing that "chunking" 
into Cooper pairs is the natural way to look at superconductivity. 
Here we have several levels of particle: the Cooper pair itself; the two 
oppositely spinning polarons which compose it; the electrons and phonons 
which make up the polarons; and then, within the electrons, the virtual 
photons and positrons, etc. etc. We can look at each level and perceive 
phenomena there, which are explained by an understanding of the levels 
below. 
"Sealing -off" 
Similarly, and fortunately, one does not have to know all about quarks to 
understand many things about the particles which they may compose. 
Thus, a nuclear physicist can proceed with theories of nuclei that are based 
on protons and neutrons, and ignore quark theories and their rivals. The 
nuclear physicist has a chunked picture of protons and neutrons-a descrip-
tion derived from lower-level theories but which does not require under-
standing the lower-level theories. Likewise, an atomic physicist has a 
chunked picture of an atomic nucleus derived from nuclear theory. Then a 
chemist has a chunked picture of the electrons and their orbits, and builds 
theories of small molecules, theories which can be taken over in a chunked 
way by the molecular biologist, who has an intuition for how small 
molecules hang together, but whose technical expertise is in the field of 
extremely large molecules and how they interact. Then the cell biologist 
has a chunked picture of the units which the molecular biologist pores over, 
and tries to use them to account for the ways that cells interact. The point is 
clear. Each level is, in some sense, "sealed off" from the levels below it. 
This is another of Simon's vivid terms, recalling the way in which a sub-
marine is built in compartments, so that if one part is damaged, and water 
begins pouring in, the trouble can be prevented from spreading, by closing 
the doors, thereby sealing off the damaged compartment from neighbor-
ing compartments. 
Although there is always some "leakage" between the hierarchical 
levels of science, so that a chemist cannot afford to ignore lower-level 
physics totally, or a biologist to ignore chemistry totally, there is almost no 
leakage from one level to a distant level. That is why people can have 
intuitive understandings of other people without necessarily understand-
ing the quark model, the structure of nuclei, the nature of electron orbits, 
Levels of DescrIptIon, and Computer Systems 
305 

the chemical bond, the structure of proteins, the organelles in a cell, the 
methods of intercellular communication, the physiology of the various 
organs of the human body, or the complex interactions among organs. All 
that a person needs is a chunked model of how the highest level acts; and as 
we all know, such models are very realistic and successful. 
The Trade-off between Chunking and Determinism 
There is, however, perhaps one significant negative feature of a chunked 
model: it usually does not have exact predictive power. That is, we save 
ourselves from the impossible task of seeing people as collections of quarks 
(or whatever is at the lowest level) by using chunked models; but of course 
such models only give us probabilistic estimates of how other people feel, 
will react to what we say or do, and so on. In short, in using chunked 
high-level models, we sacrifice determinism for simplicity. Despite not 
being sure how people will react to a joke, we tell it with the expectation 
that they will do something such as laugh, or not laugh-rather than, say, 
climb the nearest flagpole. (Zen masters might well do the latter!) A 
chunked model defines a "space" within which behavior is expected to fall, 
and specifies probabilities of its falling in different parts of that space. 
"Computers Can Only Do What You Tell Them to Do" 
Now these ideas can be applied as well to computer programs as to compo-
site physical systems. There is an old saw which says, "Computers can only 
do what you tell them to do." This i5 right in one sense, but it misses the 
point: you don't know in advance the consequences of what you tell a 
computer to do; therefore its behavior can be as baffling and surprising 
and unpredictable to you as that of a person. You generally know in 
advance the space in which the output will fall, but you don't know details of 
where it will fall. For instance, you might write a program to calculate the 
first million digits of 7T'. Your program will spew forth digits of 7T' much 
faster than you can-but there is no paradox in the fact that the computer 
is outracing its programmer. You know in advance the space in which the 
output will lie-namely the space of digits between 0 and 9-which is to say, 
you have a chunked model of the program's behavior; but if you'd known 
the rest, you wouldn't have written the program. 
There is another sense in which this old saw is rusty. This involves the 
fact that as you program in ever higher-level languages, you know less and 
less precisely what you've told the computer to do! Layers and layers of 
translation may separate the "front end" of a complex program from the 
actual machine language instructions. At the level you think and program, 
your statements may resemble declaratives and suggestions more than they 
resemble imperatives or commands. And all the internal rumbling pro-
voked by the input of a high-level statement is invisible to you, generally, 
just as when you eat a sandwich, you are spared conscious awareness of the 
digestive processes that it triggers. 
306 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

In any case, this notion that "computers can only do what they are told 
to do," first propounded by Lady Lovelace in her famous memoir, is so 
prevalent and so connected with the notion that "computers cannot think" 
that we shall return to it in later Chapters when our level of sophistication is 
greater. 
Two Types of System 
There is an important division between two types of system built up from 
many parts. There are those systems in which the behavior of some parts 
tends to cancel out the behavior of other parts, with the result that it does 
not matter too much what happens on the low level, because most anything 
will yield similar high-level behavior. An example of this kind of system is a 
container of gas, where all the molecules bump and bang against each other 
in very complex microscopic ways; but the total outcome, from a macro-
scopic point of view, is a very calm, stable system with a certain tempera-
ture, pressure, and volume. Then there are systems where the effect of a 
single low-level event may get magnified into an enormous- high-level conse-
quence. Such a system is a pinball machine, where the exact angle with 
which a ball strikes each post is crucial in determining the rest of its 
descending pathway. 
A computer is an elaborate combination of these two types of system. It 
contains subunits such as wires, which behave in a highly predictable 
fashion: they conduct electricity according to Ohm's law, a very precise, 
chunked law which resembles the laws governing gases in containers, since 
it depends on statistical effects in which billions of random effects cancel 
each other out, yielding a predictable overall behavior. A computer also 
contains macroscopic subunits, such as a printer, whose behavior is com-
pletely determined by delicate patterns of currents. What the printer prints 
is not by any means created by a myriad canceling microscopic effects. In 
fact, in the case of most computer programs, the value of every single bit in 
the program plays a critical role in the output that gets printed. If any bit 
were changed, the output would also change drastically. 
Systems which are made up of "reliable" subsystems only-that is, 
subsystems whose behavior can be reliably predicted from chunked 
descriptions-play inestimably important roles in our daily lives, because 
they are pillars of stability. We can rely on walls not to fall down, on 
sidewalks to go where they went yesterday, on the sun to shine, on clocks to 
tell the time correctly, and so on. Chunked models of such systems are 
virtually entirely deterministic. Of course, the other kind of system which 
plays a very large role in our lives is a system that has variable behavior 
which depends on some internal microscopic parameters-often a very 
large number of them, moreover-which we cannot directly observe. Our 
chunked model of such a system is necessarily in terms of the "space" of 
operation, and involves probabilistic estimates of landing in different re-
gions of that space. 
A container of gas, which, as I already pointed out, is a reliable system 
Levels of DescrIption, and Computer Systems 
307 

because of many canceling effects, obeys precise, deterministic laws of 
physics. Such laws are chunked laws, in that they deal with the gas as a whole, 
and ignore its constituents. Furthermore, the microscopic and macroscopic 
descriptions of a gas use entirely different terms. The former requires the 
specification of the position and velocity of every single component 
molecule; the latter requires only the specification of three new quantities: 
temperature, pressure, and volume, the first two of which do not even have 
microscopic counterparts. The simple mathematical relationship which 
relates these three parameters- pV = cT, where c is a constant-is a law 
which depends on, yet is independent of, the lower-level phenomena. Less 
paradoxically, this law can be derived from the laws governing the molecu-
lar level; in that sense it depends on the lower level. On the other hand, it is 
a law which allows you to ignore the lower level completely, if you wish; in 
that sense it is independent of the lower level. 
It is important to realize that the high-level law cannot be stated in the 
vocabulary of the low-level description. "Pressure" and "temperature" are 
new terms which experience with the low level alone cannot convey. We 
humans perceive temperature and pressure directly; that is how we are 
built, so that it is not amazing that we should have found this law. But 
creatures which knew gases only as theoretical mathematical constructs 
would have to have an ability to synthesize new concepts, if they were to 
discover this law. 
Epiphenomena 
In drawing this Chapter to a close, I would like to relate a story about a 
complex system. I was talking one day with two systems programmers for 
the computer I was using. They mentioned that the operating system 
seemed to be able to handle up to about thirty-five users with great com-
fort, but at about thirty-five users or so, the response time all of a sudden 
shot up, getting so slow that you might as well log off and go home and wait 
until later. Jokingly I said, "Well, that's simple to fix-just find the place in 
the operating system where the number '35' is stored, and change it to 
'60'!" Everyone laughed. The point is, of course, that there is no such place. 
Where, then, does the critical number-35 users-come from? The answer 
is: It is a visible consequence of the overall system organization-an "epiphenome-
non". 
Similarly, you might ask about a sprinter, "Where is the '9.3' stored, 
that makes him be able to run 100 yards in 9.3 seconds?" Obviously, it is not 
stored anywhere. His time is a result of how he is built, what his reaction 
time is, a million factors all interacting when he runs. The time is quite 
reproducible, but it is not stored in his body anywhere. It is spread around 
among all the cells of his body and only manifests itself in the act of the 
sprint itself. 
Epiphenomena abound. In the game of "Go", there is the feature that 
"two eyes live". It is not built into the rules, but it is a consequence of the 
308 
Levels of Description, and Computer Systems 

rules. In the human brain, there is gullibility. How gullible are you? Is your 
gullibility located in some "gullibility center" in your brain? Could a 
neurosurgeon reach in and perform some delicate operation to lower your 
gullibility, otherwise leaving you alone? If you believe this, you are pretty 
gullible, and should perhaps consider such an operation. 
Mind vs. Brain 
In coming Chapters, where we discuss the brain, we shall examine whether 
the brain's top level-the mind-can be understood without understanding 
the lower levels on which it both depends and does not depend. Are there 
laws of thinking which are "sealed off" from the lower laws that govern the 
microscopic activity in the cells of the brain? Can mind be "skimmed" off of 
brain and transplanted into other systems? Or is it impossible to unravel 
thinking processes into neat and modular subsystems? Is the brain more 
like an atom, a renormalized electron, a nucleus, a neutron, or a quark? Is 
consciousness an epiphenomenon? To understand the mind, must one go 
all the way down to the level of nerve cells?

. . . then, one by one, the four voices of the fugue chime in.) 
Achilles: 
I know the rest of you won't believe this, but the answer to the

CCrab: 
I know the rest of you won't believe this, but the answer to the

Now hold on a minute. You must be seeing things. It's plain as

Crab: 
I beg your pardon, but my eyesight is extremely good. Please look

Crab: 
Now hold on a minute. You must be seeing things. It's plain as day

Achilles: 
Another deluded one! Not "HOLISM", not "REDUCTIONISM", but 
"MU" is the message of this picture, and that much is certain. 
Anteater: 
I beg your pardon, but my eyesight is extremely clear. Please 
look again, and then see if the picture doesn't say what I said it says. 
Achilles: 
Don't you see that the picture is composed of two pieces, and that 
each of them is a single letter? 
Crab: 
You are right about the two pieces, but you are wrong in your 
identification of what they are. The piece on the left is entirely com-
posed of three copies of one word: "HOLISM"; and the piece on the right 
is composed of many copies, in smaller letters, of the same word. Why 
the letters are of different sizes in the two parts, I don't know, but I 
know what I see, and what I see is "HOLISM", plain as day. How you see 
anything else is beyond me. 
Antedter: 
You are right about the two pieces, but you are wrong in your 
identification of what they are. The piece on the left is entirely com-
posed of many copies of one word: "REDUCTIONISM"; and the piece on 
the right is composed of one single copy, in larger letters, of the same 
word. Why the letters are of different sizes in the two parts, I don't 
know, but I know what I see, and what I see is "REDUCTIONISM", plain as 
day. How you see anything else is beyond me. 
Achilles: 
I know what is going on here. Each of you has seen letters which 
compose, or are composed of, other letters. In the left-hand piece,

there are indeed three "HOLISM'''S, but each one of them is composed 
out of smaller copies of the word ·'REDUCTIONISM". And in complemen-
tary fashion, in the right-hand piece, there is indeed one "REDUC-
TIONISM", but it is composed out of smaller copies of the word "HOLISM". 
Now this is all fine and good, but in your silly squabble, the two of you 
have actually missed the forest for the trees. You see, what good is it to 
argue about whether "HOLISM" or "REDUCTIONISM" is right, when the 
proper way to understand the matter is to transcend the question, by 
answering "MU"? 
Crab: 
I now see the picture as you have described it, Achilles, but I have 
no idea of what you mean by the strange expression "transcending the 
question". 
Anteater: 
I now see the picture as you have described it, Achilles, but I 
have no idea of what you mean by the strange expression "MU". 
Achilles: 
I will be glad to indulge both of you, if you will first oblige me, by 
telling me the meaning of thes.e strange expressions, "HOLISM" and 
"REDUCTIONISM" . 
Crab: 
HOLISM is the most natural thing in the world to grasp. It's simply the 
belief that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts". No one in 
his right mind could reject holism. 
Anteater: 
REDUCTIONISM is the most natural thing in the world to grasp. It's 
simply the belief that "a whole can be understood completely if you 
understand its parts, and the nature of their 'sum"'. No one in her 
left brain could reject reductionism. 
Crab: 
I reject reductionism. I challenge you to tell me, for instance, how to 
understand a brain reductionistically. Any reductionistic explanation 
of a brain will inevitably fall far short of explaining where the con-
sciousness experienced by a brain arises from. 
Anteater: 
I reject holism. I challenge you to tell me, for instance, how a 
holistic description of an ant colony sheds any more light on it than is 
shed by a description of the ants inside it, and their roles, and their 
interrelationships. Any holistic explanation of an ant colony will inevi-
tably fall far short of explaining where the consciousness experienced 
by an ant colony arises from. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no! The last thing which I wanted to do was to provoke 
another argument. Anyway, now that I understand the controversy, I 
believe that my explanation of "MU" will help greatly. You see, "MU" is 
an ancient Zen answer which, when given to a question, UNASKS the 
question. Here, the question seems to be, "Should the world be under-
stood via holism, or via reductionism?" And the answer of "MU" here 
rejects the premises of the question, which are that one or the other 
must be chosen. By unasking the question, it reveals a wider truth: that 
there is a larger context into which both holistic and reductionistic 
explanations fit. 
Anteater: 
Absurd! Your "MU" is as silly as a cow's moo. I'll have none of this 
Zen wishy-washiness. 
312 
... Ant Fugue 

Crab: 
Ridiculous! Your "MU" is as silly as a kitten's mew. I'll have none of 
this Zen washy-wishiness. 
Achilles: 
Oh, dear! We're getting nowhere fast. Why have you stayed so 
strangely silent, Mr. Tortoise? It makes me very uneasy. Surely you 
must somehow be capable of helping straighten out this mess? 
Tortoise: 
I know the rest of you won't believe this, but the answer to the 
question is staring us all in the face, hidden in the picture. It is simply 
one word-but what an important one: HMU"! 
aust as he says this, the fourth voice in the fugue being played enters, 
exactly one octave below the first entry.) 
Achilles: 
Oh, Mr. T, for once you have let me down. I was sure that you, 
who always see the most deeply into things, would be able to resolve 
this dilemma-but apparently, you have seen no further than I myself 
saw. Oh, well, I guess I should feel pleased to have seen as far as Mr. 
Tortoise, for once. 
Tortoise: 
I beg your pardon, but my eyesight is. extremely fine. Please look 
again, and then tell me if the picture doesn't say what I said it says. 
Achilles: 
But of course it does! You have merely repeated my own original 
observation. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps "MU" exists in this picture on a deeper level than you 
imagine, Achilles-an octave lower (figuratively speaking). But for 
now I doubt that we can settle the dispute in the abstract. I would like 
to see both the holistic and reductionistic points of view laid out more 
explicitly; then there may be more of a basis for a decision. I would 
very much like to hear a reductionistic description of an ant colony, for 
instance. 
Crab: 
Perhaps Dr. Anteater will tell you something of his experiences in 
that regard. After all, he is by profession something of an expert on 
that subject. 
Tortoise: 
I am sure that we have much to learn from you, Dr. Anteater. 
Could you tell us more about ant colonies, from a reductionistic point 
of view? 
Anteater: 
Gladly. As Mr. Crab mentioned to you, my profession has led me 
quite a long way into the understanding of ant colonies. 
Achilles: 
I can imagine! The profession of anteater would seem to be 
synonymous with being an expert on ant colonies! 
Anteater: 
I beg your pardon. "Anteater" is not my profession; it is my 
species. By profession, I am a colony surgeon. I specialize in correcting 
nervous disorders of the colony by the technique of surgical removal. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I see. But what do you mean by "nervous disorders" of an ant 
colony? 
Anteater: 
Most of my clients suffer from some sort of speech impairment. 
You know, colonies which have to grope for words in everyday situa-
tions. It can be quite tragic. I attempt to remedy the situation by, 
uhh-removing'-the defective part of the colony. These operations 
... Ant Fugue 
313 

are sometimes quite involved, and of course years of study are re-
quired before one can perform them. 
Achilles: 
But-isn't it true that, before one can suffer from speech Im-
pairment, one must have the faculty of speech? 
Anteater: 
Right. 
Achilles: 
Since ant colonies don't have that faculty, I am a little confused. 
Crab: 
It's too bad, Achilles, that you weren't here last week, when Dr. 
Anteater and Aunt Hillary were my house guests. I should have 
thought of having you over then. 
Achilles: 
Is Aunt Hillary your aunt, Mr. Crab? 
Crab: 
Oh, no, she's not really anybody's aunt. 
Anteater: 
But the poor dear insists that everybody should call her that, 
even strangers. It's just one of her many endearing quirks. 
Crab: 
Yes, Aunt Hillary is quite eccentric, but such a merry old soul. It's a 
shame I didn't have you over to meet her last week. 
Anteater: 
She's certainly one of the best-educated ant colonies I have ever 
had the good fortune to know. The two of us have spent many a long 
evening in conversation on the widest range of topics. 
Achilles: 
I thought anteaters were devourers of ants, not patrons of ant-
'intellectualism! 
Anteater: 
Well, of course the two are not mutually inconsistent. I am on 
the best of terms with ant colonies. It's just ANTS that I eat, not 
colonies-and that is good for both parties: me, and the colony. 
Achilles: 
How is it possible that-
Tortoise: 
How is it possible that-
Achilles: -having its ants eaten can do an ant colony any good? 
Crab: 
How is it possible that-
Tortoise: 
-having a forest fire can do a forest any good? 
Anteater: 
How is it possible that-
Crab: -having its branches pruned can do a tree any good? 
Anteater: -having a haircut can do Achilles any good? 
Tortoise: 
Probably the rest of you were too engrossed in the discussion to 
notice the lovely stretto which just occurred in this Bach fugue. 
Achilles: 
What is a stretto? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, I'm sorry; I thought you knew the term. It is where one 
theme repeatedly enters in one voice after another, with very little 
delay between entries. 
Achilles: If I listen to enough fugues, soon I'll know all of these things and 
will be able to pick them out myself, without their having to be pointed 
out. 
Tortoise: 
Pardon me, my friends. I am sorry to have interrupted. Dr. 
Anteater was trying to explain how eating ants is perfectly consistent 
with being a friend of an ant colony. 
Achilles: 
Well, I can vaguely see how it might be possible for a limited and 
regulated amount of ant consumption to improve the overall health of 
314 
... Ant Fugue 

a colony-but what is far more perplexing is all this talk about having 
conversations with ant colonies. That's impossible. An ant colony is 
simply a bunch of individual ants running around at random looking 
for food and making a nest. 
Anteater: 
You could put it that way if you want to insist on seeing the trees 
but missing the forest, Achilles. In fact, ant colonies, seen as wholes, 
are quite well-defined units, with their own qualities, at times including 
the mastery of language. 
Achilles: 
I find it hard to imagine myself shouting something out loud in 
the middle of the forest, and hearing an ant colony answer back. 
Anteater: 
Silly fellow! That's not the way it happens. Ant colonies don't 
converse out loud, but in writing. You know how ants form trails 
leading them hither and thither? 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes-usually straight through the kitchen sink and into my 
peach jam. 
Anteater: 
Actually, some trails contain information in coded form. If you 
know the system, you can read what they're saying just like a book. 
Achilles: 
Remarkable. And can you communicate back to them? 
Anteater: 
Without any trouble at all. That's how Aunt Hillary and I have 
conversations for hours. I take a stick and draw trails in the moist 
ground, and watch the ants follow my trails. Presently, a new trail starts 
getting formed somewhere. I greatly enjoy watching trails develop. As 
they are forming, I anticipate how they will continue (and more often I 
am wrong than right). When the trail is completed, I know what Aunt 
Hillary is thinking, and I in turn make my reply. 
Achilles: 
There must be some amazingly smart ants in that colony, I'll say 
that. 
Anteater: 
I think you are still having some difficulty realizing the differ-
ence in levels here. Just as you would never confuse an individual tree 
with a forest, so here you must not take an ant for the colony. You see, 
all the ants in Aunt Hillary are as dumb as can be. They couldn't 
converse to save their little thoraxes! 
Achilles: 
Well then, where does the ability to converse come from? It must 
reside somewhere inside the colony! I don't understand how the ants 
can all be unintelligent, if Aunt Hillary can entertain you for hours 
with witty banter. 
Tortoise: 
It seems to me that the situation is not unlike the composition of 
a human brain out of neurons. Certainly no one would insist that 
individual brain cells have to be intelligent beings on their own, in 
order to explain the fact that a person can have an intelligent conversa-
tion. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no, clearly not. With brain cells, I see your point completely. 
Only ... ants are a horse of another color. I mean, ants just roam 
about at will, completely randomly, chancing now ahd then upon a 
morsel of food ... They are free to do what they want to do, and with 
that freedom, I don't see at all how their behavior, seen as a whole, can 
... Ant Fugue 
315 

amount to anything coherent---{~specially something so coherent as the 
brain behavior necessary for conversing. 
Crab: 
It seems to me that the ants are free only within certain constraints. 
For example, they are free to wander, to brush against each other, to 
pick up small items, to work on trails, and so on. But they never step 
out of that small world, that ant-system, which they are in. It would 
never occur to them, for they don't have the mentality to imagine 
anything of the kind. Thus the ants are very reliable components, in 
the sense that you can depend on them to perform certain kinds of 
tasks in certain ways. 
Achilles: 
But even so, within those limits they are still free, and they just act 
at random, running about incoherently without any regard for the 
thought mechanisms of a higher-level being which Dr. Anteater asserts 
they are merely components of. 
Anteater: 
Ah, but you fail to recognize one thing, Achilles-the regularity 
of statistics. 
Achilles: 
How is that? 
Anteater: 
For example, even though ants as individuals wander about in 
what seems a random way, there are nevertheless overall trends, in-
volving large numbers of ants, which can emerge from that chaos. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I know what you mean. In fact, ant trails are a perfect 
example of such a phenomenon. There, you have really quite unpre-
dictable motion on the part of any single ant-and yet, the trail itself 
seems to remain well-defined and stable. Certainly that must mean that 
the individual ants are not just running about totally at random. 
Anteater: 
Exactly, Achilles. There is some degree of communication 
among the ants, just enough to keep them from wandering off com-
pletely at random. By this minimal communication they can remind 
each other that they are not alone but are cooperating with teammates. 
It takes a large number of ants, all reinforcing each other this way, to 
sustain any activity-such as trail-building-for any length of time. 
Now my very hazy understanding of the operation of brains leads me 
to believe that something similar pertains to the firing of neurons. Isn't 
it true, Mr. Crab, that it takes a group of neurons firing in order to 
make another neuron fire? 
Crab: 
Definitely. Take the neurons in Achilles' brain, for example. Each 
neuron receives signals from neurons attached to its input lines, and if 
the sum total of inputs at any moment exceeds a critical threshold, 
then that neuron will fire and send its own output pulse rushing off to 
other neurons, which may in turn fire-and on down the line it goes. 
The neural flash swoops relentlessly in its Achillean path, in shapes 
stranger then the dash of a gnatchungry swallow; every twist, every 
turn foreordained by the neural structure in Achilles' brain, until 
sensory input messages interfere. 
Achilles: 
Normally, I think that I'M in control of what I think-but the way 
you put it turns it all inside out, so that it sounds as though "I" am just 
316 
... Ant Fugue 

what comes out of all this neural structure, and natural law. It makes 
what I consider my SELF sound at best like a by-product of an organism 
governed by natural law , and at worst, an artificial notion produced by 
my distorted perspective. In other words, you make me feel like I don't 
know who-or what-I am, if anything. 
Tortoise: 
You'll come to understand much better as we go along. But Dr. 
Anteater-what do you make of this similarity? 
Anteater: 
I knew there was something parallel going on in the two very 
different systems. Now I understand it much better. It seems that 
group phenomena which have coherence-trail-building, for 
example-will take place only when a certain threshold number of ants 
get involved. If an effort is initiated, perhaps at random, by a few ants 
in some locale, one of two things can happen: either it will fizzle out 
after a brief sputtering start-
Achilles: 
When there aren't enough ants to keep the thing rolling? 
Anteater: 
Exactly. The other thing that can happen is that a critical mass of 
ants is present, and the thing will snowball, bringing more and more 
ants into the picture. In the latter case, a whole "team" is brought into 
being which works on a single project. That project might be trail-
making, or food-gathering, or it might involve nest-keeping. Despite 
the extreme simplicity of this scheme on a small scale, it can give rise to 
very complex consequences on a larger scale. 
Achilles: 
I can grasp the general idea of order emerging from chaos, as 
you sketch it, but that still is a lpng way from the ability to converse. 
After all, order also emerges from chaos when molecules of a gas 
bounce against each other randomly-yet all that results there is an 
amorphous mass with but three parameters to characterize it: volume, 
pressure, and temperature. Now that's a far cry from the ability to 
understand the world, or to talk about it! 
Anteater: 
That highlights a very interesting difference between the expla-
nation of the behavior of an ant colony and the explanation of the 
behavior of gas inside a container. One can explain the behavior of the 
gas simply by calculating the statistical properties of the motions of its 
molecules. There is no need to discuss any higher elements of struc-
ture than molecules, except the full gas itself. On the other hand, in an 
ant colony, you can't even begin to understand the activities of the 
colony unless you go through several layers of structure. 
Achilles: 
I see what you mean. In a gas, one jump takes you from the 
lowest level-molecules-to the highest level-the full gas. There are 
no intermediate levels of organization. Now how do intermediate 
levels of organized activity arise in an ant colony? 
Anteater: It has to do with the existence of several different varieties of 
ants inside any colony. 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes. I think I have heard about that. They are called "castes", 
aren't they? 
Anteater: 
That's correct. Aside from the queen, there are males, who do 
... Ant Fugue 
317 

practically nothing towards the upkeep of the nest, and then-
Achilles: 
And of course there are soldiers-Glorious Fighters Against 
Communism! 
Crab: 
Hmm ... I hardly think that could be right, Achilles. An ant colony 
is quite communistic internally, so why would its soldiers fight against 
communism? Or am I right, Dr. Anteater? 
Anteater: 
Yes, about colonies you are right, Mr. Crab; they are indeed 
based on somewhat communistic principles. But about soldiers Achil-
les is somewhat naIve. In fact, the so-called "soldiers" are hardly adept 
at fighting at all. They are slow, ungainly ants with giant heads, who 
can snap with their strong jaws, but are hardly to be glorified. As in a 
true communistic state, it is rather the workers who are to be glorified. 
It is they who do most of the chores, such as food-gathering, hunting, 
and nursing of the young. It is even they who do most of the fighting. 
Achilles: 
Bah. That is an absurd state of affairs. Soldiers who won't fight! 
Anteater: 
Well, as I just said, they really aren't soldiers at all. It's the 
workers who are soldiers; the soldiers are just lazy fatheads. 
Achilles: 
Oh, how disgraceful! Why, if I were an ant, I'd put some disci-
pline in their ranks! I'd knock some sense into those fatheads! 
Tortoise: If you were an ant? How could you be an ant? There is no way to 
map your brain onto an ant brain, so it seems to me to be a pretty 
fruitless question to worry over. More reasonable would be the propo-
sition of mapping your brain onto an ant colony ... But let us not get 
sidetracked. Let Dr. Anteater continue with his most illuminating 
description of castes and their role in the higher levels of organization. 
Anteater: 
Very well. There are all sorts of tasks which must be ac-
complished in a colony, and individual ants develop specializations. 
Usually an ant's specialization changes as the ant ages. And of course it 
is also dependent on the ant's caste. At anyone moment, in any small 
area of a colony, there are ants of all types present. Of course, one 
caste may be be very sparse in some places and very dense in others. 
Crab: 
Is the density of a given caste, or specialization, just a random 
thing? Or is there a reason why ants of one type might be more heavily 
concentrated in certain areas, and less heavily in others? 
Anteater: 
I'm glad you brought that up, since it is of crucial importance in 
understanding how a colony thinks. In fact, there evolves, over a long 
period of time, a very delicate distribution of castes inside a colony. 
And it is this distribution which allows the colony to have the complex-
ity which underlies the ability to converse with me. 
Achilles: 
It would seem to me that the constant motion of ants to and fro 
would completely prevent the possibility of a very delicate distribution. 
Any delicate distribution would be quickly destroyed by all the random 
motions of ants, just as any delicate pattern among molecules in a gas 
would not survive for an instant, due to the random bombardment 
from all sides. 
Anteater: 
In an ant colony, the situation is quite the contrary. In fact, it is 
just exactly the constant to-ing and fro-ing of ants inside the colony 
318 
... Ant Fugue 

which adapts the caste distribution to varying situations, and thereby 
preserves the delicate caste distribution. You see, the caste distribution 
cannot remain as one single rigid pattern; rather, it must constantly be 
changing so as to reflect, in some manner, the real-world situation with 
which the colony is dealing, and it is precisely the motion inside the 
colony which updates the caste distribution, so as to keep it in line with 
the present circumstances facing the colony. 
Tortoise: 
Could you give an example? 
Anteater: 
Gladly. When I, an anteater, arrive to pay a visit to Aunt Hillary, 
all the foolish ants, upon sniffing my odor, go into a panic-which 
means, of course, that they begin running around completely diffe-
rently from the way they were before I arrived. 
Achilles: 
But that's understandable, since you're a dreaded enemy of the 
colony. 
Anteater: 
Oh, no. I must reiterate that, far from being an enemy of the 
colony, I am Aunt Hillary's favorite companion. And Aunt Hillary is 
my favorite aunt. I grant you, I'm quite feared by all the individual 
ants in the colony-but that's another matter entirely. In any case, you 
see that the ants' action in response to my arrival completely changes 
the internal distribution of ants. 
Achilles: 
That's clear. 
Anteater: 
And that sort of thing is the updating which I spoke of. The new 
distribution reflects my presence. One can describe the change from 
old state to new as having added a "piece of knowledge" to the colony. 
Achilles: 
How can you refer to the distribution of different types of ants 
inside a colony as a "piece of knowledge"? 
Anteater: 
Now there's a vital point. It requires some elaboration. You see, 
what it comes down to is how you choose to describe the caste distribu-
tion. If you continue to think in terms of the lower levels-individual 
ants-then you miss the forest for the trees. That'sjust too microscopic 
a level, and when you think microscopically, you're bound to miss some 
large-scale features. You've got to find the proper high-level 
framework in which to describe the caste distribution-only then will it 
make sense how the caste distribution can encode many pieces of 
knowledge. 
Achilles: 
Well, how DO you find the proper-sized units in which to describe 
the present state of the colony, then? 
Anteater: 
All right. Let's begin at the bottom. When ants need to get 
something done, they form little "teams", which stick together to 
perform a chore. As I mentioned earlier, small groups of ants are 
constantly forming and unforming. Those which actually exist for a 
while are the teams, and the reason they don't fall apart is that there 
really is something for them to do. 
Achilles: 
Earlier you said that a group will stick together if its size exceeds a 
certain threshold. Now you're saying that a group will stick together if 
there is something for it to do. 
Anteater: 
They are equivalent statements. For instance, in food-gathering, 
... Ant Fugue 
319 

if there is an inconsequential amount of food somewhere which gets 
discovered by some wandering ant who then attempts to communicate 
its enthusiasm to other ants, the number of ants who respond will be 
proportional to the size of the food sample-and an inconsequential 
amount will not attract enough ants to surpass the threshold. Which is 
exactly what I meant by saying there is nothing to do-too little food 
ought to be ignored. 
Achilles: 
I see. I assume that these "teams" are one of the levels of struc-
ture falling somewhere in between the single-ant level and the colony 
level. 
Anteater: 
Precisely. There exists a special kind of team, which I call a 
"signal"-and all the higher levels of structure are based on signals. In 
fact, all the higher entities are collections of signals acting in concert. 
There are teams on higher levels whose members are not ants, but 
teams on lower levels. Eventually you reach the lowest-level teams-
which is to say, signals-and below them, ants. 
Achilles: 
Why do signals deserve their suggestive name? 
Anteater: 
It comes from their function. The effect of signals is to transport 
ants of various specializations to appropriate parts of the colony. So the 
typical story of a signal is thus; it (omes into existence by exceeding the 
threshold needed for survival, then it migrates for some distance 
through the colony, and at some point it more or less disintegrates into 
its individual members, leaving them on their own. 
Achilles: It sounds like a wave, carrying sand dollars and seaweed from 
afar, and leaving them strewn, high and dry, on the shore. 
Anteater: 
In a way that's analogous, since the team does indeed deposit 
something which it has carried from a distance, but whereas the water 
in the wave rolls back to the sea, there is no analogous carrier substance 
in the case of a signal, since the ants themselves compose it. 
Tortoise: 
And I suppose that a signal loses its coherency just at some spot 
in the colony where ants of that type were needed in the first place. 
Anteater: 
Naturally. 
Achilles: 
Naturally? It's not so obvious to ME that a signal should always go 
just where it is needed. And even if it goes in the right direction, how 
does it figure out where to decompose? How does it know it has 
arrived? 
Anteater: 
Those are extremely important matters, since they involve ex-
plaining the existence of purposeful behavior-or what seems to be 
purposeful behavior-on the part of signals. From the description, one 
would be inclined to characterize the signals' behavior as being 
oriented towards filling a need, and to call it "purposeful". But you can 
look at it otherwise. 
Achilles: 
Oh, wait. Either the behavior IS purposeful, or it is NOT. I don't 
see how you can have it both ways. 
Anteater: 
Let me explain my way of seeing things, and then see if you 
agree. Once a signal is formed, there is no awareness on its part that it 
320 
... Ant Fugue 

should head off in any particular direction. But here, the delicate caste 
distribution plays a crucial role. It is what determines the motion of 
signals through the colony, and also how long a signal will remain 
stable, and where it will "dissolve". 
Achilles: 
So everything depends on the caste distribution, eh? 
Anteater: 
Right. Let's say a signal is moving along. As it goes, the ants 
which compose it interact, either by direct contact or by exchange of 
scents, with ants of the local neighborhoods which it passes through. 
The contacts and scents provide information about local matters of 
urgency, such as nest-building, or nursing, or whatever. The signal will 
remain glued together as long as the local needs are different from 
what it can supply; but if it CAN contribute, it disintegrates, spilling a 
fresh team of usable ants onto the scene. Do you see now how the caste 
distribution acts as an overall guide of the teams inside the colony? 
Achilles: 
I do see that. 
Anteater: 
And do you see how this way of looking at things requires 
attributing no sense of purpose to the signal? 
Achilles: 
I think so. Actually, I'm beginning to see things from two differ-
ent vantage points. From an ant's-eye point of view, a signal has NO 
purpose. The typical ant in a signal is just meandering around the 
colony, in search of nothing in particular, until it finds that it feels like 
stopping. Its teammates usually agree, and at that moment the team 
unloads itself by crumbling apart, leaving just its members but none of 
its coherency. No planning is required, no looking ahead; nor is any 
search required, to determine the proper direction. But from the 
COLONY'S point of view, the team has just responded to a message 
which was written in the language of the caste distribution. Now from 
this perspective, it looks very much like purposeful activity. 
Crab: 
What would happen if the caste distribution were entirely random? 
Would signals still band and disband? 
Anteater: 
Certainly. But the colony would not last long, due to the 
meaninglessness of the caste distribution. 
Crab: 
Precisely the point I wanted to make. Colonies survive because their 
caste distribution has meaning, and that meaning is a holistic aspect, 
invisible on lower levels. You lose explanatory power unless you take 
that higher level into account. 
Anteater: 
I see your side; but I believe you see things too narrowly. 
Crab: 
How so? 
Anteater: 
Ant colonies have been subjected to the rigors of evolution for 
billions of years. A few mechanisms were selected for, and most were 
selected against. The end result was a set of mechanisms which make 
ant colonies work as we have been describing. If you could watch the 
whole process in a movie-running a billion or so times faster than life, 
of course-the emergence of various mechanisms would be seen as 
natural responses to external pressures,just as bubbles in boiling water 
are natural responses to an external heat source. I don't suppose you 
... Ant Fugue 
321 

see "meaning" and "purpose" in the bubbles in boiling water-or do 
you? 
Crab: 
No, but-
Anteater: 
Now that's MY point. No matter how big a bubble is, it owes its 
existence to processes on the molecular level, and you can forget about 
any "higher-level laws". The same goes for ant colonies and their 
teams. By looking at things from the vast perspective of evolution, you 
can drain the whole colony of meaning and purpose. They become 
superfluous notions. 
Achilles: 
Why, then, Dr. Anteater, did you tell me that you talked with 
Aunt Hillary? It now seems that you would deny that she can talk or 
think at all. 
Anteater: 
I am not being inconsistent, Achilles. You see, I have as much 
difficulty as anyone else in seeing things on such a grandiose time scale, 
so I find it much easier to change points of view. When I do so, 
forgetting about evolution and seeing things in the here and now, the 
vocabulary of teleology comes back: the MEANING of the caste distribu-
tion and the PURPOSEFULNESS of signals. This not only happens when I 
think of ant colonies, but also when I think about my own brain and 
other brains. However, with some effort I can always remember the 
other point of view if necessary, and drain all these systems of mean-
ing, too. 
Crab: 
Evolution certainly works some miracles. You never know the next 
trick it will pull out of its sleeve. f'or instance, it wouldn't surprise me 
one bit if it were theoretically possible for two or more "signals" to pass 
through each other, each one unaware that the other one is also a 
signal; each one treating the other as if it were just part of the 
background population. 
Anteater: It is better than theoretically possible; in fact it happens 
routinely! 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... What a strange image that conjures up in my mind. I 
can just imagine ants moving in four different directions, some black, 
some white, criss-crossing, together forming an orderly pattern, almost 
like-like-
Tortoise: 
A fugue, perhaps? 
Achilles: 
Yes-that's it! An ant fugue! 
Crab: 
An interesting image, Achilles. By the way, all that talk of boiling 
water made me think of tea. Who would like some more? 
Achilles: 
I could do with another cup, Mr. C. 
Crab: 
Very good. 
Achilles: 
Do you suppose one could separate out the different visual 
"voices" of such an "ant fugue"? I know how hard it is for me-

"Ant Fugue", by M. C. Escher (woodcut, 1953). 
Anteater: -if it isn't too much trouble. 
Achilles: -when all of them-
Crab: 
Not at all. Four cups of tea-
Tortoise: 
Three! 
Achilles: -are going at once. 
Crab: 
-coming right up! 
Anteater: 
That's an interesting thought, Achilles. But it's unlikely that 
anyone could draw such a picture in a convincing way. 
Achilles: 
That's too bad. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps you could answer this, Dr. Anteater. Does a signal, from 
its creation until its dissolution, always consist of the same set of ants? 
Anteater: 
As a matter of fact, the individuals in a signal sometimes break 
off and get replaced by others of the same caste, if there are a few in 
the area. Most often, s.ignals arrive at their disintegration points with 
nary an ant in common with their starting lineup. 
... Ant Fugue 
323 

Crab: 
I can see that the signals are constantly affecting the caste distribu-
tion throughout the colony, and are doing so in response to the 
internal needs of the colony-which in turn reflect the external situa-
tion which the colony is faced with. Therefore the caste distribution, as 
you said, Dr. Anteater, gets continually updated in a way which ulti-
mately reflects the outer world. 
Achilles: 
But what about those intermediate levels of structure? You were 
saying that the caste distribution should best be pictured not in terms 
of ants or signals, but in terms of teams whose members were other 
teams, whose members were other teams, and so on until you come 
down to the ant level. And you said that that was the key to under-
standing how it was possible to describe the caste distribution as encod-
ing pieces of information about the world. 
Anteater: 
Yes, we are coming to all that. I prefer to give teams of a 
sufficiently high level the name of "symbols". Mind you, this sense of 
the word has some significant differences from the usual sense. My 
"symbols" are ACTIVE SUBSYSTEMS of a complex system, and they are 
composed of lower-level active subsystems ... They are therefore 
quite different from PASSIVE symbols, external to the system, such as 
letters of the alphabet or musical notes, which sit there immobile, 
waiting for an active system to process them. 
Achilles: 
Oh, this is rather complicated, isn't it? I just had no idea that ant 
colonies had such an abstract structure. 
Anteater: 
Yes, it's quite remarkable. But all these layers of structure are 
necessary for the storage of the kinds of knowledge which enable an 
organism to be "intelligent" in any reasonable sense of the word. Any 
system which has a mastery of language has essentially the same under-
lying sets of levels. 
Achilles: 
Now just a cotton-picking minute. Are you insinuating that my 
brain consists of, at bottom, just a bunch of ants running around? 
Anteater: 
Oh, hardly. You took me a little too literally. The lowest level 
may be utterly different. Indeed, the brains of anteaters, for instance, 
are not composed of ants. But when you go up a level or two in a brain, 
you reach a level whose elements have exact counterparts in other 
systems of equal intellectual strength-such as ant colonies. 
Tortoise: 
That is why it would be reasonable to think of mapping your 
brain, Achilles, onto an ant colony, but not onto the brain of a mere 
ant. 
Achilles: 
I appreciate the compliment. But how would such a mapping be 
carried out? For instance, what in my brain corresponds to the low-
level teams which you call signals? 
Anteater: 
Oh, I but dabble in brains, and therefore couldn't set up the map 
in its glorious detail. But-and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Crab-I 
would surmise that the brain counterpart to an ant colony's signal is 
the firing of a neuron; or perhaps it is a larger-scale event, such as a 
pattern of neural firings. 
324 
... Ant Fugue 

Crab: 
I would tend to agree. But don't you think that, for the purposes of 
our discussion, delineating the exact counterpart is not in itself crucial, 
desirable though it might be? It seems to me that the main idea is that 
such a correspondence does exist, even if we don't know exactly how to 
define it right now. I would only question one point, Dr. Anteater, 
which you raised, and that concerns the level at which one can have 
faith that the correspondence begins. You seemed to think that a 
SIGNAL might have a direct counterpart in a brain; whereas I feel that 
it is only at the level of your ACTIVE SYMBOLS and above that it is likely 
that a correspondence must exist. 
Anteater: 
Your interpretation may very well be more accurate than mine, 
Mr. Crab. Thank you for bringing out that subtle point. 
Achilles: 
What does a symbol do that a signal couldn't do? 
Anteater: It is something like the difference between words and letters. 
Words, which are meaning-carrying entities, are composed of letters, 
which in themselves carry no meaning. This gives a good idea of the 
difference between symbols and signals. In fact it is a useful analogy, as 
long as you keep in mind the fact that words and letters are PASSIVE, 
symbols and signals are ACTIVE. 
Achilles: 
I'll do so, but I'm not sure I understand why it is so vital to stress 
the difference between active and passive entities. 
Anteater: 
The reason is that the meaning which you attribute to any 
passive symbol, such as a word on a page, actually derives from the 
meaning which is carried by corresponding active symbols in your 
brain. So that the meaning of passive symbols can only be properly 
understood when it is related to the meaning of active symbols. 
Achilles: 
All right. But what is it that endows a SYMBOL-an active one, to 
be sure-with meaning, when you say that a SIGNAL, which is a per-
fectly good entity in its own right, has none? 
Anteater: 
It all has to do with the way that symbols can cause other symbols 
to be triggered. When one symbol becomes active, it does not do so in 
isolation. It is floating about, indeed, in a medium, which is charac-
terized by its caste distribution. 
Crab: 
Of course, in a brain there is no such thing as a caste distribution, 
but the counterpart is the "brain state". There, you describe the states 
of all the neurons, and all the interconnections, and the threshold for 
firing of each neuron. 
Anteater: 
Very well; let's lump "caste distribution" and "brain state" under 
a common heading, and call them just the "state". Now the state can be 
described on a low level or on a high level. A low-level description of 
the state of an ant colony would involve painfully specifying the loca-
tion of each ant, its age and caste, and other similar items. A very 
detailed description, yielding practically no global insight as to WHY it 
is in that state. On the other hand, a description on a high level would 
involve specifying which symbols could be triggered by which combi-
nations of other symbols, under what conditions, and so forth. 
... Ant Fugue 
325 

Achilles: 
What about a description on the level of signals, or teams? 
Anteater: 
A description on that level would fall somewhere in between the 
low-level and symbol-level descriptions. It would contain a great deal 
of information about what is actually going on in specific locations 
throughout the colony, although certainly less than an ant-by-ant de-
scription, since teams consist of clumps of ants. A team-by-team de-
scription is like a summary of an ant-by-ant description. However, you 
have to add extra things which were not present in the ant-by-ant 
description-such as the relationships between teams, and the supply 
of various castes here and there. This extra complication is the price 
you pay for the right to summarize. 
Achilles: 
It is interesting to me to compare the merits of the descriptions at 
various levels. The highest-level description seems to carry the most 
explanatory power, in that it gives you the most intuitive picture of the 
ant colony, although strangely enough, it leaves out seemingly the 
most important feature-the ants. 
Anteater: 
But you see, despite appearances, the ants are not the most 
important feature. Admittedly, were it not for them, the colony 
wouldn't exist; but something equivalent-a brain-can exist, ant-free. 
So, at least from a high-level point of view, the ants are dispensable. 
Achilles: 
I'm sure no ant would embrace your theory with eagerness. 
Anteater: 
Well, I never met an ant with a high-level point of view. 
Crab: 
What a counterintuitive picture you paint, Dr. Anteater. It seems 
that, if what you say is true, in order to grasp the whole structure, you 
have to describe it omitting any mention of its fundamental building 
blocks. 
Anteater: 
Perhaps I can make it a little clearer by an analogy. Imagine you 
have before you a Charles Dick.ens novel. 
Achilles: 
The Pickwick Papers-will that do? 
Anteater: 
Excellently! And now imagine trying the following game: you 
must find a way of mapping letters onto ideas, so that the entire 
Pickwick Papers makes sense when you read it letter by letter. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... You mean that every time I hit a word such as "the", I 
have to think of three definite concepts, one after another, with no 
room for variation? 
Anteater: 
Exactly. They are the 't'-concept, the 'h' -concept, and the 
'e' -concept-and every time, those concepts are as they were the pre-
ceding time. 
Achilles: 
Well, it sounds like that would turn the experience of "reading" 
The Pickwick Papers into an indescribably boring nightmare. It would be 
an exercise in meaninglessness, no matter what concept I associated 
with each letter. 
Anteater: 
Exactly. There is no natural mapping from the individual letters 
into the real world. The natural mapping occurs on a higher level-
between words, and parts of the real world. If you wanted to describe 
the book, therefore, you would make no mention of the letter level. 
326 
... Ant Fugue 

Achilles: 
Of course not! I'd describe the plot and the characters, and so 
forth. 
Anteater: 
So there you are. You would omit all mention of the building 
blocks, even though the book exists thanks to them. They are the 
medium, but not the message. 
Achilles: 
All right-but what about ant colonies? 
Anteater: 
Here, there are active signals instead of passive letters, and 
active symbols instead of passive words-but the idea carries over. 
Achilles: 
Do you mean I couldn't establish a mapping between signals and 
things in the real world? 
Anteater: 
You would find that you could not do it in such a way that the 
triggering of new signals would make any sense. Nor could you suc-
ceed on any lower level-for example the ant level. Only on the symbol 
level do the triggering patterns make sense. Imagine, for instance, that 
one day you were watching Aunt Hillary when I arrived to pay a call. 
You could watch as carefully as you wanted, and yet you would proba-
bly perceive nothing more than a rearrangement of ants. 
Achilles: 
I'm sure that's accurate. 
Anteater: 
And yet, as I watched, reading the higher level instead of the 
lower level, I would see several dormant symbols being awakened, 
those which translate into the thought, "Oh, here's that charming Dr. 
Anteater again-how pleasant!"-or words to that effect. 
Achilles: 
That sounds like what happened when the four of us all 
found different levels to read in the MU-picture-or at least THREE of 
us did ... 
Tortoise: 
What an astonishing coincidence that there should be such a 
resemblance between that strange picture which I chanced upon in the 
Well-Tempered Clavier, and the trend of our conversation. 
Achilles: 
Do you think it's just coincidence? 
Tortoise: 
Of course. 
Anteater: 
Well, I hope you can grasp now how the thoughts in Aunt 
Hillary emerge from the manipulation of symbols composed of signals 
composed of teams composed of lower-level teams, all the way down to 
ants. 
Achilles: 
Why do you call it "symbol manipulation"? Who does the manip-
ulating, if the symbols are themselves active? Who is the agent? 
Anteater: 
This gets back to the question which you earlier raised about 
purpose. You're right that symbols themselves are active, but the 
activities which they follow are nevertheless not absolutely free. The 
activities of all symbols are strictly determined by the state of the full 
system in which they reside. Therefore, the full system is responsible 
for how its symbols trigger each other, and so it is quite reasonable to 
speak of the full system as the "agent". As the symbols operate, the 
state of the system gets slowly transformed, or updated. But there are 
many features which remain over time. It is this partially constant, 
partially varying system which is the agent. One can give a name to the 
... Ant Fugue 
327 

full system. For example, Aunt Hillary is the "who" who can be said to 
manipulate her symbols; and you are similar, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
That's quite a strange characterization of the notion of who I am. 
I'm not sure I can fully understand it, but I will give it some thought. 
Tortoise: 
It would be quite interesting to follow the symbols in your brain 
as you do that thinking about the symbols in your brain. 
Achilles: 
That's too complicated for me. I have trouble enough just trying 
to picture how it is possible to look at an ant colony and read it on the 
symbol level. I can certainly imagine perceiving it at the ant level; and 
with a little trouble, I can imagine what it must be like to perceive it at 
the signal level; but what in the world can it be like to perceive an ant 
colony at the symbol level? 
Anteater: 
One only learns through long practice. But when one is at my 
stage, one reads the top level of an ant colony as easily as you yourself 
read the "MU" in the MU-picture. 
Achilles: 
Really? That must be an amazing experience. 
Anteater: 
In a way-but it is also one which is quite familiar to you, 
Achilles. 
Achilles: 
Familiar to me? What do you mean? I have never looked at an ant 
colony on anything but the ant level. 
Anteater: 
Maybe not; but ant colonies are no different from brains m 
many respects. 
Achilles: 
I have never seen nor read any brain either, however. 
Anteater: 
What about your OWN brain? Aren't you aware of your own 
thoughts? Isn't that the essence of consciousness? What else are you 
doing but reading your own brain directly at the symbol level? 
Achilles: 
I never thought of it that way. You mean that I bypass all the 
lower levels, and only see the topmost level? 
Anteater: 
That's the way it is, with conscious systems. They perceive them-
selves on the symbol level only, and have no awareness of the lower 
levels, such as the signal levels. 
Achilles: 
Does it follow that in a brain, there are active symbols which are 
constantly updating themselves so that they reRect the overall state of 
the brain itself, always on the symbol level? 
Anteater: 
Certainly. In any conscious system there are symbols which 
represent the brain state, and they are themselves part of the very 
brain state which they symbolize. For consciousness requires a large 
degree of self-consciousness. 
Achilles: 
That is a weird notion. It means that although there is frantic 
activity occurring in my brain at all times, I am only capable of register-
ing that activity in one way-on the symbol level; and I am completely 
insensitive to the lower levels. It is like being able to read a Dickens 
novel by direct visual perception, without ever having learned the 
letters of the alphabet. I can't imagine anything as weird as that really 
happening. 
Crab: 
But precisely that sort of thing DID happen when you read "MU", 
328 
... Ant Fugue 

without perceiving the lower levels "HOLISM" and "REDUCTIONISM". 
Achilles: 
You're right-I bypassed the lower levels, and saw only the top. I 
wonder if I'm missing all sorts of meaning on lower levels of my brain 
as well, by reading only the symbol level. It's too bad that the top level 
doesn't contain all the information about the bottom level, so that by 
reading the top, one also learns what the bottom level says. But I guess 
it would be naive to hope that the top level encodes anything from the 
bottom level-it probably doesn't percolate up. The MU-picture is the 
most striking possible example of that: there, the topmost level says 
only "MU", which bears no relation whatever to the lower levels! 
Crab: 
That's absolutely true. (Picks up the MU-picture, to inspect it more 
closely.) Hmm ... There's something strange about the smallest letters 
in this picture; they're very wiggly ... 
Anteater: 
Let me take a look. (Peers closely at the MU-picture.) I think there's 
yet another level, which all of us missed! 
Tortoise: 
Speak for yourself, Dr. Anteater. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no-that can't be! Let me see. (Looks very carefully.) I know the 
rest of you won't believe this, but the message of this picture is staring 
us all in the face, hidden in its depths. It is simply one word, repeated 
over and over again, like a mantra-but what an important one: "MU"! 
What do you know! It is the same as the top level! And none of us 
suspected it in the least. 
Crab: 
We would never have noticed it if it hadn't been for you, Achilles. 
Anteater: 
I wonder if the coincidence of the highest and lowest levels 
happened by chance? Or was it a purposeful act carried out by some 
creator? 
Crab: 
How could one ever decide that? 
Tortoise: 
I don't see any way to do so, since we have no idea why that 
particular picture is in the Crab's edition of the Well-Tempered Clavier. 
Anteater: 
Although we have been having a lively discussion, I have still 
managed to listen with a good fraction of an ear to this very long and 
complex four-voice fugue. It is extraordinarily beautiful. 
Tortoise: It certainly is. And now, injust a moment, comes an organ point. 
Achilles: 
Isn't an organ point what happens when a piece of music slows 
down slightly, settles for a moment or two on a single note or chord, 
and then resumes at normal speed after a short silence? 
Tortoise: 
No, you're thinking of a "fermata"-a sort of musical semicolon. 
Did you notice there was one of those in the prelude? 
Achilles: 
I guess I must have missed it. 
Tortoise: 
Well, you have another chance coming up to hear a fermata-in 
fact, there are a couple of them coming up, towards the end of this 
fugue. 
Achilles: 
Oh, good. You'll point them out in advance, won't you? 
Tortoise: If you like. 
Achilles: 
But do tell me, what is an organ point? 
Tortoise: 
An organ point is the sustaining of a single note by one of the 
... Ant Fugue 
329 

voices in a polyphonic piece (often the lowest voice), while the other 
voices continue their own independent lines. This organ point is on the 
note of G. Listen carefully, and you'll hear it. 
Anteater: 
There occurred an incident one day when I visited with Aunt 
Hillary which reminds me of your suggestion of observing the symbols 
in Achilles' brain as they create thoughts which are about themselves. 
Crab: 
Do tell us about it. 
Anteater: 
Aunt Hillary had been feeling very lonely, and was very happy 
to have someone to talk to that day. So she gratefully told me to help 
myself to the juiciest ants I could find. (She's always been most gener-
ous with her ants.) 
Achilles: 
Gee! 
Anteater: It just happened that I had been watching the symbols which 
were carrying out her thoughts, because in them were some particu-
larly juicy-looking ants. 
Achilles: 
Gee! 
Anteater: 
So I helped myself to a few of the fattest ants which had been 
parts of the higher-level symbols which I had been reading. Specifical-
ly, the symbols which they were part of were the ones which had 
expressed the thought, "Help yourself to any of the ants which look 
appetizing ." 
Achilles: 
Gee! 
Anteater: 
Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for me, the little bugs 
didn't have the slightest inkling of what they were collectively telling 
me, on the symbol level. 
Achilles: 
Gee! That is an amazing wraparound. They were completely 
unconscious of what they were participating in. Their acts could be 
seen as part of a pattern on a higher level, but of course they were 
completely unaware of that. Ah, what a pity-a supreme irony, III 
fact-that they missed it. 
Crab: 
You are right, Mr. T -that was a lovely organ point. 
Anteater: 
I had never heard one before, but that one was so conspicuous 
that no one could miss it. Very effective. 
Achilles: 
What? Has the organ point already occurred? How can I not 
have noticed it, if it was so blatant? 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps you were so wrapped up in what you were saying that 
you were completely unaware of it. Ah, what a pity-a supreme irony, 
in fact-that you missed it. 
Crab: 
Tell me, does Aunt Hillary live in an anthill? 
Anteater: 
Well, she owns a rather large piece of property. It used to belong 
to someone else, but that is rather a sad story. In any case, her estate is 
quite expansive. She lives rather sumptuously, compared to many 
other colonies. 
Achilles: 
How does that jibe with the communistic nature of ant colonies 
which you earlier described to us? It sounds quite inconsistent, to me, 
to preach communism and to live in a fancy estate! 
330 
... Ant Fugue 

Anteater: 
The communism is on the ant level. In an ant colony all ants 
work for the common good, even to their own individual detriment at 
times. Now this is simply a built-in aspect of Aunt Hillary's structure, 
but for all I know, she may not even be aware of this internal com-
munism. Most human beings are not aware of anything about their 
neurons; in fact they probably are quite content not to know anything 
about their brains, being somewhat squeamish creatures. Aunt Hillary 
is also somewhat squeamish; she gets rather antsy whenever she starts 
to think about ants at all. So she avoids thinking about them whenever 
possible. I truly doubt that she knows anything about the communistic 
society which is built into her very structure. She herself is a staunch 
believer in libertarianism-you know, laissez-faire and all that. So it 
makes perfect sense, to me at least, that she should live in a rather 
sumptuous manor.

Tortoise: 
As I turned the page just now, while following along in this lovely 
edition of the Well-Tempered Clavier, I noticed that the first of the two 
fermatas is coming up soon-so you might listen for it, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
I will, I will. 
Tortoise: 
Also, there's a most curious picture facing this page. 
Crab: 
Another one? What next? 
Tortoise: 
See for yourself. (Passes the score over to the Crab.) 
Crab: 
Aha! It's just a few bunches of letters. Let's see-there are various 
numbers of the letters ']', 'S', 'B', 'm', 'a', and 't'. It's strange, how the 
first three letters grow, and then the last three letters shrink again. 
Anteater: 
May I see it? 
Crab: 
Why, certainly. 
Anteater: 
Oh, by concentrating on details, you have utterly missed the big 
picture. In reality, this group of letters is 'f', 'e', 'r', 'A', 'C', 'H', without 
any repetitions. First they get smaller, then they get bigger. Here, 
Achilles-what do you make of it? 
Achilles: 
Let me see. Hmm. Well, I see it as a set of upper-case letters 
which grow as you move to the right. 
Tortoise: 
Do they spell anything? 
... Ant Fugue 
331 

Achilles: 
Ah ... "J. S. BACH". Oh! I understand now. It's Bach's name! 
Tortoise: 
Strange that you should see it that way. I see it as a set of 
lower-case letters, shrinking as they move to the right, and ... spelling 
out ... the name of ... (Slows down slightly, especially drawing out the last 
few words. Then there is a brief silence. Suddenly he resumes as if nothing 
unusual had happened.) -"fermat". 
Achilles: 
Oh, you've got Fermat on the brain, I do believe. You see Fer-
mat's Last Theorem everywhere. 
Anteater: 
You were right, Mr. Tortoise-I just heard a charming little 
fermata in the fugue. 
Crab: 
So did I. 
Achilles: 
Do you mean everybody heard it but me? I'm beginning to feel 
stupid. 
Tortoise: 
There, there, Achilles-don't feel bad. I'm sure you won't miss 
Fugue's Last Fermata (which is coming up quite soon). But, to return 
to our previous topic, Dr. Anteater, what is the very sad story which 
you alluded to, concerning the former owner of Aunt Hillary's prop-
erty? 
Anteater: 
The former owner was an extraordinary individual, one of the 
most creative ant colonies who ever lived. His name was Johant Sebas-
tiant Fermant, and he was a mathematiciant by vocation, but a 
musiciant by avocation. 
Achilles: 
How very versantile of him! 
Anteater: 
At the height of his creative powers, he met with a most untimely 
demise. One day, a very hot summer day, he was out soaking up the 
warmth, when a freak thundershower-the kind that hits only once 
every hundred years or so-appeared from out of the blue, and 
thoroughly drenched J. S .F. Since the storm came utterly without 
warning, the ants got completely disoriented and confused. The intri-
cate organization which had been so finely built up over decades, all 
went down the drain in a matter of minutes. It was tragic. 
Achilles: 
Do you mean that all the ants drowned, which obviously would 
spell the end of poor J. S. F.? 
Anteater: 
Actually, no. The ants managed to survive, every last one of 
them, by crawling onto various sticks and logs which floated above the 
raging torrents. But when the waters receded and left the ants back on 
their home grounds, there was no organization left. The caste distribu-
tion was utterly destroyed, and the ants themselves had no ability to 
reconstruct what had once before been such a finely tuned organiza-
tion. They were as helpless as the pieces of Humpty Dumpty in putting 
themselves back together again. I myself tried, like all the king's horses 
and all the king's men, to put poor Fermant together again. I faithfully 
put out sugar and cheese, hoping against hope that somehow Fermant 
would reappear ... (Pulls out a handkerchief and wipes his eyes.) 
Achilles: 
How valiant of you! I never knew Anteaters had such big hearts. 
Anteater: 
But it was all to no avail. He was gone, beyond reconstitution. 
332 
... Ant Fugue 

However, something very strange then began to take place: over the 
next few months, the ants which had been components of J. S. F. 
slowly regrouped, and built up a new organization. And thus was Aunt 
Hillary born. 
Crab: 
Remarkable! Aunt Hillary is composed of the very same ants as 
Fermant was? 
Anteater: 
Well, originally she was, yes. By now, some of the older ants have 
died, and been replaced. But there are still many holdovers from the 
J. S. F.-days. 
Crab: 
And can't you recognize some of J. S. F.'s old traits coming to the 
fore, from time to time, in Aunt Hillary? 
Anteater: 
Not a one. They have nothing in common. And there is no 
reason they should, as I see it. There are, after all, often several distinct 
ways to rearrange a group of parts to form a "sum". And Aunt 
Hillary was just a new "sum" of the old parts. Not MORE than the 
sum, mind you-just that particular KIND of sum. 
Tortoise: 
Speaking of sums, I am reminded of number theory, where 
occasionally one will be able to take apart a theorem into its component 
symbols, rearrange them in a new order, and come up with a new 
theorem. 
Anteater: 
I've never heard of such a phenomenon, although I confess to 
being a total ignoramus in the field. 
Achilles: 
Nor have I heard of it-and I am rather well versed in the field, if 
I don't say so myself. I suspect Mr. T is just setting up one of his 
elaborate spoofs. I know him pretty well by now. 
Anteater: 
Speaking of number theory, I am reminded of J. S. F. again, for 
number theory is one of the domains in which he excelled. In fact, he 
made some rather rema! Kable contributions to number theory. Aunt 
Hillary, on the other hand, is remarkably dull-witted in anything that 
has even the remotest connection with mathematics. Also, she has only 
a rather banal taste in music, whereas Sebastiant was extremely gifted

In musIC. 
Achilles: 
I am very fond of number theory. Could you possibly relate to us 
something of the nature of Sebastiant's contributions? 
Anteater: 
Very well, then. (Pauses for a moment to sip his tea, then resumes.) 
Have you heard of Fourmi's infamous "Well-Tested Conjecture"? 
Achilles: 
I'm not sure ... It sounds strangely familiar, and yet I can't quite 
place it. 
Anteater: 
It's a very simple idea. Lierre de Fourmi, a mathematiciant by 
vocation but lawyer by avocation, had been reading in his copy of the 
classic text Arithmetica by Di of Antus, and came across a page contain-
ing the equation 
He immediately realized that this equation has infinitely many solu-
tions a, b, c, and then wrote in the margin the following notorious 
comment:

During emigrations army ants sometimes create living bridges of their own 
bodies. In this photograph of such a bridge (de Fourmi Lierre), the workers of an Eciton 
burchelli colony can be seen linking their legs and, along the top of the bridge, hooking their 
tarsal claws together to form irregular systems of chains. A symbiotic silverfish, Trichatelura 
manni, is seen crossing the bridge in the center. [From E. O. Wilson, The Insect Societies 
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971), p. 62.]

The equation 
has solutions in positive integers a, b, c, and n only when n = 2 (and 
then there are infinitely many triplets a, b, c which satisfy the equa-
tion); but there are no solutions for n > 2. I have discovered a truly 
marvelous proof of this statement, which, unfortunately, is so small 
that it would be well-nigh invisible if written in the margin. 
Ever since that year, some three hundred days ago, mathematiciants 
have been vainly trying to do one of two things: either to prove 
Fourmi's claim, and thereby vindicate Fourmi's reputation, which, 
although very high, has been somewhat tarnished by skeptics who 
think he never really found the proof he claimed to have found·-or 
else to refute the claim, by finding a counterexample: a set of four 
integers a, b, c, and n, with n > 2, which satisfy the equation. Until very 
recently, every attempt in either direction had met with failure. To be 
sure, the Conjecture has been verified for many specific values ofn-in 
particular, all n up to 125,000. But no one had succeeded in proving it 
for ALL n-no one, that is, until Johant Sebastiant Fermant came upon 
the scene. It was he who found the proof that cleared Fourmi's name.

It now goes under the name "Johant Sebastiant's Well-Tested Conjec-
ture". 
Achilles: 
Shouldn't it be called a "Theorem" rather than a "Conjecture", if 
it's finally been given a proper proof? 
Anteater: 
Strictly speaking, you're right, but tradition has kept it this way. 
Tortoise: 
What sort of music did Sebastiant do? 
Anteater: 
He had great gifts for composition. Unfortunately, his greatest 
work is shrouded in mystery, for he never reached the point of pub-
lishing it. Some believe that he had it all in his mind; others are more 
unkind, saying that he probably never worked it out at all, but merely 
blustered about it. 
Achilles: 
What was the nature of this magnum opus? 
Anteater: 
It was to be a giant prelude and fugue; the fugue was to have 
twenty-four voices, and to involve twenty-four distinct subjects, one in 
each of the major and minor keys. 
Achilles: It would certainly be hard to listen to a twenty-four-voice fugue 
as a whole! 
Crab: 
Not to mention composing one! 
Anteater: 
But all that we know of it is Sebastiant's description of it, which 
he wrote in the margin of his copy of Buxtehude's Preludes and 
Fugues for Organ. The last words which he wrote before his tragic 
demise were: 
I have composed a truly marvelous fugue. In it, I have added 
together the power of 24 keys, and the power of 24 themes; I came 
up with a fugue with the power of 24 voices. Unfortunately, this 
margin is too narrow to contain it. 
And the unrealized masterpiece simply goes by the name, "Fermant's 
Last Fugue". 
Achilles: 
Oh, that is unbearably tragic. 
Tortoise: 
Speaking of fugues, this fugue which we have been listening to is 
nearly over. Towards the end, there occurs a strange new twist on its 
theme. (Flips the page in the Well-Tempered Clavier.) Well, what have 
we here? A new illustration-how appealing! (Shows it to the Crab.)

CHAPTER XI 
Brains and Thoughts 
New Perspectives on Thought 
IT WAS 0 N L Y with the advent of computers that people actually tried to 
create "thinking" machines, and witnessed bizarre variations on the theme 
of thought. Programs were devised whose "thinking" was to human think-
ing as a slinky flipping end over end down a staircase is to human locomo-
tion. All of a sudden the idiosyncracies, the weaknesses and powers, the 
vagaries and vicissitudes of human thought were hinted at by the new-
found ability to experiment with alien, yet hand-tailored forms of 
thought-or approximations of thought. As a result, we have acquired, in 
the last twenty years or so, a new kind of perspective on what thought is, 
and what it is not. Meanwhile, brain researchers have found out much 
about the small-scale and large-scale hardware of the brain. This approach 
has not yet been able to shed much light on how the brain manipulates 
concepts, but it gives us some ideas about the biological mechanisms on 
which thought manipulation rests. 
In the coming two Chapters, then, we will try to unite some insights 
gleaned from attempts at computer intelligence with some of the facts 
learned from ingenious experiments on living animal brains, as well as with 
results from research on human thought processes done by cognitive 
psychologists. The stage has been set by the Prelude, Ant Fugue; now we 
develop the ideas more deeply. 
Intensionality and Extensionality 
Thought must depend on representing reality in the hardware of the brain. In 
the preceding Chapters, we have developed formal systems which repre-
sent domains of mathematical reality in their symbolisms. To what extent is 
it reasonable to use such formal systems as models for how the brain might 
manipulate ideas? 
We saw, in the pq-system and then in other more complicated systems, 
how meaning, in a limited sense of the term, arose as a result of an 
isomorphism which maps typographical symbols onto numbers, opera-
tions, and relations; and strings of typographical symbols onto statements. 
Now in the brain we don't have typographical symbols, but we have some-
thing even better: active elements which can store information and trans-
mit it and receive it from other active elements. Thus we have active 
symbols, rather than passive typographical symbols. In the brain, the rules 
Brains and Thoughts 
337 

are mixed right in with the symbols themselves, whereas on paper, the 
symbols are static entities, and the rules are in our heads. 
It is important not to get the idea, from the rather strict nature of all 
the formal systems we have seen, that the isomorphism between symbols 
and real things is a rigid, one-to-one mapping, like the strings which link a 
marionette and the hand guiding it. In TNT, the notion "fifty" can be 
expressed in different symbolic ways; for example, 
((SSSSSSSO· SSSSSSSO) + (SO' SO)) 
((SSSSSO . SSSSSO) + (SSSSSO . SSSSSO)) 
That these both represent the same number is not a priori clear. You can 
manipulate each expression independently, and at some point stumble 
across a theorem which makes you exclaim, "Oh-it's that number!" 
In your mind, you can also have different mental descriptions for a 
single person; for example, 
The person whose book I sent to a friend in Poland a while back. 
The stranger who started talking with me and my friends tonight 
in this coffee house. 
That they both represent the same person is not a priori clear. Both 
descriptions may sit in your mind, unconnected. At some point during the 
evening you may stumble across a topic of conversation which leads to the 
revelation that they designate the same person, making you exclaim, 
"Oh-you're that person!" 
Not all descriptions of a person need be attached to some central 
symbol for that person, which stores the person's name. Descriptions can be 
manufactured and manipulated in themselves. We can invent nonexistent 
people by making descriptions of them; we can merge two descriptions 
when we find they represent a single entity; we can split one description 
into two when we find it represents two things, not one-and so on. This 
"calculus of descriptions" is at the heart of thinking. It is said to be inten-
sional and not extensional, which means that descriptions can "float" without 
being anchored down to specific, known objects. The intensionality of 
thought is connected to its flexibility; it gives us the ability to imagine 
hypothetical worlds, to amalgamate different descriptions or chop one 
description into separate pieces, and so on. 
Suppose a friend who has borrowed your car telephones you to say 
that your car skidded off a wet mountain road, careened against a bank, 
and overturned, and she narrowly escaped death. You conjure up a series 
of images in your mind, which get progressively more vivid as she adds 
details, and in the end you "see it all in your mind's eye". Then she tells you 
that it's all been an April Fool's joke, and both she and the car are fine! In 
many ways that is irrelevant. The story and the images lose nothing of their 
vividness, and the memory will stay with you for a long, long time. Later, 
you may even think of her as an unsafe driver because of the strength of 
338 
Brains and Thoughts 

the first impression, which should have been wiped out when you learned it 
was all untrue. Fantasy and fact intermingle very closely in our minds, and 
this is because thinking involves the manufacture and manipulation of 
complex descriptions, which need in no way be tied down to real events or 
things. 
A flexible, intensional representation of the world is what thinking is 
all about. Now how can a physiological system such as the brain support 
such a system? 
The Brain's "Ants" 
The most important cells in the brain are nerve cells, or neurons (see 
Fig. 65), of which there are about ten billion. (Curiously, outnumbering the 
neurons by about ten to one are the glial cells, or glia. Glia are believed to 
play more of a supporting role to the neurons' starring role, and therefore 
we will not discuss them.) Each neuron possesses a number of synapses 
("entry ports") and one axon ("output channel"). The input and output are 
electrochemical flows: that is, moving ions. In between the entry ports of a 
neuron and its output channel is its cell body, where "decisions" are made. 
Brains and Thoughts

neuron. [Adapted From D. Wooldridge, The 
Machinery of the Brain (New York: 
McGraw-Hill, 1963), p. 6.] 
339 

The type of decision which a neuron faces-and this can take place up to a 
thousand times per second-is this: whether or not to fire-that is, to 
release ions down its axon, which e\entually will cross over into the entry 
ports of one or more other neurons, thus causing them to make the same 
sort of decision. The decision is made in a very simple manner: if the sum 
of all inputs exceeds a certain threshold, yes; otherwise, no. Some of the 
inputs can be negative inputs, which cancel out positive inputs coming from 
somewhere else. In any case, it is simple addition which rules the lowest 
level of the mind. To paraphrase Descartes' famous remark, "I think, 
therefore I sum" (from the Latin Cogito, ergo am). 
Now although the manner of making the decision sounds very simple, 
there is one fact which complicates the issue: there may be as many as 
200,000 separate entry ports to a neuron, which means that up to 200,000 
separate summands may be involved in determining the neuron's next 
action. Once the decision has been made, a pulse of ions streaks down the 
axon towards its terminal end. Before the ions reach the end, however, 
they may encounter a bifurcation--or several. In such cases, the single 
output pulse splits up as it moves down the bifurcating axon, and by the 
time it has reached the end, "it" has become "they"-and they may reach 
their destinations at separate times, since the axon branches along which 
they travel may be of different lengths and have different resistivities. The 
important thing, though, is that they all began as one single pulse, moving 
away from the cell body. After a neuron fires, it needs a short recovery time 
before firing again; cha.racteristically this is measured in milliseconds, so 
that a neuron may fire 'up to about a thousand times per second. 
Larger Structures in the Brain 
Now we have described the brain's "ants". What about "teams", or "sig-
nals"? What about "symbols"? We make the following observation: despite 
the complexity of its input, a single neuron can respond only in a very 
primitive way-by firing, or not firing. This is a very small amount of 
information. Certainly for large amounts of information to be carried or 
processed, many neurons must be involved. And therefore one might guess 
that larger structures, composed from many neurons, would exist, which 
handle concepts on a higher level. This is undoubtedly true, but the most 
naIve assumption-that there is a fixed group of neurons for each different 
concept-is almost certainly false. 
There are many anatomical portions of the brain which can be distin-
guished from each other, such as the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the 
hypothalamus (see Fig. 66). The cerebrum is the largest part of the human 
brain, and is divided into a left hemisphere and a right hemisphere. The 
outer few millimeters of each cerebral hemisphere are coated with a 
layered "bark", or cerebral cortex. The amount of cerebral cortex is the major 
distinguishing feature, in terms of anatomy, between human brains and 
brains of less intelligent species. We will not describe any of the brain's 
suborgans in detail because, as it turns out, only the roughest mapping can

1966), p. 50.] 
at this time be made between such large-scale suborgans and the activities, 
mental or physical, which they are responsible for. For instance, it is known 
that language is primarily handled in one of the two cerebral 
hemispheres-in fact, usually the left hemisphere. Also, the cerebellum is the 
place where trains of impulses are sent off to muscles to control motor 
activity. But how these areas carry out their functions is still largely a 
mystery. 
Mappings between Brains 
Now an extremely important question comes up here. If thinking does take 
place in the brain, then how are two brains different from each other? How 
is my brain different from yours? Certainly you do not think exactly as I do, 
nor as anyone else does. But we all have the same anatomical divisions in 
our brains. How far does this identity of brains extend? Does it go to the 
neural level? Yes, if you look at animals on a low enough level of the 
thinking-hierarchy-the lowly earthworm, for instance. The following 
quote is from the neurophysiologist, David Hubel, speaking at a conference 
on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence: 
The number of nerve cells in an animal like a worm would be measured, I 
suppose, in the thousands. One very interesting thing is that we may point to a 
particular individual cell in a particular earthworm, and then identify the 
same cell, the corresponding cell in another earthworm of the same species.' 
Brains and Thoughts 
341 

Earthworms have isomorphic brains! One could say, "There is only one 
earthworm." 
But such one-to-one mappability between individuals' brains disap-
pears very soon as you ascend in the thinking-hierarchy and the number of 
neurons increases-confirming one's suspicions that there is not just one 
human! Yet considerable physical similarity can be detected between dif-
ferent human brains when they are compared on a scale larger than a 
single neuron but smaller than the major suborgans of the brain. What 
does this imply about how individual mental differences are represented in 
the physical brain? If we looked at my neurons' interconnections, could we 
find various structures that could be identified as coding for specific things 
I know, specific beliefs I have, specific hopes, fears, likes and dislikes I 
harbor? If mental experiences can be attributed to the brain, can knowl-
edge and other aspects of mental life likewise be traced to specific locations 
inside the brain, or to specific physical subsystems of the brain? This will be 
a central question to which we will often return in this Chapter and the 
next. 
Localization of Brain Processes: An Enigma 
In an attempt to answer this question, the neurologist Karl Lashley, in a 
long series of experiments beginning around 1920 and running for many 
years, tried to discover where in its brain a rat stores its knowledge about 
maze running, In his book The Conscious Brain, Steven Rose describes 
Lashley's trials and tribulations this way: 
Lashley was attempting to identify the locus of memory within the cortex, 
and, to do so, first trained rats to rlln mazes, and then removed various 
cortical regions. He allowed the animals to recover and tested the retention of 
the maze-running skills. To his surprise it was not possible to find a particular 
region corresponding to the ability to remember the way through a maze. 
Instead all the rats which had had cortex regions removed suffered some kind 
of impairment, and the extent of the impairment was roughly proportional to 
the amount of cortex taken off. Removing cortex damaged the motor and 
sensory capacities of the animals, and they would limp, hop, roll, or stagger, 
but somehow they always managed to traverse the maze. So far as memory 
was concerned, the cortex appeared to be equipotential, that is, with all 
regions of equal possible utility, Indeed, Lashley concluded rather gloomily in 
his last paper "In Search of the Engram", which appeared in 1950, that the 
only conclusion was that memory wa~ not possible at all. 2 
Curiously, evidence for the opposite point of view was being developed 
in Canada at roughly the same time that Lashley was doing his last work, in 
the late 1940's. The neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield was examining the 
reactions of patients whose brains had been operated on, by inserting 
electrodes into various parts of their exposed brains, and then using small 
electrical pulses to stimulate the neuron or neurons to which the electrodes 
had been attached. These pulses were similar to the pulses which come 
from other neurons. What Penfield found was that stimulation of certain 
342 
Brains and Thoughts 

neurons would reliably create specific images or sensations in the patient. 
These artificially provoked impressions ranged from strange but indefin-
able fears to buzzes and colors, and, most impressively of all, to entire 
successions of events recalled from some earlier time of life, such as a 
childhood birthday party. The set of locations which could trigger such 
specific events was extremely small-basically centered upon a single 
neuron. Now these results of Penfield dramatically oppose the conclusions 
of Lashley, since they seem to imply that local areas are responsible for 
specific memories, after all. 
What can one make of this? One possible explanation could be that 
memories are coded locally, but over and over again in different areas of 
the cortex-a strategy perhaps developed in evolution as security against 
possible loss of cortex in fights, or in experiments conducted by 
neurophysiologists. Another explanation would be that memories can be 
reconstructed from dynamic processes spread over the whole brain, but 
can be triggered from local spots. This theory is based on the notion of 
modern telephone networks, where the routing of a long-distance call is 
not predictable in advance, for it is selected at the time the call is placed, 
and depends on the situation all over the whole country. Destroying any 
local part of the network would not block calls; it would just cause them to 
be routed around the damaged area. In this sense any call is potentially 
nonlocalizable. Yet any calljust connects up two specific points; in this sense 
any call is localizable. 
Specificity in Visual Processing 
Some of the most interesting and significant work on localization of brain 
processes has been done in the last fifteen years by David H ubel and 
Torsten Wiesel, at Harvard. They have mapped out visual pathways in the 
brains of cats, starting with the neurons in the retina, following their 
connections towards the rear of the head, passing through the "relay 
station" of the lateral geniculate, and ending up in the visual cortex, at the 
very back of the brain. First of all, it is remarkable that there exist well-
defined neural pathways, in light of Lashley's results. But more remarkable 
are the properties of the neurons located at different stages along the 
pathway. 
It turns out that retinal neurons are primarily contrast sensors. More 
specifically, the way they act is this. Each retinal neuron is normally firing at 
a "cruising speed". When its portion of the retina is struck by light, it may 
either fire faster or slow down and even stop firing. However, it will do so 
only provided that the surrounding part of the retina is less illuminated. So 
this means that there are two types of neuron: ·"on-center", and "off-
center". The on-center neurons are those whose firing rate increases 
whenever, in the small circular retinal area to which they are sensitive, the 
center is bright but the outskirts are dark; the off-center neurons are those 
which fire faster when there is darkness in the center and brightness in the 
Brains and Thoughts 
343 

outer ring. If an on-center pattern is shown to an off-center neuron, the 
neuron will slow down in firing (and vice versa). Uniform illumination will 
leave both types of retinal neuron unaffected; they will continue to fire at 
cruising speed. 
From the retina, signals from these neurons proceed via the optic 
nerve to the lateral geniculate, located somewhere towards the middle of 
the brain. There, one can find a direct mapping of the retinal surface in the 
sense that there are lateral-geniculate neurons which are triggered only by 
specific stimuli falling on specific areas of the retina. In that sense, the 
lateral geniculate is disappointing; it seems to be only a "relay station", and 
not a further processor (although to give it its due, the contrast sensitivity 
seems to be enhanced in the lateral geniculate). The retinal image is coded 
in a straightforward way in the firing patterns of the neurons in the lateral 
geniculate, despite the fact that the neurons there are not arranged on a 
two-dimensional surface in the form of the retina, but in a three-
dimensional block. So two dimensions get mapped onto three, yet the 
information is preserved: an isomorphism. There is probably some deep 
meaning to the change in the dimensionality of the representation, which is 
not yet fully appreciated. In any case, there are so many further un-
explained stages of vision that we should not be disappointed but pleased 
by the fact that-to some extent-we have figured out this one stage! 
From the lateral geniculate, the signals proceed back to the visual 
cortex. Here, some new types of processing occur. The cells of the visual 
cortex are divided into three categories: simple, complex, and hyper-
complex. Simple cells act very much like retinal cells or lateral geniculate 
cells: they respond to point-like light or dark spots with contrasting sur-
rounds, in particular regions of the retina. Complex cells, by contrast, usu-
ally receive input from a hundred or more other cells, and they detect light 
or dark bars oriented at specific angles on the retina (see Fig. 67). Hyper-
complex cells respond to corners, ban., or even "tongues" moving in specific 
directions (again see Fig. 67). These latter cells are so highly specialized 
that they are sometimes called "higher-order hypercomplex cells". 
A "Grandmother Cell"? 
Because of the discovery of cells in the visual cortex which can be triggered 
by stimuli of ever-increasing complexity, some people have wondered if 
things are not leading in the direction of "one cell, one concept"-for 
example, you would have a "grandmother cell" which would fire if, and 
only if, your grandmother came into view. This somewhat humorous 
example of a "superhypercomplex cell" is not taken very seriously. How-
ever, it is not obvious what alternative theory seems reasonable. One possi-
bility is that larger neural networks are excited collectively by sufficiently 
complex visual stimuli. Of course, the triggering of these larger mul-
tineuron units would somehow have to come from integration of signals 
emanating from the many hypercomplex cells. How this might be done, 
nobody knows. Just when we seem to be approaching the threshold where

"symbol" might emerge from "signal", the trail gets lost-a tantalizingly 
unfinished story. We will return to this story shortly, however, and try to fill 
in some of it. 
Earlier I mentioned the coarse-grained isomorphism between all 
human brains which exists on a large anatomical scale, and the very fine-
grained, neural-level isomorphism which exists between earthworm brains. 
It is quite interesting that there is also an isomorphism between the visual 
processing apparatus of cat, monkey, and human, the "grain" of which is 
somewhere between coarse and fine. Here is how that isomorphism works. 
First of all, all three species have "dedicated" areas of cortex at the back of 
their brains where visual processing is done: the visual cortex. Secondly, in 
Brains and Thoughts 
345 

each of them, the visual cortex breaks up into three subregions, called areas 
17, 18, and 19 of the cortex. These areas are still universal, in the sense that 
they can be located in the brain of any normal individual in any of the three 
species. Within each area you can go still further, reaching the "columnar" 
organization of the visual cortex. Perpendicular to the surface of the 
cortex, moving radially inwards towards the inner brain, visual neurons are 
arranged in "columns"-that is, almost all connections move along the 
radial, columnar direction, and not between columns. And each column 
maps onto a small, specific retinal region. The number of columns is not 
the same in each individual, so that one can't find "the same column". 
Finally, within a column, there are layers in which simple neurons tend to 
be found, and other layers in which complex neurons tend to be found. 
(The hypercomplex neurons tend to be found in areas 18 and 19 predom-
inantly, while the simple and complex ones are found mostly in area 17.) 
It appears that we run out of isomorphisms at this level of detail. From here 
on down to the individual neuron level, each individual cat, monkey, or 
human has a completely unique pattern-somewhat like a fingerprint or a 
signature. 
One minor but perhaps telling difference between visual processing in 
cats' brains and monkeys' brains has 10 do with the stage at which informa-
tion from the two eyes is integrated to yield a single combined higher-level 
signal. It turns out that it takes place slightly later in the monkey than in the 
cat, which gives each separate eye's signal a slightly longer time to get 
processed by itself. This is not too surprising, since one would expect that 
the higher a species lies in the intelligence hierarchy, the more complex will 
be the problems which its visual system will be called upon to handle; and 
therefore signals ought to pass through more and more early processing 
before receiving a final "label". This is quite dramatically confirmed by 
observations of the visual abilities of a newborn calf, which seems to be born 
with as much power of visual discrimination as it will ever have. It will shy 
away from people or dogs, but not from other cattle. Probably its entire 
visual system is "hard-wired" before birth, and involves relatively little 
cortical processing. On the other hand, a human's visual system, so deeply 
reliant on the cortex, takes several years to reach maturity. 
Funneling into Neural Modules 
A puzzling thing about the discoveries so far made about the organization 
of the brain is that few direct correspondences have been found between 
large-scale hardware and high-level software. The visual cortex, for in-
stance, is a large-scale piece of hardware, which is entirely dedicated to a 
clear software purpose-the processing of visual information-yet all of 
the processing so far discovered is still quite low-level. Nothing approach-
ing recognition of objects has been localized in the visual cortex. This means 
that no one knows where or how the output from complex and hyper-
complex cells gets transformed into conscious recognition of shapes, 
346 
Brains and Thoughts 

rooms, pictures, faces, and so on. People have looked for evidence of the 
"funneling" of many low-level neural responses into fewer and fewer 
higher-level ones, culminating in something such as the proverbial grand-
mother cell, or some kind of multineuron network, as mentioned above. It 
is evident that this will not be found in some gross anatomical division of 
the brain, but rather in a more microscopic analysis. 
One possible alternative to the the grandmother cell might be a fixed 
set of neurons, say a few dozen, at the thin end of the "funnel", all of which 
fire when Granny comes into view. And for each different recognizable 
object, there would be a unique network and a funneling process that 
would focus down onto that network. There are more complicated alterna-
tives along similar lines, involving networks which can be excited in differ-
ent manners, instead of in a fixed manner. Such networks would be the 
"symbols" in our brains. 
But is such funneling necessary? Perhaps an object being looked at is 
implicitly identified by its "signature" in the visual cortex-that is, the 
collected responses of simple, complex, and hypercomplex cells. Perhaps 
the brain does not need any further recognizer for a particular form. This 
theory, however, poses the following problem. Suppose you are looking at 
a scene. It registers its signature on your visual cortex; but then how do you 
get from that signature to a verbal description of the scene? For instance, 
the paintings of Edouard Vuillard, a French post-impressionist, often take 
a few seconds of scrutiny, and then suddenly a human figure will jump out 
at you. Presumably the signature gets imprinted on the visual cortex in the 
first fraction of a second-but the picture is only understood after a few 
seconds. This is but one example of what is actually a common 
phenomenon-a sensation of something "crystallizing" in your mind at the 
moment of recognition, which takes place not when the light rays hit your 
retina, but sometime later, after some part of your intelligence has had a 
chance to act on the retinal signals. 
The crystallization metaphor yields a pretty image derived from statis-
tical mechanics, of a myriad microscopic and uncorrelated activities in a 
medium, slowly producing local regions of coherence which spread and 
enlarge; in the end, the myriad small events will have performed a com-
plete structural revamping of their medium from the bottom up, changing 
it from a chaotic assembly of independent elements into one large, coher-
ent, fully linked structure. If one thinks of the early neural activities as 
independent, and of the end result of their many independent firings as 
the triggering of a well-defined large "module" of neurons, then the word 
"crystallization" seems quite apt. 
Another argument for funneling is based on the fact that there are a 
myriad distinct scenes which can cause you to feel you have perceived the 
same object-for example, your grandmother, who may be smiling or 
frowning, wearing a hat or not, in a bright garden or a dark train station, 
seen from near or far, from side or front, and so on. All these scenes 
produce extremely different signatures on the visual cortex; yet all of them 
could prompt you to say "Hello, Granny." So a funneling process must take 
Brains and Thoughts 
347 

place at some point after the reception of the visual signature and before 
the words are uttered. One could claim that this funneling is not part of the 
perception of Granny, but just part of verbalization. But it seems quite 
unnatural to partition the process that way, for you could internally use the 
information that it is Granny without verbalizing it. It would be very 
unwieldy to handle all of the information in the entire visual cortex, when 
so much of it could be thrown away, since you don't care about where 
shadows fall or how many buttons there are on her blouse, etc. 
Another difficulty with a non-funneling theory is to explain how there 
can be different interpretations for a single signature-for example, the 
Escher picture Convex and Concave (Fig. 23). Just as it seems obvious to us 
that we do not merely perceive dots on a television screen, but chunks, 
likewise it seems ridiculous to postulate that perception has taken place 
when a giant dot-like "signature" has been created on the visual cortex. 
There must be some funneling, whose end result is to trigger some specific 
modules of neurons, each of which is associated with the concepts-the 
chunks-in the scene. 
Modules Which Mediate Thought Processes 
Thus we are led to the conclusion that for each concept there is a fairly 
well-defined module which can be triggered-a module that consists of a 
small group of neurons-a "neural complex" of the type suggested earlier. 
A problem with this theory-at least if it is taken naively-is that it would 
suggest that one should be able to locate such modules somewhere within 
the brain. This has not yet been done, and some evidence, such as the 
experiments by Lashley, points against localization. However, it is still too 
early to tell. There may be many copies of each module spread around, or 
modules may overlap physically; both of these effects would tend to 
obscure any division of neurons into "packets". Perhaps the complexes are 
like very thin pancakes packed in layers which occasionally pass through 
each other; perhaps they are like long snakes which curl around each 
other, here and there flattening out, like cobras' heads; perhaps they are 
like spiderwebs; or perhaps they are circuits in which signals travel round 
and round' in shapes stranger than the dash of a gnat-hungry swallow. 
There is no telling. It is even possIble that these modules are software, 
rather than hardware, phenomena-but this is something which we will 
discuss later. I 
There are many questions that come to mind concerning these 
hypothesized neural complexes. For instance: 
348 
Do they extend into the lower regions of the brain, such as the 
midbrain, the hypothalamus, etc.? 
Can a single neuron belong to more than one such complex? 
To how many such complexes can a single neuron belong? 
By how many neurons can such complexes overlap? 
Brains and Thoughts 

Are these complexes pretty much the same for everybody? 
Are corresponding ones found in corresponding places in differ-
ent people's brains? 
Do they overlap in the same way in everybody's brain? 
Philosophically, the most important question of all is this: What would 
the existence of modules-for instance, a grandmother module-tell us? 
Would this give us any insight into the phenomenon of our own conscious-
ness? Or would it still leave us as much in the dark about what conscious-
ness is, as does knowledge that a brain is built out of neurons and glia? As 
you might guess from reading the Ant Fugue, my feeling is that it would go 
a long way towards giving us an understanding of the phenomenon of 
consciousness. The crucial step that needs to be taken is from a low-
level-neuron-by-neuron-description of the state of a brain, to a high-
level-module-by-module-description of the same state of the same brain. 
Or, to revert to the suggestive terminology of the Ant Fugue, we want to 
shift the description of the brain state from the signal level to the symbol 
level. 
Active Symbols 
Let us from now on refer to these hypothetical neural complexes, neural 
modules, neural packets, neural networks, multineuron units-call them 
what you will, whether they come in the form of pancakes, garden rakes, 
rattlesnakes, snowflakes, or even ripples on lakes-as symbols. A description 
of a brain state in terms of symbols was alluded to in the Dialogue. What 
would such a description be like? What kinds of concepts is it reasonable to 
think actually might be "symbolized"? What kinds of interrelations would 
symbols have? And what insights would this whole picture provide into 
consciousness? 
The first thing to emphasize is that symbols can be either dormant, or 
awake (activated). An active symbol is one which has been triggered-that is, 
one in which a threshold number of neurons have been caused to fire by 
stimuli coming from outside. Since a symbol can be triggered in many 
different ways, it can act in many different ways when awakened. This 
suggests that we should think of a symbol not as a fixed entity, but as a 
variable entity. Therefore it would not suffice to describe a brain state by 
saying "Symbols A, B, ... , N are all active"; rather, we would have to supply 
in addition a set of parameters for each active symbol, characterizing some 
aspects of the symbol's internal workings. It is an interesting question 
whether in each symbol there are certain core neurons, which invariably 
fire when the symbol is activated. If such a core set of neurons exists, we 
might refer to it as the "invariant core" of the symbol. It is tempting to 
assume that each time you think of, say, a waterfall, some fixed neural 
process is repeated, without doubt embellished in different ways depend-
ing on the context, but reliably occurring. However, it is not clear that this 
must be so. 
Brains and Thoughts 
349 

Now what does a symbol do, when awakened? A low-level description 
would say, "Many of its neurons fire." But this no longer interests us. The 
high-level description should eliminate all reference to neurons, and con-
centrate exclusively on symbols. So a high-level description of what makes a 
symbol active, as distinguished from dormant, would be, "It sends out 
messages, or signals, whose purpose is to try to awaken, or trigger, other 
symbols." Of course these messages would be carried as streams of nerve 
impulses, by neurons-but to the extent that we can avoid such phraseol-
ogy, we should, for it represents a low-level way of looking at things, and we 
hope that we can get along on purely a high level. In other words, we hope 
that thought processes can be thought of as being sealed off from neural 
events in the same way that the behavior of a clock is sealed off from the 
laws of quantum mechanics, or the biology of cells is sealed off from the 
laws of quarks. 
But what is the advantage of this high-level picture? Why is it better to 
say, "Symbols A and B triggered symbol C" than to say, "Neurons 183 
through 612 excited neuron 75 and caused it to fire"? This question was 
answered in the Ant Fugue: It is better because symbols symbolize things, and 
neurons don't. Symbols are the hardware realizations of concepts. Whereas 
a group of neurons triggering another neuron corresponds to no outer 
event, the triggering of some symbol by other symbols bears a relation to 
events in the real world--or in an imaginary world. Symbols are related to 
each other by the messages which they can send back and forth, in such a 
way that their triggering patterns are very much like the large-scale events 
which do happen in our world, or could happen in a world similar to ours. 
In essence, meaning arises here for the same reason as it did in the 
pq-system-isomorphism; only here, the isomorphism is infinitely more 
complex, subtle, delicate, versatile, and intensional. 
Incidentally, the requirement that symbols should be able to pass 
sophisticated messages to and fro is probably sufficient to exclude neurons 
themselves from playing the role of symbols. Since a neuron has only a 
single way of sending information out of itself, and has no way of selectively 
directing a signal now in one direction, now in another, it simply does not 
have the kind of selective triggering power which a symbol must have to act 
like an object in the real world. In his book The Insect Societies, E. O. Wilson 
makes a similar point about how messages propagate around inside ant 
colonies: 
[Mass communication] is defined as the transfer, among groups, 
of information that a single individual could not pass to another. 3 
It is not such a bad image, the brain as an ant colony! 
The next question-and an extremely important one it is, too-
concerns the nature and "size" of the concepts which are represented in the 
brain by single symbols. About the nature of symbols there are questions 
like this: Would there be a symbol for the general notion of waterfalls, or 
would there be different symbols for various specific waterfalls? Or would 
both of these alternatives be realized? About the "size" of symbols, there are 
questions like this: Would there be a symbol for an entire story? Or for a 
350 
Brains and Thoughts 

melody? Or ajoke? Or is it more likely that there would only be symbols for 
concepts roughly the size of words, and that larger ideas, such as phrases or 
sentences, would be represented by concurrent or sequential activation of 
various symbols? 
Let us consider the issue of the size of concepts represented by sym-
bols. Most thoughts expressed in sentences are made up out of basic, 
quasi-atomic components which we do not usually analyze further. These 
are of word size, roughly-&ometimes a little longer, sometimes a little 
shorter. For instance, the noun "waterfall", the proper noun "Niagara 
Falls", the past-tense suffix "-ed", the verb "to catch up with", and longer 
idiomatic phrases are all close to atomic. These are typical elementary 
brush strokes which we use in painting portraits of more complex concepts, 
such as the plot of a movie, the flavor of a city, the nature of consciousness, 
etc. Such complex ideas are not single brush strokes. It seems reasonable to 
think that the brush strokes of language are also brush strokes of thought, 
and therefore that symbols represent concepts of about this size. Thus a 
symbol would be roughly something for which you know a word or stock 
phrase, or with which you associate a proper name. And the representation 
in the brain of a more complex idea, such as a problem in a love affair, 
would be a very complicated sequence of activations of various symbols by 
other symbols. 
Classes and Instances 
There is a general distinction concerning thinking: that between categories 
and individuals, or classes and instances. (Two other terms sometimes used 
are "types" and "tokens".) It might seem at first sight that a given symbol 
would inherently be either a symbol for a class or a symbol for an 
instance-but that is an oversimplification. Actually, most symbols may play 
either role, depending on the context of their activation. For example, look 
at the list below: 
(1) 
a publication 
(2) 
a newspaper 
(3) 
The San Francisco Chronicle 
(4) 
the May 18 edition of the Chronicle 
(5) 
my copy of the May 18 edition of the Chronicle 
(6) 
my copy of the May 18 edition of the Chronicle as 
it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with 
my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, 
burning) 
Here, lines 2 to 5 all play both roles. Thus, line 4 is an instance of of the 
general class of line 3, and line 5 is an instance of line 4. Line 6 is a special 
kind of instance of a class: a manifestation. The successive stages of an object 
during its life history are its manifestations. It is interesting to wonder if the 
cows on a farm perceive the invariant individual underneath all the man-
ifestations of the jolly farmer who feeds them hay. 
Brains and Thoughts 
351 

The Prototype Principle 
The list above seems to be a hierarchy of generality-the top being a very 
broad conceptual category, the bottom some very humble particular thing 
located in space and time. However. the idea that a "class" must always be 
enormously broad and abstract is far too limited. The reason is that our 
thought makes use of an ingenious principle, which might be called the 
prototype principle: 
The most specific event can serve as a general example 
of a class of events. 
Everyone knows that specific events have a vividness which imprints them 
so strongly on the memory that they can later be used as models for other 
events which are like them in some way. Thus in each specific event, there is 
the germ of a whole class of similar events. This idea that there is generality 
in the specific is of far-reaching importance. 
Now it is natural to ask: Do the symbols in the brain represent classes, 
or instances? Are there certain symbols which represent only classes, while 
other symbols represent only instances? Or can a single symbol serve duty 
either as a class symbol or instance symbol, depending which parts of it are 
activated? The latter theory seems appealing; one might think that a "light" 
activation of a symbol might represent a class, and that a deeper, or more 
complex, activation would contain more detailed internal neural firing 
patterns, and hence would represent an instance. But on second thought, 
this is crazy: it would imply, for example, that by activating the symbol for 
"publication" in a sufficiently complex way, you would get the very complex 
symbol which represents a specific newspaper burning in my fireplace. And 
every other possible manifestation of every other piece of printed matter 
would be represented internally by some manner of activating the single 
symbol for "publication". That seems much too heavy a burden to place on 
the single symbol "publication". One must conclude, therefore, that in-
stance symbols can exist side by side with class symbols, and are not just 
modes of activation of the latter. 
The Splitting-off of Instances from Classes 
On the other hand, instance symbols often inherit many of their properties 
from the classes to which those instances belong. If I tell you I went to see a 
movie, you will begin "minting" a fresh new instance symbol for that 
particular movie; but in the absence of more information, the new instance 
symbol will have to lean rather heavily on your pre-existing class symbol for 
"movie". Unconsciously, you will rely on a host of presuppositions about 
that movie-for example, that it lasted between one and three hours, that it 
was shown in a local theater, that it told a story about some people, and so 
on. These are built into the class symbol as expected links to other symbols 
(i.e., potential triggering relations), and are called default options. In any 
352 
Brains and Thoughts 

freshly minted instance symbol, the default options can easily be overrid-
den, but unless this is explicitly done, they will remain in the instance 
symbol, inherited from its class symbol. Until they are overridden, they 
provide some preliminary basis for you to think about the new instance-
for example, the movie I went to see-by using the reasonable guesses 
which are supplied by the "stereotype", or class symbol. 
A fresh and simple instance is like a child without its own ideas or 
experiences-it relies entirely on its parents' experiences and opinions and 
just parrots them. But gradually, as it interacts more and more with the re~t 
of the world, the child acquires its own idiosyncratic experiences and 
inevitably begins to split away from the parents. Eventually, the child 
becomes a full-fledged adult. In the same way, a fresh instance can split off 
from its parent class over a period of time, and become a class, or pro-
totype, in its own right. 
For a graphic illustration of such a splitting-off process, suppose that 
some Saturday afternoon you turn on your car radio, and happen to tune 
in on a football game between two "random" teams. At first you do not 
know the names of the players on either team. All you register, when the 
announcer says, "Palindromi made the stop on the twenty-seven yard line, 
and that brings up fourth down and six to go," is that some player stopped 
some other player. Thus it is a case of activation of the class symbol 
"football player", with some sort of coordinated activation of the symbol for 
tackling. But then as Palindromi figures in a few more key plays, you begin 
building up a fresh instance symbol for him in particular, using his name, 
perhaps, as a focal point. This symbol is dependent, like a child, on the class 
symbol for "football player": most of your image of Palindromi is supplied 
by your stereotype of a football player as contained in the "football player" 
symbol. But gradually, as more information comes to you, the "Palindromi" 
symbol becomes more autonomous, and relies less and less on concurrent 
activation of its parent class symbol. This may happen in a few minutes, as 
Palindromi makes a few good plays and stands out. His teammates may still 
all be represented by activations of the class symbol, however. Eventually, 
perhaps after a few days, when you have read some articles in the sports 
section of your paper, the umbilical cord is broken, and Palindromi can 
stand on his own two feet. Now you know such things as his home town and 
his major in college; you recognize his face; and so on. At this point, 
Palindromi is no longer conceived of merely as a football player, but as a 
human being who happens also to be a football player. "Palindromi" is an 
instance symbol which can become active while its parent class symbol 
(football player) remains dormant. 
Once, the Palindromi symbol was a satellite orbiting around its mother 
symbol, like an artificial satellite circling the Earth, which is so much bigger 
and more massive. Then there came an intermediate stage, where one 
symbol was more important than the other, but they could be seen as 
orbiting around each other-something like the Earth and the Moon. 
Finally, the new symbol becomes quite autonomous; now it might easily 
serve as a class symbol around which could start rotating new satellites-
Brains and Thoughts 
353 

symbols for other people who are less familiar but who have something in 
common with Palindromi, and for whom he can serve as a temporary 
stereotype, until you acquire more information, enabling the new symbols 
also to become autonomous. 
The Difficulty of Disentangling Symbols from Each Other 
These stages of growth and eventual detachment of an instance from a 
class will be distinguishable from each other by the way in which the 
symbols involved are linked. Sometimes it will no doubt be very difficult to 
tell just where one symbol leaves off and the other one begins. How "active" 
is the one symbol, compared to the other? If one can be activated indepen-
dently of the other, then it would he quite sensible to call them autono-
mous. 
We have used an astronomy metaphor above, and it is interesting that 
the problem of the motion of planets is an extremely complex one-in fact 
the general problem of three gravitationally interacting bodies (such as the 
Earth, Moon, and Sun) is far from solved, even after several centuries of 
work. One situation in which it is possible to obtain good approximate 
solutions, however, is when one body is much more massive than the other 
two (here, the Sun); then it makes sense to consider that body as stationary, 
with the other two rotating about it; on top of this can finally be added the 
interaction between the two satellites. But this approximation depends on 
breaking up the system into the Sun, and a "cluster": the Earth-Moon 
system. This is an approximation, but it enables the system to be under-
stood quite deeply. So to what extent is this cluster a part of reality, and to 
what extent is it a mental fabrication, a human imposition of structure on 
the universe? This problem of the "reality" of boundaries drawn between 
what are perceived to be autonomous or semi-autonomous clusters will 
create endless trouble when we relate it to symbols in the brain. 
One greatly puzzling question is the simple issue of plurals. How do we 
visualize, say, three dogs in a teacupr Or several people in an elevator? Do 
we begin with the class symbol for "dog" and then rub three "copies" off of 
it? That is, do we manufacture three fresh instance symbols using the class 
symbol "dog" as template? Or do we jointly activate the symbols "three" and 
"dog"? By adding more or less detail to the scene being imagined, either 
theory becomes hard to maintain. For instance, we certainly do not have a 
separate instance symbol for each nose, mustache, grain of salt, etc., that we 
have ever seen. We let class symbols take care of such numerous items, and 
when we pass people on the street who have mustaches, we somehow just 
activate the "mustache" class symbol, without minting fresh instance sym-
bols, unless we scrutinize them carefully. 
On the other hand, once we begin to distinguish individuals, we cannot 
rely on a single class symbol (e.g., "person") to timeshare itself among all 
the different people. Clearly there must come into existence separate 
instance symbols for individual people. It would be ridiculous to imagine 
354 
Brains and Thoughts 

that this feat could be accomplished by "juggling"-that is, by the single 
class symbol Hitting back and forth between several different modes of 
activation (one for each person). 
Between the extremes, there must be room for many sorts of inter-
mediate cases. There may be a whole hierarchy of ways of creating the 
class-instance distinction in the brain, giving rise to symbols-and symbol-
organizations-of varying degrees of specificity. The following different 
kinds of individual and joint activation of symbols might be responsible for 
mental images of various degrees of specificity: 
(1) 
various different modes or depths of activation of a single 
class symbol; 
(2) 
simultaneous activation of several class symbols in some 
coordinated manner; 
(3) 
activation of a single instance symbol; 
(4) 
activation of a single instance symbol In conjunction with 
activation of several class symbols; 
(5) 
simultaneous activation of several instance symbols and sev-
eral class symbols in some coordinated manner. 
This brings us right back to the question: "When is a symbol a distin-
guishable subsystem of the brain?" For instance, consider the second 
example-simultaneous activation of several class symbols in some coordi-
nated manner. This could easily be what happens when "piano sonata" is 
the concept under consideration (the symbols for "piano" and "sonata" 
being at least two of the activated symbols). But if this pair of symbols gets 
activated in conjunction often enough, it is reasonable to assume that the 
link between them will become strong enough that they will act as a unit, 
when activated together in the proper way. So two or more symbols can act 
as one, under the proper conditions, which means that the problem of 
enumerating the number of symbols in the brain is trickier than one might 
guess. 
Sometimes conditions can arise where two previously unlinked sym-
bols get activated simultaneously and in a coordinated fashion. They may 
fit together so well that it seems like an inevitable union, and a single new 
symbol is formed by the tight interaction of the two old symbols. If this 
happens, would it be fair to say that the new symbol "always had been there 
but never had been activated"-or should one say that it has been 
"created"? 
In case this sounds too abstract, let us take a concrete example: the 
Dialogue Crab Canon. In the invention of this Dialogue, two existing 
symbols-that for "musical crab canon", and that for "verbal dialogue"-
had to be activated simultaneously and in some way forced to interact. 
Once this was done, the rest was quite inevitable: a new symbol-a class 
symbol-was born from the interaction of these two, and from then on it 
was able to be activated on its own. Now had it always been a dormant 
symbol in my brain? If so, then it must also have been a dormant symbol in 
Brains and Thoughts 
355 

the brain of every human who ever had its component symbols, even if it 
never was awakened in them. This would mean that to enumerate the 
symbols in anyone's brain, one would have to count all dormant symbols-all 
possible combinations and permutations of all types of activations of all 
known symbols. This would even include those fantastic creatures of 
software that one's brain invents when one is asleep-the strange mixtures 
of ideas which wake up when their host goes to sleep ... The existence of 
these "potential symbols" shows that it is really a huge oversimplification to 
imagine that the brain is a well-defined collection of symbols in well-defined 
states of activation. It is much harder than that to pin down a brain state on 
the symbol level. 
Symbols - Software or Hardware? 
With the enormous and ever-growing repertoire of symbols that exist in 
each brain, you might wonder whether there eventually comes a point 
when the brain is saturated-when there is just no more room for a new 
symbol. This would come about, presumably, if symbols never overlapped 
each other-if a given neuron never served a double function, so that 
symbols would be like people getting into an elevator. "Warning: This 
brain has a maximum capacity of 350,275 symbols!" 
This is not a necessary feature of the symbol model of brain function, 
however. In fact, overlapping and completely tangled symbols are probably 
the rule, so that each neuron, far from being a member of a unique symbol, 
is probably a functioning part of hundreds of symbols. This gets a little 
disturbing, because if it is true, then might it not just as easily be the case 
that each neuron is part of every single symbol? If that were so, then there 
would be no localizability whatsoever of symbols-every symbol would be 
identified with the whole of the brain. This would account for results like 
Lashley's cortex removal in rats-but It would also mean abandonment of 
our original idea of breaking the brain up into physically distinct subsys-
tems. Our earlier characterization of symbols as "hardware realizations of 
concepts" could at best be a great oversimplification. In fact, if every symbol 
were made up of the same component neurons as every other symbol, then 
what sense would it make to speak of distinct symbols at all? What would be 
the signature of a given symbol's activation-that is, how could the activa-
tion of symbol A be distinguished from the activation of symbol B? 
Wouldn't our whole theory go down the drain? And even if there is not a 
total overlap of symbols, is our theory not more and more difficult to 
maintain, the more that symbols do overlap? (One possible way of portray-
ing overlapping symbols is shown in Figure 68.) 
There is a way to keep a theory hased on symbols even if physically, 
they overlap considerably or totally. Consider the surface of a pond, which 
can support many different types of waves or ripples. The hardware-
namely the water itself-is the same in all cases, but it possesses different 
possible modes of excitation. Such software excitations of the same

FIGURE 68. In this schematic diagram, neurons are imagined as laid out as dots in one 
plane. Two overlapping neural pathways are shown in different shades of gray. It may happen 
that two independent "neural flashes" simultaneously race down these two pathways, passing 
through one another like two ripples on a pond's surface (as in Fig. 52). This is illustrative of 
the idea of two "active symbols" which share neurons and which may even be simultaneously 
activated. [From John C. Eccles, Facing Reality (New York: Springer Verlag, 1970), p.21.] 
hardware can all be distinguished from each other. By this analogy, I do 
not mean to go so far as to suggest that all the different symbols are just 
different kinds of "waves" propagating through a uniform neural medium 
which admits of no meaningful division into physically distinct symbols. 
But it may be that in order to distinguish one symbol's activation from that 
of another symbol, a process must be carried out which involves not only 
locating the neurons which are firing, but also identifying very precise 
details of the timing of the firing of those neurons. That is, which neuron 
preceded which other neuron, and by how much? How many times a 
second was a particular neuron firing? Thus perhaps several symbols can 
coexist in the same set of neurons by having different characteristic neural 
firing patterns. The difference between a theory having physically distinct 
symbols, and a theory having overlapping symbols which are distinguished 
from each other by modes of excitation, is that the former gives hardware 
realizations of concepts, while the latter gives partly hardware, partly 
software realizations of concepts.

Liftability of Intelligence 
Thus we are left with two basic problems in the unraveling of thought 
processes, as they take place in the brain. One is to explain how the 
low-level traffic of neuron firings gives rise to the high-level traffic of 
symbol activations. The other is to explain the high-level traffic of symbol 
activation in its own terms-to make a theory which does not talk about the 
low-level neural events. If this latter is possible-and it is a key assumption 
at the basis of all present research into Artificial Intelligence-then intelli-
gence can be realized in other types of hardware than brains. Then intelli-
gence will have been shown to be a property that can be "lifted" right out of 
the hardware in which it resides-or in other words, intelligence will be a 
software property. This will mean that the phenomena of consciousness and 
intelligence are indeed high-level in the same sense as most other complex 
FIGURE 69. 
The construction of an arch by workers of the termite Macrotermes bel-
licosus. Each column is built up by the addition of pellets of soil and excrement. On the outer 
part of the left column a worker is seen depositing a round fecal pellet. Other workers, having 
carried pellets in their mandibles up the columns, are now placing them at the growing ends of 
the columns. When a column reaches a certain height the termites, evidently guided by odor, 
begin to extend it at an angle in the direction 0/ a neighboring column. A completed arch is 
shown in the background. [Drawing by Turid Hiilldobler;!rom E. O. Wilson, The Insect Societies

phenomena of nature: they have their own high-level laws which depend 
on, yet are "liftable" out of, the lower levels. If, on the other hand, there is 
absolutely no way to realize symbol-triggering patterns without having all 
the hardware of neurons (or simulated neurons), this will imply that intelli-
gence is a brain-bound phenomenon, and much more difficult to unravel 
than one which owes its existence to a hierarchy oflaws on several different 
levels. 
Here we come back to the mysterious collective behavior of ant col-
onies, which can build huge and intricate nests, despite the fact that the 
roughly 100,000 neurons of an ant brain almost certainly do not carry any 
information about nest structure. How, then, does the nest get created? 
Where does the information reside? In particular, ponder where the in-
formation describing an arch such as is shown in Figure 69 can be found. 
Somehow, it must be spread about in the colony, in the caste distribution, 
the age distribution-and probably largely in the physical properties of the 
ant-body itself. That is, the interaction between ants is determined just as 
much by their six-Ieggedness and their size and so on, as by the information 
stored in their brain. Could there be an Artificial Ant Colony? 
Can One Symbol Be Isolated? 
Is it possible that one single symbol could be awakened in isolation from all 
others? Probably not. Just as objects in the world always exist in a context of 
. other objects, so symbols are always connected to a constellation of other 
symbols. This does not necessarily mean that symbols can never be disen-
tangled from each other. To make a rather simple analogy, males and 
females always arise in a species together: their roles are completely in-
tertwined, and yet this does not mean that a male cannot be distinguished 
from a female. Each is reflected in the other, as the beads in Indra's net 
reflect each other. The recursive intertwining of the functions F( n) and 
M(n) in Chapter V does not prevent each function from having its own 
characteristics. The intertwining of F and M could be mirrored in a pair of 
RTN's which call each other. From this we can jump to a whole network of 
A TN's intertwined with each other-a heterarch y of interacting recursive 
procedures. Here, the meshing is so inherent that no one A TN could be 
activated in isolation; yet its activation may be completely distinctive, not 
confusable with that of any other of the ATN's. It is not such a bad image, 
the brain as an ATN-colony! 
Likewise, symbols, with all their multiple links to each other, are 
meshed together and yet ought to be able to be teased apart. This might 
involve identifying a neural network, a network plus a mode of 
excitation-or possibly something of a completely different kind. In any 
case, if symbols are part of reality, presumably there exists a natural way to 
chart them out in a real brain. However, if some symbols were finally 
identified in a brain, this would not mean that anyone of them could be 
awakened in isolation. 
Brains and Thoughts 
359 

The fact that a symbol cannot be awakened in isolation does not 
diminish the separate identity of the ~)'mbol; in fact, quite to the contrary: a 
symbol's identity lies precisely in its ways of being connected (via potential 
triggering links) to other symbols. The network by which symbols can 
potentially trigger each other constitutes the brain's working model of the 
real universe, as well as of the alternate universes which it considers (and 
which are every bit as important for the individual's survival in the real 
world as the real world is). 
The Symbols of Insects 
Our facility for making instances out of classes and classes out of instances 
lies at the basis of our intelligence, and it is one of the great differences 
between human thought and the thought processes of other animals. Not 
that I have ever belonged to another species and experienced at first hand 
how it feels to think their way-but from the outside it is apparent that no 
other species forms general concepts as we do, or imagines hypothetical 
worlds-variants on the world as it is, which aid in figuring out which 
future pathway to choose. For instance, consider the celebrated "language 
of the bees"-information-laden dances which are performed by worker 
bees returning to the hive, to inform other bees of the location of nectar. 
While there may be in each bee a set of rudimentary symbols which are 
activated by such a dance, there is no reason to believe that a bee has an 
expandable vocabulary of symbols. Bees and other insects do not seem to 
have the power to generalize-that is, to develop new class symbols from 
instances which we would perceive as nearly identical. 
A classic experiment with solitary wasps is reported in Dean Wool-
dridge's book, Mechanical Man, from which I quote: 
When the time comes for egg laying, the wasp Sphex builds a burrow for the 
purpose and seeks out a cricket which ~he stings in such a way as to paralyze 
but not kill it. She drags the cricket into the burrow, lays her eggs alongside, 
closes the burrow, then flies away, never to return. In due course, the eggs 
hatch and the wasp grubs feed off the paralyzed cricket, which has not 
decayed, having been kept in the wasp equivalent of a deepfreeze. To the 
human mind, such an elaborately organized and seemingly purposeful 
routine conveys a convincing flavor or logic and thoughtfulness-until more 
details are examined. For example. the wasp's routine is to bring the 
paralyzed cricket to the burrow, leave it on the threshold, go inside to see that 
all is well, emerge, and then drag the cricket in. If the cricket is moved a few 
inches away while the wasp is inside making her preliminary inspection, the 
wasp, on emerging from the burrow. will bring the cricket back to the 
threshold, but not inside, and will then repeat the preparatory procedure of 
entering the burrow to see that everything is all right. If again the cricket is 
removed a few inches while the wasp is inside, once again she will move the 
cricket up to the threshold and reenter the burrow for a final check. The wasp 
never thinks of pulling the cricket straight in. On one occasion this procedure 
was repeated forty times, always with the same result.4 
360 
Brains and Thoughts 

This seems to be completely hard-wired behavior. Now in the wasp brain, 
there may be rudimentary symbols, capable of triggering each other; but 
there is nothing like the human capacity to see several instances as instances 
of an as-yet-unformed class, and then to make the class symbol; nor is there 
anything like the human ability to wonder, "What if I did this-what would 
ensue in that hypothetical world?" This type of thought process requires an 
ability to manufacture instances and to manipulate them as if they were 
symbols standing for objects in a real situation, although that situation may 
not be the case, and may never be the case. 
Class Symbols and Imaginary Worlds 
Let us reconsider the April Fool's joke about the borrowed car, and the 
images conjured up in your mind during the telephone call. To begin with, 
you need to activate symbols which represent a road, a car, a person in a 
car. Now the concept "road" is a very general one, with perhaps several 
stock samples which you can unconsciously pull out of dormant memory 
when the occasion arises. "Road" is a class, rather than an instance. As you 
listen to the tale, you quickly activate symbols which are instances with 
gradually increasing specificity. For instance, when you learn that the road 
was wet, this conjures up a more specific image, though you realize that it is 
most likely quite different from the actual road where the incident took 
place. But that is not important; what matters is whether your symbol is 
sufficiently well suited for the story-that is, whether the symbols which it 
can trigger are the right kind. 
As the story progresses, you fill in more aspects of this road: there is a 
high bank against which a car could smash. Now does this mean that you 
are activating the symbol for "bank", or does it mean that you are setting 
some parameters in your symbol for "road"? Undoubtedly both. That is, 
the network of neurons which represents "road" has many different ways 
of firing, and you are selecting which subnetwork actually shall fire. At the 
same time, you are activating the symbol for "bank", and this is probably 
instrumental in the process of selecting the parameters for "road", in that 
its neurons may send signals to some of those in "road"-and vice versa. (In 
case this seems a little confusing, it is because I am somewhat straddling 
levels of description-I am trying to set up an image of the symbols, as well 
as of their component neurons.) 
No less important than the nouns are the verbs, prepositions, etc. 
They, too, activate symbols, which send messages back and forth to each 
other. There are characteristic differences between the kinds of triggering 
patterns of symbols for verbs and symbols for nouns, of course, which 
means that they may be physically somewhat differently organized. For 
instance, nouns might have fairly localized symbols, while verbs and prepo-
sitions might have symbols with many "tentacles" reaching all around the 
cortex; or any number of other possibilities. 
After the story is all over, you learn it was all untrue. The power of 
Brains and Thoughts 
361 

"rubbing off" instances from classes, in the way that one makes rubbings 
from brasses in churches, has enabled you to represent the situation, and 
has freed you from the need to remain faithful to the real world. The fact 
that symbols can act as templates for other symbols gives you some mental 
independence of reality: you can create artificial universes, in which there 
can happen nonreal events with any amount of detail that you care to 
imbue them with. But the class symbols themselves, from which all of this 
richness springs, are deeply grounded in reality. 
Usually symbols play isomorphic roles to events which seem like they 
could happen, although sometimes symbols are activated which represent 
situations which could not happen--for example, watches sizzling, tubas 
laying eggs, etc. The borderline between what could and what could not 
happen is an extremely fuzzy one. As we imagine a hypothetical event, we 
bring certain symbols into active states-and depending on how well they 
interact (which is presumably reflected in our comfort in continuing the 
train of thought), we say the event "could" or "could not" happen. Thus the 
terms "could" and "could not" are extremely subjective. Actually, there is a 
good deal of agreement among people about which events could or could 
not happen. This reflects the great amount of mental structure which we all 
share-but there is a borderline area where the subjective aspect of what 
kinds of hypothetical worlds we are willing to entertain is apparent. A 
careful study of the kinds of imaginary events that people consider could 
and could not happen would yield much insight into the triggering pat-
terns of the symbols by which people think. 
Intuitive Laws of Physics 
When the story has been completely told, you have built up quite an 
elaborate mental model of a scene, and in this model all the objects obey 
physical law. This means that physical law itself must be implicitly present 
in the triggering patterns of the symbols. Of course, the phrase "physical 
law" here does not mean "the laws of physics as expounded by a physicist", 
but rather the intuitive, chunked la\\s which all of us have to have in our 
minds in order to survive. 
A curious sidelight is that one can voluntarily manufacture mental 
sequences of events which violate physical law, if one so desires. For 
instance, if I but suggest that you imagine a scene with two cars approach-
ing each other and then passing right through each other, you won't have 
any trouble doing so. The intuitive physical laws can be overridden by 
imaginary laws of physics; but how this overriding is done, how such 
sequences of images are manufactured-indeed what anyone visual image 
is-all of these are deeply cloaked mysteries-inaccessible pieces of knowl-
edge. 
Needless to say, we have in our brains chunked laws not only of how 
inanimate objects act, but also of how plants, animals, people and societies 
act-in other words, chunked laws of biology, psychology, sociology, and so 
362 
Brains and Thoughts 

on. All of the internal representations of such entities involve the inevitable 
feature of chunked models: determinism is sacrificed for simplicity. Our 
representation of reality ends up being able only to predict probabilities of 
ending up in certain parts of abstract spaces of behavior-not to predict 
anything with the precision of physics. 
Procedural and Declarative Knowledge 
A distinction which is made in Artificial Intelligence is that between pro-
cedural and declarative types of knowledge. A piece of knowledge is said to 
be declarative if it is stored explicitly, so that not only the programmer but 
also the program can "read" it as if it were in an encyclopedia or an 
almanac. This usually means that it is encoded locally, not spread around. 
By contrast, procedural knowledge is not encoded as facts---only as pro-
grams. A programmer may be able to peer in and say, "I see that because of 
these procedures here, the program 'knows' how to write English 
sentences "-but the program itself may have no explicit awareness of how it 
writes those sentences. For instance, its vocabulary may include none of the 
words "English", "sentence", and "write" at all! Thus procedural knowl-
edge is usually spread around in pieces, and you can't retrieve it, or "key" 
on it. It is a global consequence of how the program works, not a local 
detail. In other words, a piece of purely procedural knowledge is an 
epiphenomenon. 
In most people there coexists, along with a powerful procedural rep-
resentation of the grammar of their native language, a weaker declarative 
representation of it. The two may easily be in conflict, so that a native 
speaker will often instruct a foreigner to say things he himself would never 
say, but which agree with the declarative "book learning" he acquired in 
school sometime. The intuitive or chunked laws of physics and other 
disciplines mentioned earlier fall mainly on the procedural side; the knowl-
edge that an octopus has eight tentacles falls mainly on the declarative side. 
In between the declarative and procedural extremes, there are all 
possible shades. Consider the recall of a melody. Is the melody stored in 
your brain, note by note? Could a surgeon extract a winding neural fila-
ment from your brain, then stretch it straight, and finally proceed to 
pinpoint along it the successively stored notes, almost as if it were a piece of 
magnetic tape? If so, then melodies are stored declaratively. Or is the recall 
of a melody mediated by the interaction of a large number of symbols, 
some of which represent tonal relationships, others of which represent 
emotional qualities, others of which represent rhythmic devices, and so on? 
If so, then melodies are stored procedurally. In reality, there is probably a 
mixture of these extremes in the way a melody is stored and recalled. 
It is interesting that, in pulling a melody out of memory, most people 
do not discriminate as to key, so that they are as likely to sing "Happy 
Birthday" in the key of F -sharp as in the key of C. This indicates that tone 
relationships, rather than absolute tones, are stored. But there is no reason 
Brains and Thoughts 
363 

that tone relationships could not be stored quite declaratively. On the other 
hand, some melodies are very easy to memorize, whereas others are ex-
tremely elusive. If it were just a matter of storing successive notes, any 
melody could be stored as easily as any other. The fact that some melodies 
are catchy and others are not seems 1.0 indicate that the brain has a certain 
repertoire of familiar patterns which are activated as the melody is heard. 
So, to "play back" the melody, those patterns would have to be activated in 
the same order. This returns us to the concept of symbols triggering one 
another, rather than a simple linear sequence of declaratively stored notes 
or tone relationships. 
How does the brain know whether a piece of knowledge is stored 
declaratively? For instance, suppose you are asked, "What is the population 
of Chicago?" Somehow the number five million springs to mind, without 
your wondering, "Gee, how would [ go about counting them all?" Now 
suppose I ask you, "How many chairs are there in your living room?" Here, 
the opposite happens-instead of trying to dredge the answer out of a 
mental almanac, you immediately either go to the room and count the 
chairs, or you manufacture the room in your head and count the chairs in 
the image of the room. The questions were of a single type-"how 
many?"-yet one of them caused a piece of declarative knowledge to be 
fetched, while the other one caused a procedural method of finding the 
answer to be invoked. This is one example where it is clear that you have 
knowledge about how you classify your own knowledge; and what is more, 
some of that metaknowledge may itself be stored procedurally, so that it is 
used without your even being aware of how it is done. 
Visual Imagery 
One of the most remarkable and difficult-to-describe qualities of con-
sciousness is visual imagery. How do we create a visual image of our living 
room? Of a roaring mountain brook? Of an orange? Even more mysteri-
ous, how do we manufacture images unconsciously, images which guide 
our thoughts, giving them power and color and depth? From what store 
are they fetched? What magic allows us to mesh two or three images, hardly 
giving a thought as to how we should do it? Knowledge of how to do this is 
among the most procedural of all, for we have almost no insight into what 
mental imagery is. 
It may be that imagery is based on our ability to suppress motor 
activity. By this, I mean the following. If you imagine an orange, there may 
occur in your cortex a set of commands to pick it up, to smell it, to inspect it, 
and so on. Clearly these commands cannot be carried out, because the 
orange is not there. But they can be sent along the usual channels towards 
the cerebellum or other suborgans of the brain, until, at some critical point, 
a "mental faucet" is closed, preventing them from actually being carried 
out. Depending on how far down the line this "faucet" is situated, the 
images may be more or less vivid and real-seeming. Anger can cause us to 
364 
Brains and Thoughts 

imagine quite vividly picking up some object and throwing it, or kicking 
something; yet we don't actually do so. On the other hand, we feel so "near" 
to actually doing so. Probably the faucet catches the nerve impulses "at the 
last moment". 
Here is another way in which visualization points out the distinction 
between accessible and inaccessible knowledge. Consider how you vi-
sualized the scene of the car skidding on the mountain road. Undoubtedly 
you imagined the mountain as being much larger than the car. Now did 
this happen because sometime long ago you had occasion to note that "cars 
are not as big as mountains"; then you committed this statement to rote 
memory; and in imagining the story, you retrieved this fact, and made use 
of it in constructing your image? A most unlikely theory. Or did it happen 
instead as a consequence of some introspectively inaccessible interactions of 
the symbols which were activated in your brain? Obviously the latter seems 
far more likely. This knowledge that cars are smaller than mountains is not 
a piece of rote memorization, but a piece of knowledge which can be 
created by deduction. Therefore, most likely it is not stored in any single 
symbol in your brain, but rather it can be produced as a result of the 
activation, followed by the mutual interaction, of many symbols-for 
example, those for "compare", "size", "car", "mountain", and probably 
others. This means that the knowledge is stored not explicitly, but im-
plicitly, in a spread-about manner, rather than as a local "packet of infor-
mation". Such simple facts as relative sizes of objects have to be assembled, 
rather than merely retrieved. Therefore, even in the case of a verbally 
accessible piece of knowledge:;, there are complex inaccessible processes 
which mediate its coming to the state of being ready to be said. 
We shall continue our exploration of the entities called "symbols" in 
different Chapters. In Chapters XVIII and XIX, on Artificial Intelligence, 
we shall discuss some possible ways of implementing active symbols in 
programs. And next Chapter, we shall discuss some of the insights that our 
symbol-based model of brain activity give into the comparison of brains.

CHAPTER XII 
Minds and Thoughts 
Can Minds Be Mapped onto Each Other? 
Now TH AT WE have hypothesized the existence of very high-level active 
subsystems of the brain (symbols), we may return to the matter of a possible 
isomorphism, or partial isomorphism, between two brains. Instead of ask-
ing about an isomorphism on the neural level (which surely does not exist), 
or on the macroscopic suborgan level (which surely does exist but does not 
tell us very much), we ask about the possibility of an isomorphism between 
brains on the symbol level: a correspondence which not only maps symbols 
in one brain onto symbols in another brain, but also maps triggering 
patterns onto triggering patterns. This means that corresponding symbols 
in the two brains are linked in corresponding ways. This would be a true 
functional isomorphism-the same type of isomorphism as we spoke of 
when trying to characterize what it is that is invariant about all butterflies. 
It is clear from the outset that such an isomorphism does not exist 
between any pair of human beings. If it did, they would be completely 
indistinguishable in their thoughts; but in order for that to be true, they 
would have to have completely indistinguishable memories, which would 
mean they would have to have led one and the same life. Even identical 
twins do not approach, in the remotest degree, this ideal. 
How about a single individual? When you look back over things which 
you yourself wrote a few years ago, you think "How awful!" and smile with 
amusement at the person you once were. What is worse is when you do the 
same thing with something you wrote or said five minutes ago. When this 
happens, it shows that you do not fully understand the person you were 
moments ago. The isomorphism from your brain now to your brain then 
is imperfect. What, then, of the isomorphisms to other people, other 
species ... ? 
The opposite side of the coin is shown by the power of the communica-
tion that arises between the unlikeliest partners. Think of the barriers 
spanned when you read lines of poetry penned in jail by Fran~ois Villon, 
the French poet of the 1400's. Another human being, in another era, 
captive in jail, speaking another language ... How can you ever hope to 
have a sense of the connotations behind the facade of his words, translated 
into English? Yet a wealth of meaning comes through. 
Thus, on the one hand, we can drop all hopes of finding exactly 
isomorphic software in humans, but on the other, it is clear that some 
people think more alike than others do. It would seem an obvious conclu-

sion that there is some sort of partial software isomorphism connecting the 
brains of people whose style of thinking is similar-in particular, a corre-
spondence of (1) the repertoire of symbols, and (2) the triggering patterns 
of symbols. 
Comparing Different Semantic Networks 
But what is a partial isomorphism? This is a most difficult question to 
answer. It is made even more difficult by the fact that no one has found an 
adequate way to represent the network of symbols and their triggering 
patterns. Sometimes a picture of a small part of such a network of symbols 
is drawn, where each symbol is represented as a node into which, and out of 
which, lead some arcs. The lines represent triggering relationships-in 
some sense. Such figures attempt to capture something of the intuitively 
sensible notion of "conceptual nearness". However, there are many differ-
ent kinds of nearness, and different ones are relevant in different contexts. 
A tiny portion of my own "semantic network" is shown in Figure 70. The 
problem is that representing a complex interdependency of many symbols 
cannot be carried out very easily with just a few lines joining vertices. 
Another problem with such a diagram is that it is not accurate to think 
of a symbol as simply "on" or "off". While this is true of neurons, it does 
not carry upwards, to collections of them. In this respect, symbols are quite 
a bit more complicated than neurons-as you might expect, since they are 
made up of many neurons. The messages that are exchanged between 
symbols are more complex than the mere fact, "I am now activated". That 
is more like the neuron-level messages. Each symbol can be activated in 
many different ways, and the type of activation will be influential in deter-
mining which other symbols it tries to activate. How these intertwining 
triggering relationships can be represented in a pictorial manner-indeed, 
whether they can be at all-is not clear. 
But for the moment, suppose that issue had been solved. Suppose we 
now agree that there are certain drawings of nodes, connected by links (let 
us say they come in various colors, so that various types of conceptual 
nearness can be distinguished from each other), which capture precisely 
the way in which symbols trigger other symbols. Then under what condi-
tions would we fee! that two such drawings were isomorphic, or nearly 
isomorphic? Since we are dealing with a visual representation of the net-
work of symbols, let us consider an analogous visual problem. How would 
you try to determine whether two spiderwebs had been spun by spiders 
belonging to the same species? Would you try to identify individual vertices 
which correspond exactly, thereby setting up an exact map of one web onto 
the other, vertex by vertex, fiber by fiber, perhaps even angle by angle? 
This would be a futile effort. Two webs are never exactly the same; yet 
there is still some sort of "style", "form", what-have-you, that infallibly 
brands a given species' web. 
In any network-like structure, such as a spiderweb, one can look at 
local properties and global properties. Local properties require only a very 
Minds and Thoughts 
371 

nearsighted observer-for example an observer who can only see one 
vertex at a time; and global properties require only a sweeping vision, 
without attention to detail. Thus, the overall shape of a spiderweb is a 
global property, whereas the average number of lines meeting at a vertex is 
a local property. Suppose we agree that the most reasonable criterion for 
calling two spiderwebs "isomorphic" is that they should have been spun by 
spiders of the same species. Then it is interesting to ask which kind of 
observation-local or global-tends to be a more reliable guide in deter-
mining whether two spiderwebs are isomorphic. Without answering the 
question for spiderwebs, let us now return to the question of the 
closeness-or isomorphic ness, if you will--of two symbol networks. 
Translations of "Jabberwocky" 
Imagine native speakers of English, French, and German, all of whom have 
excellent command of their respective native languages, and all of whom 
enjoy wordplay in their own language. Would their symbol networks be 
similar on a local level, or on a global level? Or is it meaningful to ask such a 
question? The question becomes concrete when you look at the preceding 
translations of Lewis Carroll's famous "Jabberwocky". 
I chose this example because it demonstrates, perhaps better than an 
example in ordinary prose, the problem of trying to find "the same node" 
in two different networks which are, on some level of analysis, extremely 
nonisomorphic. In ordinary language, the task of translation is more 
straightforward, since to each word or phrase in the original language, 
there can usually be found a corresponding word or phrase in the new 
language. By contrast, in a poem of this type, many "words" do not carry 
ordinary meaning, but act purely as exciters of nearby symbols. However, 
what is nearby in one language may be remote in another. 
Thus, in the brain of a native speaker of English, "slithy" probably 
activates such symbols as "slimy", "slither", "slippery", "lithe", and "sly", to 
varying extents. Does "lubricilleux" do the corresponding thing in the 
brain of a Frenchman? What indeed would be "the corresponding thing"? 
Would it be to activate symbols which are the ordinary translations of those 
words? What if there is no word, real or fabricated, which will accomplish 
that? Or what if a word does exist, but is very intellectual-sounding and 
Latinate ("lubricilleux"), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ("slithy")? 
Perhaps "huilasse" would be better than "lubricilleux"? Or does the Latin 
origin of the word "lubricilleux" not make itself felt to a speaker of French 
in the way that it would if it were an English word ("lubricilious", perhaps)? 
An interesting feature of the translation into French is the transposi-
tion into the present tense. To keep it in the past would make some 
unnatural turns of phrase necessary, and the present tense has a much 
fresher flavor in French than the past. The translator sensed that this 
would be "more appropriate"-in some ill-defined yet compelling sense-
and made the switch. Who can say whether remaining faithful to the 
English tense would have been better? 
372 
Minds and Thoughts 

In the German version, the droll phrase "er an-zu-denken-fing" oc-
curs; it does not correspond to any English original. It is a playful reversal 
of words, whose flavor vaguely resembles that of the English phrase "he 
out-to-ponder set", if I may hazard a reverse translation. Most likely this 
funny turnabout of words was inspired by the similar playful reversal in the 
English of one line earlier: "So rested he by the Tumtum tree". It corre-
sponds, yet doesn't correspond. 
Incidentally, why did the Tumtum tree get changed into an "arbre 
Te-te" in French? Figure it out for yourself. 
The word "manxome" in the original, whose "x" imbues it with many 
rich overtones, is weakly rendered in German by "manchsam", which 
back-translates into English as "maniful". The French "manscant" also lacks 
the manifold overtones of "manxome". There is no end to the interest of 
this kind of translation task. 
When confronted with such an example, one realizes that it is utterly 
impossible to make an exact translation. Yet even in this pathologically 
difficult case of translation, there seems to be some rough equivalence 
obtainable. Why is this so, if there really is no isomorphism between the 
brains of people who will read the different versions? The answer is that 
there is a kind of rough isomorphism, partly global, partly local, between 
the brains of all the readers of these three poems. 
ASU's 
An amusing geographical fantasy will give some intuition for this kind of 
quasi-isomorphism. (Incidentally, this fantasy is somewhat similar to a 
geographical analogy devised by M. Minsky in his article on "frames", 
which can be found in P. H. Winston's book The Psychology of Computer 
Vision.) Imagine that you are given a strange atlas of the USA, with all 
natural geological features premarked-such as rivers, mountains, lakes, 
and so on-but with nary a printed word. Rivers are shown as blue lines, 
mountains by color, and so on. Now you are told to convert it into a road 
atlas for a trip which you will soon make. You must neatly fill in the names 
of all states, their boundaries, time zones, then all counties, cities, towns, all 
freeways and highways and toll routes, all county roads, all state and 
national parks, campgrounds, scenic areas, dams, airports, and so on ... 
All of this must be carried out down to the level that would appear in a 
detailed road atlas. And it must be manufactured out of your own head. 
You are not allowed access to any information which would help you for 
the duration of your task. 
You are told that it will payoff, in ways that will become clear at a later 
date, to make your map as true as you can. Of course, you will begin by 
filling in large cities and major roads, etc., which you know. And when you 
have exhausted your factual knowledge of an area, it will be to your 
advantage to use your imagination to help you reproduce at least the flavor 
of that area, if not its true geography, by making up fake town names, fake 
populations, fake roads, fake parks, and so on. This arduous task will take 
Minds and Thoughts 
373 

months. To make things a little easier, you have a cartographer on hand to 
print everything in neatly. The end product will be your personal map of 
the "Alternative Structure of the Union"-your own personal "ASU". 
Your personal ASU will be very much like the USA in the area where 
you grew up. Furthermore, wherever your travels have chanced to lead 
you, or wherever you have perused maps with interest, your ASU will have 
spots of striking agreement with the USA: a few small towns in North 
Dakota or Montana, perhaps, or the whole of metropolitan New York, 
might be quite faithfully reproduced in your ASU. 
A Surprise Reversal 
When your ASU is done, a surprise takes place. Magically, the country you 
have designed comes into being, and you are transported there. A friendly 
committee presents you with your favorite kind of automobile, and ex-
plains that, "As a reward for your designing efforts, you may now enjoy an 
all-expense-paid trip, at a leisurely pace, around the good old A. S. of U. 
You may go wherever you want, do whatever you wish to do, taking as long 
as you wish-compliments of the Geographical Society of the ASU. 
And-to guide you around-here is a road atlas." To your surprise, you 
are given not the atlas which you de:;igned, but a regular road atlas of the 
USA. 
When you embark on your trip, all sorts of curious incidents will take 
place. A road atlas is being used to guide you through a country which it 
only partially fits. As long as you stick to major freeways, you will probably 
be able to cross the country without gross confusions. But the moment you 
wander off into the byways of New Mexico or rural Arkansas, there will be 
adventure in store for you. The locals will not recognize any of the towns 
you're looking for, nor will they know the roads you're asking about. They 
will only know the large cities you name, and even then the routes to those 
cities will not be the same as are indicated on your map. It will happen 
occasionally that some of the cities which are considered huge by the locals 
are nonexistent on your map of the USA; or perhaps they exist, but their 
population according to the atlas is wrong by an order of magnitude. 
Centrality and Universality 
What makes an ASU and the USA, which are so different in some ways, 
nevertheless so similar? It is that their most important cities and routes of 
communication can be mapped onto each other. The differences between 
them are found in the less frequently traveled routes, the cities of smaller 
size, and so on. Notice that this cannot be characterized either as a local or a 
global isomorphism. Some correspondences do extend down to the very 
local level-for instance, in both New Yorks, the main street may be Fifth 
Avenue, and there may be a Times Square in both as well-yet there may 
not be a single town that is found in both Montanas. So the local-global 
374 
Minds and Thoughts 

distinction is not relevant here. What is relevant is the centrality of the city, 
in terms of economics, communication, transportation, etc. The more vital 
the city is, in one of these ways, the more certain it will be to occur in both 
the ASU and the USA. 
In this geographic analogy, one aspect is very crucial: that there are 
certain definite, absolute points of reference which will occur in nearly all 
ASU's: New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and so on. From these it is then 
possible to orient oneself. In other words, if we begin comparing my ASU 
with yours, I can use the known agreement on big cities to establish points 
of reference with which I can communicate the location of smaller cities in 
my ASU. And if I hypothesize a voyage from Kankakee to Fruto and you 
don't know where those towns are, I can refer to something we have in 
common, and thereby guide you. And if I talk about a voyage from Atlanta 
to Milwaukee, it may go along different freeways or smaller roads, but the 
voyage itself can still be carried out in both countries. And if you start 
describing a trip from Horsemilk to janzo, I can plot out what seems to me 
to be an analogous trip in my ASU, despite not having towns by those 
names, as long as you constantly keep me oriented by describing your 
position with respect to nearby larger towns which are found in my ASU as 
well as in yours. 
My roads will not be exactly the same as yours, but, with our separate 
maps, we can each get from a particular part of the country to another. We 
can do this, thanks to the external, predetermined geological facts-
mountain chains, streams, etc.-facts which were available to us both 
as we worked on our maps. Without those external features, we would 
have no possibility of reference points in common. For instance, if you had 
been given only a map of France, and I had been given a map of Germany, 
and then we had both filled them in in great detail, there would be no way 
to try to find "the same place" in our fictitious lands. It is necessary to begin 
with identical external conditions---otherwise nothing will match. 
Now that we have carried our geographical analogy quite far, we 
return to the question of isomorphisms between brains. You might well 
wonder why this whole question of brain isomorphisms has been stressed so 
much. What does it matter if two brains are isomorphic, or quasi-isomor-
phic, or not isomorphic at all? The answer is that we have an intuitive sense 
that, although other people differ from us in important ways, they are still 
"the same" as we are in some deep and important ways. It would be 
instructive to be able to pinpoint what this invariant core of human intelli-
gence is, and then to be able to describe the kinds of "embellishments" 
which can be added to it, making each one of us a unique embodiment of 
this abstract and mysterious quality called "intelligence". 
In our geographic analogy, cities and towns were the analogues of 
symbols, while roads and highways were analogous to potential triggering 
paths. The fact that all ASU's have some things in common, such as the East 
Coast, the West Coast, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, the Rockies, 
and many major cities and roads is analogous to the fact that we are all 
forced, by external realities, to construct certain class symbols and trigger-
Minds and Thoughts 
375 

ing paths in the same way. These core symbols are like the large cities, to 
which everyone can make reference without ambiguity. (Incidentally, the 
fact that cities are localized entities should in no way be taken as indicative 
that symbols in a brain are small, almost point-like entities. They are merely 
symbolized in that manner in a network.) 
The fact is that a large proportion of every human's network of 
symbols is universal. We simply take what is common to all of us so much for 
granted that it is hard to see how much we have in common with other 
people. It takes the conscious effort of imagining how much-or how 
little-we have in common with other types of entities, such as stones, cars, 
restaurants, ants, and so forth, to make evident the large amount of overlap 
that we have with randomly chosen people. What we notice about another 
person immediately is not the standard overlap, because that is taken for 
granted as soon as we recognize the humanity of the other person; rather, 
we look beyond the standard overlap and generally find some major differ-
ences, as well as some unexpected, additional overlap. 
Occasionally, you find that another person is missing some of what you 
thought was the standard, minimal core-as if Chicago were missing from 
their ASU, which is almost unimaginable. For instance, someone might not 
know what an elephant is, or who is President, or that the earth is round. In 
such cases, their symbolic network is likely to be so fundamentally different 
from your own that significant communication will be difficult. On the 
other hand, perhaps this same person will share some specialized kind of 
knowledge with you-such as expertise in the game of dominoes-so that 
you can communicate well in a limited domain. This would be like meeting 
someone who comes from the very same rural area of North Dakota as you 
do, so that your two ASU's coincide iII great detail over a very small region, 
which allows you to describe how to get from one place to another very 
fluently. 
How Much Do language and Culture Channel Thought? 
If we now go back to comparing our own symbol network with those of a 
Frenchman and a German, we can say that we expect them to have the 
standard core of class symbols, despite the fact of different native lan-
guages. We do not expect to share highly specialized networks with them, 
but we do not expect such sharing with a randomly chosen person who 
shares our native language, either. The triggering patterns of people with 
other languages will be somewhat different from our own, but still the 
major class symbols, and the major routes between them, will be universally 
available, so that more minor routes can be described with reference to 
them. 
Now each of our three people may in addition have some command of 
the languages of the other two. What is it that marks the difference 
between true fluency, and a mere ability to communicate? First of all, 
someone fluent in English uses most words at roughly their regular fre-
quencies. A non-native speaker will have picked up some words from 
376 
Minds and Thoughts 

dictionaries, novels, or classes-words which at some time may have been 
prevalent or preferable, but which are now far down in frequency-for 
example, "fetch" instead of "get", "quite" instead of "very", etc. Though the 
meaning usually comes through, there is an alien quality transmitted by the 
unusual choice of words. 
But suppose that a foreigner learns to use all words at roughly the 
normal frequencies. Will that make his speech truly fluent? Probably not. 
Higher than the word level, there is an association level, which is attached 
to the culture as a whole-its history, geography, religion, children's 
stories, literature, technological level, and so on. For instance, to be able to 
speak modern Hebrew absolutely fluently, you need to know the Bible 
quite well in Hebrew, because the language draws on a stock of biblical 
phrases and their connotations. Such an association level permeates each 
language very deeply. Yet there is room for all sorts of variety inside 
fluency-otherwise the only truly fluent speakers would be people whose 
thoughts were the most stereotyped possible! 
Although we should recognize the depth to which culture affects 
thought, we should not overstress the role of language in molding thoughts. 
For instance, what we might call two "chairs" might be perceived by a 
speaker of French as objects belonging to two distinct types: "chaise" and 
"fauteuil" ("chair" and "armchair"). People whose native language is 
French are more aware of that difference than we are-but then people 
who grow up in a rural area are more aware of, say, the difference between 
a pickup and a truck, than a city dweller is. A city dweller may call them 
both "trucks". It is not the difference in native language, but the difference 
in culture (or subculture), that gives rise to this perceptual difference. 
The relationships between the symbols of people with different native 
languages have every reason to be quite similar, as far as the core is 
concerned, because everyone lives in the same world. When you come 
down to more detailed aspects of the triggering patterns, you will find that 
there is less in common. It would be like comparing rural areas in Wiscon-
sin in ASU's which had been made up by people who had never lived in 
Wisconsin. This will be quite irrelevant, however, as long as there is 
sufficient agreement on the major cities and major routes, so that there are 
common points of reference all over the map. 
Trips and Itineraries in ASU's 
Without making it explicit, I have been using an image of what a "thought" 
is in the ASU-analogy-namely, I have been implying that a thought corre-
sponds to a trip. The towns which are passed through represent the symbols 
which are excited. This is not a perfect analogy, but it is quite strong. One 
problem with it is that when a thought recurs in someone's mind 
sufficiently often, it can get chunked into a single concept. This would 
correspond to quite a strange event in an ASU: a commonly taken trip 
would become, in some strange fashion, a new town or city! If one is to 
continue to use the ASU-metaphor, then, it is important to remember that 
Minds and Thoughts 
377 

the CltIes represent not only the elementary symbols, such as those for 
"grass", "house", and "car", but also symbols which get created as a result of 
the chunking ability of a brain-symbols for such sophisticated concepts as 
"crab canon", "palindrome", or "ASU". 
Now if it is granted that the notion of taking a trip is a fair counterpart 
to the notion of having a thought, then the following difficult issue comes 
up: virtually any route leading from one city to a second, then to a third, 
and so on, can be imagined, as long as one remembers that some interven-
ing cities are also passed through. This would correspond to the activation 
of an arbitrary sequence of symbols, one after another, making allowance for 
some extra symbols-those which lie en route. Now if virtually any se-
quence of symbols can be activated in any desired order, it may seem that a 
brain is an indiscriminate system, which can absorb or produce any thought 
whatsoever. But we all know that that is not so. In fact, there are certain 
kinds of thoughts which we call knowledge, or beliefs, which play quite a 
different role from random fancies, or humorously entertained absur-
dities. How can we characterize the difference between dreams, passing 
thoughts, beliefs, and pieces of knowledge? 
Possible, Potential, and Preposterous Pathways 
There are some pathways-you can think of them as pathways either in an 
ASU or in a brain-which are taken routinely in going from one place to 
another. There are other pathways which can only be followed if one is led 
through them by the hand. These pathways are "potential pathways", 
which would be followed only if special external circumstances arose. The 
pathways which one relies on over and over again are pathways which 
incorporate knowledge-and here I mean not only knowledge of facts 
(declarative knowledge), but also knowledge of how-to's (procedural knowl-
edge). These stable, reliable pathways are what constitute knowledge. 
Pieces of knowledge merge gradually with beliefs, which are also rep-
resented by reliable pathways, but perhaps ones which are more susceptible 
to replacement if, so to speak, a bridge goes out, or there is heavy fog. This 
leaves us with fancies, lies, falsities, absurdities, and other variants. These 
would correspond to peculiar routes such as: New York City to Newark via 
Bangor, Maine and Lubbock, Texas. They are indeed possible pathways, 
but ones which are not likely to be stock routes, used in everyday voyages. 
A curious, and amusing, implication of this model is that all of the 
"aberrant" kinds of thoughts listed above are composed, at rock bottom, 
completely out of beliefs or pieces of knowledge. That is, any weird and 
snaky indirect route breaks up into a number of non-weird, non-snaky 
direct stretches, and these short, straightforward symbol-connecting routes 
represent simple thoughts that one can rely on-beliefs and pieces of 
knowledge. On reflection, this is hardly surprising, however, since it is quite 
reasonable that we should only be able to imagine fictitious things that are 
somehow grounded in the realities we have experienced, no matter how 
378 
Minds and Thoughts 

wildly they deviate from them. Dreams are perhaps just such random 
meanderings about the ASU's of our minds. Locally, they make sense-but 
globally ... 
Different Styles of Translating Novels 
A poem like "Jabberwocky" is like an unreal journey around an ASU, 
hopping from one state to another very quickly, following very curious 
routes. The translations convey this aspect of the poem, rather than the 
precise sequence of symbols which are triggered, although they do their 
best in that respect. In ordinary prose, such leaps and bounds are not so 
common. However, similar problems of translation do occur. Suppose you 
are translating a novel from Russian to English, and come across a sentence 
whose literal translation is, "She had a bowl of borscht." Now perhaps many 
of your readers will have no idea what borscht is. You could attempt to 
replace it by the "corresponding" item in their culture-thus, your transla-
tion might run, "She had a bowl of Campbell's soup." Now if you think this 
is a silly exaggeration, take a look at the first sentence of Dostoevsky's novel 
Crime and Punishment in Russian and then in a few different English transla-
tions. I happened to look at three different English paperback translations, 
and found the following curious situation. 
The first sentence employs the street name "S. Pereulok" (as transliter-
ated). What is the meaning of this? A careful reader of Dostoevsky's work 
who knows Leningrad (which used to be called "St. Petersburg"--or should 
I say "Petrograd"?) can discover by doing some careful checking of the rest 
of the geography in the book (which incidentally is also given only by its 
initials) that the street must be "Stoliarny Pereulok". Dostoevsky probably 
wished to tell his story in a realistic way, yet not so realistically that people 
would take literally the addresses at which crimes and other events were 
supposed to have occurred. In any case, we have a translation problem; or 
to be more precise, we have several translation problems, on several differ-
ent levels. 
First of all, should we keep the initial so as to reproduce the aura of 
semi-mystery which appears already in this first sentence of the book? We 
would get "S. Lane" ("lane" being the standard translation of "pereulok"). 
None of the three translators took this tack. However, one chose to write 
"S. Place". The translation of Crime and Punishment which I read in high 
school took a similar option. I will never forget the disoriented feeling I 
experienced when I began reading the novel and encountered those streets 
with only letters for names. I had some sort of intangible malaise about the 
beginning of the book; I was sure that I was missing something essential, 
and yet I didn't know what it was ... I decided that all Russian novels were 
very weird. 
Now we could be frank with the reader (who, it may be assumed, 
probably won't have the slightest idea whether the street is real or fictitious 
anyway!) and give him the advantage of our modern scholarship, writing 
Minds and Thoughts 
379 

"Stoliarny Lane" (or "Place"). This was the choice of translator number 2, 
who gave the translation as "Stoliarny Place". 
What about number 3? This is the most interesting of all. This transla-
tion says "Carpenter's Lane". And why not, indeed? After all, "stoliar" 
means "carpenter" and "ny" is an adjectival ending. So now we might 
imagine ourselves in London, not Petrograd, and in the midst of a situation 
invented by Dickens, not Dostoevsky. Is that what we want? Perhaps we 
should just read a novel by Dickens instead, with the justification that it is 
"the corresponding work in English". When viewed on a sufficiently high 
level, it is a "translation" of the Dostoevsky novel-in fact, the best possible 
one! Who needs Dostoevsky? 
We have come all the way from attempts at great literal fidelity to the 
author's style, to high-level translations of flavor. Now if this happens 
already in the first sentence, can you imagine how it must go on in the rest 
of the book? What about the point where a German landlady begins 
shouting in her German-style Russian? How do you translate broken Rus-
sian spoken with a German accent, into English? 
Then one may also consider the problems of how to translate slang and 
colloquial modes of expression. Should one search for an "analogous" 
phrase, or should one settle for a word-by-word translation? If you search 
for an analogous phrase, then you run the risk of committing a "Campbell's 
soup" type of blunder; but if you translate every idiomatic phrase word by 
word, then the English will sound alien. Perhaps this is desirable, since the 
Russian culture is an alien one to s.peakers of English. But a speaker of 
English who reads such a translation will constantly be experiencing, 
thanks to the unusual turns of phrase, a sense-an artificial sense-of 
strangeness, which was not intended by the author, and which is not 
experienced by readers of the Russian original. 
Problems such as these give one pause in considering such statements 
as this one, made by Warren Weaver, one of the first advocates of transla-
tion by computer, in the late 1940's: "When I look at an article in Russian, I 
say, 'This is really written in English, hut it has been coded in some strange 
symbols. I will now proceed to decode.' "1 Weaver's remark simply cannot 
be taken literally; it must rather be considered a provocative way of saying 
that there is an objectively describable meaning hidden in the symbols, or at 
least something pretty close to objective; therefore, there would be no 
reason to suppose a computer could not ferret it out, if sufficiently well 
programmed. 
High-Level Comparisons between Programs 
Weaver's statement is about translations between different natural lan-
guages. Let's consider now the problem of translating between two com-
puter languages. For instance, suppose two people have written programs 
which run on different computers, and we want to know if the two pro-
grams carry out the same task. How can we find out? We must compare the 
programs. But on what level should this be done? Perhaps one program-
380 
Minds and Thoughts 

mer wrote in a machine language, the other in a compiler language. Are 
two such programs comparable? Certainly. But how to compare them? One 
way might be to compile the compiler language program, producing a 
program in the machine language of its home computer. 
Now we have two machine language programs. But there is another 
problem: there are two computers, hence two different machine 
languages-and they may be extremely different. One machine may have 
sixteen-bit words; the other thirty-six-bit words. One machine may have 
built-in stack-handling instructions (pushing and popping), while the other 
lacks them. The differences between the hardware of the two machines 
may make the two machine language programs seem incomparable-and 
yet we suspect they are performing the same task, and we would like to see 
that at a glance. We are obviously looking at the programs from much too 
close a distance. 
What we need to do is to step back, away from machine language, 
towards a higher, more chunked view. From this vantage point, we hope we 
will be able to perceive chunks of program which make each program seem 
rationally planned out on a global, rather than a local, scale-that is, chunks 
which fit together in a way that allows one to perceive the goals of the 
programmer. Let us assume that both programs were originally written in 
high-level languages. Then some chunking has already been done for us. 
But we will run into other troubles. There is a proliferation of such 
languages: Fortran, Algol, LISP, APL, and many others. How can you 
compare a program written in APL with one written in Algol? Certainly not 
by matching them up line by line. You will again chunk these programs in 
your mind, looking for conceptual, functional units which correspond. 
Thus, you are not comparing hardware, you are not comparing 
software-you are comparing "etherware"-the pure concepts which lie 
back of the software. There is some sort of abstract "conceptual skeleton" 
which must be lifted out of low levels before you can carry out a meaningful 
comparison of two programs in different computer languges, of two ani-
mals, or of two sentences in different natural languages. 
Now this brings us back to an earlier question which we asked about 
computers and brains: How can we make sense of a low-level description of 
a computer or a brain? Is there, in any reasonable sense, an objective way to 
pull a high-level description out of a low-level one, in such complicated 
systems? In the case of a computer, a full display of the contents of 
memory-a so-called memory dump-is easily available. Dumps were com-
monly printed out in the early days of computing, when something went 
wrong with a program. Then the programmer would have to go home and 
pore over the memory dump for hours, trying to understand what each 
minuscule piece of memory represented. In essence, the programmer 
would be doing the opposite of what a compiler does: he would be translat-
ing from machine language into a higher-level language, a conceptual 
language. In the end, the programmer would understand the goals of the 
program and could describe it in high-level terms-for example, "This 
program translates novels from Russian to English", or "This program 
composes an eight-voice fugue based on any theme which is fed in". 
Minds and Thoughts 
381 

High-Level Comparisons between Brains 
Now our question must be investigated in the case of brains. In this case, we 
are asking, "Are people's brains also capable of being 'read', on a high 
level? Is there some objective description of the content of a brain?" In the 
Ant Fugue, the Anteater claimed to be able to tell what Aunt Hillary was 
thinking about, by looking at the scurryings of her component ants. Could 
some superbeing-a Neuroneater, perhaps-conceivably look down on our 
neurons, chunk what it sees, and come up with an analysis of our thoughts? 
Certainly the answer must be yes, since we are all quite able to describe, 
in chunked (i.e., non-neural) terms, the activity of our minds at any given 
time. This means that we have a mechanism which allows us to chunk our 
own brain state to some rough degree, and to give a functional description 
of it. To be more precise, we do not chunk all of the brain state-we only 
chunk those portions of it which are active. However, if someone asks us 
about a subject which is coded in a currently inactive area of our brain, we 
can almost instantly gain access to the appropriate dormant area and come 
up with a chunked description of it-that is, some belief on that subject. 
Note that we come back with absolutely zero information on the neural 
level of that part of the brain: our description is so chunked that we don't 
even have any idea what part of our brain it is a description of. This can be 
contrasted with the programmer whose chunked description comes from 
conscious analysis of every part of the memory dump. 
Now if a person can provide a chunked description of any part of his 
own brain, why shouldn't an outsider too, given some nondestructive 
means of access to the same brain, not only be able to chunk limited 
portions of the brain, but actually to give a complete chunked description 
of it-in other words, a complete documentation of the beliefs of the 
person whose brain is accessible? It is obvious that such a description would 
have an astronomical size, but that is not of concern here. We are interested 
in the question of whether, in principle, there exists a well-defined, high-
level description of a brain, or whether, conversely, the neuron-level 
description-or something equally physiological and intuitively 
unenlightening-is the best description that in principle exists. Surely, to 
answer this question would be of the highest importance if we seek to know 
whether we can ever understand ourselves. 
Potential Beliefs, Potential Symbols 
It is my contention that a chunked description is possible, but when we get 
it, all will not suddenly be clear and light. The problem is that in order to 
pull a chunked description out of the brain state, we need a language to 
describe our findings. Now the most appropriate way to describe a brain, it 
would seem, would be to enumerate the kinds of thoughts it could enter-
tain, and the kinds of thoughts it could not entertain-or, perhaps, to 
enumerate its beliefs and the things which it does not believe. If that is the 
382 
Minds and Thoughts 

kind of goal we will be striving for in a chunked description, then it is easy 
to see what kinds of troubles we will run up against. 
Suppose you wanted to enumerate all possible voyages that could be 
taken in an ASU; there are infinitely many. How do you determine which 
ones are plausible, though? Well, what does'''plausible'' mean? We will have 
precisely this kind of difficulty in trying to establish what a "possible 
pathway" from symbol to symbol in a brain is. We can imagine an upside-
down dog flying through the air with a cigar in its mouth-or a collision 
between two giant fried eggs on a freeway-or any number of other 
ridiculous images. The number of far-fetched pathways which can be 
followed in our brains is without bound, just as is the number of insane 
itineraries that could be planned on an ASU. But just what constitutes a 
"sane" itinerary, given an ASU? And just what constitutes a "reasonable" 
thought, given a brain state? The brain state itself does not forbid any 
pathway, because for any pathway there are always circumstances which 
could force the following of that pathway. The physical status of a brain, if 
read correctly, gives information telling not which pathways could be 
followed, but rather how much resistance would be offered along the way. 
Now in an ASU, there are many trips which could be taken along tWo 
or more reasonable alternative routes. For example, the trip from San 
Francisco to New York could go along either a northern route or a south-
ern route. Each of them is quite reasonable, but people tend to take them 
under different circumstances. Looking at a map at a given moment in time 
does not tell you anything about which route will be preferable at some 
remote time in the future-that depends on the external circumstances 
under which the trip is to be taken. Likewise, the "reading" of a brain state 
will reveal that several reasonable alternative pathways are often available, 
connecting a given set of symbols. However, the trip among these symbols 
need not be imminent; it may be simply one of billions of "potential" trips, 
all of which figure in the readout of the brain state. From this follows an 
important conclusion: there is no information in the brain state itself which 
tells which route will be chosen. The external circumstances will playa 
large determining role in choosing the route. 
What does this imply? It implies that thoughts which clash totally may 
be produced by a single brain, depending on the circumstances. And any 
high-level readout of the brain state which is worth its salt must contain all 
such conflicting versions. Actually this is quite obvious-that we all are 
bundles of contradictions, and we manage to hang together by bringing out 
only one side of ourselves at a given time. The selection cannot be pre-
dicted in advance, because the conditions which will force the selection are 
not known in advance. What the brain state can provide, if properly read, is 
a conditional description of the selection of routes. 
Consider, for instance, the Crab's plight, described in the Prelude. He 
can react in various ways to the playing of a piece of music. Sometimes he 
will be nearly immune to it, because he knows it so well. Other times, he will 
be quite excited by it, but this reaction requires the right kind of triggering 
from the outside-for instance, the presence of an enthusiastic listener, to 
Minds and Thoughts 
383 

whom the work is new. Presumably, a high-level reading of the Crab's brain 
state would reveal the potential thrill (and conditions which would induce 
it), as well as the potential numbness (and conditions which would induce 
it). The brain state itself would not tell which one would occur on the next 
hearing of the piece, however; it could only say, "If such-&-such conditions 
obtain, then a thrill will result; otherwise ... " 
Thus a chunked description of a brain state would give a catalogue of 
beliefs which would be evoked conditionally, dependent on circumstances. 
Since not all possible circumstances can be enumerated, one would have to 
settle for those which one thinks are "reasonable". Furthermore, one would 
have to settle for a chunked description of the circumstances themselves, 
since they obviously cannot-and should not-be specified down to the 
atomic level! Therefore, one will not be able to make an exact, deterministic 
prediction saying which beliefs will be pulled out of the brain state by a 
given chunked circumstance. In summary, then, a chunked description of a 
brain state will consist of a probabili~tic catalogue, in which are listed those 
beliefs which are most likely to be induced (and those symbols which are 
most likely to be activated) by various sets of "reasonably likely" cir-
cumstances, themselves described on a chunked level. Trying to chunk 
someone's beliefs without referring to context is precisely as silly as trying 
to describe the range of a single person's "potential progeny" without 
referring to the mate. 
The same sorts of problems arise in enumerating all the symbols in a 
given person's brain. There are potentially not only an infinite number of 
pathways in a brain, but also an infinite number of symbols. As was pointed 
out, new concepts can always be formed from old ones, and one could 
argue that the symbols which represent such new concepts are merely 
dormant symbols in each individual, waiting to be awakened. They may 
never get awakened in the person's lifetime, but it could be claimed that 
those symbols are nonetheless always there, just waiting for the right 
circumstances to trigger their synthesis. However, if the probability is very 
low, it would seem that "dormant" would be a very unrealistic term to apply 
in the situation. To make this clear, try to imagine all the "dormant 
dreams" which are sitting there inside your skull while you're awake. Is it 
conceivable that there exists a decision procedure which could tell "poten-
tially dreamable themes" from "undreamable themes", given your brain 
state? 
Where Is the Sense of Self? 
Looking back on what we have discussed, you might think to yourself, 
"These speculations about brain and mind are all well and good, but what 
about the feelings involved in consciousness? These symbols may trigger 
each other all they want, but unless someone perceives the whole thing, 
there's no consciousness." 
This makes sense to our intuition on some level, but it does not make 
much sense logically. For we would then be compelled to look for an 
384 
Minds and Thoughts 

explanation of the mechanism which does the perceiving of all the active 
symbols, if it is not covered by what we have described so far. Of course, a 
"soulist" would not have to look any further-he would merely assert that 
the perceiver of all this neural action is the soul, which cannot be described 
in physical terms, and that is that. However, we shall try to give a "non-
soulist" explanation of where consciousnes's arises. 
Our alternative to the soulist explanation-and a disconcerting one it 
is, too-is to stop at the symbol level and say, "This is it-this is what 
consciousness is. Consciousness is that property of a system that arises 
whenever there exist symbols in the system which obey triggering patterns 
somewhat like the ones described in the past several sections." Put so 
starkly, this may seem inadequate. How does it account for the sense of "I", 
the sense of self? 
Subsystems 
There is no reason to expect that "I", or "the self", should not be rep-
resented by a symbol. In fact, the symbol for the self is probably the most 
complex of all the symbols in the brain. For this reason, I choose to put it on 
a new level of the hierarchy and call it a subsystem, rather than a symbol. To 
be precise, by "subsystem", I mean a constellation of symbols, each of which 
can be separately activated under the control of the subsystem itself. The 
image I wish to convey of a subsystem is that it functions almost as an 
independent "subbrain", equipped with its own repertoire of symbols 
which can trigger each other internally. Of course, there is also much 
communication between the subsystem and the "outside" world-that is, 
the rest of the brain. "Subsystem" is just another name for an overgrown 
symbol, one which has gotten so complicated that it has many subsymbols 
which interact among themselves. Thus, there is no strict level distinction 
between symbols and subsystems. 
Because of the extensive links between a subsystem and the rest of the 
brain (some of which will be described shortly), it would be very difficult to 
draw a sharp boundary between the subsystem and the outside; but even if 
the border is fuzzy, the subsystem is quite a real thing. The interesting 
thing about a subsystem is that, once activated and left to its own devices, it 
can work on its own. Thus, two or more subsystems of the brain of an 
individual may operate simultaneously. I have noticed this happening on 
occasion in my own brain: sometimes I become aware that two different 
melodies are running through my mind, competing for "my" attention. 
Somehow, each melody is being manufactured, or "played", in a separate 
compartment of my brain. Each of the systems responsible for drawing a 
melody out of my brain is presumably activating a number of symbols, one 
after another, completely oblivious to the other system doing the same 
thing. Then they both attempt to communicate with a third subsystem of 
my brain-my self-symbol-and it is at that point that the "I" inside my 
brain gets wind of what's going on; in other words, it starts picking up a 
chunked description of the activities of those two subsystems. 
Minds and Thoughts 
385 

Subsystems and Shared Code 
Typical subsystems might be those that represent the people we know 
intimately. They are represented in such a complex way in our brains that 
their symbols enlarge to the rank of subsystem, becoming able to act 
autonomously, making use of some resources in our brains for support. By 
this, I mean that a subsystem symbolizing a friend can activate many of the 
symbols in my brain just as I can. For instance, I can fire up my subsystem 
for a good friend and virtually feel myself in his shoes, running through 
thoughts which he might have, activating symbols in sequences which 
reflect his thinking patterns more accurately than my own. It could be said 
that my model of this friend, as embodied in a subsystem of my brain, 
constitutes my own chunked description of his brain. 
Does this subsystem include, then, a symbol for every symbol which I 
think is in his brain? That would be redundant. Probably the subsystem 
makes extensive use of symbols already present in my brain. For instance, 
the symbol for "mountain" in my brain can be borrowed by the subsystem, 
when it is activated. The way in which that symbol is then used by the 
subsystem will not necessarily be identical to the way it is used by my full 
brain. In particular, if I am talking with my friend about the Tien Shan 
mountain range in Central Asia (neither of us having been there), and I 
know that a number of years ago he had a wonderful hiking experience in 
the Alps, then my interpretation of his remarks will be colored in part by 
my imported images of his earlier Alpine experience, since I will be trying 
to imagine how he visualizes the area. 
In the vocabulary we have been building up in this Chapter, we could 
say that the activation of the "mountain" symbol in me is under control of 
my subsystem representing him. The effect of this is to open up a different 
window onto to my memories from the one which I normally use-namely, 
my "default option" switches from the full range of my memories to the set 
of my memories of his memories. Needless to say, my representations of his 
memories are only approximations to his actual memories, which are com-
plex modes of activation of the symbols in his brain, inaccessible to me. 
My representations of his memories are also complex modes of activa-
tion of my own symbols-those for "primordial" concepts, such as grass, 
trees, snow, sky, clouds, and so on. These are concepts which I must assume 
are represented in him "identically" to the way they are in me. I must also 
assume a similar representation in him of even more primordial notions: 
the experiences of gravity, breathing, fatigue, color, and so forth. Less 
primordial but perhaps a nearly unhersal human quality is the enjoyment 
of reaching a summit and seeing a view. Therefore, the intricate processes 
in my brain which are responsible for this enjoyment can be taken over 
directly by the friend-subsystem without much loss of fidelity. 
We could go on to attempt to describe how I understand an entire tale 
told by my friend, a tale filled with many complexities of human relation-
ships and mental experiences. But our terminology would quickly become 
inadequate. There would be tricky recursions connected with representa-
·386 
Minds and Thoughts 

tions in him of representations in me of representations in him of one thing 
and another. If mutual friends figured in the tale being told, I would 
unconsciously look for compromises between my image of his representa-
tions of them, and my own images of them. Pure recursion would simply be 
an inappropriate formalism for dealing with symbol amalgams of this type. 
And I have barely scratched the surface! We plainly lack the vocabulary 
today for describing the complex interactions that are possible between 
symbols. So let us stop before we get bogged down. 
We should note, however, that computer systems are beginning to run 
into some of the same kinds of complexity, and therefore some of these 
notions have been given names. For instance, my "mountain" symbol is 
analogous to what in computer jargon is called shared (or reentrant) code-
code which can be used by two or more separate timesharing programs 
running on a single computer. The fact that activation of one symbol can 
have different results when it is part of different subsystems can be ex-
plained by saying that its code is being processed by different interpreters. 
Thus, the triggering patterns in the "mountain" symbol are not absolute; 
they are relative to the system within which the symbol is activated. 
The reality of such "subbrains" may seem doubtful to some. Perhaps 
the following quote from M. C. Escher, as he discusses how he creates his 
periodic plane-filling drawings, will help to make clear what kind of 
phenomenon I am referring to: 
While drawing I sometimes feel as if I were a spiritualist medium, controlled 
by the creatures which I am conjuring up. It is as if they themselves decide on 
the shape in which they choose to appear. They take little account of my 
critical opinion during their birth and I cannot exert much influence on the 
measure of their development. They are usually very difficult and obstinate 
creatures.2 
Here is a perfect example of the near-autonomy of certain subsystems of 
the brain, once they are activated. Escher's subsystems seemed to him 
almost to be able to override his esthetic judgment. Of course, this opinion 
must be taken with a grain of salt, since those powerful subsystems came 
into being as a result of his many years of training and submission to 
precisely the forces that molded his esthetic sensitivities. In short, it is 
wrong to divorce the subsystems in Escher's brain from Escher himself or 
from his esthetic judgement. They consititute a vital part of his esthetic 
sense, where "he" is the complete being of the artist. 
The Self-Symbol and Consciousness 
A very important side effect of the self-subsystem is that it can play the role 
of "soul", in the following sense: in communicating constantly with the rest 
of the subsystems and symbols in the brain, it keeps track of what symbols 
are active, and in what way. This means that it has to have symbols for 
mental activity-in other words, symbols for symbols, and symbols for the 
actions of symbols. 
Minds and Thoughts 
387 

Of course, this does not elevate consciousness or awareness to any 
"magical", nonphysical level. Awareness here is a direct effect of the com-
plex hardware and software we have described. Still, despite its earthly 
origin, this way of describing awareness-as the monitoring of brain activ-
ity by a subsystem of the brain itself-seems to resemble the nearly inde-
scribable sensation which we all know and call "consciousness". Certainly 
one can see that the complexity here is enough that many unexpected 
effects could be created. For instance, it is quite plausible that a computer 
program with this kind of structure would make statements about itself 
which would have a great deal of resemblance to statements which people 
commonly make about themselves. This includes insisting that it has free 
will, that it is not explicable as a "sum of its parts", and so on. (On this 
subject, see the article "Matter, Mind, and Models" by M. Minsky in his 
book Semantic Information Processing.) 
What kind of guarantee is there that a subsystem, such as I have here 
postulated, which represents the self, actually exists in our brains? Could a 
whole complex network of symbols such as has been described above evolve 
without a self-symbol evolving? How could these symbols and their ac-
tivities play out "isomorphic" mental events to real events in the surround-
ing universe, if there were no symbol for the host organism? All the stimuli 
coming into the system are centered on one small mass in space. It would be 
quite a glaring hole in a brain's symbolic structure not to have a symbol for 
the physical object in which it is housed, and which plays a larger role in the 
events it mirrors than any other object. In fact, upon reflection, it seems 
that the only way one could make sense of the world surrounding a 
localized animate object is to understand the role of that object in relation 
to the other objects around it. This necessitates the existence of a self-
symbol; and the step from symbol to subsystem is merely a reflection of the 
importance of the self-symbol, and is not a qualitative change. 
Our First Encounter with Lucas 
The Oxford philosopher J. R. Lucas (not connected with the Lucas num-
bers described earlier) wrote a remarkable article in 1961, entitled "Minds, 
Machines, and Godel". His views are quite opposite to mine, and yet he 
manages to mix many of the same ingredients together in coming up with 
his opinions. The following excerpt is quite relevant to what we have just 
been discussing: 
At one's first and simplest attempts to philosophize, one becomes entangled in 
questions of whether when one knows wmething one knows that one knows 
it, and what, when one is thinking of oneself, is being thought about, and what 
is doing the thinking. After one has been puzzled and bruised by this problem 
for a long time, one learns not to press these questions: the concept of a 
conscious being is, implicitly, realized to be different from that of an uncon-
scious object. In saying that a conscious being knows something, we are saying 
not only that he knows it, but that he knows that he knows it, and that he 
knows that he knows that he knows it, and so on, as long as we care to pose the 
388 
Minds and Thoughts 

question: there is, we recognize, an infinity here, but it is not an infinite 
regress in the bad sense, for it is the questions that peter out, as being 
pointless, rather than the answers. The questions are felt to be pointless 
because the concept contains within itself the idea of being able to go on 
answering such questions indefinitely. Although conscious beings have the 
power of going on, we do not wish to exhibit this simply as a succession of 
tasks they are able to perform, nor do we see the mind as an infinite sequence 
of selves and super-selves and super-super-selves. Rather, we insist that a 
conscious being is a unity, and though we talk about parts of the mind, we do 
so only as a metaphor, and will not allow it to be taken literally. 
The paradoxes of consciousness arise because a conscious being can be 
aware of itself, as well as of other things, and yet cannot really be construed as 
being divisible into parts. It means that a conscious being can deal with 
G6delian questions in a way in which a machine cannot, because a conscious 
being can both consider itself and its performance and yet not be other than 
that which did the performance. A machine can be made in a manner of 
speaking to "consider" its performance, but it cannot take this "into account" 
without thereby becoming a different machine, namely the old machine with 
a "new part" added. But it is inherent in our idea of a conscious mind that it 
can reflect upon itself and criticize its own performances, and no extra part is 
required to do this: it is already complete, and has no Achille's' heel. 
The thesis thus begins to become more of a matter of conceptual analysis 
than mathematical discovery. This is borne out by considering another argu-
ment put forward by Turing. So far, we have constructed only fairly simple 
and predictable artifacts. When we increase the complexity of our machines, 
there may, perhaps, be surprises in store for us. He draws a parallel with a 
fission pile. Below a certain "critical" size, nothing much happens: but above 
the critical size, the sparks begin to fly. So too, perhaps, with brains and 
machines. Most brains and all machines are, at present, "sub-critical"-they 
react to incoming stimuli in a stodgy and uninteresting way, have no ideas of 
their own, can produce only stock responses-but a few brains at present, and 
possibly some machines in the future, are super-critical, and scintillate on 
their own account. Turing is suggesting that it is only a matter of complexity, 
and that above a certain level of complexity a qualitative difference appears, 
so that "super-critical" machines will be quite unlike the simple ones hitherto 
envisaged. 
This may be so. Complexity often does introduce qualitative differences. 
Although it sounds implausible, it might turn out that above a certain level of 
complexity, a machine ceased to be predictable, even in principle, and started 
doing things on its own account, or, to use a very revealing phrase, it might 
begin to have a mind of its own. It might begin to have a mind of its own. It 
would begin to have a mind of its own when it was no longer entirely 
predictable and entirely docile, but was capable of doing things which we 
recognized as intelligent, and not just mistakes or random shots, but which we 
had not programmed into it. But then it would cease to be a machine, within 
the meaning of the act. What is at stake in the mechanist debate is not how 
minds are, or might be, brought into being, but how they operate. It is 
essential for the mechanist thesis that the mechanical model of the mind shall 
operate according to "mechanical principles," that is, that we can understand 
the operation of the whole in terms of the operations of its parts, and the 
operation of each part either shall be determined by its initial state and the 
construction of the machine, or shall be a random choice between a determi-
nate number of determinate operations. If the mechanist produces a machine 
which is so complicated that this ceases to hold good of it, then it is no longer a 
Minds and Thoughts 
389 

machine for the purposes of our discllssion, no matter how it was constructed. 
We should say, rather, that he had C1Tated a mind, in the same sort of sense as 
we procreate people at present. There would then be two ways of bringing 
new minds into the world, the traditional way, by begetting children born of 
women, and a new way by constructing very, very complicated systems of, say, 
valves and relays. When talking of the second way, we should take care to 
stress that although what was created looked like a machine, it was not one 
really, because it was not just the total of its parts. One could not tell what it 
was going to do merely by knowing the way in which it was built up and the 
initial state of its parts: one could not even tell the limits of what it could do, 
for even when presented with a G6dd-type question, it got the answer right. 
In fact we should say briefly that any system which was not floored by the 
G6del question was eo ipso not a Turing machine, i.e. not a machine within the 
meaning of the act.3 
In reading this passage, my mind constantly boggles at the rapid 
succession of topics, allusions, connotations, confusions, and conclusions. 
We jump from a Carrollian paradox to G6del to Turing to Artificial 
Intelligence to holism and reductionism, all in the span of two brief pages. 
About Lucas one can say that he is nothing if not stimulating. In the 
following Chapters, we shall come back to many of the topics touched on so 
tantalizingly and fleetingly in this odd passage.

Aria with Diverse Variations 
Achilles has been unable to sleep these past few nights. His friend 
the Tortoise has come over tonight, to keet him company during these 
annoying hours. 
Tortoise: 
I am so sorry to hear of the troubles that have been plaguing you, 
my dear Achilles. I hope my company will provide a welcome relief 
from all the unbearable stimulation which has kept you awake. 
Perhaps I will bore you sufficiently that you will at long last go to sleep. 
In that way, I will be of some service. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no, I am afraid that I have already had some of the world's 
finest bores try their hand at boring me to sleep-and all, sad to say, to 
no avail. So you will be no match for them. No, Mr. T, I invited you 
over hoping that perhaps you could entertain me with a little this or 
that, taken from number theory, so that I could at least while away 
these long hours in an agreeable fashion. You see, I have found that a 
little number theory does wonders for my troubled psyche. 
Tortoise: 
How quaint an idea! You know, it reminds me,just a wee bit, of 
the story of poor Count Kaiserling. 
Achilles: 
Who was he? 
Tortoise: 
Oh, he was a Count in Saxony in the eighteenth century-a 
Count of no account, to tell the truth-but because of him-well, shall 
I tell you the story? It is quite entertaining. 
Achilles: 
In that case, by all means, do! 
Tortoise: 
There was a time when the good Count was suffering from 
sleeplessness, and it just so happened that a competent musician lived 
in the same town, and so Count Kaiserling commissioned this musician 
to compose a set of variations to be played by the Count's court 
harpsichordist for him during his sleepless nights, to make the hours 
pass by more pleasantly. 
Achilles: 
Was the local composer up to the challenge? 
Tortoise: 
I suppose so, for after they were done, the Count rewarded him 
most lucratively-he presented him with a gold goblet containing one 
hundred Louis d'or. 
Achilles: 
You don't say! I wonder where he came upon such a goblet and 
all those Louis d'or, in the first place. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps he saw it in a museum, and took a fancy to it. 
Achilles: 
Are you suggesting he absconded with it? 
Tortoise: 
Now, now, I wouldn't put it exactly that way, but ... Those days, 
Counts could get away with most anything. Anyway, it is clear that the 
Count was most pleased with the music, for he was constantly entreat-
ing his harpsichordist-a mere lad of a fellow, name of Goldberg-to 
A ria with Diverse Variations

play one or another of these thirty variations. Consequently (and 
somewhat ironically) the variations became attached to the name of 
young Goldberg, rather than to the distinguished Count's name. 
Achilles: 
You mean, the composer was Bach, and these were the so-called 
"Goldberg Variations"? 
Tortoise: 
Do I ever! Actually, the work was entitled Aria with Diverse Varia-
tions, of which there are thirty. Do you know how Bach structured 
these thirty magnificent variations? 
Achilles: 
Do tell. 
Tortoise: 
All the pieces-except the final one-are based on a single 
theme, which he called an "aria". Actually, what binds them all to-
gether is not a common melody. but a common harmonic ground. The 
melodies may vary, but underneath, there is a constant theme. Only in 
the last variation did Bach take liberties. It is a sort of "post-ending 
ending". It contains extraneous musical ideas having little to do with 
the original Theme-in fact, two German folk tunes. That variation is 
called a "quodlibet". 
Achilles: 
What else is unusual about the Goldberg Variations? 
Tortoise: 
Well, every third variation is a canon. First a canon in which the 
two canonizing voices enter on the SAME note. Second, a canon in 
which one of the canonizing voices enters ONE NOTE HIGHER than the 
first. Third, one voice enters TWO notes higher than the other. And so 
on, until the final canon has entries just exactly one ninth apart. Ten 
canons, all told. And-
Achilles: 
Wait a minute. Don't I recall reading somewhere or other about 
fourteen recently discovered Goldberg canons ... ? 
Tortoise: 
Didn't that appear in the same journal where they recently re-
ported the discovery of fourteen previously unknown days in 
November? 
Achilles: 
No, it's true. A fellow named Wolff-a musicologist-heard 
about a special copy of the Goldberg Variations in Strasbourg. He went 
there to examine it, and to his surprise, on the back page, as a sort of 
"post-ending ending", he found these fourteen new canons, all based 
on the first eight notes of the theme of the Goldberg Variations. So 
now it is known that there are in reality forty-four Goldberg Varia-
tions, not thirty. 
Tortoise: 
That is, there are forty-four of them, unless some other 
musicologist discovers yet another batch of them in some unlikely spot. 
And although it seems improbable, it is still possible, even if unlikely, 
that still another batch will be discovered, and then another one, and 
on and on and on ... Why, it might never stop! We may never know if 
or when we have the full complement of Goldberg Variations. 
Achilles: 
That is a peculiar idea. Presumably, everybody thinks that this 
latest discovery was just a fluke, and that we now really do have all the 
Goldberg Variations. But just supposing that you are right, and some 
more turn up sometime, we shall start to expect this kind of thing. At 
392 
Aria with Diverse Variations 

that point, the name "Goldberg Variations" will start to shift slightly in 
meaning, to include not only the known ones, but also any others 
which might eventually turn up. Their number-call it 'g'-is certain 
to be finite, wouldn't you agree?-but merely knowing that g is finite 
isn't the same as knowing how big g is. Consequently, this information 
won't tell us when the last Goldberg Variation has been located. 
Tortoise: 
That is certainly true. 
Achilles: 
Tell me-when was it that Bach wrote these celebrated varia-
tions? 
Tortoise: 
It all happened in the year 1742, when he was Cantor in Leipzig. 
Achilles: 
1742? Hmm ... That number rings a bell. 
Tortoise: 
It ought to, for it happens to be a rather interesting number, 
being a sum of two odd primes: 1729 and 13. 
Achilles: 
By thunder! What a curious fact! I wonder how often one runs 
across an even number with that property. Let's see ... 
6 = 
3 + 3 
8 = 3 + 5 
10= 3+7= 
5+5 
12 = 5 + 7 
14 = 3 + 11 = 
7 + 7 
16 = 3 + 13 = 
5 + 11 
18 = 5 + 13 = 
7 + 11 
20 = 3 + 17 = 
7 + 13 
22 = 3 + 19 = 
5 + 17 = 11 + 11 
24 = 5 + 19 = 
7 + 17 = 11 + 13 
26 = 3 + 23 = 
7 + 19 = 13 + 13 
28 = 5 + 23 = 11 + 17 
30 = 7 + 23 = 11 + 19 = 13 + 17 
Now what do you know-according to my little table here, it seems to 
be quite a common occurrence. Yet I don't discern any simple regular-
ity in the table so far. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps there is no regularity to be discerned. 
Achilles: 
But of course there is! I am just not clever enough to spot it right 
off the bat. 
Tortoise: 
You seem quite convinced of it. 
Achilles: 
There's no doubt in my mind. I wonder ... Could it be that ALL 
even numbers (except 4) can be written as a sum of two odd primes? 
Tortoise: 
Hmm ... That question rings a bell ... Ah, I know why! You're 
not the first person to ask that question. Why, as a matter of fact, in the 
year 1742, a mathematical amateur put forth this very question in a-
Achilles: 
Did you say 1742? Excuse me for interrupting, but I just noticed 
that 1742 happens to be a rather interesting number, being a differ-
ence of two odd primes: 1747 and 5. 
Tortoise: 
By thunder! What a curious fact! I wonder how often one runs 
across an even number with that property. 
Aria with Diverse Variations 
393 

Achilles: 
But please don't let me dIstract you from your story. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, yes-as I was saying, in 1742, a certain mathematical 
amateur, whose name escapes me momentarily, sent a letter to Euler, 
who at the time was at the court of King Frederick the Great in 
Potsdam, and-well, shall I tell you the story? It is not without charm. 
Achilles: 
In that case, by all means, do! 
Tortoise: 
Very well. In his letter, this dabbler in number theory pro-
pounded an unproved conjecture to the great Euler: "Every even 
number can be represented as a sum of two odd primes." Now what 
was that fellow's name? 
Achilles: 
I vaguely recollect the story, from some number theory book or 
other. Wasn't the fellow named ·'Kupfergodel"? 
Tortoise: 
Hmm ... No, that sounds too long. 
Achilles: 
Could it have been "Silberescher"? 
Tortoise: 
No, that's not it, either. There's a name on the tip of my 
tongue-ah-ah-oh yes! It was "Goldbach"! Goldbach was the fellow. 
Achilles: 
I knew it was something like that. 
Tortoise: 
Yes-your guesses helped jog my memory. It's quite odd, how 
one occasionally has to hunt around in one's memory as if for a book in 
a library without call numbers .. But let us get back to 1742. 
Achilles: 
Indeed, let's. I wanted to ask you: did Euler ever prove that this 
guess by Goldbach was right? 
Tortoise: 
Curiously enough, he never even considered it worthwhile work-
ing on. However, his disdain was not shared by all mathematicians. In 
fact, it caught the fancy of many, and became known as the "Goldbach 
Conjecture". 
Achilles: 
Has it ever been proven correct? 
Tortoise: 
No, it hasn't. But there have been some remarkable near misses. 
For instance, in 1931 the Russian number theorist Schnirelmann 
proved that any number-even or odd-can be represented as the sum 
of not more than 300,000 primes. 
Achilles: 
What a strange result. Of what good is it? 
Tortoise: 
It has brought the problem into the domain of the finite. Previ-
ous to Schnirelmann's proof, it was conceivable that as you took larger 
and larger even numbers, they would require more and more primes 
to represent them. Some even number might take a trillion primes to 
represent it! Now it is known that that is not so-a sum of 300,000 
primes (or fewer) will always suffice. 
Achilles: 
I see. 
Tortoise: 
Then in 1937, a sly fellow named Vinogradov-a Russian 
too-managed to establish something far closer to the desired result: 
namely, every sufficiently large ODD number can be represented as 
a sum of no more than THREE odd primes. For example, 
1937 = 641 + 643 + 653. We could say that an odd number which is 
representable as a sum of three odd primes has "the Vinogradov 
property". Thus, all sufficiently large odd numbers have the Vino-
gradov property. 
394 
Aria with Diverse Variations 

Achilles: 
Very well-but what does "sufficiently large" mean? 
Tortoise: 
It means that some finite number of odd numbers may fail to 
have the Vinogradov property, but there is a number-call it 'v'-
beyond which all odd numbers have the Vinogradov property. But 
Vinogradov was unable to say how big v is. So in a way, v is like g, the 
finite but unknown number of Goldberg Variations. Merely knowing 
that v is finite isn't the same as knowing how big v is. Consequently, 
this information won't tell us when the last odd number which needs 
more than three primes to represent it has been located. 
Achilles: 
I see. And so any sufficiently large even number 2N can be 
represented as a sum of FOUR primes, by first representing 2N - 3 as a 
sum of three primes, and then adding back the prime number 3. 
Tortoise: 
Precisely. Another close approach is contained in the Theorem 
which says, "All even numbers can be represented as a sum of one 
prime and one number which is a product of at most two primes." 
Achilles: 
This question about sums of two primes certainly leads you into 
strange territory. I wonder where you would be led if you looked at 
DIFFERENCES of two odd primes. I'll bet I could glean some insight into 
this teaser by making a little table of even numbers, and their represen-
tations as differences of two odd primes, just as I did for sums. Let's 
see ... 
2= 5 - 3, 
7 - 5, 
13 -
11, 
19 -
17, 
etc. 
4= 7 - 3, 
11 - 7, 
17 -
13, 
23 -
19, etc. 
6 = 11 - 5, 
13 - 7, 
17-11, 19 -
13, etc. 
8 = 11 - 3, 
13 - 5, 
19 -
11, 
31 - 23, etc. 
10 = 13 - 3, 
17 - 7, 
23 -
13, 
29 -
19, etc. 
My gracious! There seems to be no end to the number of different 
representations I can find for these even numbers. Yet I don't discern 
any simple regularity in the table so far. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps there is no regularity to be discerned. 
Achilles: 
Oh, you and your constant rumblings about chaos! I'll hear none 
of that, thank you. 
Tortoise: 
Do you suppose that EVERY even number can be represented 
somehow as the difference of two odd primes? 
Achilles: 
The answer certainly would appear to be yes, from my table. But 
then again, I suppose it could also be no. That doesn't really get us very 
far, does it? 
Tortoise: 
With all due respect, I would say there are deeper insights to be 
had on the matter. 
Achilles: 
Curious how similar this problem is to Goldbach's original one. 
Perhaps it should be called a "Goldbach Variation". 
Tortoise: 
Indeed. But you know, there is a rather striking difference 
between the Goldbach Conjecture, and this Goldbach Variation, which 
I would like to tell you about. Let us say that an even number 2N has 
the "Goldbach property" if it is the SUM of two odd primes, and it has 
the "Tortoise property" if it is the DIFFERENCE of two odd primes. 
Aria with Diverse Variations 
395 

Achilles: 
I think you should call it the "Achilles property". After all, I 
suggested the problem. 
Tortoise: 
I was just about to propose that we should say that a number 
which LACKS the Tortoise property has the "Achilles property". 
Achilles: 
Well, all right ... 
Tortoise: 
Now consider, for instance, whether 1 trillion has the Goldbach 
property or the Tortoise property. Of course, it may have both. 
Achilles: 
I can consider it, but I doubt whether I can give you an answer to 
either question. 
Tortoise: 
Don't give up so soon. Suppose I asked you to answer one or the 
other question. Which one would you pick to work on? 
Achilles: 
I suppose I would flip a coin. I don't see much difference be-
tween them. 
Tortoise: 
Aha! But there's a world of difference! If you pick the Goldbach 
property, involving SUMS of primes, then you are limited to using 
primes which are bounded between 2 and 1 trillion, right? 
Achilles: 
Of course. 
Tortoise: 
So your search for a representation for 1 trillion as a sum of two 
primes is GUARANTEED TO TERMINATE. 
Achilles: 
Ahhh! I see your point. Whereas if I chose to work on represent-
ing 1 trillion as the DIFFERENCE of two primes, I would not have any 
bound on the size of the primes involved. They might be so big that it 
would take me a trillion years to find them. 
Tortoise: 
Or then again, they might not even EXIST! After all, that's what 
the question was asking-do such primes exist? It wasn't of much 
concern how big they might tum out to be. 
Achilles: 
You're right. If they didn't exist, then a search process would 
lead on forever, ne\'er answering yes, and never answering no. And 
nevertheless, the answer would be no. 
Tortoise: 
So if you have some number, and you wish to test whether it has 
the Goldbach property or the Tortoise property, the difference be-
tween the two tests will be this: in the former, the search involved is 
GUARANTEED TO TERMINATE; in the latter, it is POTENTIALLY 
ENDLESS-there are no guarantees of any type. It might just go merrily 
on forever, without yielding an answer. And yet, on the other hand, in 
some cases, it might stop on the first step. 
Achilles: 
I see there is a rather vast difference between the Goldbach and 
Tortoise properties. 
Tortoise: 
Yes, the two similar problems concern these vastly different 
properties. The Goldbach Conjecture is to the effect that all even 
numbers have the Goldbach property; the Goldbach Variation 
suggests that all even numbers have the Tortoise property. Both prob-
lems are unsolved, but what is interesting is that although they sound 
very much alike, they involve properties of whole numbers which are 
quite different. 
Achilles: 
I see what you mean. The Goldbach property is a detectable, or 
396 
Aria with Diverse Variations 

recognizable property of any even number, since I know how to test 
for its presence-just embark on a search. It will automatically come to 
an end with a yes or no answer. The Tortoise property, however, is 
more elusive, since a brute force search just may never give an answer. 
Tortoise: 
Well, there may be cleverer ways of searching in the case of the 
Tortoise property, and maybe following one of them would always 
come to an end, and yield an answer. 
Achilles: 
Couldn't the search only end if the answer were yes? 
Tortoise: 
Not necessarily. There might be some way of proving that 
whenever the search lasts longer than a certain length of time, then the 
answer must be no. There might even be some OTHER way of search-
ing for the primes, not such a brute force way, which is guaranteed to 
find them if they exist, and to tell if they don't. In either case, a finite 
search would be able to yield the answer no. But I don't know if such a 
thing can be proven or not. Searching through infinite spaces is always 
a tricky matter, you know. 
Achilles: 
So as things stand now, you know of no test for the Tortoise 
property which is guaranteed to terminate-and yet there MIGHT exist 
such a search. 
Tortoise: 
Right. I suppose one could embark on a search for such a search, 
but I can give no guarantee that that "meta-search" would terminate, 
either. 
Achilles: 
You know, it strikes me as quite peculiar that if some even 
number-for example, a trillion-failed to have the Tortoise property, 
it would be caused by an infinite number of separate pieces of informa-
tion. It's funny to think of wrapping all that information up into one 
bundle, and calling it, as you so gallantly suggested, "the Achilles 
property" of 1 trillion. It is really a property of the number system as a 
WHOLE, not just of the number 1 trillion. 
Tortoise: 
That is an interesting observation, Achilles, but I maintain that it 
makes a good deal of sense to attach this fact to the number 1 trillion 
nevertheless. For purposes of illustration, let me suggest that you 
consider the simpler statement "29 is prime". Now in fact, this state-
ment really means that 2 times 2 is not 29, and 5 times 6 is not 29, and 
so forth, doesn't it? 
Achilles: 
It must, I suppose. 
Tortoise: 
But you are perfectly happy to collect all such facts together, and 
attach them in a bundle to the number 29, saying merely, "29 is 
prime"? 
Achilles: 
Yes ... 
Tortoise: 
And the number of facts involved is actually infinite, isn't it? 
After all, such facts as "4444 times 3333 is not 29" are all part of it, 
aren't they? 
Achilles: 
Strictly speaking, I suppose so. But you and I both know that you 
can't produce 29 by multiplying two numbers which are both bigger 
than 29. So in reality, saying "29 is prime" is only summarizing a 
FINITE number of facts about multiplication. 
Aria with Diverse Variations 
397 

Tortoise: 
You can put it that way if you want, but think of this: the fact that 
two numbers which are bigger than 29 can't have a product equal to 29 
involves the entire structure of the number system. In that sense, that 
fact in itself is a summary of an infinite number of facts. You can't get 
away from the fact, Achilles, that when you say "29 is prime", you are 
actually stating an infinite number of things. 
Achilles: 
Maybe so, but it feels like just one fact to me. 
Tortoise: 
That's because an infinitude of facts are contained in your prior 
knowledge-they are embedded implicitly in the way you visualize 
things. You don't see an explicit infinity because it is captured im-
plicitly inside the images you manipulate. 
Achilles: 
I guess that you're right. It ~till seems odd to lump a property of 
the entire number system into a unit, and label the unit "primeness of 
29". 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps it seems odd, but it is also quite a convenient way to look 
at things. Now let us come back to your hypothetical idea. If, as you 
suggested, the number 1 trillion has the Achilles property, then no 
matter what prime you add to it, you do not get another prime. Such a 
state of affairs would be caused by an infinite number of separate 
mathematical "events". Now do all these "events" necessarily spring 
from the same source? Do they have to have a common cause? Because 
if they don't, then some sort of "infinite coincidence" has created the 
fact, rather than an underlying regularity. 
Achilles: 
An "infinite coincidence"? Among the natural numbers, NO-
THING is coincidental-nothing happens without there being some 
underlying pattern. Take 7, instead of a trillion. I can deal with it more 
easily, because it is smaller. 7 has the Achilles property. 
Tortoise: 
You're sure? 
Achilles: 
Yes. Here's why. If you add 2 to it, you get 9, which isn't prime. 
And if you add any other prime to 7, you are adding two odd numbers, 
resulting in an even number-thus you again fail to get a prime. So 
here the "Achilleanity" of 7, to coin a term, is a consequence of just 
TWO reasons: a far cry from any "infinite coincidence". Whichjust goes 
to support my assertion: that it never takes an infinite number of 
reasons to account for some arithmetical truth. If there WERE some 
arithmetical fact which were caused by an infinite collection of unre-
lated coincidences, then you could never give a finite proof for that 
truth. And that is ridiculous. 
Tortoise: 
That is a reasonable opinion, and you are in good company in 
making it. However-
Achilles: 
Are there actually those who disagree with this view? Such people 
would have to believe that there are "infinite coincidences", that there 
is chaos in the midst of the most perfect, harmonious, and beautiful of 
all creations: the system of natural numbers. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps they do; but have you ever considered that such chaos 
might be an integral part of the beauty and harmony? 
398

FIGURE 71. 
Order and Chaos, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1950). 
Achilles: 
Chaos, part of perfection? Order and chaos make a pleasing 
unity? Heresy! 
Tortoise: 
Your favorite artist, M. C. Escher, has been known to suggest 
such a heretical point of view in one of his pictures ... And while we're 
on the subject of chaos, I believe that you might be interested in 
hearing about two different categories of search, both of which are 
guaranteed to terminate. 
Achilles: 
Certainly. 
Aria with Diverse Variations 
399 

Tortoise: 
The first type of search-the non-chaotic type-is exemplified by 
the test involved in checking for the Goldbach property. You just look 
at primes less than 2N, and if some pair adds up to 2N, then 2N has 
the Goldbach property; otherwise, it doesn't. This kind of test is not 
only sure to terminate, but you can predict BY WHEN it will terminate, 
as well. 
Achilles: 
So it is a PREDICT ABLY TERMINATING test. Are you going to tell 
me that checking for some number-theoretical properties involves tests 
which are guaranteed to terminate, but about which there is no way to 
know in advance how long they will take? 
Tortoise: 
How prophetic of you, Achilles. And the existence of such tests 
shows that there is intrinsic chaos, in a certain sense, in the natural 
number system. 
Achilles: 
Well, in that case, I would have to say that people just don't know 
enough about the test. If they did a little more research, they could 
figure out how long it will take, at most, before it terminates. After all, 
there must always be some rhyme or reason to the patterns among 
integers. There can't just be chaotic patterns which defy prediction! 
Tortoise: 
I can understand your intuitive faith, Achilles. However, it's not 
always justified. Of course, in many cases you are exactly right-just 
because somebody doesn't know something, one can't conclude that it 
is unknowable! But there are certain properties of integers for which 
terminating tests can be proven to exist, and yet about which it can also 
be PROVEN that there is no way to predict in advance how long they will 
take. 
Achilles: 
I can hardly believe that. It sounds as if the devil himself man-
aged to sneak in and throw a monkey wrench into God's beautiful 
realm of natural numbers! 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps it will comfort you to know that it is by no means easy, or 
natural, to define a property for which there is a terminating but not 
PREDICTABLY terminating test. Most "natural" properties of integers 
do admit of predictably terminating tests. For example, primeness, 
squareness, being a power of ten, and so on. 
Achilles: 
Yes, I can see that those properties are completely straightfor-
ward to test for. Will you tell me a property for which the only possible 
test is a terminating but nonpredictable one? 
Tortoise: 
That's too complicated for me in my sleepy state. Let me instead 
show you a property which is very easy to define, and yet for which no 
terminating test is known. I'm not saying there won't ever be one 
discovered, mind you-just that none is known. You begin with a 
number-woul~ you care to pick one? 
Achilles: 
How about IS? 
Tortoise: 
An excellent choice. We begin with your number, and if it is ODD, 
we triple it, and add 1. If it is EVEN, we take half of it. Then we repeat 
the process. Call a number which eventually reaches 1 this way a 
WONDROUS number, and a number which doesn't, an UNWONDROUS 
number.

Wow! That's quite a roundabout journey, from 15 to 1. But I finally 
reached it. That shows that 15 has the property of being wondrous. I 
wonder what numbers are uNwondrous ... 
Tortoise: 
Did you notice how the numbers swung up and down, in this 
simply defined process? 
Achilles: 
Yes. I was particularly surprised, after thirteen turns, to find 
myself at 16, only one greater than 15, the number I started with. In 
one sense, I was almost back where I started-yet in another sense, I 
was nowhere near where I had started. Also, I found it quite curious 
that I had to go as high as 160 to resolve the question. I wonder how 
come. 
Tortoise: 
Yes, there is an infinite "sky" into which you can sail, and it is very 
hard to know in advance how high into the sky you will wind up sailing. 
Indeed, it is quite plausible that you might just sail up and up and up, 
and never come down. 
Achilles: 
Really? I guess that is conceivable-but what a weird coincidence 
it would require! You'd just have to hit odd number after odd number, 
with only a few evens mixed in. I doubt if that would ever happen-but 
I just don't know for sure. 
Tortoise: 
Why don't you try starting with 27? Mind you, I don't promise 
anything. But sometime, just try it, for your amusement. And I'd 
advise you to bring along a rather large sheet of paper. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... Sounds interesting. You know, it still makes me feel 
funny to associate the wondrousness (or unwondrousness) with the 
starting number, when it is so obviously a property of the entire 
number system. 
Tortoise: 
I understand what you mean, but it's not that different from 
saying "29 is prime", or "gold is valuable"-both statements attribute to 
Aria with Diverse Variations 
401 

a single entity a property which it has only by virtue of being embed-
ded in a particular context. 
Achilles: 
I suppose you're right. This "wondrousness" problem is won-
drous tricky, because of the way in which the numbers oscillate-now 
increasing, now decreasing. The pattern OUGHT to be regular, yet on 
the surface it appears to be quite chaotic. Therefore, I can well imagine 
why, as of yet, no one knows of a test for the property of wondrousness 
which is guaranteed to terminate. 
Tortoise: 
Speaking of terminating and nonterminating processes, and 
those which hover in between, I am reminded of a friend of mine, an 
author, who is at work on a book. 
Achilles: 
Oh, how exciting! What is it called? 
Tortoise: 
Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic Alloy. Doesn't that 
sound interesting? 
Achilles: 
Frankly, I'm a little confused by the title. After all, what do 
Copper, Silver, and Gold have to do with each other? 
Tortoise: 
It seems clear to me. 
Achilles: 
Now if the title were, say, Giraffes, Silver, Gold, or Copper, 
Elephants, Gold, why, I could see it ... 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps you would prefer Copper, Silver, Baboons? 
Achilles: 
Oh, absolutely! But that original title is a loser. No one would 
understand it. 
Tortoise: 
I'll tell my friend. He'll be delighted to have a catchier title (as will 
his publisher). 
Achilles: 
I'm glad. But how were you reminded of his book by our discus-
sion? 
Tortoise: 
Ah, yes. You see, in his book there will be a Dialogue in which he 
wants to throw readers off by making them SEARCH for the ending. 
Achilles: 
A funny thing to want to do. How is it done? 
Tortoise: 
You've undoubtedly noticed how some authors go to so much 
trouble to build up great tension a few pages before the end of their 
stories-but a reader who is holding the book physically in his hands 
can FEEL that the story is about to end. Hence, he has some extra 
information which acts as an advance warning, in a way. The tension is 
a bit spoiled by the physicality of the book. It would be so much better 
if, for instance, there were a lot of padding at the end of novels. 
Achilles: 
Padding? 
Tortoise: 
Yes; what I mean is, a lot of extra printed pages which are not 
part of the story proper, but which serve to conceal the exact location 
of the end from a cursory glance, or from the feel of the book. 
Achilles: 
I see. So a story's true ending might occur, say, fifty or a hundred 
pages before the physical end of the book? 
Tortoise: 
Yes. This would provide an element of surprise, because the 
reader wouldn't know in advance how many pages are padding, and 
how many are story. 
Achilles: If this were standard practice, it might be quite effective. But 
402 
Aria with Diverse Variations 

there is a problem. Suppose your padding were very obvious-such as 
a lot of blanks, or pages covered with X's or random letters. Then, it 
would be as good as absent. 
Tortoise: 
Granted. You'd have to make it resemble normal printed pages. 
Achilles: 
But even a cursory glance at a normal page from one story will 
often suffice to distinguish it from another story. So you will have to 
make the padding resemble the genuine story rather closely. 
Tortoise: 
That's quite true. The way I've always envisioned it is this: you 
bring the story to an end; then without any break, you follow it with 
something which looks like a continuation but which is in reality just 
padding, and which is utterly unrelated to the true theme. The pad-
ding is, in a way, a "post-ending ending". It may contain extraneous 
literary ideas, having little to do with the original theme. 
Achilles: 
Sneaky! But then the problem is that you won't be able to tell 
when the real ending comes. It'll just blend right into the padding. 
Tortoise: 
That's the conclusion my author friend and I have reached as 
well. It's a shame, for I found the idea rather appealing. 
Achilles: 
Say, I have a suggestion. The transition between genuine story 
and padding material could be made in such a way that, by sufficiently 
assiduous inspection of the text, an intelligent reader will be able to 
detect where one leaves off and the other begins. Perhaps it will take 
him quite a while. Perhaps there will be no way to predict how long it 
will take ... But the publisher could give a guarantee that a sufficiently 
assiduous search for the true ending will always terminate, even if he 
can't say how long it will be before the test terminates. 
Tortoise: 
Very well-but what does "sufficiently assiduous" mean? 
Achilles: 
It means that the reader must be on the lookout for some small 
but telltale feature in the text which occurs at some point. That would 
signal the end. And he must be ingenious enough to think up, and 
hunt for, many such features until he finds the right one. 
Tortoise: 
Such as a sudden shift of letter frequencies or word lengths? Or a 
rash of grammatical mistakes? 
Achilles: 
Possibly. Or a hidden message of some sort might reveal the true 
end to a sufficiently assiduous reader. Who knows? One could even 
throw in some extraneous characters or events which are inconsistent 
with the spirit of the foregoing story. A naIve reader would swallow the 
whole thing, whereas a sophisticated reader would be able to spot the 
dividing line exactly. 
Tortoise: 
That's a most original idea, Achilles. I'll relay it to my friend, and 
perhaps he can incorporate it in his Dialogue. 
Achilles: 
I would be highly honored. 
Tortoise: 
Well, I am afraid that I myself am growing a little groggy, 
Achilles. It would be well for me to take my leave, while I am still 
capable of navigating my way home. 
Achilles: 
I am most flattered that you have stayed up for so long, and at 
such an odd hour of the night, just for my benefit. I assure you that 
Aria with Diverse Variations 
403 

your number-theoretical entertainment has been a perfect antidote to 
my usual tossing and turning. And who knows-perhaps I may even 
be able to go to sleep tonight. As a token of my gratitude, Mr. T, I 
would like to present you with a special gift. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, don't be silly, Achilles. 
Achilles: It is my pleasure, Mr. T. Go over to that dresser; on it, you will 
see an Asian box. 
(The Tortoise moseys over to Achilles' dresser.) 
Tortoise: 
You don't mean this very gold Asian box, do you? 
Achilles: 
That's the one. Please accept it, Mr. T, with my warmest compli-
ments. 
Tortoise: 
Thank you very much indeed, Achilles. Hmm ... Why are all 
these mathematicians' names engraved on the top? What a curious list: 
De Morgan 
Abel 
Boole 
Brouwer 
S i e r pin s k 
Weierstrass 
Achilles: 
I believe it is supposed to be a Complete List of All Great 
Mathematicians. What I haven't been able to figure out is why the 
letters running down the diagonal are so much bolder. 
Tortoise: 
At the bottom it says, "Subtract 1 from the diagonal, to find Bach 
in Leipzig". 
Achilles: 
I saw that, but I couldn't make head or tail of it. Say, how about a 
shot of excellent whiskey? I happen to have some in that decanter on 
my shelf. 
Tortoise: 
No, thanks. I'm too tired. I'm just going to head home. (Casually, 
he opens the box.) Say, wait a moment, Achilles-there are one hundred 
Louis d'or in here! 
Achilles: 
I would be most pleased If you would accept them, Mr. T. 
Tortoise: 
But-but-
Achilles: 
No objections, now. The box, the gold-they're yours. And thank 
you for an evening without parallel. 
Tortoise: 
Now whatver has come over you, Achilles? Well, thank you for 
your outstandig generosity, and I hope you have sweet dreams about 
the strange Golbach Conjecture, and its Variation. Good night. 
(And he picks up the very gold Asian box jilled with the one hundred Louis 
d'or, and walks towards the door. As he is about to leave, there is a loud 
knock.) 
Who could be knocking at this ungodly hour, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
I haven't the foggiest idea. It seems suspicious to me. Why don't 
you go hide behind the dresser, in case there's any funny business. 
404 
Aria with Diverse Variations 

Tortoise: 
Achilles: 
Good idea. (Scrambles in behind the dresser.) 
Who's there? 
Voice: 
Open up-it's the cops. 
Achilles: 
Come in, it's open. 
(Two burly policemen walk in, wearing shiny badges.) 
Cop: 
I'm Silva. This is Gould. (Points at his badge.) Is there an Achilles at 
this address? 
Achilles: 
That's met 
Cop: 
Well, Achilles, we have reason to believe that there is a very gold 
Asian box here, filled with one hundred Louis d'or. Someone 
absconded with it from the museum this afternoon. 
Achilles: 
Heavens to Betsy! 
Cop: If it is here, Achilles, since you would be the only possible suspect, I 
regret to say that I should have to take y~)U into custody. Now I have 
here a search warrant-
Achilles: 
Oh, sirs, am I ever glad you arrived! All evening long, I have 
been being terrorized by Mr. Tortoise and his very Asian gold box. 
Now at last you have come to liberate me! Please, sirs, just take a look 
behind that dresser, and there you will find the culprit! 
(The cops look behind the dresser and spy the Tortoise huddled behind it, 
holding his very gold Asian box, and trembling.) 
Cop: 
So there it is! And so Mr. Tortoise is the varmint, eh? I never would 
have suspected HIM. But he's caught, red-handed. 
A chilies: 
Haul the villain away, kind sirs! Thank goodness, that's the last 
I'll have to hear of him, and the Very Asian Gold Box!

CHAPTE.R XIII 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
Self-Awareness and Chaos 
BLOOP, FLOOP, AND GLOOP are not trolls, talking ducks, or the sounds 
made by a sinking ship-they are three computer languages, each one with 
its own special purpose. These languages were invented specially for this 
Chapter. They will be of use in explaining some new senses of the word 
"recursive"-in particular, the notions of primitive recursivity and general 
recursivity. They will prove very helpful in clarifying the machinery of 
self-reference in TNT. 
We seem to be making a rather abrupt transition from brains and 
minds to technicalities of mathematics and computer science. Though the 
transition is abrupt in some ways, it makes some sense. We just saw how a 
certain kind of self-awareness seems to be at the crux of consciousness. 
Now we are going to scrutinize "self-awareness" in more formal settings, 
such as TNT. The gulf between TNT and a mind is wide, but some of the 
ideas will be most illuminating, and perhaps metaphorically transportable 
back to our thoughts about consciousness. 
One of the amazing things about TNT's self-awareness is that it is 
intimately connected to questions about order versus chaos among the 
natural numbers. In particular, we shall see that an orderly system of 
sufficient complexity that it can mirror itself cannot be totally orderly-it 
must contain some strange, chaotic features. For readers who have some 
Achilles in them, this will be hard to take. However, there is a "magical" 
compensation: there is a kind of order to the disorder, which is now its own 
field of study, called "recursive function theory". Unfortunately, we will not 
be able to do much more than hint at the fascination of this subject. 
Representability and Refrigerators 
Phrases such as "sufficiently complex", "sufficiently powerful" and the like 
have cropped up quite often earlier. Just what do they mean? Let us go 
back to the battle of the Crab and Tortoise, and ask, "What qualifies 
something as a record player?" The Crab might claim that his refrigerator 
is a "Perfect" record player. Then to prove it, he could set any record 
whatsoever atop it, and say, "You see--it's playing it!" The Tortoise, if he 
wanted to counter this Zen-like act, would have to reply, "No-your re-
frigerator is too low-fidelity to be counted as a phonograph: it cannot 
reproduce sounds ·at all (let alone it~ self-breaking sound)." The Tortoise 
406 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 

can only make a record called "I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X" 
provided that Record Player X is really a record player! The Tortoise's 
method is quite insidious, as it plays on the strength, rather than on the 
weakness, of the system. And therefore he requires "sufficiently hi-fi" 
record players. 
Ditto for formal versions of number theory. The reason that TNT is a 
formalization of N'is that its symbols act the right way: that is, its theorems 
are not silent like a refrigerator-they speak actual truths of N. Of course, 
so do the theorems of the pq-system. Does it, too, count as "a formalization 
of number theory", or is it more like a refrigerator? Well, it is a little better 
than a refrigerator, but it is still pretty weak. The pq-system does not 
include enough of the core truths of N to count as "a number theory". 
What, then, are these "core truths" of N? They are the primitive recur-
sive truths; that means they involve only predictably terminating calculations. 
These core truths serve for N as Euclid's first four postulates served for 
geometry: they allow you to throw out certain candidates before the game 
begins, on the grounds of "insufficient power". From here on out, the 
representability of all primitive recursive truths will be the criterion for calling a 
system "sufficiently powerful". 
Ganto's Ax in Metamathematics 
The significance of the notion is shown by the following key fact: If you 
have a sufficiently powerful formalization of number theory, then Godel's 
method is applicable, and consequently your system is incomplete. If, on the 
other hand, your system is not sufficiently powerful (i.e., not all primitive 
recursive truths are theorems), then your system is, precisely by virtue of 
that lack, incomplete. Here we have a reformulation of "Gant6's Ax" in 
metamathematics: whatever the system does, Godel's Ax will chop its head 
om Notice also how this completely parallels the high-fidelity-versus-low-
fidelity battle in the Contracrostipunctus. 
Actually, it turns out that much weaker systems are still vulnerable to 
the Godel method; the criterion that all primitive recursive truths need be 
represented as theorems is far too stringent. It is a little like a thief who will 
only rob "sufficiently rich" people, and whose criterion is that the potential 
victim should be carrying at least a million dollars in cash. In the case of 
TNT, luckily, we will be able to act in our capacity as thieves, for the million 
in cash is there-which is to say, TNT does indeed contain all primitive 
recursive truths as theorems. 
Now before we plunge into a detailed discussion of primitive recursive 
functions and predicates, I would like to tie the themes of this Chapter to 
themes from earlier Chapters, so as to provide a bit better motivation. 
Finding Order by Choosing the Right Filter 
We saw at a very early stage that formal systems can be difficult and unruly 
beasts because they have lengthening and shortening rules, which can 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
407 

possibly lead to never-ending searches among strings. The discovery of 
Godel-numbering showed that any search for a string having a special 
typographical property has an arithmetical cousin: an isomorphic search 
for an integer with a corresponding special arithmetical property. Con-
sequently, the quest for decision procedures for formal systems involves 
solving the mystery of unpredictably long searches- chaos-among the 
integers. Now in the Aria with Diverse Variations, I gave perhaps too much 
weight to apparent manifestations of chaos in problems about integers. As 
a matter of fact, people have tamed wilder examples of apparent chaos 
than the "wondrousness" problem, finding them to be quite gentle beasts 
after all. Achilles' powerful faith in the regularity and predictability of 
numbers should therefore be accorded quite a bit of respect---especially as 
it reflects the beliefs of nearly all mathematicians up till the 1930's. To show 
why order versus chaos is such a subtle and significant issue, and to tie it in 
with questions about the location and revelation of meaning, I would like to 
quote a beautiful and memorable passage from Are Quanta Real?-a Gali-
lean Dialogue by the late J. M. Jauch: 
SALVIATI Suppose I give you two sequences of numbers, such as 
78539816339744830961566084 ... 
and 
1, -1/3, +115, -117, +119, -1111, +1113, -1115, ... 
If I asked you, Simplicio, what the next number of the first sequence is, what 
would you say? 
SIMPLICIO 
I could not tell you. I think it is a random sequence and that 
there is no law in it. 
SALVIATI 
And for the second sequence? 
SIMPLICIO That would be easy. It must be +1117. 
SALVIATI 
Right. But what would you say if I told you that the first 
sequence is also constructed by a law and this law is in fact identical with the 
one you have just discovered for the 5.econd sequence? 
SIMPLICIO 
This does not seem probable to me. 
SALVIATI 
But it is indeed so, since the first sequence is simply the begin-
ning of the decimal fraction [expansion] of the sum of the second. Its value is 
1T14. 
SIMPLICIO 
You are full of such mathematical tricks, but I do not see what 
this has to do with abstraction and reality. 
SALVIATI The relationship with abstraction is easy to see. The first se-
quence looks random unless one has developed through a process of abstrac-
tion a kind of filter which sees a simple structure behind the apparent 
randomness. 
It is exactly in this manner that laws of nature are discovered. Nature 
presents us with a host of phenomena which appear mostly as chaotic ran-
domness until we select some significant events, and abstract from their 
particular, irrelevant circumstances so that they become idealized. Only then 
can they exhibit their true structure in full splendor. 
SAGREDO 
This is a marvelous idea! It suggests that when we try to under-
stand nature, we should look at the phenomena as if they were messages to be 
408 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 

understood. Except that each message appears to be random until we estab-
lish a code to read it. This code takes the form of an abstraction, that is, we 
choose to ignore certain things as irrelevant and we thus partially select the 
content of the message by a free choice. These irrelevant signals form the 
"background noise," which will limit the accuracy of our message. 
But since the code is not absolute there may be several messages in the 
same raw material of the data, so changing the code will result in a message of 
equally deep significance in something that was merely noise before, and 
conversely: In a new code a former message may be devoid of meaning. 
Thus a code presupposes a free choice among different, complementary 
aspects, each of which has equal claim to reality, if I may use this dubious 
word. 
Some of these aspects may be completely unknown to us now but they may 
reveal themselves to an observer with a different system of abstractions. 
But tell me, Salviati, how can we then still claim that we discover something 
out there in the objective real world? Does this not mean that we are merely 
creating things according to our own images and that reality is only within 
ourselves? 
SALVIATI 
I don't think that this is necessarily so, but it is a question which 
requires deeper reflection.' 
Jauch is here dealing with messages that come not from a "sentient 
being" but from nature itself. The questions that we raised in Chapter VI 
on the relation of meaning to messages can be raised equally well with 
messages from nature. Is nature chaotic, or is nature patterned? And what 
is the role of intelligence in determining the answer to this question? 
To back off from the philosophy, however, we can consider the point 
about the deep regularity of an apparently random sequence. Might the 
function Q( n} from Chapter V have a simple, nonrecursive explanation, 
too? Can every problem, like an orchard, be seen from such an angle that 
its secret is revealed? Or are there some problems in number theory which, 
no matter what angle they are seen from, remain mysteries? 
With this prologue, I feel it is time to move ahead to define the precise 
meaning of the term "predictably long search". This will be accomplished 
in terms of the language BlooP. 
Primordial Steps of the Language BlooP 
Our topic will be searches for natural numbers which have various proper-
ties. In order to talk about the length of any search, we shall have to define 
some primordial steps, out of which all searches are built, so that length can 
be measured in terms of number of steps. Some steps which we might 
consider primordial are: 
adding any two natural numbers; 
multiplying any two natural numbers; 
determining if two numbers are equal; 
determining the larger (smaller) of two numbers. 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
409 

Loops and Upper Bounds 
If we try to formulate a test for, say, primality in terms of such steps, we 
shall soon see that we have to include a control structure-that is, descriptions 
of the order to do things in, when to branch back and try something again, 
when to skip over a set of steps, when to stop, and similar matters. 
It is typical of any algorithm-that is, a specific delineation of how to 
carry out a task-that it includes a mixture of (1) specific operations to be 
performed, and (2) control statements. Therefore, as we develop our 
language for expressing predictably long calculations, we shall have to 
incorporate primordial control structures also. In fact, the hallmark of 
BlooP is its limited set of control structures. It does not allow you to branch 
to arbitrary steps, or to repeat groups of steps without limit; in BlooP, 
essentially the only control structure is the bounded loop: a set of instructions 
which can be executed over and over again, up to a predefined maximum 
number of times, called the upper bound, or ceiling, of the loop. If the ceiling 
were 300, then the loop might be executed 0, 7, or 300 times-but not 301. 
Now the exact values of all the upper bounds in a program need 
not be put in numerically by the programmer-indeed, they may not be 
known in advance. Instead, any upper bound may be determined by 
calculations carried out before its loop is entered. For instance, if you 
wanted to calculate the value of 23", there would be two loops. First, 
you evaluate 3n , which involves n multiplications. Then, you put 2 to 
that power, which involves 3n multiplications. Thus, the upper bound 
for the second loop is the result of the calculation of the first loop. 
Here is how you would expres.~ this in a BlooP program: 
DEFINE PROCEDURE "TWO-TO-THE-THREE-TO-THE" [N]: 
BLOCK 0: BEGIN 
CELL( 0) ¢: t; 
LOOP N TIMES: 
BLOCK t: BEGIN 
CELL(O) ¢: 3 X CELL(O); 
BLOCK t: END; 
CELL( t) ¢: t; 
LOOP CELL( 0) TIMES: 
BLOCK 2: BEGIN 
CELL( t) ¢: 2 X CELL( t ); 
BLOCK 2: END; 
OUTPUT ¢: CELL( t); 
BLOCK 0: END. 
Conventions of BlooP 
Now it is an acquired skill to be able to look at an algorithm written in a 
computer language, and figure out what it is doing. However, I hope that 
this algorithm is simple enough that it makes sense without too much 
410 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 

scrutiny. A procedure is defined, having one input parameter, N; its output is 
the desired value. 
This procedure definition has what is called block structure, which 
means that certain portions of it are to be considered as units, or blocks. All 
the statements in a block get executed as a unit. Each block has a number 
(the outermost being BLOCK 0), and is delimited by a BEGIN and an END. 
In our example, BLOCK t and BLOCK 2 contain just one statement each-
but shortly you will see longer blocks. A LOOP statement always means to 
execute the block immediately under it repeatedly. As can be seen above, 
blocks can be nested. 
The strategy of the above algorithm is as described earlier. You begin 
by taking an auxiliary variable, called CELL(O); you set it initially to 1, and 
then, in a loop, you multiply it repeatedly by 3 until you've done so exactly 
N times. Next, you do the analogous thing for CELL( t )-set it to 1, multiply 
by 2 exactly CELL(O) times, then quit. Finally, you set OUTPUT to the value 
of CELL( t). This is the value returned to the outside world-the only 
externally visible behavior of the procedure. 
A number of points about the notation should be made here. First, the 
meaning of the left-arrow'¢:' is this: 
Evaluate the expression to its right, then take the result and set the 
CELL (or OUTPUT) on its left to that value. 
So the meaning of a command such as CELL( t) ¢: 3 X CELL( t) is to triple 
the value stored in CELL( t). You may think of each CELL as being a separate 
word in the memory of some computer. The only difference between a 
CELL and a true word is that the latter can only hold integers up to some 
finite limit, whereas we allow a CELL to hold any natural number, no matter 
how big. 
Every procedure in BlooP, when called, yields a value-namely the 
value of the variable called OUTPUT. At the beginning of execution of any 
procedure, it is assumed as a default option that OUTPUT has the value O. 
That way, even if the procedure never resets OUTPUT at all, OUTPUT has a 
well-defined value at all times. 
IF-Statements and Branching 
Now let us look at another procedure which will show us som6 other 
features of BlooP which give it more generality. How do you find out, 
knowing only how to add, what the value of M - N is? The trick is to add 
various numbers onto N until you find the one which yields M. However, 
what happens if M is smaller than N? What if we are trying to take 5 from 
2? In the domain of natural numbers, there is no answer. But we would like 
our BlooP procedure to give an answer anyway-let's say O. Here, then, is a 
BlooP procedure which does subtraction: 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
411 

DEFINE PROCEDURE "MINUS" [M,N]: 
BLOCK 0: BEGIN 
IF M < N, THEN: 
QUIT BLOCK 0; 
LOOP AT MOST M + t TIMES: 
BLOCK t: BEGIN 
IF OUTPUT + N = M, THEN: 
ABORT LOOP t; 
OUTPUT ¢: OUTPUT + t; 
BLOCK t: END; 
BLOCK 0: END. 
Here we are making use of the implicit feature that OUTPUT begins at 
O. If M is less than N, then the subtraction is impossible, and we simply 
jump to the bottom of BLOCK 0 right away, and the answer is O. That is 
what is meant by the line QUIT BLOCK O. But if M is not less than N, then 
we skip over that QUIT-statement, and carry out the next command in 
sequence (here, a LOOP-statement). That is how IF-statements always work 
in BlooP. 
So we enter LOOP t, so called because the block which it tells us to 
repeat is BLOCK t. We try adding 0 to N, then 1, 2, etc., until we find a 
number that gives M. At that point, we ABORT the loop we are in, meaning 
we jump to the statement immediately following the END which marks the 
bottom of the loop's block. In this case, that jump brings us just below 
BLOCK t: END, which is to say, to the last statement of the algorithm, and 
we are done. OUTPUT now contains the correct answer. 
Notice that there are two distinct instructions for jumping downwards: 
QUIT, and ABORT. The former pertains to blocks, the latter to loops. QUIT 
BLOCK n means to jump to the last line of BLOCK n, whereas ABORT LOOP n 
means to jump just below the last line of BLOCK n. This distinction only 
matters when you are inside a loop and want to continue looping but to quit 
the block this time around. Then you can say QUIT and the proper thing 
will happen. 
Also notice that the words AT MOST now precede the upper bound of 
the loop, which is a warning that the loop may be aborted before the upper 
bound is reached. 
Automatic Chunking 
Now there are two last features of BlooP to explain, both of them very 
important. The first is that, once a procedure has been defined, it may be 
called inside later procedure definitions. The effect of this is that once an 
operation has been defined in a procedure, it is considered as simple as a primordial 
step. Thus, BlooP features automatic chunking. You might compare it to 
the way a good ice skater acquires new motions: not by defining them as 
long sequences of primordial muscle-actions, but in terms of previously 
learned motions, which were themselves learned as compounds of earlier 
412 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 

learned motions, etc.-and the nestedness, or chunkedness, can go back 
many layers until you hit primordial muscle-actions. And thus, the reper-
toire of BlooP programs, like the repertoire of a skater's tricks, grows, quite 
literally, by loops and bounds. 
BlooP Tests 
The other feature of BlooP is that certain procedures can have YES or NO 
as their output, instead of an integer value. Such procedures are tests, 
rather thanfunctions. To indicate the difference, the name of a test must 
terminate in a question mark. Also, in a test, the default option for OUTPUT 
is not 0, of course, but NO. 
Let us see an example of these last two features of BlooP in an 
algorithm which tests its argument for primality: 
DEFINE PROCEDURE "PRIME?" [N]: 
BLOCK 0: BEGIN 
IF N = 0, THEN: 
QUIT BLOCK 0; 
CELL(O) ¢: 2; 
LOOP AT MOST MINUS [N,2] TIMES: 
BLOCK t: BEGIN 
IF REMAINDER [N,CELL(O)] = 0, THEN: 
QUIT BLOCK 0; 
CELL( 0) ¢: CELL( 0) + t; 
BLOCK t: END; 
OUTPUT ¢: YES; 
BLOCK 0: END. 
Notice that I have called two procedures inside this algorithm: MINUS and 
REMAINDER. (The latter is presumed to have been previously defined, and 
you may work out its definition yourself.) Now this test for primality works 
by trying out potential factors of N one by one, starting at 2 and increasing 
to a maximum of N - t. In case any of them divides N exactly (i.e., gives 
remainder 0), then we jump down to the bottom, and since OUTPUT still 
has its default value at this stage, the answer is NO. Only if N has no exact 
divisors will it survive the entirety of LOOP t; then we will emerge smoothly 
at the statement OUTPUT ¢: YES, which will get executed, and then the 
procedure is over. 
BlooP Programs Contain Chains of Procedures 
We have seen how to define procedures in BlooP; however, a procedure 
definition is only a part of a program. A program consists of a chain of 
procedure definitions (each only calling previously defined procedures), op-
tionally followed by one or more calls on the procedures defined. Thus, an 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
413 

example of a full BlooP program would be the definition of the procedure 
TWO-TO-THE-THREE-TO-THE, followed by the call 
TWO-TO-TH E-TH REE-TO-TH E [2] 
which would yield an answer of 512. 
If you have only a chain of procedure definitions, then nothing ever 
gets executed; they are all just waiting for some call, with specific numerical 
values, to set them in motion. It is like a meat grinder waiting for some 
meat to grind-or rather, a chain of meat grinders all linked together, each 
of which is fed from earlier ones ... In the case of meat grinders, the image 
is perhaps not so savory; however, in the case of BlooP programs, such a 
construct is quite important, and we will call it a "call-less program". This 
notion is illustrated in Figure 72. 
Now BlooP is our language for defining predictably terminating 
calculations. The standard name for functions which are BlooP-computable 
is primitive recursive functions; and the standard name for properties 
which can be detected by BlooP-tests is primitive recursive predicates. 
Thus, the function 23
11 is a primitive recursive function; and the state-
ment "n is a prime number" is a primitive recursive predicate. 
It is clear intuitively that the Goldbach property is primitive recursive, 
and to make that quite explicit, here is a procedure definition in BlooP, 
showing how to test for its presence or absence: 
DEFINE PROCEDURE "GOLDBACH?" [N]: 
BLOCK 0: BEGIN 
CELL( 0) ¢: 2; 
LOOP AT MOST N TIMES: 
BLOCK t: BEGIN 
IF {PRIME? [CELL(O)] 
AND PRIME? [MINUS [N,CELL(O)]]}, 
THEN: 
BLOCK 2: BEGIN 
OUTPUT ¢: YES; 
QUIT BLOCK 0; 
BLOCK 2: END 
CELL(O) ¢: CELL(O) + t; 
BLOCK t: END; 
BLOCK 0: END. 
As usual, we assume NO until proven YES, and we do a brute force search 
among pairs of numbers which sum up to N. If both are prime, we quit the 
outermost block; otherwise we just go back and try again, until all pos-
sibilities are exhausted. 
(Warning: The fact that the Goldbach property is primitive recursive 
does not make ~he question "Do all numbers have the Goldbach property?" 
a simple question-far from itt)

Suggested Exercises 
Can you write a similar BlooP procedure which tests for the presence or 
absence of the Tortoise property (or the Achilles property)? If so, do it. If 
not, is it merely because you are ignorant about upper bounds, or could it 
be that there is a fundamental obstacle preventing the formulation of such 
an algorithm in BlooP? And what about the same questions, with respect to 
the property of wondrousness, defined in the Dialogue? 
Below, I list some functions and properties, and you ought to take the 
time to determine whether you believe they are primitive recursive 
(BlooP-programmable) or not. This means that you must carefully consider 
what kinds of operations will be involved in the calculations which they 
require, and whether ceilings can be given for all the loops involved.

PRIME-BEYOND [N] = the lowest prime beyond N 
(e.g., PRIME-BEYOND [33] = 37) 
PERFECT [N] = the Nth "perfect" number (a number such as 28 whose 
divisors sum up to itself: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14) 
(e.g., PERFECT [2] = 28) 
PRIME? [N] = YES if N is prime, otherwise NO. 
PERFECT? [N] = YES if N is perfect, otherwise NO. 
TRIVIAL? [A,B.C,N] = YES if AN+ BN = CN is correct; otherwise NO.

values of A, B, C; otherwise NO. 
(e.g., FERMAT? [2] = YES)

(e.g., TORTOISE [1742] = YES, 
TORTOISE [7] = NO)

system, is well-formed; otherwise NO. 
(e.g., MIU-WELL-FORMED? [310] = YES. 
MIU-WELL-FORMED? [415] = NO) 
MIU-PROOF-PAIR? [M,N] = YES if M, as seen as a sequence of strings of 
the MIU-system, is a derivation of N, as seen as a string of the MIU-system; 
otherwise NO. 
(e.g., MIU-PROOF-PAIR? [3131131111301.301] = YES, 
MIU-PROOF-PAIR? [31 1 130,30] = NO) 
MIU-THEOREM? [N] = YES if N, seen as a MIU-system string, is a theorem;

FALSE? [223666111666] = YES, 
FALSE? [7014] = NO) 
The last seven examples are particularly relevant to our future 
metamathematical explorations, so they highly merit your scrutiny. 
Expressibility and Representability 
Now before we go on to some interesting questions about BlooP and are led 
to its relative, FlooP, let us return to the reason for introducing BlooP in 
the first place, and connect it to TNT. Earlier, I stated that the critical mass 
for Godel's method to be applicable to a formal system is attained when all 
primitive recursive notions are representable in that system. Exactly what 
does this mean? First of all, we must distinguish between the notions of 
representability and expressibility. Expressing a predicate is a mere matter 
of translation from English into a strict formalism. It has nothing to do with 
theoremhood. For a predicate to be represented, on the other hand, is a 
much stronger notion. It means that 
(1) 
All true instances of the predicate are theorems; 
(2) 
All false instances are nontheorems. 
By "instance", I mean the string produced when you replace all free 
variables by numerals. For example, the predicate m + n = k is represented 
in the pq-system, because each true instance of the predicate is a theorem, 
each false instance is a nontheorem. Thus any specific addition, whether 
true or false, translates into a decidable string of the pq-system. However, the 
pq-system is unable to express-let alone represent-any other properties 
of natural numbers. Therefore it would be a weak candidate indeed in a 
competition of systems which can do number theory. 
Now TNT has the virtue of being able to express virtually any number-
theoretical predicate; for example, it is easy to write a TNT -string which 
expresses the predicate "b has the Tortoise property". Thus, in terms of 
expressive power, TNT is all we want. 
However, the question "Which properties are represented in TNT?" is 
precisely the question "How powerful an axiomatic system is TNT?" Are all 
possible predicates represented in TNT? If so, then TNT can answer any 
question of number theory; it is complete. 
Primitive Recursive Predicates Are Represented in TNT 
Now although completeness will turn out to be a chimera, TNT is at least 
complete with respect to primitive recursive predicates. In other words, any 
statement of number theory whose truth or falsity can be decided by a 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 
417 

computer within a predictable length of time is also decidable inside TNT. 
Or, one final restatement of the same thing: 
If a BlooP test can be written for some property of natural 
numbers, then that property is represented in TNT. 
Are There Functions Which Are Not Primitive Recursive? 
Now the kinds of properties which can be detected by BlooP tests are 
widely varied, including whether a number is prime or perfect, has the 
Goldbach property, is a power of 2, and so on and so forth. It would not be 
crazy to wonder whether every property of numbers can be detected by 
some suitable BlooP program. The fact that, as of the present moment, we 
have no way of testing whether a number is wondrous or not need not 
disturb us too much, for it might merely mean that we are ignorant about 
wondrousness, and that with more digging around, we could discover a 
universal formula for the upper bound to the loop involved. Then a BlooP 
test for wondrousness could be written on the spot. Similar remarks could 
be made about the Tortoise properly. 
So the question really is, "Can upper bounds always be given for the 
length of calculations-or, is there an inherent kind of jumbliness to the 
natural number system, which sometimes prevents calculation lengths from 
being predictable in advance?" The striking thing is that the latter is the 
case, and we are about to see why. It is the sort of thing that would have 
driven Pythagoras, who first proved that the square root of 2 is irrational, 
out of his mind. In our demonstration, we will use the celebrated diagonal 
method, discovered by Georg Cantor, the founder of set theory. 
Pool B, Index Numbers, and Blue Programs 
We shall begin by imagining a CurioU50 notion: the pool of all possible BlooP 
programs. Needless to say, this pool-·"Pool B"-is an infillite one. We want 
to consider a subpool of Pool B, obtained by three successive filtering 
operations. The first filter will retain for us only call-less programs. From 
this subpool we then eliminate all tests, leaving only functions. (By the way, in 
call-less programs, the last procedure in the chain determines whether the 
program as a whole is considered a test, or a function.) The third filter will 
retain only functions which have exactly one input parameter. (Again referring 
to the final procedure in the chain.) What is left? 
A complete pool of all call-less BlooP programs which calculate 
functions of exactly one input parameter. 
Let us call these special BlooP programs Blue Programs. 
What we would like to do now is to assign an unambiguous index 
number to each Blue Program. How can this be done? The easiest way-we 
shall use it-is to list them in order of length: the shortest possible Blue 
418 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 

Program being # 1, the second shortest being #2, etc. Of course, there will 
be many programs tied for each length. To break such ties, we use al-
phabetical order. Here, "alphabetical order" is taken in an extended sense, 
where the alphabet includes all the special characters of BlooP, in some 
arbitrary order, such as the following: 
ABCDE FGH I J K LMN 
OPQRSTUVWXYZ+x 
o t 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ~ = < > 
()[]{} ']:;, 
-and at the end comes the lowly blank! Altogether, fifty-six characters. For 
convenience's sake, we can put all Blue Programs of length 1 in Volume 1, 
programs of 2 characters in Volume 2, etc. Needless to say, the first few 
volumes will be totally empty, while later volumes will have many, many 
entries (though each volume will only have a finite number). The very first 
Blue Program would be this one: 
DEFINE PROCEDURE "A" [B]: 
BLOCK 0: BEGIN 
BLOCK 0: END. 
This rather silly meat grinder returns a value of 0 no matter what its input 
is. It occurs in Volume 56, since it has 56 characters (counting necessary 
blanks, including blanks separating successive lines). 
Soon after Volume 56, the volumes will get extremely fat, because 
there are just so many millions of ways of combining symbols to make Blue 
BlooP programs. But no matter-we are not going to try to print out this 
infinite catalogue. All that we care about is that, in the abstract, it is 
well-defined, and that each Blue BlooP program therefore has a unique 
and definite index number. This is the crucial idea. 
Let us designate the function calculated by the kth Blue Program this 
way: 
Blueprogram{# k} [N] 
Here, k is the index number of the program, and N is the single input 
parameter. For instance, Blue Program #12 might return a value twice the 
size of its input: 
Blueprogram{#12} [N] = 2 X N 
The meaning of the equation above is that the program named on the 
left-hand side returns the same value as a human would calculate from the 
ordinary algebraic expression on the right-hand side. As another example, 
perhaps the 5000th Blue Program calculates the cube of its input parame-
ter: 
Blueprogram{#5000} [N] = N3 
BlooP and AooP and GlooP 
419 

The Diagonal Method 
Very well-now we apply the "twist": Cantor's diagonal method. We shall 
take this catalogue of Blue Programs and use it to define a new function of 
one variable-Bluediag [N]-which will turn out not to be anywhere in the 
list (which is why its name is in italics). Yet Bluediag will clearly be a 
well-defined, calculable function of one variable, and so we will have to 
conclude that functions exist which simply are not programmable in BlooP. 
Here is the definition of Bluediag [N]: 
Equation (1) ... 
Bluediag [N] = 1 + Blueprogram{#N} [N] 
The strategy is: feed each meat grinder with its own index number, then 
add 1 to the output. To illustrate, let us find Bluediag [12]. We saw that 
Blueprogram{#12} is the function 2N; therefore, Bluediag [12] must have 
the value 1 + 2 X 12, or 25. Likewise, Bluediag [5000] would have the value 
125,000,000,001, since that is 1 more than the cube of 5000. Similarly, you 
can find Bluediag of any particular argument you wish. 
The peculiar thing about Bluediag [N] is that it is not represented in 
the catalogue of Blue Programs. It cannot be. The reason is this. To be a 
Blue Program, it would have to have an index number-say it were Blue 
Program # X. This assumption is expressed by writing 
Equation (2) ... 
Bluediag [N] = Blueprogram{# X} [N] 
But there is an inconsistency between the equations (1) and (2). It becomes 
apparent at the moment we try to calculate the value of Bluediag [X], for 
we can do so by letting N take the value of X in either of the two equations. 
If we substitute into equation (1), we get: 
Bluediag [X] = 1 + Blueprogram{ # X} [ X] 
But if we substitute into equation (2) instead, we get: 
Bluediag [X] = Blueprogram{# X} [X] 
Now Bluediag [X] cannot be equal to a number and also to the successor of 
that number. But that is what the two equations say. So we will have to go 
back and erase some assumption on which the inconsistency is based. The 
only possible candidate for erasure is the assumption expressed by Equa-
tion (2): that the function Bluediag [N] is able to be coded up as a Blue 
BlooP program. And that is the proof that Bluediag lies outside the realm of 
primitive recursive functions. Thus, we have achieved our aim of destroying 
Achilles' cherished but na·ive notion that every number-theoretical function 
must be calculable within a predictable number of steps. 
There are some subtle things going on here. You might ponder this, 
for instance: the number of steps involved in the calculation of 
Bluediag [N], for each specific value of N, is predictable-but the different 
methods of prediction cannot all be united into a general recipe for predict-
420 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 

ing the length of calculation of B luediag [N]. This is an "infinite conspira-
cy", related to the Tortoise's notion of "infinite coincidences", and also to 
w-incompleteness. But we shall not trace out the relations in detail. 
Cantor's Original Diagonal Argument 
Why is this called a diagonal argument? The terminology comes from 
Cantor's original diagonal argument, upon which many other arguments 
(such as ours) have subsequently been based. To explain Cantor's original 
argument will take us a little off course, but it is worthwhile to do so. 
Cantor, too, was concerned with showing that some item is not in a certain 
list. Specifically, what Cantor wanted to show was that if a "directory" of 
real numbers were made, it would inevitably leave some real numbers 
out-so that actually, the notion of a complete directory of real numbers is a 
contradiction in terms. 
It must be understood that this pertains not just to directories of finite 
size, but also to directories of infinite size. It is a much deeper result than the 
statement "the number of reals is infinite, so of course they cannot be listed 
in a finite directory". The essence of Cantor's result is that there are (at 
least) two distinct types of infinity: one kind of infinity describes how many 
entries there can be in an infinite directory or table, and another describes 
how many real numbers there are (i.e., how many points there are on a line, 
or line segment)-and this latter is "bigger", in the sense that the real 
numbers cannot be squeezed into a table whose length is described by the 
former kind of infinity. So let us see how Cantor's argument involves the 
notion of diagonal, in a literal sense. 
Let us consider just real numbers between 0 and 1. Assume, for the 
sake of argument, that an infinite list could be given, in which each positive 
integer N is matched up with a real number r(N) between 0 and 1, and in 
which each real number between 0 and 1 occurs somewhere down the line. 
Since real numbers are given by infinite decimals, we can imagine that the 
beginning of the table might look as follows: 
r( 1): 
.1 
4 
1 
5 
9 
2 
6 
5 
3 
r(2): 
.3 
3 
3 
3 
3 
3 
3 
3 
3 
r(3): 
.7 
8 
2

r(4):

6 
2 
r(5): 
.5 
0 
0 
0 
0 
0 
0 
0 
0 
The digits that run down the diagonal are in boldface: 1,3,8,2,0, ... Now 
those diagonal digits are going to be used in making a special real number 
d, which is between 0 and 1 but which, we will see, is not in the list. To 
make d, you take the diagonal digits in order, and change each one of them 
to some other digit. When you prefix this sequence of digits by a decimal 
point, you have d. There are of course many ways of changing a digit to 
some other digit, and correspondingly many different d's. Suppose, for 
BlooP and AooP and GlooP 
421 

example, that we subtract 1 from the diagonal digits (with the convention that 1 
taken from 0 is 9). Then our number d will be: 
.0 2 7 
9 
Now, because of the way we constructed it, 
Hence, 
d's 1st digit is not the same as the 1st digit of r(l); 
d's 2nd digit is not the same as the 2nd digit of r(2); 
d's 3rd digit is not the same as the 3rd digit of r(3); 
... and so on. 
d is different from r(l); 
d is different from r(2); 
d is different from r(3); 
... and so on. 
In other words, d is not in the list' 
What Does a Diagonal Argument Prove? 
Now comes the crucial difference between Cantor's proof and our proof-
it is in the matter of what assumption to go back and undo. In Cantor's 
argument, the shaky assumption was that such a table could be drawn up. 
Therefore, the conclusion warranted by the construction of d is that no 
exhaustive table of reals can be drawn up after all-which amounts to 
saying that the set of integers is just not big enough to index the set of reals. 
On the other hand, in our proof, we know that the directory of Blue BlooP 
programs can be drawn up-the set of integers is big enough to index the 
set of Blue BlooP programs. So, we have to go back and retract some 
shakier idea which we used. And that idea is that Bluediag [N] is calculable 
by some program in BlooP. This is a subtle difference in the application of 
the diagonal method. 
It may become clearer if we apply it to the alleged "List of All Great 
Mathematicians" in the Dialogue-a more concrete example. The diagonal 
itself is "Dboups". If we perform the desired diagonal-subtraction, we will 
get "Cantor". Now two conclusions are possible. If you have an unshakable 
belief that the list is complete, then you must conclude that Cantor is not a 
Great Mathematician, for his name differs from all those on the list. On the 
other hand, if you have an unshakable belief that Cantor is a Great 
Mathematician, then you must conclude that the List of All Great 
Mathematicians is incomplete, for Cantor's name is not on the list! (Woe to 
those who have unshakable beliefs on both sides!) The former case corre-
sponds to our proof that Bluediag [N] is not primitive recursive; the latter 
case corresponds to Cantor's proof that the list of rea Is is incomplete. 
422

FIGURE 73. 
Georg Cantor. 
Cantor's proof uses a diagonal in the literal sense of the word. Other 
"diagonal" proofs are based on a more general notion, which is abstracted 
from the geometric sense of the word. The essence of the diagonal method 
is the fact of using one integer in two different ways-or, one could say, 
using one integer on two different levels-thanks to which one can construct an 
item which is outside of some predetermined list. One time, the integer 
serves as a vertical index, the other time as a horizontal index. In Cantor's 
construction this is very clear. As for the function Bluediag [N], it involves 
using one integer on two different levels-first, as a Blue Program index 
number; and second, as an input parameter. 
The Insidious Repeatability of the Diagonal Argument 
At first, the Cantor argument may seem less than fully convincing. Isn't 
there some way to get around it? Perhaps by throwing in the diagonally 
constructed number d, one might obtain an exhaustive list. If you consider 
this idea, you will see it helps not a bit to throw in the number d, for as soon 
as you assign it a specific place in the table, the diagonal method becomes 
applicable to the new table, and a new missing number d' can be con-
structed, which is not in the new table. No matter how many times you 
repeat the operation of constructing a number by the diagonal method and 
then throwing it in to make a "more complete" table, you still are caught on 
the ineradicable hook of Cantor's method. You might even try to build a 
table of reals which tries to outwit the Cantor diagonal method by taking 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
423 

the whole trick, lock, stock, and barrel, including its insidious repeatability, 
into account somehow. It is an interesting exercise. But if you tackle it, you 
will see that no matter how you twist and turn trying to avoid the Cantor 
"hook", you are still caught on it. One might say that any self-proclaimed 
"table of all reals" is hoist by its own petard. 
The repeatability of Cantor's diagonal method is similar to the re-
peatability of the Tortoise's diabolic method for breaking the Crab's 
phonographs, one by one, as they got more and more "hi-fi" and-at least 
so the Crab hoped-more "Perfect". This method involves constructing, 
for each phonograph, a particular song which that phonograph cannot 
reproduce. It is not a coincidence that Cantor's trick and the Tortoise's 
trick share this curious repeatability; indeed, the Contracrostipunctus might 
well have been named "Cantorcrostipunctus" instead. Moreover, as the 
Tortoise subtly hinted to the innocent Achilles, the events in the Contracros-
tipunctus are a paraphrase of the construction which Godel used in proving 
his Incompleteness Theorem; it follows that the Godel construction is also 
very much like a diagonal construction. This will become quite apparent in 
the next two Chapters. 
From BlooP to FlooP 
We have now defined the class of primitive recursive functions and primi-
tive recursive properties of natural numbers by means of programs written 
in the language BlooP. We have also shown that BlooP doesn't capture all 
the functions of natural numbers which we can define in words. We even 
constructed an "unBlooPable" function, Bluediag [N], by Cantor's diagonal 
method. What is it about BlooP that makes Bluediag unrepresentable in it? 
How could BlooP be improved so that Bluediag became representable? 
BlooP's defining feature was the boundedness of its loops. What if we 
drop that requirement on loops, and invent a second language, called 
"FlooP" ('F' for "free")? FlooP will be identical to BlooP except in one 
respect: we may have loops without ceilings, as well as loops with ceilings 
(although the only reason one would include a ceiling when writing a 
loop-statement in FlooP would be for the sake of elegance). These new 
loops will be called MU-LOOPS. This follows the convention of mathemati-
cal logic, in which "free" searches (searches without bounds) are usually 
indicated by a symbol called a "JL-operator" (mu-operator). Thus, loop-
statements in FlooP may look like this: 
MU-LOOP: 
BLOCK n: BEGIN 
BLOCK n: END; 
424 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 

This feature will allow us to write tests in FlooP for such properties as 
wondrousness and the Tortoise property-tests which we did not know 
how to program in BlooP because of the potential open-ended ness of the 
searches involved. I shall leave it to interested readers to write a FlooP test 
for wondrousness which does the following things: 
(1) 
If its input, N, is wondrous, the program halts and gives the 
answer YES. 
(2) 
If N is unwondrous, but causes a closed cycle other than 
1-4-2-1-4-2-1- ... , the program halts and gives the answer 
NO. 
(3) 
If N is unwondrous, and causes an "endlessly rising progres-
sion", the program never halts. This is FlooP's way of answer-
ing by not answering. FlooP's nonanswer bears a strange 
resemblance to joshli's nonanswer "MU". 
The irony of case 3 is that OUTPUT always has the value NO, but it is always 
inaccessible, since the program is still grinding away. That troublesome 
third alternative is the price that we must pay for the right to write free 
loops. In all FlooP programs incorporating the MU-LOOP option, nonter-
mination will always be one theoretical alternative. Of course there will be 
many FlooP programs which actually terminate for all possible input val-
ues. For instance, as I mentioned earlier, it is suspected by most people who 
have studied wondrousness that a FlooP program such as suggested above 
will always terminate, and moreover with the answer YES each time. 
Terminating and Nonterminating FlooP Programs 
It would seem extremely desirable to be able to separate FlooP procedures 
into two classes: terminators and nonterminators. A terminator will eventually 
halt no matter what its input, despite the "MU-ness" of its loops. A nonter-
minator will go on and on forever, for at least one choice of input. If we 
could always tell, by some kind of complicated inspection of a FlooP 
program, to which class it belonged, there would be some remarkable 
repercussions (as we shall shortly see). Needless to say, the operation of 
class-checking would itself have to be a terminating operation-otherwise 
one would gain nothing! 
Turing's Trickery 
The idea springs to mind that we might let a BlooP procedure do the 
inspection. But BlooP procedures only accept numerical input, not pro-
grams! However, we can get around that ... by coding programs into 
numbers! This sly trick is just Godel-numbering in another of its many 
manifestations. Let the fifty-six characters of the FlooP alphabet get the 
"codons" 901, 902, ... ,956, respectively. So each FlooP program now gets 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 
42& 

a very long Godel number. For instance, the shortest BlooP function (which 
is also a terminating FlooP program)-
DEFINE PROCEDURE "A" [B]: 
BLOCK 0: BEGIN 
BLOCK 0: END. 
-would get the Godel number partially shown below: 
904,905,906,909,914,905, ........... ,905,914,904,955, 
DE FIN E 
END 
Now our scheme would be to write a BlooP test called TERMINATOR? 
which says YES if its input number codes for a terminating FlooP program, 
NO if not. This way we could hand the task over to a machine and with 
luck, distinguish terminators from nonterminators. However, an ingen-
ious argument given by Alan Turing shows that no BlooP program can 
make this distinction infallibly. The trick is actually much the same as 
Godel's trick, and therefore closely related to the Cantor diagonal trick. We 
shall not give it here-suffice it to say that the idea is to feed the termina-
tion tester its own Godel number. This is not so simple, however, for it is 
like trying to quote an entire sentence inside itself. You have to quote the 
quote, and so forth; it seems to lead to an infinite regress. However, Turing 
figured out a trick for feeding a program its own Godel number. A solution 
to the same problem in a different context will be presented next Chapter. 
In the present Chapter, we shall take a different route to the same goal, 
which is namely to prove that a termination tester is impossible. For readers 
who wish to see an elegant and simple presentation of the Turing ap-
proach, I recommend the article by Hoare and Allison, mentioned in the 
Bibliography. 
A Termination Tester Would Be Magical 
Before we destroy the notion, let us delineate just why having a termination 
tester would be a remarkable thing. In a sense, it would be like having a 
magical dowsing rod which could solve all problems of number theory in 
one swell FlooP. Suppose, for instance, that we wished to know if the 
Goldbach Variation is a true conjecture or not. That is, do all numbers have 
the Tortoise property? We would begin by writing a FlooP test called 
TORTOISE? which checks whether its input has the Tortoise property. Now 
the defect of this procedure-namely that it doesn't terminate if the Tor-
toise property is absent-here turns into a virtue! For now we run the 
termination tester on the procedure TORTOISE? If it says YES, that means 
that TORTOISE? terminates for all values of its input-in other words, all 
numbers have the Tortoise property. If it says NO, then we know there 
exists a number which has the Achilles property. The irony is that we never 
actually use the program TORTOISE? at all-we just inspect it! 
This idea of solving any problem in number theory by coding it into a 
426 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 

program and then waving a termination tester over the program is not 
unlike the idea of testing a koan for genuineness by coding it into a folded 
string and then running a test for Buddha-nature on the string instead. As 
Achilles suggested, perhaps the desired information lies "closer to the 
surface" in one representation than in another. 
Pool F, Index Numbers, and Green Programs 
Well, enough daydreaming. How can we prove that the termination tester 
is impossible? Our argument for its impossibility will hinge on trying to 
apply the diagonal argument to FlooP,just as we did to BlooP. We shall see 
that there are some subtle and crucial differences between the two cases. 
As we did for BlooP, imagine the pool of all FlooP programs. We shall 
call it "Pool F". Then perform the same three filtering operations on Pool 
F, so that you get, in the end: 
A complete pool of all call-less FlooP programs which calculate 
functions of exactly one input parameter. 
Let us call these special FlooP-programs Green Programs (since they may go 
forever). 
Now just as we assigned index numbers to all Blue Programs, we can 
assign index numbers to Green Programs, by ordering them in a catalogue, 
each volume of which contains all Green Programs of a fixed length, 
arranged in alphabetical order. 
So far, the carry-over from BlooP to FlooP has been straightforward. 
Now let us see if we can also carryover the last part: the diagonal trick. 
What if we try to define a diagonal function? 
Greendiag [N] = 1 + Greenprogram{#N} [N] 
Suddenly, there is a snag: this function Greendiag [N] may not have a 
well-defined output value for all input values N. This is simply because we 
have not filtered out the nonterminator programs from Pool F, and there-
fore we have no guarantee that we can calculate Greendiag [N] for all values 
of N. Sometimes we may enter calculations which never terminate. And the 
diagonal argument cannot be carried through in such a case, for it depends 
on the diagonal function having a value for all possible inputs. 
The Termination Tester Gives Us Red Programs 
To remedy this, we would have to make use of a termination tester, if one 
existed. So let us deliberately introduce the shaky assumption that one 
exists, and let us use it as our fourth filter. We run down the list of Green 
Programs, eliminating one by one all nonterminators, so that in the end we 
are left with: 
BlooP and FlooP and GlooP 
427 

A complete pool of all call-less FlooP programs which calculate 
functions of exactly one input parameter, and which terminate for 
all values of their input. 
Let us call these special FlooP programs Red Programs (since they all must 
stop). Now, the diagonal argument will go through. We define 
Reddiag [N] = 1 + Redprogram{#N} [N] 
and in an exact parallel to Bluediag. we are forced to conclude that Red-
diag [N] is a well-defined, calculable function of one variable which is not in 
the catalogue of Red Programs, and is hence not even calculable in the 
powerful language FlooP. Perhaps it is time to move on to GlooP? 
GlooP .. . 
Yes, but what is GlooP? If FlooP is BlooP unchained, then GlooP must be 
FlooP unchained. But how can you take the chains off twice? How do you 
make a language whose power transcends that of FlooP? In Reddiag, we 
have found a function whose values we humans know how to calculate-the 
method of doing so has been explicitly described in English-but which 
seemingly cannot be programmed in the language FlooP. This is a serious 
dilemma because no one has ever found any more powerful computer 
language than FlooP. 
Careful investigation into the power of computer languages has been 
carried out. We need not do it ourselves; let it just be reported that there is 
a vast class of computer languages all of which can be proven to have exactly 
the same expressive power as FlooP does, in this sense: any calculation which 
can be programmed in anyone of the languages can be programmed in 
them all. The curious thing is that almost any sensible attempt at designing 
a computer language ends up by creating a member of this class-which is 
to say, a language of power equal to that of FlooP. It takes some doing to 
invent a reasonably interesting computer language which is weaker than 
those in this class. BlooP is, of course, an example of a weaker language, but 
it is the exception rather than the rule. The point is that there are some 
extremely natural ways to go about inventing algorithmic languages; and 
different people, following independent routes, usually wind up creating 
equivalent languages, with the only difference being style, rather than 
power. 
... Is a Myth 
In fact, it is widely believed that there cannot be any more powerful 
language for describing calculations than languages that are equivalent to 
FlooP. This hypothesis was formulated in the 1930's by two people, inde-
pendently of each other: Alan Turing-about whom we will say more 
later-and Alonzo Church, one of the eminent logicians of this century. It 
428 
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 

is called the Church-Turing Thesis. If we accept the CT-Thesis, we have to 
conclude that "GlooP" is a myth-there are no restrictions to remove in 
FlooP, no ways to increase its power by "unshackling" it, as we did BlooP. 
This puts us in the uncomfortable position of asserting that people can 
calculate Reddiag [N] for any value of N, but there is no way to program a 
computer to do so. For, if it could be done at all, it could be done in 
FlooP-and by construction, it can't be done in FlooP. This conclusion is so 
peculiar that it should cause us to investigate very carefully the pillars on 
which it rests. And one of them, you will recall, was our shaky assumption 
that there is a decision procedure which can tell terminating from nonter-
minating FlooP programs. The idea of such a decision procedure already 
seemed suspect, when we saw that its existence would allow all problems of 
number theory to be solved in a uniform way. Now we have double the 
reason for believing that any termination test is a myth-that there is no 
way to put FlooP programs in a centrifuge and separate out the terminators 
from the nonterminators. 
Skeptics might maintain that this is nothing like a rigorous proof that 
such a termination test doesn't exist. That is a valid objection; however, the 
Turing approach demonstrates more rigorously that no computer pro-
gram can be written in a language of the FlooP class which can perform a 
termination test on all FlooP programs. 
The Church-Turing Thesis 
Let us come back briefly to the Church-Turing Thesis. We will talk about 
it-and variations on it-in considerable detail in Chapter XVII; for now it 
will suffice to state it in a couple of versions, and postpone discussion of its 
merits and meanings until then. Here, then, are three related ways to state 
the CT -Thesis: 
(1) 
What is human-computable is machine-computable. 
(2) 
What is machine-computable is FlooP-computable. 
(3) 
What is human-computable is FlooP-computable 
(i.e., general or partial recursive). 
Terminology: General and Partial Recursive 
We have made a rather broad survey, in this Chapter, of some notions from 
number theory and their relations to the theory of computable functions. It 
is a very wide and flourishing field, an intriguing blend of computer science 
and modern mathematics. We should not conclude this Chapter without 
introducing the standard terminology for the notions we have been dealing 
with. 
As has already been mentioned, "Bloop-computable" is synonymous 
with "primitive recursive". Now FlooP-computable functions can be di-
BlooP and F100P and GlooP 
429 

vided into two realms: (1) those which are computable by terminating FlooP 
programs: these are said to be general recursive; and (2) those which are 
computable only by nonterminating FlooP programs: these are said to be 
partial recursive. (Similarly for predicates.) People often just say "recursive" 
when they mean "general recursive". 
The Power of TNT 
It is interesting that TNT is so powerful that not only are all primitive 
recursive predicates represented, but moreover all general recursive predi-
cates are represented. We shall not prove either of these facts, because such 
proofs would be superfluous to our aim, which is to show that TNT is 
incomplete. If TNT could not represent some primitive or general recur-
sive predicates, then it would be incomplete in an uninteresting way-so we 
might as well assume that it can, and then show that it is incomplete in an 
interesting way.

Air on G's String 
The Tortoise and Achilles have just completed a tour of a porridge factory. 
Achilles: 
You don't mind if I change the subject, do you? 
Tortoise: 
Be my guest. 
Achilles: 
Very well, then. It concerns an obscene phone call I received a 
few days ago. 
Tortoise: 
Sounds interesting. 
Achilles: 
Yes. Well-the problem was that the caller was incoherent, at 
least as far as I could tell. He shouted something over the line and then 
hung up-or rather, now that I think of it, he shouted something, 
shouted it again, and then hung up. 
Tortoise: 
Did you catch what that thing was? 
Achilles: 
Well, the whole call went like this: 
Myself: 
Hello? 
Caller (shouting wildly): 
Yields falsehood when preceded 
by its quotation! Yields falsehood when preceded by 
its quotation! 
(Click.) 
Tortoise: 
That is a most unusual thing to say to somebody on an obscene 
phone call. 
Achilles: 
Exactly how it struck me. 
Tortoise: 
Perhaps there was some meaning to that seeming madness. 
Achilles: 
Perhaps. 
(They enter a spacious courtyard framed by some charming three-story 
stone houses. At its center stands a palm tree, and to one side is a tower. 
Near the tower there is a staircase where a boy sits, talking to a young 
woman in a window.) 
Tortoise: 
Where are you taking me, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
I would like to show you the pretty view from the top of this 
tower. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, how nice. 
(They approach the boy, who watches them with curiosity, then says some-
thing to the young woman-they both chuckle. Achilles and Mr. T, instead 
of going up the boy's staircase, turn left and head down a short flight of 
stairs which leads to a small wooden door.) 
Achilles: 
We can just step inside right here. Follow me.

431 

FIGURE 74. 
Above and Below, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1947). 

(Achilles opens the door. They enter, and begin climbing the steep helical 
staircase inside the tower.) 
Tortoise (puffing slightly): 
I'm a little out of shape for this sort of exercise, 
Achilles. How much further do we have to go? 
Achilles: 
Another few flights ... but I have an idea. Instead of walking on 
the top side of these stairs, why don't you walk on the underside? 
Tortoise: 
How do I do THAT? 
Achilles: Just hold on tightly, and climb around underneath-there's 
room enough for you. You'll find that the steps make just as much 
sense from below as from above ... 
Tortoise (gingerly shifting himself about): 
Am I doing it right? 
Achilles: 
You've got it! 
Tortoise (his voice slightly mufJled): 
Say-this little maneuver has got me 
confused. Should I head upstairs or downstairs, now? 
Achilles: Just continue heading in the same direction as you were before. 
On your side of the staircase, that means go DOWN, on mine it means 
UP. 
Tortoise: 
Now you're not going to tell me that I can get to the top of the 
tower by going down, are you? 
Achilles: 
I don't know, but it works ... 
(And so they begin spiraling in synchrony, with A always on one side, and 
T matching him on the other side. Soon they reach the end of the staircase.) 
Now just undo the maneuver, Mr. T. Here-let me help you up. 
(He lends an arm to the Tortoise, and hoists him back to the other side of the 
stairs.) 
Tortoise: 
Thanks. It was a little easier getting back up. 
(And they step out onto the roof, overlooking the town.) 
That's a lovely view, Achilles. I'm glad you brought me up here-or 
rather, DOWN here. 
Achilles: 
I figured you'd enjoy it. 
Tortoise: 
I've been thinking about that obscene phone call. I think I un-
derstand it a little better now. 
Achilles: 
You do? Would you tell me about it? 
Tortoise: 
Gladly. Do you perchance feel, as I do, that that phrase "pre-
ceded by its quotation" has a slightly haunting quality about it? 
Achilles: 
Slightly, yes-extremely slightly. 
Tortoise: 
Can you imagine something preceded by its quotation? 
Achilles: 
I guess I can conjure up an image of Chairman Mao walking into 
a banquet room in which there already haQgs a large banner with some 
of his own writing on it. Here would be Chairman Mao, preceded by 
his quotation. 
Tortoise: 
A most imaginative example. But suppose we restrict the word 
Air on G's String 
433 

"preceded" to the idea of precedence on a printed sheet, rather than 
elaborate entries into a banquet room. 
Achilles: 
All right. But what exactly do you mean by "quotation" here? 
Tortoise: 
When you discuss a word or a phrase, you conventionally put it 
in quotes. For example, I can say, 
The word "philosopher" has five letters. 
Here, I put "philosopher" in quotes to show that I am speaking about 
the WORD "philosopher" rather than about a philosopher in the flesh. 
This is called the USE-MENTION distinction. 
Achilles: 
Oh? 
Tortoise: 
Let me explain. Suppose I were to say to you, 
Philosophers make lots of money. 
Here, I would be USING the word to manufacture an image in your 
mind of a 'twinkle-eyed sage with bulging moneybags. But when I put 
this word-or any word-in quotes, I subtract out its meaning and 
connotation~, and am left only with some marks on paper, or some 
sounds. That is called "MENTION". Nothing about the word matters, 
other than its typographical aspects-any meaning it might have is 
ignored. 
Achilles: It reminds me of using a violin as a fly swatter. Or should I say 
"mentioning"? Nothing about the violin matters, other than its 
solidity-any meaning or function it might have is being ignored. 
Come to think of it, I guess the fly is being treated that way, too. 
Tortoise: 
Those are sensible, if shghtly unorthodox, extensions of the 
use-mention distinction. But now, I want you to think about preceding 
something by its own quotation. 
Achilles: 
All right. Would this be correct? 
Tortoise: 
Achilles: 
"HUBB'\''' HUBBA 
Good. Try another. 
All right. 
"'PLOP' IS NOT THE TITLE OF ANY BOOK, SO FAR AS I KNOW" 
'PLOP' IS NOT THE TITLE OF A~Y BOOK, SO FAR AS I KNOW. 
Tortoise: 
Now this example can be modified into quite an interesting 
specimen, simply by dropping 'Plop'. 
Achilles: 
Really? Let me see what you mean. It becomes 
"IS NOT THE TITLE OF ANY BOOK, SO FAR AS I KNOW" 
IS NOT THE TITLE OF ANY BOOK, SO FAR AS I KNOW. 
Tortoise: 
You see, you have made a sentence. 
Achilles: 
So I have. It is a sentence about the phrase "is not the title of any 
book, so far as I know", and quite a silly one, too. 
Tortoise: 
Why silly? 
434 
Air on C's String 

Achilles: 
Because it's so pointless. Here's another one for you: 
"WILL BE BOYS" WILL BE BOYS. 
Now what does that mean? Honestly, what a silly game. 
Tortoise: 
Not to my mind. It's very earnest stuff, in my opinion. In fact this 
operation of preceding some phrase by its quotation is so overwhelm-
ingly imp(')rtant that I think I'll give it a name. 
Achilles: 
You will? What name will you dignify that silly operation by? 
Tortoise: 
I believe I'll call it "to quine a phrase", to quine a phrase. 
Achilles: 
"Quine"? What sort of word is that? 
Tortoise: 
A five-letter word, if I'm not in error. 
Achilles: 
What I was driving at is why you picked those exact five letters in 
that exact order. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, now I understand what you meant when you asked me 
"What sort of word is that?" The answer is that a philosopher by the 
name of "Willard Van Orman Quine" invented the operation, so I 
name it in his honor. However, I cannot go any further than this in my 
explanation. Why these particular five letters make up his name-not 
to mention why they occur in this particular order-is a question to 
which I have no ready answer. However, I'd be perfectly willing to go 
and-
Achilles: 
Please don't bother! I didn't really want to know everything about 
Quine's name. Anyway, now I know how to quine a phrase. It's quite 
amusing. Here's a quined phrase: 
"IS A SENTENCE FRAGMENT" IS A SENTENCE FRAGMENT. 
It's silly but all the same I enjoy it. You take a sentence fragment, quine 
it, and 10 and behold, you've made a sentence! A true sentence, in this 
case. 
Tortoise: 
How about quining the phrase "is a king with no subject"? 
Achilles: 
A king without a subject would be-
Tortoise: -an anomaly, of course. Don't wander from the point. Let's 
have quines first, and kings afterwards! 
Achilles: 
I'm to quine that phrase, am I? All right-
"IS A KING WITH NO SUBJECT" IS A KING WITH NO SUBJECT. 
It seems to me that it might make more sense if it said "sentence" 
instead of "king". Oh, well. Give me another! 
Tortoise: 
All'right-just one more. Try this one: 
"WHEN QUI NED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE SONG" 
Achilles: 
That should be easy ... I'd say the quining gives this: 
"WHEN QUI NED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE SONG" 
WHEN QUINED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE SONG. 
Hmm ... There's something just a little peculiar here. Oh, I see what it 
is! The sentence is talking about itself! Do you see that? 
Air on G's String 
435 

Tortoise: 
What do you mean? Sentences can't talk. 
Achilles: 
No, but they REFER to things-and this one refers directly-
unambiguously-unmistakably-to the very sentence which it is! You 
just have to think back and remember what quining is all about. 
Tortoise: 
I don't see it saying anything about itself. Where does it say "me", 
or "this sentence", or the like? 
Achilles: 
Oh, you are being deliberately thick-skulled. The beauty of it lies 
in just that: it talks about itself without having to come right out and 
say so! 
Tortoise: 
Well, as I'm such a simple fellow, could you just spell it all out for 
me? 
Achilles: 
Oh, he is such a Doubting Tortoise ... All right, let me see ... 
Suppose I make up a sentence~I'll call it "Sentence P"-with a blank 
in it. 
Tortoise: 
Such as? 
Achilles: 
Such as ... 
" __ 
, WHEN QUI NED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE SONG". 
Now the subject matter of Sentence P depends on how you fill in the 
blank. But once you've chosen how to fill in the blank, then the subject 
matter is determined: it is the phrase which you get by QUINING the 
blank. Call that "Sentence Q", since it is produced by an act of quining. 
Tortoise: 
That makes sense. If the blank phrase were "is written on old jars 
of mustard to keep them fresh", then Sentence Q would have to be 
"IS WRITTEN ON OLD JARS OF MUSTARD TO KEEP THEM FRESH" 
IS WRITTEN ON OLD JARS OF MUSTARD TO KEEP THEM FRESH. 
Achilles: 
True, and Sentence P makes the claim (though whether it is valid 
or not, I do not know) that Sentence Q is a Tortoise's love song. In any 
case, Sentence P here is not talking about itself, but rather about 
Sentence Q. Can we agree on that much? 
Tortoise: 
By all means, let us agree-and what a beautiful song it is, too. 
Achilles: 
But now I want to make a different choice for the blank, namely: 
"WHEN QUINED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE SONG". 
Tortoise: 
Oh, heavens, you're getting a little involved here. I hope this all 
isn't going to be too highbrow for my modest mind. 
Achilles: 
Oh, don't worry-you'll surely catch on. With this choice, Sen-
tence Q becomes ... 
"WHEN QUI NED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE-SONG" 
WHEN QUI NED, YIELDS A TORTOISE'S LOVE-SONG. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, you wily old warrior you, I catch on. Now Sentence Q is just 
the same as Sentence P. 
Achilles: 
And since Sentence Q is always the topic of Sentence P, there is a 
loop, so now, P points back to itself. But you see, the self-reference is a 
436 
Air on C's String 

sort of accident. Usually Sentences Q and P are entirely unlike each 
other; but with the right choice for the blank in Sentence P, quining 
will do this magic trick for you. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, how clever. I wonder why I never thought of that myself. 
Now tell me: is the following sentence self-referential? 
"IS COMPOSED OF FIVE WORDS" IS COMPOSED OF FIVE WORDS. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... I can't quite tell. The sentence which you just gave is 
not really about itself, but rather about the phrase "is composed of five 
words". Though, of course, that phrase is PART of the sentence ... 
Tortoise: 
So the sentence refers to some part of itself-so what? 
Achilles: 
Well, wouldn't that qualify as self-reference, too? 
Tortoise: 
In my opinion, that is still a far cry from true self-reference. But 
don't worry too much about these tricky matters. You'll have ample 
time to think about them in the future. 
Achilles: 
I will? 
Tortoise: 
Indeed you will. But for now, why don't you try quining the 
phrase "yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation"? 
Achilles: 
I see what you're getting at-that old obscene phone call. Quin-
ing it produces the following: 
"YIELDS FALSEHOOD WHEN PRECEDED BY ITS QUOTATION" 
YIELDS FALSEHOOD WHEN PRECEDED BY ITS QUOTATION. 
SO this is what that caller was saying! Ijust couldn't make out where the 
quotation marks were as he spoke. That certainly is an obscene re-
mark! People ought to be jailed for saying things like that! 
Tortoise: 
Why in the world? 
Achilles: It just makes me very uneasy. Unlike the earlier examples, I can't 
quite make out if it is a truth or a falsehood. And the more I think 
about it, the more I can't unravel it. It makes my head spin. I wonder 
what kind of a lunatic mind would make something like that up, and 
torment innocent people in the night with it? 
Tortoise: 
I wonder ... Well, shall we go downstairs now? 
Achilles: 
We needn't go down-we're at ground level already. Let's go 
back inside-you'll see. (They go into the tower, and come to a small wooden 
door.) We can just step outside right here. Follow me. 
Tortoise: 
Are you sure? I don't want to fall three floors and break my shell. 
Achilles: 
Would I fool you? 
(And he opens the door. In front of them sits, to all appearances, the same 
boy, talking to the same young woman. Achilles and Mr. T walk up what 
seem to be the same stairs they walked down to enter the tower, and find 
themselves in what looks like just the same courtyard they first came into.) 
Thank you, Mr. T, for your lucid clarification of that obscene tele-
phone call. 
Tortoise: 
And thank you, Achilles, for the pleasant promenade. I hope we 
meet again soon.

CHAPTER XIV 
On Formally Undecidable 
Propositions of TNT 
and Related Systems l 
The Two Ideas of the "Oyster" 
THIS CHAPTER'S TITLE is an adaptation of the title of Godel's famous 
1931 paper-"TNT" having been substituted for "Principia Mathematica". 
Godel's paper was a technical one, concentrating on making his proof 
watertight and rigorous; this Chapter will be more intuitive, and in it I will 
stress the two key ideas which are at the core of the proof. The first key idea 
is the deep discovery that there are strings of TNT which can be interpret-
ed as speaking about other strings of TNT; in short, that TNT, as a 
language, is capable of "introspection", or self-scrutiny. This is what comes 
from Godel-numbering. The second key idea is that the property of self-
scrutiny can be entirely concentrated into a single string; thus that string's 
sole focus of attention is itself. This "focusing trick" is traceable, in essence, 
to the Cantor diagonal method. 
In my opinion, if one is interested in understanding Godel's proof in a 
deep way, then one must recognize that the proof, in its essence, consists of 
a fusion of these two main ideas. Each of them alone is a master stroke; to 
put them together took an act of genius. If I were to choose, however, 
which of the two key ideas is deeper, I would unhesitatingly pick the first 
one-the idea of Godel-numbering, for that idea is related to the whole 
notion of what meaning and reference are, in symbol-manipulating sys-
tems. This is an idea which goes far beyond the confines of mathematical 
logic, whereas the Cantor trick, rich though it is in mathematical conse-
quences, has little if any relation to issues in real life. 
The First Idea: Proof-Pairs 
Without further ado, then, let us proceed to the elaboration of the proof 
itself. We have already given a fairly careful notion of what the Godel 
isomorphism is about, in Chapter IX. We now shall describe a mathemati-
cal notion which allows us to translate a statement such as "The string 0=0 
is a theorem of TNT" into a statement of number theory. This will involve 
the notion of proof-pairs. A proof-pair is a pair of natural numbers related 
in a particular way. Here is the idea: 
438 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

Two natural numbers, m and n respectively, form a TNT-
proof-pair if and only if m is the Godel number of a TNT-
derivation whose bottom line is the string with Godel number n. 
The analogous notion exists with respect to the MI U-system, and it is a little 
easier on the intuition to consider that case first. So, for a moment, let us 
back off from TNT-proof-pairs, and look at MIU-proof-pairs. Their 
definition is parallel: 
Two natural numbers, m and n respectively, form a MIU-proof-
pair if and only if m is the Godel number of a MIU-system 
derivation whose bottom line is the string with Godel number n. 
Let us see a couple of examples involving MIU-proof-pairs. First, let 
m = 3131131111301, n = 301. These values of m and n do indeed form a 
MIU-proof-pair, because m is the Godel number of the MIU-derivation 
Ml 
Mil 
Mllli 
MUI 
whose last line is MUl, having Godel number 301, which is n. By contrast, 
let m = 31311311130, and n = 30. Why do these two values not form a 
MIU-proof-pair? To see the answer, let us write out the alleged derivation 
which m codes for: 
Ml 
Mil 
Mlll 
MU 
There is an invalid step in this alleged derivation! It is the step from the 
second to the third line: from Mil to Mill. There is no rule of inference in 
the MIU-system which permits such 
a 
typographical step. 
Correspondingly-and this is most crucial-there is no arithmetical rule of 
inference which carries you from 311 to 3111. This is perhaps a trivial 
observation, in light of our discussion in Chapter IX, yet it is at the heart of 
the Godel isomorphism. What we do in any formal system has its parallel in 
arithmetical manipulations. 
In any case, the values m = 31311311130, n = 30 certainly do not 
form a MIU-proof-pair. This in itself does not imply that 30 is not a 
MIU-number. There could be another value of m which forms a MIU-
proof-pair with 30. (Actually, we know by earlier reasoning that MU is not a 
MIU-theorem, and therefore no number at all can form a MIU-proof-pair 
with 30.) 
Now what about TNT-proof-pairs? Here are two parallel examples, 
one being merely an alleged TNT-proof-pair, the other being a valid 
TNT-proof-pair. Can you spot which is which? (Incidentally, here is where 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
439 

the '611' codon comes in. Its purpose is to separate the Godel numbers of 
successive lines in a TNT-derivation. In that sense, '611' serves as a punctu-
ation mark. In the MIU-system, the initial '3' of all lines is sufficient-no 
extra punctuation is needed.) 
(I) 
m = 626,262,636,223,123,262,111,666,611 ,223,123,666, 111,666 
n = 123,666,111,666 
(2) 
m = 626,262,636,223, 123,262,111.666,611 ,223,333,262,636,123,262,111,666 
n = 223,333,262,636,123,262,111,666 
It is quite simple to tell which one is which, simply by translating back to the 
old notation, and making some routine examinations to see 
(1) 
whether the alleged derivation coded for by m is actually a 
legitimate derivation; 
(2) 
if so, whether the last line of the derivation coincides with the 
string which n codes for. 
Step 2 is trivial; and step 1 is also utterly straightforward, in this sense: 
there are no open-ended searches involved, no hidden endless loops. 
Think of the examples above involving the MIU-system, and now just 
mentally substitute the rules of TNT for the MIU-system's rules, and the 
axioms of TNT for the MIU-system's one axiom. The algorithm in both 
cases is the same. Let me make that algorithm explicit: 
Go down the lines in the derivation one by one. 
Mark those which are axioms. 
For each line which is not an axiom, check whether it follows by 
any of the rules of inference from earlier lines in the alleged 
derivation. 
If all nonaxioms follow by rules of inference from earlier lines, 
then you have a legitimate derivation; otherwise it is a phony 
derivation. 
At each stage, there is a clear set of tasks to perform, and the number of 
them is quite easily determinable in advance. 
Proof-Pair-ness Is Primitive Recursive 
The reason I am stressing the boundedness of these loops is, as you may 
have sensed, that I am about to as~ert 
FUNDAMENTAL FACT 1: 
The property of being a proof-pair is a 
primitive recursive number-theoretical property, and can there-
fore be tested for by a BlooP program. 
There is a notable contrast to be made here with that other closely 
related number-theoretical property: that of being a theorem-number. To 
440 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

assert that n is a theorem-number is to assert that some value of m exists 
which forms a proof-pair with n. (Incidentally, these comments apply 
equally well to TNT and to the MIU-system; it may perhaps help to keep 
both in mind, the MIU-system serving as a prototype.) To check whether n 
is a theorem-number, you must embark on a search through all its potential 
proof-pair "partners" m-and here you may be getting into an endless 
chase. No one can say how far you will have to look to find a number which 
forms a proof-pair with n as its second element. That is the whole problem 
of having lengthening and shortening rules in the same system: they lead to 
a certain degree of unpredictability. 
The example of the Goldbach Variation may prove helpful at this 
point. It is trivial to test whether a pair of numbers (m,n) form a Tortoise-
pair: that is to say, both m and n + m should be prime. The test is easy 
because the property of primeness is primitive recursive: it admits of a 
predictably terminating test. But if we want to know whether n possesses 
the Tortoise property, then we are asking, "Does any number m form a 
Tortoise-pair with n as its second element?"-and this, once again, leads us 
out into the wild, MU-loopy unknown . 
. . . And Is Therefore Represented in TNT 
The key concept at this juncture, then, is Fundamental Fact 1 given above, 
for from it we can conclude 
FUNDAMENTAL FACT 2: 
The property of forming a proof-pair is 
testable in BlooP, and consequently, it is represented in TNT by 
some formula having two free variables. 
Once again, we are being casual about specifying which system these 
proof-pairs are relative to; it really doesn't matter, for both Fundamental 
Facts hold for any formal system. That is the nature of formal systems: it is 
always possible to tell, in a predictably terminating way, whether a given 
sequence of lines forms a proof, or not-and this carries over to the 
corresponding arithmetical notions. 
The Power of Proof-Pairs 
Suppose we assume we are dealing with the MIU-system, for the sake of 
concreteness. You probably recall the string we called "MUMON", whose 
interpretation on one level was the statement "MU is a theorem of the 
MIU-system". We can show how MUMON would be expressed in TNT, in 
terms of the formula which represents the notion of MIU-proof-pairs. Let 
us abbreviate that formula, whose existence we are assured of by Funda-
mental Fact 2, this way: 
MlU-PROOF-PAlR{a,a'} 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
441 

Since it is a property of two numbers, it is represented by a formula with 
two free variables. (Note: In this Chapter we shall always use austere 
TNT-so be careful to distinguish between the variables a, a', a".) In order 
to assert "MU is a theorem of the MI U-system", we would have to make the 
isomorphic statement "30 is a theorem-number of the MIU-system", and 
then translate that into TNT -notation. With the aid of our abbreviation, 
this is easy (remember also from Chapter VIII that to indicate the replace-
ment of every a' by a numeral, we write that numeral followed by "la' "): 
3a:MI U-PROO F-PAl R{ a,SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSOI a'} 
Count the S's: there are 30. Note that this is a closed sentence of TNT, 
because one free variable was quantified, the other replaced by a numeraL 
A clever thing has been done here, by the way. Fundamental Fact 2 gave us 
a way to talk about proof-pairs; we have figured out how to talk about 
theorem-numbers, as well: you just add an existential quantifier in front! A 
more literal translation of the string above would be, "There exists some 
number a that forms a MIU-proof-pair with 30 as its second element". 
Suppose that we wanted to do something parallel with respect to 
TNT-say, to express the statement "0=0 is a theorem of TNT". We may 
abbreviate the formula which Fundamental Fact 2 assures us exists, in an 
analogous way (with two free variables, again): 
TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'} 
(The interpretation of this abbreviated TNT-formula is: "Natural numbers 
a and a' form a TNT-proof-pair.") The next step is to transform our 
statement into number theory, following the MUMON-model above. The 
statement becomes "There exists some number a which forms a TNT-
proof-pair with 666,111,666 as its second element". The TNT-formula 
which expresses this is: 
3a:TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,SSSSS ........ .sSSSSO/a'} 
-------------
many, many S's! 
(in fact, 666,111,666 of them) 
-a closed sentence of TNT. (Let us call it "jOSHO", for reasons to appear 
momentarily.) So you see that there is a way to talk not only about the 
primitive recursive notion of TNT -proof-pairs, but also about the related 
but trickier notion of TNT-theorem-numbers. 
To check your comprehension of these ideas, figure out how to trans-
late into TNT the following statements of meta-TNT: 
(1) 0=0 is not a theorem of T:\IT. 
(2) 
-0=0 is a theorem of TKT. 
(3) 
-0=0 is not a theorem of TNT. 
442 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

How do the solutions differ from the example done above, and from each 
other? Here are a few more translation exercises. 
(4) 
jOSHO is a theorem of TNT. (Call the TNT-string which 
expresses this "META-JOSHO".) 
(5) 
META-jOSHO is a theorem of TNT. (Call the TNT-string 
which expresses this "META-META-jOSHO".) 
(6) 
META-META-jOSHO is a theorem of TNT. 
(7) 
META-META-META-jOSHO is a theorem of TNT. 
(etc., etc.) 
Example 5 shows that statements of meta-met a-TNT can be translated into 
TNT-notation; example 6 does the same for meta-meta-meta-TNT, etc. 
It is important to keep in mind the difference between expressing a 
property, and representing it, at this point. The property of being a TNT-
theorem-number, for instance, is expressed by the formula 
3a:TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'} 
Translation: "a' is a TNT-theorem-number". However, we have no 
guarantee that this formula represents the notion, for we have no guarantee 
that this property is primitive recursive-in fact, we have more than a 
sneaking suspicion that it isn't. (This suspicion is well warranted. The 
property of being a TNT -theorem-number is not primitive recursive, and 
no TNT-formula can represent the property!) By contrast, the property of 
being a proof-pair, by virtue of its primitive recursivity, is both expressible 
and representable, by the formula already introduced. 
Substitution Leads to the Second Idea 
The preceding discussion got us to the point where we saw how TNT can 
"introspect" on the notion of TNT -theoremhood. This is the essence of the 
first part of the proof. We now wish to press on to the second major idea of 
the proof, by developing a notion which allows the concentration of this 
introspection into a single formula. To do this, we need to look at what 
happens to the Godel number of a formula when you modify the formula 
structurally in a simple way. In fact, we shall consider this specific modifica-
tion: 
replacement of all free variables by a specific numeral. 
Below are shown a couple of examples of this operation in the left-hand 
column, and in the right-hand column are exhibited the parallel changes in 
Godel numbers.

We now replace all

-3a:3a':a" =(SSa ·SSa') 
We now replace all 
free variables by 
the numeral for 4: 
223,333,262,636,333,262,163,636, 
262,163,163,111,362,123,123,262, 
236,123 '12l62 ,163 ,323 
-3a:3a':SSSSO=(SSa· SSa') 
223,333,262,636,333,262,163,636, 
123,123,123,123,666,111,362,123, 
123,262,236,123,123,262,163,323 
An isomorphic arithmetical process is going on in the right-hand 
column, in which one huge number is turned into an even huger number. 
The function which makes the new number from the old one would not be 
too difficult to describe arithmetically, in terms of additions, multiplica-
tions, powers of 10 and so on-but we need not do so. The main point is 
this: that the relation among (1) the original Godel number, (2) the 
number whose numeral is inserted, and (3) the resulting Godel number, is 
a primitive recursive relation. That is to say, a BlooP test could be written 
which, when fed as input any three natural numbers, says YES if they they 
are related in this way, and NO if they aren't. You may test yourself on your 
ability to perform such a test-and at the same time convince yourself that 
there are no hidden open-ended loops to the process-by checking the 
following two sets of three numbers: 
(1) 
362,262,112,262,163,323,111,123,123,123,123,666; 
2; 
362,123,123,666,112,123, 123,666,323,111,123,123,123,123,666. 
(2) 
223,362,262,236,262,323,111,262,163; 
1 ; 
223,362,123,666,236,123,666,323,111,262,163. 
As usual, one of the examples checks, the other does not. Now this relation-
ship between three numbers will be called the substitution relationship. 
Because it is primitive recursive, it is represented by some formula of TNT 
having three free variables. Let us abbreviate that TNT -formula by the 
following notation: 
SUB{ a,a' ,a"} 
444 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

Because this formula represents the substitution relationship, the formula 
shown below must be a TNT-theorem: 
SUB{SSSSS .... .sSSSSO/a,SSO/a',SSSSSS ..... SSSSO/a"} 
--------------
---------
262,111,262 S's 
123,123,666,111,123,123,666 S's 
(This is based on the first example of the substitution relation shown in the 
parallel columns earlier in this section.) And again because the SUB for-
mula represents the substitution relation, the formula shown below cer-
tainly is not a TNT-theorem: 
SUB{SSSO/a,SSO/a',SO/a"} 
Arithmoquining 
We now have reached the crucial point where we can combine all of our 
disassembled parts into one meaningful whole. We want to use the machin-
ery of the TNT-PROOF-PAlR and SUB formulas in some way to construct a 
single sentence of TNT whose interpretation is: "This very string of TNT 
is not a TNT -theorem." How do we do it? Even at this point, with all the 
necessary machinery in front of us, the answer is not easy to find. 
A curious and perhaps frivolous-seeming notion is that of substituting 
a formula's own G6del number into itself. This is quite parallel to that other 
curious, and perhaps frivolous-seeming, notion of "quining" in the Air on 
C's String. Yet quining turned out to have a funny kind of importance, in 
that it showed a new way of making a self-referential sentence. Self-
reference of the Quine variety sneaks up on you from behind the first time 
you see it-but once you understand the principle, you appreciate that it is 
quite simple and lovely. The arithmetical version of quining-let's call it 
arithmoquining-will allow us to make a TNT-sentence which is "about 
itself". 
Let us see an example of arithmoquining. We need a formula with at 
least one free variable. The following one will do: 
a=SO 
This formula's G6del number is 262,111,123,666, and we will stick this 
number into the formula itself-or rather, we will stick its numeral in. Here 
is the result: 
SSSSS ..... SSSSSO = SO 
-----------
262,111,123,666 S's 
This new formula asserts a silly falsity-that 262,111,123,666 equals 1. If 
we had begun with the string -a=SO and then arithmoquined, we would 
have come up with a true statement-as you can see for yourself. 
When you arithmoquine, you are of course performing a special case 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
445 

of the substitution operation we defined earlier. If we wanted to speak 
about arithmoquining inside TNT, we would use the formula 
SUB{a", a", a'} 
where the first two variables are the same. This comes from the fact that we 
are using a single number in two different ways (shades of the Cantor 
diagonal method!). The number a" is both (1) the original Godel number, 
and (2) the insertion-number. Let us invent an abbreviation for the above 
formula: 
ARlTHMOQUINE{a", a'} 
What the above formula says, in English, is: 
a' is the G6del number of the formula gotten by arithmoquining 
the formula with G6del number a". 
Now the preceding sentence is long and ugly. Let's introduce a concise and 
elegant term to summarize it. We'll say 
a' is the arithmoquinification of a" 
to mean the same thing. For instance, the arithmoquinification of 
262,111,123,666 is this unutterably gigantic number: 
123,123,123, ..... ,123,123,123,666,111,123,666 
----------~-----------
262,111,123,666 copies of '123' 
(This is just the Godel number of the formula we got when we 
arithmoquined a=SO.) We can speak quite easily about arithmoquining 
inside TNT. 
The Last Straw 
Now if you look back in the Air on G's String, you will see that the ultimate 
trick necessary for achieving self-reference in Quine's way is to quine a 
sentence which itself talks about the concept of quining. It's not enough just 
to quine-you must quine a quine-mentioning sentence! All right, then-
the parallel trick in our case must be to arithmoquine some formula which 
itself is talking about the notion of arithmoquining! 
Without further ado, we'll now write that formula down, and call it G's 
uncle: 
-3a:3a':<TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'}AARITHMOQUINE{a",a'}> 
You can see explicitly how arithmoquinification is thickly involved in the 
plot. Now this "uncle" has a G6del number, of course, which we'll call 'u'. 
446 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

The head and tail of u's decimal expansion, and even a teeny bit of its 
midsection, can be read off directly: 
u = 223,333,262,636,333,262,163,636,212, ... ,161, ... ,213 
For the rest, we'd have to know just how the formulas TNT-PROOF-PAIR 
and ARITHMOQUINE actually look when written out. That is too complex, 
and it is quite beside the point, in any case. 
Now all we need to do is-arithmoquine this very uncle! What this 
entails is "booting out" all free variables-of which there is only one, 
namely a"-and putting in the numeral for u everywhere. This gives us: 
-3a:3a':<TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'}AARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a",a'}> 
----------
uS's 
And this, believe it or not, is Godel's string, which we can call 'G'. Now there 
are two questions we must answer without delay. They are 
(1) 
What is G's Godel number? 
(2) 
What is the interpretation of G? 
Question 1 first. How did we make G? Well, we began with the uncle, and 
arithmoquined it. So, by the definition of arithmoquinification, G's Godel 
number is: 
the arithmoquinification of u. 
Now question 2. We will translate G into English in stages, getting gradually 
more comprehensible as we go along. For our first rough try, we make a 
pretty literal translation: 
"There do not exist numbers a and a' such that both (1) they form 
a TNT-proof-pair, and (2) a' is the arithmoquinification of u." 
Now certainly there is a number a' which is the arithmoquinification of 
u-so the problem must lie with the other number, a. This observation 
allows us to rephrase the translation of G as follows: 
"There is no number a that forms a TNT -proof-pair 
with the arithmoquinification of u." 
(This step, which can be confusing, is explained below in more detail.) Do 
you see what is happening? G is saying this: 
"The formula whose Godel number is the arithmoquinification 
of u is not a theorem of TNT." 
But-and this should come as no surprise by now-that formula is none 
other than G itself; whence we can make the ultimate translation of G as 
"G is not a theorem of TNT." 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
447 

-or if you prefer, 
"I am not a theorem of TNT." 
We have gradually pulled a high-level interpretation-a sentence of 
meta-TNT -out of what was originally a low-level interpretation-a sen-
tence of number theory. 
TNT Says "UncleI" 
The main consequence of this amazing construction has already been 
delineated in Chapter IX: it is the incompleteness of TNT. To reiterate the 
argument: 
Is G a TNT-theorem? If so, then it must assert a truth. But 
what in fact does G assert? Its own nontheoremhood. Thus from 
its theoremhood would follow its nontheoremhood: a contradic-
tion. 
Now what about G being a nontheorem? This is acceptable, in 
that it doesn't lead to a contradiction. But G's nontheoremhood is 
what G asserts-hence G asserts a truth. And since G is not a 
theorem, there exists (at least) one truth which is not a theorem of 
TNT. 
Now to explain that one tricky step again. I will use another similar 
example. Take this string: 
-3a:3a':<TORTOISE-PAIR{a,a'}ATENTH-POWER{SSO/a",a'}> 
where the two abbreviations are for strings of TNT which you can write 
down yourself. TENTH-POWER{a",a'} represents the statement "a' is the 
tenth power of a"". The literal translation into English is then: 
"There do not exist numbers a and a' such that both (1) they form 
a Tortoise-pair, and (2) a' is the tenth power of 2." 
But dearly, there is a tenth power of 2-namely lO24. Therefore, what the 
string is really saying is that 
"There is no number a that forms a Tortoise-pair with lO24" 
which can be further boiled down to: 
"lO24 does not have the Tortoise property." 
The point is that we have achieved a way of substituting a description of a 
number, rather than its numeral, into a predicate. It depends on using one 
extra quantified variable (a'). Here, it was the number lO24 that was 
described as "the tenth power of 2"; above, it was the number described as 
"the arithmoquinification of u".

G6del's Second Theorem 
Since G's interpretation is true, the interpretation of its negation -G is 
false. And we know that no false statements are derivable in TNT. Th us 
neither G nor its negation -G can be a theorem of TNT. We have found a "hole" 
in our system-an undecidable proposition. This has a number of ramifica-
tions. Here is one curious fact which follows from G's undecidability: 
although neither G nor -G is a theorem, the formula <Gv-G> is a 
theorem, since the rules of the Propositional Calculus ensure that all 
well-formed formulas of the form <Pv-P> are theorems. 
This is one simple example where an assertion inside the system and an 
assertion about the system seem at odds with each other. It makes one 
wonder if the system really reflects itself accurately. Does the "reflected 
metamathematics" which exists inside TNT correspond well to the 
metamathematics which we do? This was one of the questions which in-
trigued Godel when he wrote his paper. In particular, he was interested in 
whether it was possible, in the "reflected metamathematics", to prove 
TNT's consistency. Recall that this was a great philosophical dilemma of 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
449 

the day: how to prove a system consistent. Godel found a simple way to 
express the statement "TNT is consistent" in a TNT formula; and then he 
showed that this formula (and all others which express the same idea) are 
only theorems of TNT under one condition: that TNT is inconsistent. This 
perverse result was a severe blow to optimists who expected that one could 
find a rigorous proof that mathematics is contradiction-free. 
How do you express the statement "TNT is consistent" inside TNT? It 
hinges on this simple fact: that inconsistency means that two formulas, x 
and - x, one the negation of the other, are both theorems. But if both x 
and - x are theorems, then according to the Propositional Calculus, all 
well-formed formulas are theorems. Thus, to show TNT's consistency, it 
would suffice to exhibit one single sentence of TNT which can be proven to 
be a nontheorem. Therefore, one way to express "TNT is consistent" is to 
say "The formula -0=0 is not a theorem of TNT". This was already 
proposed as an exercise a few pages back. The translation is: 
-3a:TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,SSSSS ..... SSSSSO/a'} 
------------
223,666,111,666 S's 
It can be shown, by lengthy but fairly straightforward reasoning, that-as 
long as TNT is consistent-this oath-of-consistency by TNT is not a theo-
rem of TNT. So TNT's powers of introspection are great when it comes to 
expressing things, but fairly weak when it comes to proving them. This is 
quite a provocative result, if one applies it metaphorically to the human 
problem of self-knowledge. 
TNT Is w-Incomplete 
Now what variety of incompleteness does TNT "enjoy"? We shall see that 
TNT's incompleteness is of the "omega" variety-defined in Chapter VIII. 
This means that there is some infinite pyramidal family of strings all of 
which are theorems, but whose associated "summarizing string" is a non-
theorem. It is easy to exhibit the summarizing string which is a nontheo-
rem: 
uS's 
~ 
Va:-3a':<TNT-PROOF-PAlR{a,a' }AARITHMOQUlNE{SSS ... SSSO/a",a'}> 
To understand why this string is a nontheorem, notice that it is extremely 
similar to G itself-in fact, G can be made from it in one step (viz., 
according to TNT's Rule of Interchange). Therefore, if it were a theorem, 
so would G be. But since G isn't a theorem, neither can this be. 
Now we want to show that all of the strings in the related pyramidal 
family are theorems. We can write them down easily enough: 
450 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

u 
uS's 
~ 
-3a': <TNT-PROOF-PAIR{O/a,a'} A ARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a", a'}> 
-3a': <TNT-PROOF-PAIR{SO/a,a'} A ARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a", a'}> 
-3a': <TNT-PROOF-PAlR{SSO/a,a'} A ARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a", a'}> 
-3a': <TNT-PROOF-PAIR{SSSO/a,a'} AARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a", a'}> 
What does each one assert? Their translations, one by one, are: 
"0 and the arithmoquinification of u do not form a TNT -proof-pair." 
"1 and the arithmoquinification of u do not form a TNT-proof-pair." 
"2 and the arithmoquinification of u do not form a TNT -proof-pair." 
"3 and the arithmoquinification of u do not form a TNT -proof-pair." 
Now each of these assertions is about whether two specific integers form a 
proof-pair or not. (By contrast, C itself is about whether one specific integer 
is a theorem-number or not.) Now because'C is a nontheorem, no integer 
forms a proof-pair with C's Codel number. Therefore, each of the state-
ments of the family is true. Now the crux of the matter is that the property 
of being a proof-pair is primitive recursive, hence represented, so that each 
of the statements in the list above, being true, must translate into a theorem 
of TNT-which means that everything in our infinite pyramidal family is a 
theorem. And that shows why TNT is w-incomplete. 
Two Different Ways to Plug Up the Hole 
Since C's interpretation is true, the interpretation of its negation -C is 
false. And, using the assumption that TNT is consistent, we know that no 
false statements are derivable in TNT. Thus neither C nor its negation -C 
is a theorem of TNT. We have found a hole in our system-an undecidable 
proposition. Now this need be no source of alarm, if we are philosophically 
detached enough to recognize what this is a symptom of. It signifies that 
TNT can be extended, just as absolute geometry could be. In fact, TNT 
can be extended in two distinct directions, just as absolute geometry could 
be. It can be extended in a standard direction-which corresponds to ex-
tending absolute geometry in the Euclidean direction; or, it can be ex-
tended in a nonstandard direction-which corresponds, of course, to ex-
tending absolute geometry in the non-Euclidean direction. Now the stan-
dard type of extension would involve 
adding C as a new axiom. 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
451 

This suggestion seems rather innocuous and perhaps even desirable, since, 
after all, G asserts something true about the natural number system. But 
what about the nonstandard type of extension? If it is at all parallel to the 
case of the parallel postulate, it must involve 
adding the negation of G as a new axiom. 
But how can we even contemplate doing such a repugnant, hideous thing? 
After all, to paraphrase the memorable words of Girolamo Saccheri, isn't 
what -G says "repugnant to the nature of the natural numbers"? 
Supernatural Numbers 
I hope the irony of this quotation strikes you. The exact problem with 
Saccheri's approach to geometry was that he began with a fixed notion of 
what was true and what was not true, and he set out only to prove what he'd 
assessed as true to start with. Despite t.he cleverness of his approach-which 
involved denying the fifth postulate, and then proving many "repugnant" 
propositions of the ensuing geometry-Saccheri never entertained the 
possibility of other ways of thinking about points and lines. Now we should 
be wary of repeating this famous mist.ake. We must consider impartially, to 
the extent that we can, what it would mean to add -G as an axiom to TNT. 
Just think what mathematics would be like today if people had never 
considered adding new axioms of the following sorts: 
3a:(a+a)=50 
3a:5a=0 
3a:(a· a) =550 
3a:5(a·a) =0 
While each of them is "repugnant to the nature of previously known 
number systems", each of them also provides a deep and wonderful exten-
sion of the notion of whole numbers: rational numbers, negative numbers, 
irrational numbers, imaginary numbers. Such a possibility is what -G is 
trying to get us to open our eyes to. Now in the past, each new extension of 
the notion of number was greeted with hoots and catcalls. You can hear this 
particularly loudly in the names attached to the unwelcome arrivals, such as 
"irrational numbers", "imaginary numbers". True to this tradition, we shall 
name the numbers which -G is announcing to us the supernatural numbers, 
.showing how we feel they violate all reasonable and commonsensical no-
tions. 
If we are going to throw -G in as the sixth axiom of TNT, we had 
better understand how in the world it. could coexist, in one system, with the 
infinite pyramidal family we just finished discussing. To put it bluntly, -G 
says: 
452 
"There exists some number which forms a TNT-proof-pair 
with the arithmoquinification of u" 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

-but the various members of the pyramidal family successively assert: 
"0 is not that number" 
"1 is not that number" 
"2 is not that number" 
This is rather confusing, because it seems to be a complete contradiction 
(which is why it is called "w-inconsistency"). At the root of our 
confusion-much as in the case of the splitting of geometry-is our stub-
born resistance to adopt a modified interpretation for the symbols, despite 
the fact that we are quite aware that the system is a modified system. We 
want to get away without reinterpreting any symbols-and of course that 
will prove impossible. 
The reconciliation comes when we reinterpret 3 as "There exists a 
generalized natural number", rather than as "There exists a natural 
number". As we do this, we shall also reinterpret V in the corresponding 
way. This means that we are opening the door to some extra numbers 
besides the natural numbers. These are the supernatural numbers. The 
naturals and supernaturals together make up the totality of generalized 
naturals. 
The apparent contradiction vanishes into thin air, now, for the pyram-
idal family still says what it said before: "No natural number forms a 
TNT -proof-pair with the arithmoquinification of u." The family doesn't 
say anything about supernatural numbers, because there are no numerals 
for them. But now, -G says, "There exists a generalized natural number 
which forms a TNT-proof-pair with the arithmoquinification of u." It is 
clear that taken together, the family and -G tell us something: that there is 
a supernatural number which forms a TNT-proof-pair with the arithmo-
quinification of u. That is all-there is no contradiction any more. 
TNT +-G is a consistent system, under an interpretation which includes 
supernatural numbers. 
Since we have now agreed to extend the interpretations of the two 
quantifiers, this means that any theorem which involves either of them has 
an extended meaning. For example, the commutativity theorem 
Va:Va':(a+a')=(a' +a) 
now tells us that addition is commutative for all generalized natural 
numbers-in other words, not only for natural numbers, but also for 
supernatural numbers. Likewise, the TNT-theorem which says "2 is not the 
square of a natural number"-
-3a:(a ·a)=SSO 
-now tells us that 2 is not the square of a supernatural number, either. In 
fact, supernatural numbers share all the properties of natural numbers, as 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
453 

long as those properties are given to us in theorems of TNT. In other 
words, everything that can be formally proven about natural numbers is 
thereby established also for supernatural numbers. This means, in particu-
lar, that supernatural numbers are not anything already familiar to you, 
such as fractions, or negative numbers, or complex numbers, or whatever. 
The supernatural numbers are, instead, best visualized as integers which 
are greater than all natural numbers--as infinitely large integers. Here is the 
point: although theorems of TNT can rule out negative numbers, frac-
tions, irrational numbers, and complex numbers, still there is no way to 
rule out infinitely large integers. The problem is, there is no way even to 
express the statement "There are no infinite quantities". 
This sounds quite strange, at first. Just exactly how big is the number 
which makes a TNT-proof-pair with G's Godel number? (Let's call it 'I', 
for no particular reason.) Unfortunately, we have not got any good vocabu-
lary for describing the sizes of infinitely large integers, so I am afraid I 
cannot convey a sense of I's magnitude. But then just how big is i (the 
square root of -I)? Its size cannot be imagined in terms of the sizes of 
familiar natural numbers. You can't say, "Well, i is about half as big as 14, 
and 9/10 as big as 24." You have to say, "i squared is -I", and more or less 
leave it at that. A quote from Abraham Lincoln seems a propos here. 
When he was asked, "How long should a man's legs be?" he drawled, "Long 
enough to reach the ground." That is more or less how to answer the 
question about the size of I-it should be just the size of a number which 
specifies the structure of a proof of G-no bigger, no smaller. 
Of course, any theorem of TNT has many different derivations, so you 
might complain that my characterization of I is nonunique. That is so. But 
the parallel with i-the square root of -I-still holds. Namely, recall that 
there is another number whose square is also minus one: -i. Now i and -i 
are not the same number. They just have a property in common. The only 
trouble is that it is the property which defines them! We have to choose one 
of them-it doesn't matter which one·-and call it "i". In fact there's no way 
of telling them apart. So for all we know we could have been calling the 
wrong one "i" for all these centuries and it would have made no difference. 
Now, like i, I is also nonuniquely defined. So you just have to think of I as 
being some specific one of the many possible supernatural numbers which 
form TNT -proof-pairs with the arithmoquinification of u. 
Supernatural Theorems Have Infinitely Long Derivations 
We haven't yet faced head on what it means to throw -G in as an axiom. 
We have said it but not stressed it. The point is that -G asserts that G has a 
proof How can a system survive, when one of its axioms asserts that its own 
negation has a proof? We must be in hot water now! Well, it is not so bad as 
you might think. As long as we only construct finite proofs, we will never 
prove G. Therefore, no calamitous collision between G and its negation -G 
will ever take place. The supernatural number I won't cause any disaster. 
454 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

However, we will have to get used to the idea that -G is now the one which 
asserts a truth ("G has a proof"), while G asserts a falsity ("G has no 
proof"). In standard number theory it is the other way around-but then, 
in standard number theory there aren't any supernatural numbers. Notice 
that a supernatural theorem of TNT-namely G-may assert a falsity, but 
all natural theorems still assert truths. 
Supernatural Addition and Multiplication 
There is one extremely curious and unexpected fact about supernaturals 
which I would like to tell you, without proof. (I don't know the proof 
either.) This fact is reminiscent of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in 
quantum mechanics. It turns out that you can "index" the supernaturals in 
a simple and natural way by associating with each supernatural number a 
trio of ordinary integers (including negative ones). Thus, our original 
supernatural number, I, might have the index set (9,-8,3), and its succes-
sor, 1+ 1, might have the index set (9,-8,4). Now there is no unique way to 
index the supernaturals; different methods offer different advantages and 
disadvantages. Under some indexing schemes, it is very easy to calculate 
the index triplet for the sum of two supernaturals, given the indices of the 
two numbers to be added. Under other indexing schemes, it is very easy to 
calculate the index triplet for the product of two supernaturals, given the 
indices of the two numbers to be multiplied. But under no indexing scheme 
is it possible to calculate both. More precisely, if the sum's index can be 
calculated by a recursive function, then the product's index will not be a 
recursive function; and conversely, if the product's index is a recursive 
function, then the sum's index will not be. Therefore, supernatural school-
children who learn their supernatural plus-tables will have to be excused if 
they do not know their supernatural times-tables-and vice versa! You 
cannot know both at the same time. 
Supernaturals Are Useful . .. 
One can go beyond the number theory of supernaturals, and consider 
supernatural fractions (ratios of two supernaturals), supernatural real 
numbers, and so on. In fact, the calculus can be put on a new footing, using 
the notion of supernatural real numbers. Infinitesimals such as dx and dy, 
those old bugaboos of mathematicians, can be completely justified, by 
considering them to be reciprocals of infinitely large real numbers! Some 
theorems in advanced analysis can be proven more intuitively with the aid 
of "nonstandard analysis". 
But Are They Real? 
Nonstandard number theory is a disorienting thing when you first meet up 
with it. But then, non-Euclidean geometry is also a disorienting subject. In 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
455 

both instances, one is powerfully driven to ~sk, "But which one of these two 
rival theories is correct? Which is thl' truth?" In a certain sense, there is no 
answer to such a question. (And yet, in another sense-to be discussed 
later-there is an answer.) The reason that there is no answer to the 
question is that the two rival theories, although they employ the same 
terms, do not talk about the same concepts. Therefore, they are only 
superficially rivals, just like Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. In 
geometry, the words "point", "line". and so on are undefined terms, and 
their meanings are determined by the axiomatic system within which they 
are used. 
Likewise for number theory. When we decided to formalize TNT, we 
preselected the terms we would use as interpretation words-for instance, 
words such as "number", "plus", "times", and so on. By taking the step of 
formalization, we were committing ourselves to accepting whatever passive 
meanings these terms might take on. But-just like Saccheri-we didn't 
anticipate any surprises. We thought we knew what the true, the real, the 
only theory of natural numbers was. We didn't know that there would be 
some questions about numbers which TNT would leave open, and which 
could therefore be answered ad libitum by extensions of TNT heading off 
in different directions. Thus, there is no basis on which to say that number 
theory "really" is this way or that, just as one would be loath to say that the 
square root of - 1 "really" exists, or "really" does not. 
Bifurcations in Geometry, and Physicists 
There is one argument which can be, and perhaps ought to be, raised 
against the preceding. Suppose experiments in the real, physical world can 
be explained more economically in terms of one particular version of 
geometry than in terms of any other. Then it might make sense to say that 
that geometry is "true". From the point of view of a physicist who wants to 
use the "correct" geometry. then it makes some sense to distinguish be-
tween the "true" geometry, and other geometries. But this cannot be taken 
too simplistically. Physicists are always dealing with approximations and 
idealizations of situations. For instance, my own Ph.D. work, mentioned in 
Chapter V, was based on an extreme idealization of the problem of a crystal 
in a magnetic field. The mathematics which emerged was of a high degree 
of beauty and symmetry. Despite--or rather, because of-the artificiality of 
the model, some fundamental features emerged conspicuously in the 
graph. These features then suggest some guesses about the kinds of things 
that might happen in more realistic ~ituations. But without the simplifying 
assumptions which produced my graph, there could never be such insights. 
One can see this kind of thing over and over again in physics, where a 
physicist uses a "nonreal" situation to learn about deeply hidden features of 
reality. Therefore, one should be extremely cautious in saying that the 
brand of geometry which physicists might wish to use would represent "the 
456 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

true geometry'.', for in fact, physicists will always use a variety of different 
geometries, choosing in any given situation the one that seems simplest and 
most convenient. 
Furthermore-and perhaps this is even more to the point-physicists 
do not study just the 3-D space we live in. There are whole families of 
"abstract spaces" within which physical calculations take place, spaces which 
have totally different geometrical properties from the physical space within 
which we live. Who is to say, then, that "the true geometry" is defined by 
the space in which Uranus and Neptune orbit around the sun? There is 
"Hilbert space", where quantum-mechanical wave functions undulate; 
there is "momentum space", where Fourier components dwell; there is 
"reciprocal space", where wave-vectors cavort; there is "phase space", 
where many-particle configurations swish; and so on. There is absolutely 
no reason that the geometries of all these spaces should be the same; in fact, 
they couldn't possibly be the same! So it is essential and vital for physicists 
that different and "rival" geometries should exist. 
Bifurcations in Number Theory, and Bankers 
So much for geometry. What about number theory? Is it also essential and 
vital that different number theories should coexist with each other? If you 
asked a bank officer, my guess is that you would get an expression of 
horror and disbelief. How could 2 and 2 add up to anything but 4? And 
moreover, if 2 and 2 did not make 4, wouldn't world economies collapse 
immediately under the unbearable uncertainty opened up by that fact? Not 
really. First of all, nonstandard number theory doesn't threaten the age-old 
idea that 2 plus 2 equals 4. It differs from ordinary number theory only in 
the way it deals with the concept of the infinite. After all, every theorem of 
TNT remains a theorem in any extension of TNT! So bankers need not despair 
of the chaos that will arrive when nonstandard number theory takes over. 
And anyway, entertaining fears about old facts being changed betrays 
a misunderstanding of the relationship between mathematics and the real 
world. Mathematics only tells you answers to questions in the real world 
after you have taken the one vital step of choosing which kind of mathemat-
ics to apply. Even if there were a rival number theory which used the 
symbols '2', '3', and '+', and in which a theorem said "2 + 2 = 3", there 
would be little reason for bankers to choose to use that theory! For that 
theory does not fit the way money works. You fit your mathematics to the 
world, and not the other way around. For instance, we don't apply number 
theory to cloud systems, because the very concept of whole numbers hardly 
fits. There can be one cloud and another cloud, and they will come together 
and instead of there being two clouds, there will still only be one. This 
doesn't prove that 1 plus 1 equals 1; it just proves that our number-
theoretical concept of "one" is not applicable in its full power to cloud-
counting. 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 
457 

Bifurcations in Number Theory, and Metamathematicians 
So bankers, cloud-counters, and most of the rest of us need not worry 
about the advent of supernatural numbers: they won't affect our everyday 
perception of the world in the slightest. The only people who might 
actually be a little worried are people whose endeavors depend in some 
crucial way on the nature of infinite entities. There aren't too many such 
people around-but mathematical logicians are members of this category. 
How can the existence of a bifurcation in number theory affect them? Well, 
number theory plays two roles in logic: (1) when axiomatized, it is an object 
of study; and (2) when used informally. it is an indispensable tool with which 
formal systems can be investigated. This is the use-mention distinction once 
again, in fact: in role (1), number theory is mentioned. in role (2) it is used. 
Now mathematicians have judged that number theory is applicable to 
the study of formal systems even if not to cloud-counting, just as bankers 
have judged that the arithmetic of real numbers is applicable to their 
transactions. This is an extramathematical judgement, and shows that the 
thought processes involved in doing mathematics, just like those in other 
areas, involve "tangled hierarchies" in which thoughts on one level can 
affect thoughts on any other level. Levels are not cleanly separated, as the 
formalist version of what mathematics is would have one believe. 
The formalist philosophy claims that mathematicians only deal with 
abstract symbols, and that they couldn't care less whether those symbols 
have any applications to or connections with reality. But that is quite a 
distorted picture. Nowhere is this clearer than in metamathematics. If the 
theory of numbers is itself used as an aid in gaining factual knowledge about 
formal systems, then mathematicians are tacitly showing that they believe 
these ethereal things called "natural numbers" are actually part of reality-
not just figments of the imagination. This is why I parenthetically re-
marked earlier that, in a certain sense. there is an answer to the question of 
which version of number theory is "true". Here is the nub of the matter: 
mathematical logicians must choose which version of number theory to put 
their faith in. In particular, they cannot remain neutral on the question of 
the existence or nonexistence of supernatural numbers, for the two differ-
ent theories may give different answers to questions in metamathematics. 
For instance, take this question: "Is -G finitely derivable in TNT?" No 
one actually knows the answer. Nevertheless, most mathematical logicians 
would answer no without hesitation. The intuition which motivates that 
answer is based on the fact that if --G were a theorem, TNT would be 
w-inconsistent, and this would force supernaturals down your throat if you 
wanted to interpret TNT meaningfully-a most unpalatable thought for 
most people. After all, we didn't intend or expect supernaturals to be part 
of TNT when we invented it. That is, we-or most of us-believe that it is 
possible to make a formalization of number theory which does not force 
you into believing that supernatural numbers are every bit as real as 
naturals. It is that intuition about reality which determines which "fork" of 
number theory mathematicians will put their faith in, when the chips are 
458 
On Formally Undecidable Propositions 

down. But this faith may be wrong. Perhaps every consistent formalization 
of number theory which humans invent will imply the existence of super-
naturals, by being w-inconsistent. This is a queer thought, but it is conceiv-
able. 
If this were the case-which I doubt, but there is no disproof avail-
able-then G would not have to be undecidable. In fact, there might be no 
undecidable formulas of TNT at all. There could simply be one unbifur-
cated theory of numbers-which necessarily includes supernaturals. This is 
not the kind of thing mathematical logicians expect, but it is something 
which ought not to be rejected outright. Generally, mathematical logicians 
believe that TNT-and systems similar to it-are w-consistent, and that the 
Gode! string which can be constructed in any such system is undecidable 
within that system. That means that they can choose to add either it or its 
negation as an axiom. 
Hilbert's Tenth Problem and the Tortoise 
I would like to conclude this Chapter by mentioning one extension of 
Godel's Theorem. (This material is more fully covered in the article "Hil-
bert's Tenth Problem" by Davis and Hersh, for which see the Bibliog-
raphy.) For this, I must define what a Diophantine equation is. This is an 
equation in which a polynomial with fixed integral coefficients and expo-
nents is set to O. For instance, 
a=O 
and 
5x + 13y - 1 = 0 
and 
5p5 + 17ql7 -
177 = 0 
and 
aI23.666.111.666 + bI23.666.111.666 _ 
CI23.666.111.666 = 0 
are Diophantine equations. It is in general a difficult matter to know 
whether a given Diophantine equation has any integer solutions or not. In 
fact, in a famous lecture at the beginning of the century, Hilbert asked 
mathematicians to look for a general algorithm by which one could deter-
mine in a finite number of steps if a given Diophantine equation has integer 
solutions or not. Little did he suspect that no such algorithm exists!

Now for the simplification of G. It has been shown that whenever you 
have a sufficiently powerful formal number theory, and a Godel-
numbering for it, there is a Diophantine equation which is equivalent to G. 
The equivalence lies in the fact that this equation, when interpreted on a 
metamathematical level, asserts of itself that it has no solutions. Turn it 
around: if you found a solution to it, you could construct from it the 
Godel number of a proof in the system that the equation has no solutions! 
This is what the Tortoise did in the Prelude, using Fermat's equation as his 
Diophantine equation. It is nice to know that when you do this, you can 
retrieve the sound of Old Bach from the molecules in the air!

Birthday Cantatatata ... 
One fine May day, the Tortoise and Achilles meet, wandering in the woods. 
The latter, all decked out handsomely, is doing a jiggish sort of thing to a 
tune which he himself is humming. On his vest he is wearing a great big 
button with the words "Today is my Birthday!" 
Tortoise: 
Hello there, Achilles. What makes you so joyful today? Is it your 
birthday, by any chance? 
Achilles: 
Yes, yes! Yes it is, today is my birthday! 
Tortoise: 
That is what I had suspected, on account of that button which 
you are wearing, and also because unless I am mistaken, you are 
singing a tune from a Birthday Cantata by Bach, one written in 1727 
for the fifty-seventh birthday of Augustus, King of Saxony. 
Achilles: 
You're right. And Augustus' birthday coincides with mine, so 
THIS Birthday Cantata has double meaning. However, I shan't tell you 
my age. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, that's perfectly all right. However, I would like to know one 
other thing. From what you have told me so far, would it be correct to 
conclude that today is your birthday? 
Achilles: 
Yes, yes, it would be. Today IS my birthday. 
Tortoise: 
Excellent. That'sjust as I suspected. So now, I WILL conclude it is 
your birthday, unless-
Achilles: 
Yes-unless what? 
Tortoise: 
Unless that would be a premature or hasty conclusion to draw, 
you know. Tortoises don't like to jump to conclusions, after all. (We 
don't like to jump at all, but especially not to conclusions.) So let me 
just ask you, knowing full well of your fondness for logical thought, 
whether it would be reasonable to deduce logically from the foregoing 
sentences, that today is in fact your birthday. 
Achilles: 
I do believe I detect a pattern to your questions, Mr. T. But 
rather than jump to conclusions myself, I shall take your question at 
face value, and answer it straightforwardly. The answer is: YES. 
Tortoise: 
Fine! Fine! Then there is only one more thing I need to know, to 
be quite certain that today is-
Achilles: 
Yes, yes, yes, yes ... I can already see the line of your question-
ing, Mr. T. I'll have you know that I am not so gullible as I was when 
we discussed Euclid's proof, a while back. 
Tortoise: 
Why, who would ever have thought you to be gullible? Quite to 
the contrary, I regard you as an expert in the forms of logical thought, 
an authority in the science of valid deductions, a fount of knowledge 
about correct methods of reasoning ... To tell the truth, Achilles, you 
are, in my opinion, a veritable titan in the art of rational cogitation. 
Birthday Cantatatata ... 
461 

And it is only for that reason that I would ask you, "Do the foregoing 
sentences present enough evidence that I should conclude without 
further puzzlement that today is your birthday?" 
Achilles: 
You Hatten me with your weighty praise, Mr. T -FLATTER, I 
mean. But I am struck by the repetitive nature of your questioning-
and in my estimation, you, just as well as I, could have answered 'yes' 
each time. 
Tortoise: 
Of course I could have, Achilles. But you see, to do so would 
have been to make a Wild Guess-and Tortoises abhor Wild Guesses. 
Tortoises formulate only Educated Guesses. Ah, yes-the power of the 
Educated Guess. You have no idea how many people fail to take into 
account all the Relevant Factors when they're guessing. 
Achilles: It seems to me that there was only one relevant factor in this 
rigmarole, and that was my first statement. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, to be sure, it's at least ONE of the factors to take into account, 
I'd say-but would you have me neglect Logic, that venerated science 
of the ancients? Logic is always a Relevant Factor in making Educated 
Guesses, and since I have with me a renowned expert in Logic, I 
thought it only Logical to take advantage of that fact, and confirm my 
hunches, by directly asking him whether my intuitions were correct. So 
let me finally come out and ask. you point blank: "Do the preceding 
sentences allow me to conclude, with no room for doubt, that Today is 
your Birthday?" 
Achilles: 
For one more time, YES. But frankly speaking, I have the distinct 
impression that you could have supplied that answer-as well as all the 
previous ones-yourself. 
Tortoise: 
How your words sting! Would I were so wise as your insinuation 
suggests! But as merely a mortal Tortoise, profoundly ignorant and 
longing to take into account all the Relevant Factors, I needed to know 
the answers to all those questions. 
Achilles: 
Well then, let me clear the matter up for once and for all. The 
answer to all the previous questions, and to all the succeeding ones 
which you will ask along the same line, is just this: YES. 
Tortoise: 
Wonderful! In one fell swoop, you have circumvented the whole 
mess, in your characteristically inventive manner. I hope you won't 
mind if I call this ingenious trick an ANSWER SCHEMA. It rolls up 
yes-answers numbers 1,2,3, etc., into one single ball. In fact, coming 
as it does at the end of the line, it deserves the title "Answer Schema 
Omega", 'w' being the last letter of the Greek alphabet-as if YOU 
needed to be told THAT! 
Achilles: 
I don't care what you call it. I am just very relieved that you 
finally agree that it is my birthday, and we can go on to some other 
topic-such as what you are going to give me as a present. 
Tortoise: 
Hold on-not so fast. I WILL agree it is your birthday, provided 
one thing. 
Achilles: 
What? That I ask for no present? 
462 
Birthday Cantatatata ... 

Tortoise: 
Not at all. In fact, Achilles, I am looking forward to treating you 
to a fine birthday dinner, provided merely that I am convinced that 
knowledge of all those yes-answers at once (as supplied by Answer 
Schema w) allows me to proceed directly and without any further 
detours to the conclusion that today is your birthday. That's the case, 
isn't it? 
Achilles: 
Yes, of course it is. 
Tortoise: 
Good. And now I have yes-answer w + 1. Armed with it, I can 
proceed to accept the hypothesis that today is your birthday, if it is 
valid to do so. Would you be so kind as to counsel me on that matter, 
Achilles? 
Achilles: 
What is this? I thought I had seen through your infinite plot. 
Now doesn't yes-answer w + 1 satisfy you? All right. I'll give you not 
only yes-answer w + 2, but also yes-answers w + 3, w + 4, and so on. 
Tortoise: 
How generous of you, Achilles. And here it is your birthday, 
when I should be giving YOU presents instead of the reverse. Or 
rather, I SUSPECT it is your birthday. I guess I can conclude that it IS 
your birthday, now, armed with the new Answer Schema, which I will 
caH "Answer Schema 2w". But tell me, Achilles: Does Answer Schema 
2w REALLY allow me to make that enormous leap, or am I missing 
something? 
Achilles: 
You won't trick me any more, Mr. T. I've seen the way to end this 
silly game. I hereby shall present you with an Answer Schema to end 
all Answer Schemas! That is, I present you simultaneously with An-
swer Schemas w, 2w, 3w, 4w, 5w, etc. With thi~ Meta-Answer-Schema, I 
have JUMPED OUT of the whole system, kit and caboodle, transcended 
this silly game you thought you had me trapped in-and now we are 
DONE! 
Tortoise: 
Good grief! I feel honored, Achilles, to be the recipient of such a 
powerful Answer Schema. I feel that seldom has anything so gigantic 
been devised by the mind of man, and I am awestruck by its power. 
Would you mind if I give a name to your gift? 
Achilles: 
Not at all. 
Tortoise: 
Then I shaH call it "Answer Schema w 2 ". And we can shortly 
proceed to other matters-as soon as you tell me whether the 
possession of Answer Schema w 2 allows me to deduce that today is 
your birthday. 
Achilles: 
Oh, woe is me! Can't I ever reach the end of this tantalizing trail? 
What comes next? 
Tortoise: 
Well, after Answer Schema w 2 there's answer w 2 + 1. And 
then answer w 2 + 2. And so forth. But you can wrap those all 
together into a packet, being Answer Schema w2 + w. And then 
there are quite a few other answer-packets, such as w2 + 2w, and 
w2 + 3w ... Eventually, you come to Answer Schema 2w 2, and 
after a while, Answer Schemas 3w2 and 4w2• Beyond them there 
Birthday Cantatatata ... 
463 

are yet further Answer Schemas, such as w3 , w4 , w 5 , and so on. 
It goes on quite a ways, you know. 
Achilles: 
I can imagine. I suppose it comes to Answer Schema WW 
after a while. 
Tortoise: 
Of course. 
Achilles: 
And then w
Ww
, and w
WWw? 
Tortoise: 
You're catching on mighty fast, Achilles. I have a suggestion for 
you, if you don't mind. Why don't you throw all of those together into 
a single Answer Schema? 
Achilles: 
All right, though I'm beginning to doubt whether it will do any 
good. 
Tortoise: It seems to me that within our naming conventions as so 
far set up, there is no obvious name for this one. So perhaps we should 
just arbitrarily name it Answer Schema Eo. 
Achilles: 
Confound it all! Every time you give one of my answers a NAME, it 
seems to signal the imminent shattering of my hopes that that answer 
will satisfy you. Why don't we just leave this Answer Schema nameless? 
Tortoise: 
We can hardly do that, Achilles. We wouldn't have any way to 
refer to it without a name. And besides, there is something inevitable 
and rather beautiful about this particular Answer Schema. It would be 
quite ungraceful to leave it nameless! And you wouldn't want to do 
something lacking in grace on your birthday, would you? Or IS it your 
birthday? Say, speaking of birthdays, today is MY birthday! 
Achilles: 
It is? 
Tortoise: 
Yes, it is. Well, actually, it's my uncle's birthday, but that's almost 
the same. How would you like to treat me to a delicious birthday 
dinner this evening? 
Achilles: 
Now just a cotton-picking minute, Mr. T. Today is MY birthday. 
You should do the treating! 
Tortoise: 
Ah, but you never did succeed in convincing me ofthe veracity of 
that remark. You kept on beating around the bush with answers, 
Answer Schemas, and whatnot. All I wanted to know was if it was your 
birthday or not, but you managed to befuddle me entirely. Oh, well, 
too bad. In any case, I'll be happy to let you treat me to a birthday 
dinner this evening. 
Achilles: 
Very well. I know just the place. They have a variety of delicious 
soups. And I know exactly what kind we should have ...

Birthday Cantatatata ... 

CHAPTER XV 
Jumping out of the System 
A More Powerful Formal System 
ONE OF THE things which a thoughtful critic of Godel's proof might do 
would be to examine its generality. Such a critic might, for example, 
suspect that Godel has just cleverly taken advantage of a hidden defect in 
one particular formal system, TNT. If this were the case, then perhaps a 
formal system superior to TNT could be developed which would not be 
subject to the Godelian trick, and Godel's Theorem would lose much of its 
sting. In this Chapter we will carefully scrutinize the properties of TNT 
which made it vulnerable to the arguments of last Chapter. 
A natural thought is this: If the basic trouble with TNT is that it 
contains a "hole"-in other words, a sentence which is undecidable, namely 
G-then why not simply plug up the hole? Why not just tack G onto TNT 
as a sixth axiom? Of course, by comparison to the other axioms, G is a 
ridiculously huge giant, and the resulting system-TNT +G-would have a 
rather comical aspect due to the disproportionateness of its axioms. Be that 
as it may, adding G is a reasonable suggestion. Let us consider it done. 
Now, it is to be hoped, the new system, TNT+G, is a superior formal 
system-one which is not only supernatural-free, but also complete. It is 
certain that TNT +G is superior to TNT in at least one respect: the string G 
is no longer undecidable in this new system, since it is a theorem. 
What was the vulnerability of TNT due to? The essence of its vulnera-
bility was that it was capable of expressing statements about itself-in 
particular, the statement 
"I Cannot Be Proven in Formal System TNT" 
or, expanded a bit, 
"There does not exist a natural number which forms a 
TNT-proof-pair with the Godel number of this string." 
Is there any reason to expect or hope that TNT +G would be invulner-
able to Godel's proof? Not really. Our new system is just as expressive as 
TNT. Since Godel's proof relies primarily on the expressive power of a 
formal system, we should not be surprised to see our new system succumb, 
Jumping out of the System 
465 

too. The trick will be to find a string which expresses the statement 
"I Cannot Be Proven in Formal System TNT +G." 
Actually, it is not much of a trick, once you have seen it done for TNT. All 
the same principles are employed; only the context shifts slightly. (Figura-
tively speaking, we take a tune we know and simply sing it again, only in a 
higher key.) As before, the string which we are looking for-let us call it 
"G' "-is constructed by the intermediary of an "uncle". But instead of 
being based on the formula which represents TNT-proof-pairs, it is based 
on the similar but slightly more complicated notion of TNT +G-proof-
pairs. This notion of TNT +G-proof-pairs is only a slight extension of the 
original notion of TNT -proof-pairs. 
A similar extension could be envisaged for the MIU-system. We have 
seen the unadulterated form of MIU-proof-pairs. Were we now to add MU 
as a second axiom, we would be dealing with a new system-the MIU +MU 
system. A derivation in this extended system is presented: 
MU 
MUU 
axiom 
rule 2 
There is a MIU + MU-proof-pair which corresponds-namely, m = 30300, 
n = 300. Of course, this pair of numbers does not form a MIU-proof-
pair-only a MIU +MU-proof-pair. The addition of an extra axiom does 
not substantially complicate the arithmetical properties of proof-pairs. The 
significant fact about them-that being a proof-pair is primitive 
recursive-is preserved. 
The Godel Method Reapplied 
Now, returning to TNT+G, we will find a similar situation. TNT+G-
proof-pairs, like their predecessors. are primitive recursive, so they are 
represented inside TNT +G by a formula which we abbreviate in an obvi-
ous manner: 
(TNT +G)-PROOF-PAlR{a,a'} 
Now we just do everything all over again. We make the counterpart of G by 
beginning with an "uncle", just as before: 
-3a:3a':«TNT +G)-PROOF-PAlR{a,a'}AARlTHMOQUlNE{a",a'}> 
Let us say its Godel-number is u'. Now we arithmoquine this very uncle. 
That will give us G': 
466 
-3a:3a':«TNT +G)-PROOF-PAlR{a,a'} 
AARlTHMOQUlNE{SSS .... SSSO/a",a'}> 
~ 
u'S's 
Jumping out of the System 

Its interpretation is 
"There is no number a that forms a TNT +G-proof-pair 
with the arithmoquinification of u'." 
More concisely, 
"I Cannot Be Proven in Formal System TNT+G." 
Multifurcation 
Well (yawn), the details are quite boring from here on out. G' is precisely to 
TNT +G as G was to TNT itself. One finds that either G' or -G' can be 
added to TNT +G, to yield a further splitting of number theory. And, lest 
you think this only happens to the "good guys", this very same dastardly 
trick can be played upon TNT +-G-that is, upon the nonstandard exten-
sion of TNT gotten by adding G's negation. So now we see (Fig. 75) that 
there are all sorts of bifurcations in number theory: 
FICURE 75. 
"Multifurcation" of TNT. Each extension of TNT has its very own Cadet 
sentence; that sentence, or its negation, can be added on, so that from each extension there 
sprouts a pair of further extensions, a process which goes on ad infinitum. 
Of course, this is just the beginning. Let us imagine moving down the 
leftmost branch of this downwards-pointing tree, where we always toss in 
the Godel sentences (rather than their negations). This is the best we can do 
by way of eliminating supernaturals. After adding G, we add G'. Then we 
add Gil, and G'II, and so on. Each time we make a new extension of TNT, 
its vulnerability to the Tortoise's method-pardon me, I mean Godel's 
method-allows a new string to be devised, having the interpretation 
"I Cannot Be Proven in Formal System X." 
Jumping out of the System 
467 

Naturally, after a while, the whole process begins to seem utterly 
predictable and routine. Why, all the "holes" are made by one single 
technique! This means that, viewed as typographical objects, they are all 
cast from one single mold, which in turn means that one single axiom 
schema suffices to represent all of them! So if this is so, why not plug up all 
the holes at once and be done with this nasty business of incompleteness 
once and for all? This would be accomplished by adding an axiom schema to 
TNT, instead of just one axiom at a time. Specifically, this axiom schema 
would be the mold in which all of G, G', G", G''', etc., are cast. By adding 
this axiom schema (let's call it "G,u"), we would be outsmarting the "Godel-
ization" method. Indeed, it seems quite clear that adding Gw to TNT would 
be the last step necessary for the complete axiomatization of all of number-
theoretical truth. 
It was at about this point in the Contracrostipunctus that the Tortoise 
related the Crab's invention of "Record Player Omega". However, readers 
were left dangling as to the fate of that device, since before completing his 
tale, the tuckered-out Tortoise decided that he had best go home to sleep 
(but not before tossing off a sly reference to Godel's Incompleteness Theo-
rem). Now, at last, we can get around to clearing up that dangling detail ... 
Perhaps you already have an inkling, after reading the Birthday Cantatatata. 
Essential Incompleteness 
As you probably suspected, even this fantastic advance over TNT suffers 
the same fate. And what makes it quite weird is that it is still for, in essence, 
the same reason. The axiom schema is not powerful enough, and the Godel 
construction can again be effected. Let me spell this out a little. (One can do 
it much more rigorously tpan I shall here.) If there is a way of capturing the 
various strings G, G', G", G''', ... in a single typographical mold, then there 
is a way of describing their Godel numbers in a single arithmetical mold. 
And this arithmetical portrayal of an infinite class of numbers can then be 
represented inside TNT +Gw by some formula OMEGA-AXlOM{a} whose 
interpretation is: "a is the Godel number of one of the axioms coming from 
Gw". When a is replaced by any specific numeral, the formula which results 
will be a theorem of TNT +Gw if and only if the numeral stands for the 
Godel number of an axiom coming from the schema. 
With the aid of this new formula, it becomes possible to represent even 
such a complicated notion as TNT+Gw-proof-pairs inside TNT +Gw: 
(TNT +Gw)-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'} 
Using this formula, we can construct a new uncle, which we proceed to 
arithmoquine in the by now thoroughly familiar way, making yet another 
undecidable string, which will be called "TNT +Gw+I". At this point, you 
might well wonder, "Why isn't Gw+1 among the axioms created by the axiom 
schema Gw?" The answer is that Gw was not clever enough to foresee its own 
embeddability inside number theOl·Y. 
468 
Jumping out of the System 

In the Contracrostipunctus, one of the essential steps in the Tortoise's 
making an "unplayable record" was to get a hold of a manufacturer's 
blueprint of the record player which he was out to destroy. This was 
necessary so that he could figure out to what kinds of vibrations it was 
vulnerable, and then incorporate into his record such grooves as would 
code for sounds which would induce those vibrations. It is a close analogue 
to the Godel trick, in which the system's own properties are reflected inside 
the notion of proof-pairs, and then used against it. Any system, no matter 
how complex or tricky it is, can be Godel-numbered, and then the notion of 
its proof-pairs can be defined-and this is the petard by which it is hoist. 
Once a system is well-defined, or "boxed", it becomes vulnerable. 
This principle is excellently illustrated by the Cantor diagonal trick, 
which finds an omitted real number for each well-defined list of reals 
between 0 and 1. I t is the act of giving an explicit list-a "box" of reals-
which causes the downfall. Let us see how the Cantor trick can be repeated 
over and over again. Consider what happens if, starting with some list L, 
you do the following: 
(la) Take list L, and construct its diagonal number d. 
(lb) Throw d somewhere into list L, making a new list L +d. 
(2a) Take list L +d, and construct its diagonal number d'. 
(2b) Throw d' somewhere into list L +d, making a new list 
L+d+d'. 
Now this step-by-step process may seem a doltish way to patch up L, for we 
could have made the entire list d, d', d", d''', ... at once, given L originally. 
But if you think that making such a list will enable you to complete your list 
of reals, you are very wrong. The problem comes at the moment you ask, 
"Where to incorporate the list of diagonal numbers inside L?" No matter 
how diabolically clever a scheme you devise for ensconcing the d-numbers 
inside L, once you have done it, then the new list is still vulnerable. As was 
said above, it is the act of giving an explicit list-a "box" of reals-that 
causes the downfall. 
Now in the case of formal systems, it is the act of giving an explicit 
recipe for what supposedly characterizes number-theoretical truth that 
causes the incompleteness. This is the crux of the problem with TNT +Gw. 
Once you insert all the G's in a well-defined way into TNT, there is seen to 
be some other G-some unforeseen G-which you didn't capture in your 
axiom schema. And in the case of the TC-battle inside the Contracros-
tipunctus, the instant a record player's "architecture" is determined, the 
record player becomes capable of being shaken to pieces. 
So what is to be done? There is no end in sight. It appears that TNT, 
even when extended ad infinitum, cannot be made complete. TNT is 
therefore said to suffer from essential incompleteness because the incom-
Jumping out of the System 
469 

pleteness here is part and parcel of TNT; it is an essential part of the 
nature of TNT and cannot be eradicated in any way, whether simple-
minded or ingenious. What's more, this problem will haunt any formal 
version of number theory, whether it is an extension of TNT, a modifica-
tion of TNT, or an alternative to TNT. The fact of the matter is this: the 
possibility of constructing, in a given system, an undecidable string via 
Godel's self-reference method, depends on three basic conditions: 
(1) That the system should be rich enough so that all desired 
statements about numbers, whether true or false, can be 
expressed in it. (Failure on this count means that the system is 
from the very start too weak to be counted as a rival to TNT, 
because it can't even express number-theoretical notions that 
TNT can. In the metaphor of the Contracrostipunctus, it is as if 
one did not have a phonograph but a refrigerator or some 
other kind of object.) 
(2) 
That all general recursive relations should be represented by 
formulas in the system. (Failure on this count means the 
system fails to capture in a theorem some general recursive 
truth, which can only be considered a pathetic bellyftop if it is 
attempting to produce all of number theory's truths. In the 
Contracrostipunctus metaphor, this is like having a record 
player, but one of low fidelity.) 
(3) 
That the axioms and typographical patterns defined by its 
rules be recognizable by some terminating decision proce-
dure. (Failure on this count means that there is no method to 
distinguish valid derivations in the system from invalid 
ones-thus that the "formal system" is not formal after all, 
and in fact is not even well-defined. In the Contracrostipunctus 
metaphor, it is a phonograph which is still on the drawing 
board, only partially designed.) 
Satisfaction of these three conditions guarantees that any consistent system 
will be incomplete, because Godel's construction is applicable. 
The fascinating thing is that any such system digs its own hole; the 
system's own richness brings about its own downfall. The downfall occurs 
essentially because the system is powerful enough to have self-referential 
sentences. In physics, the notion exists of a "critical mass" of a fissionable 
substance, such as uranium. A solid lump ofthe substance will just sit there, 
if its mass is less than critical. But beyond the critical mass, such a lump will 
undergo a chain reaction, and blow up. It seems that with formal systems 
there is an analogous critical point. Below that point, a system is "harmless" 
and does not even approach defining arithmetical truth formally; but 
beyond the critical point, the system suddenly attains the capacity for 
self-reference, and thereby dooms itself to incompleteness. The threshold 
seems to be roughly when a system attains the three properties listed above. 
470 
Jumping out of the System 

Once this ability for self-reference is attained, the system has a hole which is 
tailor-made for itself; the hole takes the features of the system into account 
and uses them against the system. 
The Passion According to Lucas 
The baffling repeatability of the Godel argument has been used by various 
people-notably J. R. Lucas-as ammunition in the battle to show that 
there is some elusive and ineffable quality to human intelligence, which 
makes it unattainable by "mechanical automata"-that is, computers. Lucas 
begins his article "Minds, Machines, and Godel" with these words: 
Codel's theorem seems to me to prove that Mechanism is false, that is, that 
minds cannot be explained as machines. I 
Then he proceeds to give an argument which, paraphrased, runs like this. 
For a computer to be considered as intelligent as a person is, it must be able 
to do every intellectual task which a person can do. Now Lucas claims that 
no computer can do "Godelization" (one of his amusingly irreverent terms) 
in the manner that people can. Why not? Well, think of any particular 
formal system, such as TNT, or TNT + G, or even TNT + Gw. One can write 
a computer program rather easily which will systematically generate theo-
rems of that system, and in such a manner that eventually, any preselected 
theorem will be printed out. That is, the theorem-generating program 
won't skip any portion of the "space" of all theorems. Such a program 
would be composed of two major parts: (1) a subroutine which stamps out 
axioms, given the "molds" of the axiom schemas (if there are any), and (2) a 
subroutine which takes known theorems (including axioms, of course) and 
applies rules of inference to produce new theorems. The program would 
alternate between running first one of these subroutines, and then the 
other. 
We can anthropomorphically say that this program "knows" some facts 
of number theory-namely, it knows those facts which it prints out. If it 
fails to print out some true fact of number theory, then of course it doesn't 
"know" that fact. Therefore, a computer program will be inferior to human 
beings if it can be shown that humans know something which the program 
cannot know. Now here is where Lucas starts rolling. He says that we 
humans can always do the Godel trick on any formal system as powerful as 
TNT-and hence no matter what the formal system, we know more than it 
does. Now this may only sound like an argument about formal systems, but 
it can also be slightly modified so that it becomes, seemingly, an invincible 
argument against the possibility of Artificial Intelligence ever reproducing 
the human level of intelligence. Here is the gist of it: 
Rigid internal codes entirely rule computers and robots; ergo ... 
Computers are isomorphic to formal systems. Now ... 
Any computer which wants to be as smart as we are has got to be 
able to do number theory as well as we can, so ... 
Jumping out of the System 
471 

Among other things, it has to be able to do primitive recursive 
arithmetic. But for this very reason ... 
It is vulnerable to the Godelian "hook", which implies that ... 
We, with our human intelligence, can concoct a certain statement 
of number theory which is true, but the computer is blind to 
that statement's truth (i.e., will never print it out), precisely 
because of Godel's boomeranging argument. 
This implies that there is one thing which computers just cannot 
be programmed to do, but which we can do. So we are 
smarter. 
Let us enjoy, with Lucas, a transient moment of anthropocentric glory: 
However complicated a machine we construct, it will, if it is a machine, 
correspond to a formal system, which in turn will be liable to the Godel 
procedure for finding a formula unprovable-in-that-system. This formula the 
machine will be unable to produce as being true, although a mind can see it is 
true. And so the machine will still not be an adequate model of the mind. We 
are trying to produce a model of the mind which is mechanical-which is 
essentially "dead"-but the mind, being in fact "alive," can always go one 
better than any formal, ossified, dead system can. Thanks to GOdd's theorem, 
the mind always has the last word. 2 
On first sight, and perhaps even on careful analysis, Lucas' argument 
appears compelling. It usually evokes rather polarized reactions. Some 
seize onto it as a nearly religious proof of the existence of souls, while 
others laugh it off as being unworthy of comment. I feel it is wrong, but 
fascinatingly so-and therefore quite worthwhile taking the time to rebut. 
In fact, it was one of the major early forces driving me to think over the 
matters in this book. I shall try to rebut it in one way in this Chapter, and in 
other ways in Chapter XVII. 
We must try to understand more deeply why Lucas says the computer 
cannot be programmed to "know" as much as we do. Basically the idea is 
that we are always outside the system, and from out there we can always 
perform the "Godelizing" operation, which yields something which the 
program, from within, can't see is true. But why can't the "Godelizing 
operator", as Lucas calls it, be programmed and added to the program as a 
third major component? Lucas explains: 
The procedure whereby the Godelian formula is constructed is a standard 
procedure-only so could we be sure that a Godelian formula can be con-
structed for every formal system. But if it is a standard procedure, then a 
machine should be able to be programmed to carry it out too .... This would 
correspond to having a system with an additional rule of inference which 
allowed one to add, as a theorem, the GOdelian formula of the rest of the 
formal system, and then the Godelian formula of this new, strengthened, 
formal system, and so on. It would be tantamount to adding to the original 
formal system an infinite sequence of axioms, each the Godelian formula of 
the system hitherto obtained .... We might expect a mind, faced with a 
machine that possessed a Godelizing operator, to take this into account, and 
472 
Jumping out of the System 

out-Codel the new machine, Codelizing operator and all. This has, in fact, 
proved to be the case. Even if we adjoin to a formal system the infinite set of 
axioms consisting of the successive Codelian formulae, the resulting system is 
still incomplete, and contains a formula which cannot be proved-iri-the-
system, although a rational being can, standing outside the system, see that it 
is true, We had expected this, for even if an infinite set of axioms were added, 
they would have to be specified by some finite rule or specification, and this 
further rule or specification could then be taken into account by a mind 
considering the enlarged formal system. In a sense,just because the mind has 
the last word, it can always pick a hole in any formal system presented to it as a 
model of its own workings. The mechanical model must be, in some sense, 
finite and definite: and then the mind can always go one better.3 
Jumping Up a Dimension 
A visual image provided by M, C. Escher is extremely useful in aiding the 
intuition here: his drawing Dragon (Fig, 76). Its most salient feature is, of 
course, its subject matter-a dragon biting its tail, with all the G6delian 
connotations which that carries. But there is a deeper theme to this picture, 
Escher himself wrote the following most interesting comments. The first 
comment is about a set of his drawings all of which are concerned with "the 
conflict between the flat and the spatial"; the second comment is about 
Dragon in particular. 
I. Our three-dimensional space is the only true reality we know. The two-
dimensional is every bit as fictitious as the four-dimensional, for nothing is 
flat, not even the most finely polished mirror. And yet we stick to the conven-
tion that a wall or a piece of paper is flat, and curiously enough, we still go on, 
as we have done since time immemorial, producing illusions of space on just 
such plane surfaces as these. Surely it is a bit absurd to draw a few lines and 
then claim: "This is a house". This odd situation is the theme of the next five 
pictures [including Dragon).4 
II. 
However much this dragon tries to be spatial, he remains completely flat. 
Two incisions are made in the paper on which he is printed. Then it is folded 
in such a way as to leave two square openings. But this dragon is an obstinate 
beast, and in spite of his two dimensions he persists in assuming that he has 
three; so he sticks his head through one of the holes and his tail through the 
other. 5 
This second remark especially is a very telling remark. The message is that 
no matter how cleverly you try to simulate three dimensions in two, you are 
always missing some "essence of three-dimensionality". The dragon tries 
very hard to fight his two-dimensionality. He defies the two-dimensionality 
of the paper on which he thinks he is drawn, by sticking his head through 
it; and yet all the while, we outside the drawing can see the pathetic futility 
of it all, for the dragon and the holes and the folds are all merely two-
dimensional simulations of those concepts, and not a one of them is real. 
But the dragon cannot step out of his two-dimensional space, and cannot

know it as we do. We could, in fact, carry the Escher picture any number of 
steps further. For instance, we could tear it out of the book, fold it, cut 
holes in it, pass it through itself, and photograph the whole mess, so that it 
again becomes two-dimensional. And to that photograph, we could once 
again do the same trick. Each time, at the instant that it becomes two-
dimensional-no matter how cleverly we seem to have simulated three 
dimensions inside two-it becomes vulnerable to being cut and folded 
again. 
474 
Jumping out of the System 

Now with this wonderful Escherian metaphor, let us return to the 
program versus the human. We were talking about trying to encapsulate 
the "Godelizing operator" inside the program itself. Well, even if we had 
written a program which carried the operation out, that program would 
not capture the essence of Godel's method. For once again, we, outside the 
system, could still "zap" it in a way which it couldn't do. But then are we 
arguing with, or against, Lucas? 
The Limits of Intelligent Systems 
Against. For the very fact that we cannot write a program to do "Godeliz-
ing" must make us somewhat suspicious that we ourselves could do it in 
every case. It is one thing to make the argument in the abstract that 
Godelizing "can be done"; it is another thing to know how to do it in every 
particular case. In fact, as the formal systems (or programs) escalate in 
complexity, our own ability to "Godelize" will eventually begin to waver. It 
must, since, as we have said above, we do not have any algorithmic way of 
describing how to perform it. If we can't tell explicitly what is involved in 
applying the Godel method in all cases, then for each of us there will 
eventually come some case so complicated that we simply can't figure out 
how to apply it. 
Of course, this borderline of one's abilities will be somewhat ill-
defined, just as is the borderline of weights which one can pick up off the 
ground. While on some days you may not be able to pick up a 250-pound 
object, on other days maybe you can. Nevertheless, there are no days 
whatsoever on which you can pick up a 250-ton object. And in this sense, 
though everyone's Godelization threshold is vague, for each person, there 
are systems which lie far beyond his ability to Godelize. 
This notion is illustrated in the Birthday Cantatatata. At first, it seems 
obvious that the Tortoise can proceed as far as he wishes in pestering 
Achilles. But then Achilles tries to sum up all the answers in a single swoop. 
This is a move of a different character than any that has gone before, and is 
given the new name 'w'. The newness of the name is quite important. It is 
the first example where the old naming scheme-which only included 
names for all the natural numbers-had to be transcended. Then come 
some more extensions, some of whose names seem quite obvious, others of 
which are rather tricky. But eventually, we run out of names once again-at 
the point where the answer-schemas 
w 
WW 
w, w, w , ... 
are all subsumed into one outrageously complex answer schema. The 
altogether new name 'Eo' is supplied for this one. And the reason a 
new name is needed is that some fundamentally new kind of step has 
been taken-a sort of irregularity has been encountered. Thus a new name 
must be supplied ad hoc. 
Jumping out of the System 
475 

There Is No Recursive Rule for Naming Ordinals 
Now offband you might think that these irregularities in the progression 
from ordinal to ordinal (as these names of infinity are called) could be 
handled by a computer program. That is, there would be a program to 
produce new names in a regular way, and when it ran out of gas, it would 
invoke the "irregularity handler", which would supply a new name, and 
pass control back to the simple one. But this will not work. It turns out that 
the irregularities themselves happen in irregular ways, and one would need 
also a second-order program-that is, a program which makes new pro-
grams which make new names. And even this is not enough. Eventually, a 
third-order program becomes necessary. And so on, and so on. 
All of this perhaps ridiculous-seeming complexity stems from a deep 
theorem, due to Alonzo Church and Stephen C. Kleene, about the struc-
ture of these "infinite ordinals", which says: 
There is no recursively related notation-system 
which gives a name to every constructive ordinal. 
What "recursively related notation-systems" are, and what "constructive 
ordinals" are, we must leave to the more technical sources, such as Hartley 
Rogers' book, to explain. But the intuitive idea has been presented. As the 
ordinals get bigger and bigger, there are irregularities, and irregularities in 
the irregularities, and irregularities in the irregularities in the ir-
regularities, etc. No single scheme, no matter how complex, can name all 
the ordinals. And from this, it follows that no algorithmic method can tell 
how to apply the method of Codel to all possible kinds of formal systems. 
And unless one is rather mystically inclined, therefore one must conclude 
that any human being simply will reach the limits of his own ability to 
Codelize at some point. From there on out, formal systems of that complex-
ity, though admittedly incomplete for the Codel reason, will have as much 
power as that human being. 
Other Refutations of Lucas 
Now this is only one way to argue against Lucas' position. There are others, 
possibly more powerful, which we shall present later. But this counter-
argument has special interest because it brings up the fascinating concept 
of trying to create a computer program which' can get outside of itself, see 
itself completely from the outside, and apply the Codel zapping-trick to 
itself. Of course this is just as impossible as for a record player to be able to 
play records which would cause it to break. 
But-one should not consider TNT defective for that reason. If there 
is a defect anywhere, it is not in TNT, but in our expectations of what it 
should be able to do. Furthermore, it is helpful to realize that we are equally 
vulnerable to the word trick which Godel transplanted into mathematical 
formalisms: the Epimenides paradox. This was quite cleverly pointed out 
476 
Jumping out of the System 

by C. H. Whitely, when he proposed the sentence "Lucas cannot consis-
tently assert this sentence." If you think about it, you will see that (1) it is 
true, and yet (2) Lucas cannot consistently assert it. So Lucas is also "incom-
plete" with respect to truths about the world. The way in which he mirrors 
the world in his brain structures prevents him from simultaneously being 
"consistent" and asserting that true sentence. But Lucas is no more vulner-
able than any of us. He is just on a par with a sophisticated formal system. 
An amusing way to see the incorrectness of Lucas' argument is to 
translate it into a battle between men and women ... In his wanderings, 
Loocus the Thinker one day comes across an unknown object-a woman. 
Such a thing he has never seen before, and at first he is wondrous thrilled at 
her likeness to himself; but then, slightly scared of her as well, he cries to all 
the men about him, "Behold! I can look upon her face, which is something 
she cannot do-therefore women can never be like me!" And thus he 
proves man's superiority over women, much to his relief, and that of his 
male companions. Incidentally, the same argument proves that Loocus is 
superior to all other males, as well-but he doesn't point that out to them. 
The woman argues back: "Yes, you can see my face, which is something I 
can't do-but I can see your face, which is something you can't do! We're 
even." However, Loocus comes up with an unexpected counter: "I'm sorry, 
you're deluded if you think you can see my face. What you women do is not 
the same as what we men do-it is, as I have already pointed out, of an 
inferior caliber, and does not deserve to be called by the same name. You 
may call it 'womanseeing'. Now the fact that you can 'womansee' my face is 
of no import, because the situation is not symmetric. You see?" "I woman-
see," womanreplies the woman, and womanwalks away ... 
Well, this is the kind of "heads-in-the-sand" argument which you have 
to be willing to stomach if you are bent on seeing men and women running 
ahead of computers in these intellectual battles. 
Self-Transcendence-A Modern Myth 
It is still of great interest to ponder whether we humans ever can jump out 
of ourselves--or whether computer programs can jump out of themselves. 
Certainly it is possible for a program to modify itself-but such modifiabil-
ity has to be inherent in the program to start with, so that cannot be 
counted as an example of "jumping out of the system". No matter how a 
program twists and turns to get out of itself, it is still following the rules 
inherent in itself. It is no more possible for it to escape than it is for a 
human being to decide voluntarily not to obey the laws of physics. Physics is 
an overriding system, from which there can be no escape. However, there is 
a lesser ambition which it is possible to achieve: that is, one can certainly 
jump from a subsystem of one's brain into a wider subsystem. One can step 
out of ruts on occasion. This is still due to the interaction of various 
subsystems of one's brain, but it can feel very much like stepping entirely 
out of oneself. Similarly, it is entirely conceivable that a partial ability to 
"step outside of itself" could be embodied in a computer program. 
Jumping out of the System 
477 

However, it is important to see the distinction between perceiving one-
self, and transcending oneself. You can gain visions of yourself in all sorts of 
ways-in a mirror, in photos or movies, on tape, through the descriptions 
of others, by getting psychoanalyzed, and so on. But you cannot quite break 
out of your own skin and be 011 the outside of yourself (modern occult 
movements, pop psychology fads, etc. notwithstanding). TNT can talk 
about itself, but it cannot jump out of itself. A computer program can 
modify itself but it cannot violate its own instructions-it can at best change 
some parts of itself by obeying its own instructions. This is reminiscent of the 
humorous paradoxical question, "Can God make a stone so heavy that he 
can't lift it?" 
Advertisement and Framing Devices 
This drive to jump out of the system is a pervasive one, and lies behind all 
progress in art, music, and other human endeavors. It also lies behind such 
trivial undertakings as the making of radio and television commercials. 
This insidious trend has been beautifully perceived and described by 
Erving Goffman in his book Frame Analysis: 
For example, an obviously professional actor completes a commercial pitch 
and, with the camera still on him, turns in obvious relief from his task, now to 
take real pleasure in consuming the product he had been advertising. 
This is, of course, but one example of the way in which TV and radio 
commercials are coming to exploit framing devices to give an appearance of 
naturalness that (it is hoped) will override the reserve auditors have de-
veloped. Thus, use is currently being made of children's voices, presumably 
because these seem unschooled; street noises, and other effects to give the 
impression of interviews with unpaid respondents; false starts, filled pauses, 
byplays, and overlapping speech to ~imulate actual conversation; and, follow-
ing Welles, the interception of a finn's jingle commercials to give news of its 
new product, alternating occasionally with interception by a public interest 
spot, this presumably keeping the faith of the auditor alive. 
The more that auditors withdraw to minor expressive details as a test of 
genuineness, the more that advertisers chase after them. What results is a sort 
of interaction pollution, a disordel' t.hat is also spread by the public relations 
consultants of political figures, and, more modestly, by micro-sociology.6 
Here we have yet another example of an escalating "TC-battle"-the an-
tagonists this time being Truth and Commercials. 
Simplicio, Salviati, Sagredo: Why Three? 
There is a fascinating connection between the problem of jumping out of 
the system and the quest for complete objectivity. When I read Jauch's four 
Dialogues in Are Quanta Real? based on Galileo's four Dialogues Concerning 
Two New Sciences, I found myself wondering why there were three characters 
participating: Simplicio, Salviati, and Sagredo. Why wouldn't two have 
478 
Jumping out of the System 

sufficed: Simplicio, the educated simpleton, and Salviati, the knowledge-
able thinker? What function does Sagredo have? Well, he is supposed to be a 
sort of neutral third party, dispassionately weighing the two sides and 
coming out with a "fair" and "impartial" judgment. It sounds very bal-
anced, and yet there is a problem: Sagredo is always agreeing with Salviati, 
not with Simplicio. How come Objectivity Personified is playing favorites? 
One answer, of course, is that Salviati is enunciating correct views, so 
Sagredo has no choice. But what, then, of fairness or "equal time"? 
By adding Sagredo, Calileo (and Jauch) stacked the deck more against 
Simplicio, rather than less. Perhaps there should be added a yet higher-
level Sagredo-someone who will be objective about this whole situation ... 
You can see where it is going. We are getting into a never-ending series of 
"escalations in objectivity", which have the curious property of never get-
ting any more objective than at the first level: where Salviati is simply right, 
and Simplicio wrong. So the puzzle remains: why add Sagredo at all? And 
the answer is, it gives the illusion of stepping out of the system, in some 
intuitively appealing sense. 
Zen and "Stepping Out" 
In Zen, too, we can see this preoccupation with the concept of transcending 
the system. For instance, the koan in which Tozan tells his monks that "the 
higher Buddhism is not Buddha". Perhaps, self-transcendence is even the 
central theme of Zen. A Zen person is always trying to understand more 
deeply what he is, by stepping more and more out of what he sees himself 
to be, by breaking every rule and convention which he perceives himself to 
be chained by-needless to say, including those of Zen itself. Somewhere 
along this elusive path may come enlightenment. In any case (as I see it), 
the hope is that by gradually deepening one's self-awareness, by gradually 
widening the scope of "the system", one will in the end come to a feeling of 
being at one with the entire universe.

Edifying Thoughts 
of a Tobacco Smoker 
Achilles has been invited to the Crab's home. 
Achilles: 
I see you have made a few additions since I was last here, Mr. 
Crab. Your new paintings are especially striking. 
Crab: 
Thank you. I am quite fond of certain painters-especially Rene 
Magritte. Most of the paintings I have are by him. He's my favorite 
artist. 
Achilles: 
They are very intriguing Images, I must say. In some ways, these 
paintings by Magritte remind me of works by MY favorite artist, M. C. 
Escher. 
Crab: 
I can see that. Both Magritte and Escher use great realism in 
exploring the worlds of paradox and illusion; both have a sure sense 
for the evocative power of certain visual symbols, and-something 
which even their admirers often fail to point out-both of them have a 
sense of the graceful line. 
Achilles: 
Nevertheless, there is something quite different about them. I 
wonder how one could characterize that difference. 
Crab: 
It would be fascinating to compare the two in detail. 
Achilles: 
I must say, Magritte's command of realism is astonishing. For 
instance, I was quite taken in by that painting over there of a tree with 
a giant pipe behind it.

Crab: 
You mean, a normal pipe with a tiny tree in front of it! 
Achilles: 
Oh, is that what it is? Well, in any case, when I first spotted it, I 
was convinced I was smelling pipe smoke! Can you imagine how silly I 
felt? 
Crab: 
I quite understand. My guests are often taken in by that one. 
(So saying, he reaches up, removes the pipe from behind the tree in the 
painting, turns it over and taps it against the table, and the room begins to 
reek of pipe tobacco. He begins packing in a new wad of tobacco.) 
This is a fine old pipe, Achilles. Believe it or not, the bowl has a copper 
lining, which makes it age wonderfully. 
Achilles: 
A copper lining! You don't say! 
Crab (pulls out a box of matches, and lights his pipe): 
Would you care for a 
smoke, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
No, thank you. I only smoke cigars now and then. 
Crab: 
No problem! I have one right here! (Reaches out towards another 
Magritte painting, featuring a bicycle mounted upon a lit cigar.) 
Achilles: 
Uhh-no thank you, not now. 
Crab: 
As you will. I myself am an incurable tobacco smoker. Which re-
minds me-you undoubtedly know of Old Bach's predilection for pipe 
smoking? 
Achilles: 
I don't recall exactly. 
Crab: 
Old Bach was fond of versifying, philosophizing, pipe smoking, and

music making (not necessarily in that order). He combined all four into 
a droll poem which he set to music. It can be found in the famous 
musical notebook he kept for his wife, Anna Magdalena, and it is called 
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker! 
Whene'er I take my pipe and stuff it 
And smoke to pass the time away, 
My thoughts, as I sit there and puff it, 
Dwell on a picture sad and gray: 
It teaches me that very like 
Am I myself unto my pipe. 
Like me, this pipe so fragrant burning 
Is made of naught but earth and clay; 
To earth I too shall be returning. 
It falls and, ere I'd think to say, 
It breaks in two before my eyes; 
In store for me a like fate lies. 
No stain the pipe's hue yet doth darken; 
It remains white. Thus do I know 
That when to death's call I must harken 
My body, too, all pale will grow. 
To black beneath the sod 'twill turn, 
Likewise the pipe, if oft it burn. 
Or when the pipe is fairly glowing, 
Behold then, instantaneously, 
The smoke off into thin air going, 
Till naught but ash is left to see. 
Man's fame likewise away will burn 
And unto dust his body turn. 
How oft it happens when one's smoking: 
The stopper's missing from its shelf, 
And one goes with one's finger poking 
Into the bowl and burns oneself. 
If in the pipe such pain doth dwell, 
How hot must be the pains of hell. 
Thus o'er my pipe, in contemplation 
Of such things, I can constantly 
Indulge in fruitful meditation, 
And so, puffing contentedly, 
On land, on sea, at home, abroad, 
I smoke my pipe and worship God. 
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 

A charming philosophy, is it not? 
Achilles: 
Indeed. Old Bach was a turner of phrases quite pleasin'. 
Crab: 
You took the very words from my mouth. You know, in my time I 
have tried to write clever verses. But I fear mine don't measure up to 
much. I don't have such a way with words. 
Achilles: 
Oh, come now, Mr. Crab. You have-how to put it?-quite a 
penchant for trick'ry and teasin'. I'd be honored if you'd sing me one 
of your songs, Mr. C. 
Crab: 
I'm most flattered. How about if I play you a record of myself 
singing one of my efforts? I don't remember when it dates from. Its 
title is "A Song Without Time or Season". 
Achilles: 
How poetic! 
(The Crab pulls a record from his shelves, and walks over to a huge, 
complex piece of apparatus. He opens it up, and inserts the record into an 
ominous-looking mechanical mouth. Suddenly a bright flash of greenish 
light sweeps over the surface of the record, and after a moment, the record 
is silently whisked into some hidden belly of the fantastic machine. A 
moment passes, and then the strains of the Crab's voice ring out.) 
A turner of phrases quite pleasin', 
Had a penchant for trick'ry and teasin'. 
In his songs, the last line 
Might seem sans design; 
What I mean is, without why or wherefore. 
Achilles: 
Lovely! Only, I'm puzzled by one thing. It seems to me that in 
your song, the last line is-
Crab: 
Sans design? 
Achilles: 
No ... What I mean is, without rhyme or reason. 
Crab: 
You could be right. 
Achilles: 
Other than that, it's a very nice song, but I must say I am even 
more intrigued by this monstrously complex contraption. Is it merely 
an oversized record player? 
Crab: 
Oh, no, it's much more than that. This is my Tortoise-chomping 
record player. 
Achilles: 
Good grief! 
Crab: 
Well, I don't mean that it chomps up Tortoises. But it chomps up 
records produced by Mr. Tortoise. 
Achilles: 
Whew! That's a little milder. Is this part of that weird musical 
battle that evolved between you and Mr. T some time ago? 
Crab: 
In a way. Let me explain a little more fully. You see, Mr. Tortoise's 
sophistication had reached the point where he seemed to be able to 
destroy almost any record player I would obtain. 
Achilles: 
But when I last heard about your rivalry, it seemed to me you had 
at last come into possession of an invincible phonograph-one with a

built-in TV camera, minicomputer and so on, which could take itself 
apart and rebuild itself in such a way that it would not be destroyed. 
Crab: 
Alack and alas! My plan was foiled. For Mr. Tortoise took advan-
tage of one small detail which I had overlooked: the subunit which 
directed the disassembly and reassembly processes was itself stable 
during the entire process. That is, for obvious reasons, it could not 
take itself apart and rebuild itself, so it stayed intact. 
Achilles: 
Yes, but what consequences did that have? 
Crab: 
Oh, the direst ones! For you see, Mr. T focused his method down 
onto that subunit entirely. 
Achilles: 
How is that? 
Crab: 
He simply made a record which would induce fatal vibrations in 
the one structure he knew would never change-the disassembly-
reassembly subunit. 
Achilles: 
Oh, I see ... Very sneaky. 
Crab: 
Yes, so I thought, too. And his strategy worked. Not the first time, 
mind you. I thought I had outwitted him when my phonograph 
survived his first onslaught. I laughed gleefully. But the next time, he 
returned with a steely glint in his eye, and I knew he meant business. I 
placed his new record on my turntable. Then, both of us eagerly 
watched the computer-directed subunit carefully scan the grooves, 
then dismount the record, disassemble the record player, reassemble it 
in an astonishingly different way, remount the record-and then 
slowly lower the needle into the outermost groove. 
Achilles: 
Golly! 
Crab: 
No sooner had the first strains of sound issued forth than a loud 
SMASH! filled the room. The whole thing fell apart, but particularly 
badly destroyed was the assembler-disassembler. In that painful in-
stant I finally realized, to my chagrin, that the Tortoise would ALWAYS 
be able to focus down upon-if you'll pardon the phrase-the Achilles' 
heel of the system. 
Achilles: 
Upon my soul! You must have felt devastated. 
Crab: 
Yes, I felt rather forlorn for a while. But, happily, that was not the 
end of the story. There is a sequel to the tale, which taught me a 
valuable lesson, which I may pass on to you. On the Tortoise's recom-
mendation, I was browsing through a curious book filled with strange 
Dialogues about many subjects, including molecular biology, fugues, 
Zen Buddhism, and heaven knows what else. 
Achilles: 
Probably some crackpot wrote it. What is the book called? 
Crab: If I recall correctly, it was called Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible 
Metallic Alloy. 
Achilles: 
Oh, Mr. Tortoise told me about it, too. It's by a friend of his, who, 
it appears, is quite taken with metal-logic. 
Crab: 
I wonder which friend it is ... Anyway, in one of the Dialogues, I 
encountered some Edifying Thoughts on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus, 
ribosomes, and other strange things I had never heard of. 
484 
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 

FIGURE 79. 
Tobacco Mosaic Virus. 
[From A. Lehninger, Biochemistry ( New York: 
Worth Publishers, 1976).] 
Achilles: 
What is the Tobacco Mosaic Virus? What are ribosomes? 
Crab: 
I can't quite say, for I'm a total dunce when it comes to biology. All I 
know is what I gathered from that Dialogue. There, it said that To-
bacco Mosaic Viruses are tiny cigarette-like objects that cause a disease 
in tobacco plants. 
Achilles: 
Cancer? 
Crab: 
No, not exactly, but-
Achilles: 
What next? A tobacco plant smoking, and getting cancer! Serves 
it right! 
Crab: 
I believe you've jumped to a hasty conclusion, Achilles. Tobacco 
plants don't SMOKE these "cigarettes". The nasty little "cigarettes" just 
come and attack them, uninvited. 
Achilles: 
I see. Well, now that I know all about Tobacco Mosaic Viruses, 
tell me what a ribosome is. 
Crab: 
Ribosomes are apparently some sort of subcellular entities which 
take a message in one form and convert it into a message in another 
form. 
Achilles: 
Something like a teeny tape recorder or phonograph? 
Crab: 
Metaphorically, I suppose so. Now the thing which caught my eye 
was a line where this one exceedingly droll character mentions the fact 
that ribosomes-as well as Tobacco Mosaic Viruses and certain other 
bizarre biological structures-possess "the baffling ability to spontane-
ously self-assemble". Those were his exact words. 
Achilles: 
That was one of his droller lines, I take it. 
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 
485 

Crab: 
That's just what the other character in the Dialogue thought. But 
that's a preposterous interpretation of the statement. (The Crab draws 
deeply from his pipe, and puffs several billows of smoke into the air.) 
Achilles: 
Well, what does "spontaneous self-assembly" mean, then? 
Crab: 
The idea is that when some biological units inside a cell are taken 
apart, they can spontaneously reassemble themselves-without being 
directed by any other unit. The pieces just come together, and 
prestol-they stick. 
Achilles: 
That sounds like magic. Wouldn't it be wonderful if a full-sized 
record player could have that property? I mean, if a miniature "record 
player" such as a ribosome can do it, why not a big one? That would 
allow you to create an indestructible phonograph, right? Any time it 
was broken, it would just put itself together again. 
Crab: 
Exactly my thought. I breathlessly rushed a letter off to my man-
ufacturer explaining the concept of self-assembly, and asked him if he 
could build me a record player which could take itself apart and 
spontaneously self-assemble in another form. 
Achilles: 
A hefty bill to fill. 
Crab: 
True; but after several months, he wrote to me that he had suc-
ceeded, at long last-and indeed he sent me quite a hefty bill. One fine 
day, hoI My Grand Self-assembling Record Player arrived in the mail, 
and it was with great confidence that I telephoned Mr. Tortoise, and 
invited him over for the purpose of testing my ultimate record player. 
Achilles: 
So this magnificent object before us must be the very machine of 
which you speak. 
Crab: 
I'm afraid not, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
Don't tell me that once again ... 
Crab: 
What you suspect, my dear friend, is unfortunately the case. I don't 
pretend to understand the reasons why. The whole thing is too painful 
to recount. To see all those springs and wires chaotically strewn about 
on the floor, and puffs of smoke here and there-oh, me ... 
Achilles: 
There, there, Mr. Crab, don't take it too badly. 
Crab: 
I'm quite all right; I just have these spells every so often. Well, to go 
on, after Mr. Tortoise's initial gloating, he at last realized how sorrow-
ful I was feeling, and took pity. He tried to comfort me by explaining 
that it couldn't be helped-it all had to do with somebody-or-other's 
"Theorem", but I couldn't follow a word of it. It sounded like "Turtle's 
Theorem". 
Achilles: 
I wonder if it was that "Godel's Theorem" which he spoke of once 
before to me ... It has a rather sinister ring to it. 
Crab: 
It could be. I don't recall. 
Achilles: 
I can assure you, Mr. Crab, that I have followed this tale with the 
utmost empathy for your position. It is truly sad. But, you mentioned 
that there was a silver lining. Pray tell, what was that? 
Crab: 
Oh, yes-the silver lining. Well, eventually, I abandoned my quest 
after "Perfection" in phonographs., and decided that I might do better 
486 
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 

to tighten up my defenses against the Tortoise's records. I concluded 
that a more modest aim than a record player which can play anything 
is simply a record player that can SURVIVE: one that will avoid getting 
destroyed-even if that means that it can only playa few particular 
records. 
Achilles: 
So you decided you would develop sophisticated anti-Tortoise 
mechanisms at the sacrifice of being able to reproduce every possible 
sound, eh? 
Crab: 
Well ... I wouldn't exactly say I "decided" it. More accurate would 
be to say that I was FORCED into that position. 
Achilles: 
Yes, I can see what you mean. 
Crab: 
My new idea was to prevent all "alien" records from being played on 
my phonograph. I knew my own records are harmless, and so if I 
prevented anyone else from infiltrating THEIR records, that would 
protect my record player, and still allow me to enjoy my recorded 
musIC. 
Achilles: 
An excellent strategy for your new goal. Now does this giant 
thing before us represent your accomplishments to date along those 
lines? 
Crab: 
That it does. Mr. Tortoise, of course, has realized that he must 
change HIS strategy, as well. His main goal is now to devise a record 
which can slip past my censors-a new type of challenge. 
Achilles: 
For your part, how are you planning to keep his and other "alien" 
records out? 
Crab: 
You promise you won't reveal my strategy to Mr. T, now? 
Achilles: 
Tortoise's honor. 
Crab: 
What!? 
Achilles: 
Oh-it'sjust a phrase I've picked up from Mr. T. Don't worry-I 
swear your secret will remain secret with me. 
Crab: 
All right, then. My basic plan is to use a LABELING technique. To 
each and everyone of my records will be attached a secret label. Now 
the phonograph before you contains, as did its predecessors, a televi-
sion camera for scanning the records, and a computer for processing 
the data obtained in the scan and controlling subsequent operations. 
My idea is simply to chomp all records which do not bear the proper 
label! 
Achilles: 
Ah, sweet revenge! But it seems to me that your plan will be easy 
to foil. All Mr. T needs to do is to get a hold of one of your records, 
and copy its label! 
Crab: 
Not so simple, Achilles. What makes you think he will be able to tell 
the label from the rest of the record? It may be better integrated than 
you suspect. 
Achilles: 
Do you mean that it could be mixed up somehow with the actual 
music? 
Crab: 
Precisely. But there is. a way to disentangle the two. It requires 
sucking the data off the record visually, and then-
Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 
487 

Achilles: 
Is that what that bright green flash was for? 
Crab: 
That's right. That was the TV camera scanning the grooves. The 
groove-patterns were sent to the minicomputer, which analyzed the 
musical style of the piece I had put on-all in silence. Nothing had 
been played yet. 
Achilles: 
Then is there a screening process, which eliminates pieces which 
aren't in the proper styles? 
Crab: 
You've got it, Achilles. The only records which can pass this second 
test are records of pieces in my own style-and it will be hopelessly 
difficult for Mr. T to imitate that. So you see, I am convinced I will win 
this new musical battle. However, I should mention that Mr. T is 
equally convinced that somehow, he will manage to slip a record past 
my censors. 
Achilles: 
And smash your marvelous machine to smithereens? 
Crab: 
Oh, no-he has proved his point on that. Now he just wants to 
prove to me that he can slip a record-an innocuous one-by me, no 
matter what measures I take to prevent it. He keeps on muttering 
things about songs with strange titles, such as "I Can Be Played on 
Record Player X". But he can't scare ME! The only thing that worries 
me a little is that, as before, he seems to have some murky arguments 
which ... which ... (He trails off into silence. Then, looking quite pensive, he 
takes a few puffs on his pipe.) 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... I'd say Mr. Tortoise has an impossible task on his 
hands. He's met his match, at long last! 
Crab: 
Curious that you should think so ... I don't suppose that you know 
Henkin's Theorem forwards and backwards, do you? 
Achilles: 
Know WHOSE Theorem forwards and backwards? I've never 
heard of anything that sounds like that. I'm sure it's fascinating, but I'd 
rather hear more about "music to infiltrate phonographs by". It's an 
amusing little story. Actually, I guess I can fill in the end. Obviously, 
Mr. T will find out that there is no point in going on, and so he will 
sheepishly admit defeat, and that will be that. Isn't that exactly it? 
Crab: 
That's what I'm hoping, at least. Would you like to see a little bit of 
the inner workings of my defensive phonograph? 
Achilles: 
Gladly. I've always wanted to see a working television camera. 
Crab: 
No sooner said than done, my friend. (Reaches into the gaping "mouth" 
of the large phonograph, undoes a couple of snaps, and pulls out a neatly 
packaged instrument.) You see, the whole thing is built of independent 
modules, which can be detached and used independently. This TV 
camera, for instance, works very well by itself. Watch the screen over 
there, beneath the painting with the flaming tuba. (He points the camera 
at Achilles, whose face instantly appears on the large screen.) 
Achilles: 
Terrific! May I try it out? 
Crab: 
Certainly. 
Achilles (pointing the camera at the Crab): 
There YOU are, Mr. Crab, on the 
screen.

Crab: 
So I am. 
Achilles: 
Suppose I point the camera at the painting with the burning 
tuba. Now it is on the screen, too! 
Crab: 
The camera can zoom in and out, Achilles. You ought to try it. 
Achilles: 
Fabulous! Let me just focus down onto the tip of those flames, 
where they meet the picture frame ... It's such a funny feeling to be 
able to instantaneously "copy" anything in the room-anything I 
want-onto that screen. I merely need to point the camera at it, and it 
pops like magic onto the screen. 
Crab: 
ANYTHING in the room, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Anything in sight, yes. That's obvio;Js. 
Crab: 
What happens, then, if you point the camera at the flames on the 
TV screen? 
(Achilles shifts the camera so that it points directly at that part of the 
television screen on which the flames are-or were-displayed.) 
Achilles: 
Hey, that's funny! That very act makes the flames DISAPPEAR 
from the screen! Where did they go? 
Crab: 
You can't keep an image still on the screen and move the camera at 
the same time. 
Achilles: 
So I see ... But I don't understand what's on the screen now-
not at all! It seems to be a strange long corridor. Yet I'm certainly not

pointing the camera down any corridor. I'm merely pointing it at an 
ordinary TV screen. 
Crab: 
Look more carefully, Achilles. Do you really see a corridor? 
Achilles: 
Ahhh, now I see. It's a set of nested copies of the TV screen itself, 
getting smaller and smaller and smaller ... Of course! The image of 
the flames HAD to go away, because it came from my pointing the 
camera at the PAINTING. When 1 point the camera at the SCREEN, then 
the screen itself appears, with whatever is on the screen at the time-
which is the screen itself, with whatever is on the screen at the time-
which is the screen itself, with-
Crab: 
I believe I can fill in the rest, Achilles. Why don't you try rotating 
the camera? 
Achilles: 
Oh! I get a beautiful spiraling corridor! Each screen is rotated 
inside its framing screen, so that the littler they get, the more rotated 
they are, with respect to the outermost screen. This idea of having a 
TV screen "engulf itself" is weird. 
Crab: 
What do you mean by "self-engulfing", Achilles? 
Achilles: 
I mean, when I point the camera at the screen-or at part of the 
screen. THAT'S self-engulfing. 
Crab: 
Do you mind if I pursue that: a little further? I'm intrigued by this 
new notion. 
Achilles: 
So am I. 
Crab: 
Very well, then. If you point the camera at a CORNER of the screen, 
is that still what you mean by "self-engulfing"? 
Achilles: 
Let me try it. Hmm-the "corridor" of screens seems to go off the 
edge, so there isn't an infinite nesting any more. It's pretty, but it 
doesn't seem to me to have the spirit of self-engulfing. It's a "failed 
self-engulfing" . 
Crab: If you were to swing the TV camera back towards the center of the 
screen, maybe you could fix it up again ... 
Achilles (slowly and cautiously turning the camera): 
Yes! The corridor is get-
ting longer and longer ... There it is! Now it's all back. I can look 
down it so far that it vanishes in the distance. The corridor became 
infinite again preci"ely at the moment when the camera took in the 
WHOLE screen. Hmm-that reminds me of something Mr. Tortoise 
was saying a while back, about self-reference only occurring when a 
sentence talks about ALL of itself ... 
Crab: 
Pardon me? 
Achilles: 
Oh, nothing-just muttering to myself. 
(As Achilles plays with the lens and other controls on the camera, a 
profusion of new kinds of self-enguljing images appear: swirling spirals 
that resemble galaxies, kaleidoscopicflower-like shapes, and other assorted 
patterns . .. ) 
Crab: 
You seem to be having a grand time. 
Achilles (turns away from the camera): 
I'll say! What a wealth of images this 
simple idea can produce! (He glances back at the screen, and a look of 
492 
Ed!fving Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 

astonishment crosses his face.) Good grief, Mr. Crab! There's a pulsating 
petal-pattern on the screen! Where do the pulsations come from? The 
TV is still, and so is the camera. 
Crab: 
You can occasionally set up patterns which change in time. This is 
because there is a slight delay in the circuitry between the moment the 
camera "sees" something, and the moment it appears on the screen-
around a hundredth of a second. So if you have a nesting of depth fifty 
or so, roughly a half-second delay will result. If somehow a moving 
image gets onto the screen-for example, by you putting your finger in 
front of the camera-then it takes a while for the more deeply nested 
screens to "find out" about it. This delay then reverberates through the 
whole system, like a visual echo. And if things are set up so the echo 
doesn't die away, then you can get pulsating patterns. 
Achilles: 
Amazing! Say-what if we tried to make a TOTAL self-engulfing? 
Crab: 
What precisely do you mean by that? 
Achilles: 
Well, it seems to me that this stuff with screens within screens is 
interesting, but I'd like to get a picture of the TV camera AND the 
screen, ON the screen. Only then would I really have made the system 
engulf itself. For the screen is only PART of the total system. 
Crab: 
I see what you mean. Perhaps with this mirror, you can achieve the 
effect you want. 
(The Crab hands him a mirror, and Achilles maneuvers the mirror and 
camera in such a way that the camera and the screen are both pictured on 
the screen.) 
Achilles: 
There! I've created a TOTAL self-engulfing! 
Crab: 
It seems to me you only have the front of the mirror-what about 
its back? If it weren't for the back of the mirror, it wouldn't be 
reflective-and you wouldn't have the camera in the picture. 
Achilles: 
You're right. But to show both the front and back of this mirror, 
I need a second mirror. 
Crab: 
But then you'll need to show the back of that mirror, too. And what 
about including the back of the television, as well as its front? And then 
there's the electric cord, and the inside of the television, and-
Achilles: 
Whoa, whoa! My head's beginning to spin! I can see that this 
"total self-engulfing project" is going to pose a wee bit of a problem. 
I'm feeling a little dizzy. 
Crab: 
I know exactly how you feel. Why don't you sit down here and take 
your mind off all this self-engulfing? Relax! Look at my paintings, and 
you'll calm down. 
(Achilles lies down, and sighs.) 
Oh-perhaps my pipe smoke is bothering you? Here, I'll put my pipe 
away. (Takes the pipe from his mouth, and carefully places it above some 
written words in another Magritte painting.) There! Feeling any better? 
Achilles: 
I'm still a little woozy. (Points at the Magritte.) That's an interesting 
painting. I like the way it's framed, especially the shiny inlay inside the 
wooden frame.

Crab: 
Thank you. I had it specially done-it's a gold lining. 
Achilles: 
A gold lining? What next? What are those words below the pipe? 
They aren't in English, are they? 
Crab: 
No, they are in French. They say, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." That 
means, "This is not a pipe". Which is perfectly true. 
Achilles: 
But it IS a pipe! You were just smoking it! 
Crab: 
Oh, you misunderstand the phrase, I believe. The word "ceci" refers 
to the painting, not to the pipe. Of course the pipe is a pipe. But a 
painting is not a pipe. 
Achilles: 
I wonder if that "ceci" inside the painting refers to the WHOLE 
painting, or just to the pipe inside the painting. Oh, my gracious! That 
would be ANOTHER self-engulfing' I'm not feeling at all well, Mr. Crab. 
I think I'm going to be sick ...

Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker 

CHAPTER XVI 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
IN THIS CHAPTER, we will look at some of the mechanisms which create 
self-reference in various contexts, and compare them to the mechanisms 
which allow some kinds of systems to reproduce themselves. Some remark-
able and beautiful parallels between these mechanisms will come to light. 
Implicitly and Explicitly Self-Referential Sentences 
To begin with, let us look at sentences which, at first glance, may seem to 
provide the simplest examples of self-reference. Some such sentences are 
these: 
(1) This sentence contains five words. 
(2) 
This sentence is meaningless because it is self-referential. 
(3) This sentence no verb. 
(4) This sentence is false. 
(Epimenides paradox) 
(5) The sentence I am now writing is the sentence you are now 
reading. 
All but the last one (which is an anomaly) involve the simple-seeming 
mechanism contained in the phrase "this sentence". But that mechanism is 
in reality far from simple. All of these sentences are "floating" in the 
context of the English language. They can be compared to icebergs, whose 
tips only are visible. The word sequences are the tips of the icebergs, and 
the processing which must be done to understand them is the hidden part. 
In this sense their meaning is implicit, not explicit. Of course, no sentence's 
meaning is completely explicit, but the more explicit the self-reference is, 
the more exposed will be the mechanisms underlying it. In this case, for the 
self-reference of the sentences above to be recognized, not only has one to 
be comfortable with a language such as English which can deal with linguis-
tic subject matter, but also one has to be able to figure out the referent of 
the phrase "this sentence". It seems simple, but it depends on our very 
complex yet totally assimilated ability to handle English. What is especially 
important here is the ability to figure out the referent of a noun phrase 
with a demonstrative adjective in it. This ability is built up slowly, and 
should by no means be considered trivial. The difficulty is perhaps under-
lined when a sentence such as number 4 is presented to someone na'ive 
about paradoxes and linguistic tricks, such as a child. They may say, "What 
sentence is false?" and it may take a bit of persistence to get across the idea 
that the sentence is talking about itself. The whole idea is a little mind-
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
495 

boggling at first. A couple of pictures may help (Figs. 83, 84). Figure 83 is a 
picture which can be interpreted on two levels. On one level, it is a sentence 
pointing at itself; on the other level, it is a picture of Epimenides executing 
his own death sentence. 
FIGURE 83. 
Figure 84, showing visible and invisible portions of the iceberg, 
suggests the relative proportion of sentence to processing required for the 
recognition of self-reference:

FIGURE 84. 
It is amusing to try to create a self-referring sentence without using the 
trick of saying "this sentence". One could try to quote a sentence inside 
itself. Here is an attempt: 
The sentence "The sentence contains five words" contains five words. 
But such an attempt must fail, for any sentence that could be quoted 
entirely inside itself would have to be shorter than itself. This is actually 
possible, but only if you are willing to entertain infinitely long sentences, 
such as: 
496 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

The sentence 
"The sentence 
"The sentence 
·'The sentence 
is infinitely long" 
is infinitely long·· 
is infinitely long" 
is infinitely long. 
elc., etc. 
But this cannot work for finite sentences. For the same reason, Codel's 
string C could not contain the explicit numeral for its Codel number: it 
would not fit. No string of TNT can contain the TNT-numeral for its own 
Codel number, for that numeral always contains more symbols than the 
string itself does. But you can get around this by having C contain a 
description of its own Codel number, by means of the notions of "sub" and 
"arithmoquinification". 
One way of achieving self-reference in an English sentence by means 
of description instead of by self-quoting or using the phrase "this sentence" 
is the Quine method, illustrated in the dialogue Air on C's String. The 
understanding of the Quine sentence requires less subtle mental processing 
than the four examples cited earlier. Although it may appear at first to be 
trickier, it is in some ways more explicit. The Quine construction is quite 
like the Codel construction, in the way that it creates self-reference by 
describing another typographical entity which, as it turns out, is isomorphic 
to the Quine sentence itself. The description of the new typographical 
entity is carried out by two parts of the Quine sentence. One part is a set of 
instructions telling how to build a certain phrase, while the other part 
contains the construction materials to be used; that is, the other part is a 
template. This resembles a floating cake of soap more than it resembles an 
iceberg (See Fig. 85). 
FIGURE 85. 
Quine sentence

water 

The self-reference of this sentence is achieved in a more direct way than in 
the Epimenides paradox; less hidden processing is needed. By the way, it is 
interesting to point out that the phrase "this sentence" appears in the 
previous sentence; yet it is not there to cause self-reference; you probably 
understood that its referent was the Quine sentence, rather than the 
sentence in which it occurs. This just goes to show how pointer phrases 
such as "this sentence" are interpreted according to context, and helps to 
show that the processing of such phrases is indeed quite involved. 
A Self-Reproducing Program 
The notion of quining, and its usage in creating self-reference, have al-
ready been explained inside the Dialogue itself, so we need not dwell on 
such matters here. Let us instead show how a computer program can use 
precisely the same technique to reproduce itself. The following self-
reproducing program is written in a BlooP-like language and is based on 
following a phrase by its own quotation (the opposite order from quining, so 
I reverse the name "quine" to make "eniuq"): 
DEfINE PROCEDURE "ENIUQ" [TEMPLATE): PRINT [TEMPLATE. LEfT-BRACKET. 
QUOTE-MARK. TEMPLATE. QUOTE-MARK. RIGHT-BRACKET. PERIOD]' 
ENIUQ 
['DEFINE PROCEDURE "ENIUQ" [TEMPLATE]: PRINT [TEMPLATE. LEFT-BRACKET. 
QUOTE-MARK. TEMPLATE. QUOTE-MARK. RIGHT-BRACKET. PERIOD]' 
ENIUQ']. 
ENIUQ is a procedure defined in the first two lines, and its input is called 
"TEMPLATE". It is understood that when the procedure is called, 
TEMPLATE's value will be some string of typographical characters. The 
effect of ENIUQ is to carry out a printing operation, in which TEMPLATE 
gets printed twice: the first time just plain; the second time wrapped in 
(single) quotes and brackets, and garnished with a final period. Thus, if 
TEMPLATE's value were the string DOUBLE-BUBBLE, then performing 
ENIUQ on it would yield: 
DOUBLE-BUBBLE ['DOUBLE-BUBBLE']. 
Now in the last four lines of the program above, the procedure ENIUQ is 
called with a specific value of TEMPLATE-namely the long string inside the 
single quotes: DEFINE ... ENIUQ. That value has been carefully chosen; it 
consists of the definition of ENIUQ, followed by the word ENIUQ. This makes 
the program itself-or, if you prefer. a perfect copy of it-get printed out. 
It is very similar to Quine'S version of the Epimenides sentence: 
"yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" 
yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation. 
It is very important to realize that the character string which appears in 
quotes in the last three lines of the program above-that is, the value of 
498 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

TEMPLATE-is never interpreted as a sequence of instructions. That it 
happens to be one is, in a sense,just an accident. As was pointed out above, 
it could just as well have been DOUBLE-BUBBLE or any other string of 
characters. The beauty of the scheme is that when the same string appears 
in the top two lines of this program, it is treated as a program (because it is 
not in quotes). Thus in this program, one string functions in two ways: first 
as program, and second as data. This is the secret of self-reproducing 
programs, and, as we shall see, of self-reproducing molecules. It is useful, 
incidentally, to call any kind of self-reproducing object or entity a self-rep; 
and likewise to call any self-referring object or entity a self-ref. I will use 
those terms occasionally from here on. 
The preceding program is an elegant example of a self-reproducing 
program written in a language which was not designed to make the writing 
of self-reps particularly easy. Thus, the task had to be carried out using 
those notions and operations which were assumed to be part of the 
language-such as the word QUOTE-MARK, and the command PRINT. But 
suppose a language were designed expressly for making self-reps easy to 
write. Then one could write much shorter self-reps. For example, suppose 
that the operation of eniuq-ing were a built-in feature of the language, 
needing no explicit definition (as we assumed PRINT was). Then a teeny 
self-rep would be this: 
ENIUQ ['ENIUQ']. 
It is very similar to the Tortoise's version of Quine's version of the 
Epimenides self-ref, where the verb "to quine" is assumed to be known: 
"yields falsehood when quined" yields falsehood when quined. 
But self-reps can be even shorter. For instance, in some computer 
language it might be a convention that any program whose first symbol is 
an asterisk is to be copied before being executed normally. Then the 
program consisting of merely one asterisk is a self-rep! You may complain 
that this is silly and depends on a totally arbitrary convention. In doing so, 
you are echoing my earlier point that it is almost cheating to use the phrase 
"this sentence" to achieve self-reference-it relies too much on the proces-
sor, and not enough on explicit directions for self-reference. Using an 
asterisk as an example of a self-rep is like using the word "I" as an example 
of a self-ref: both conceal all the interesting aspects of their respective 
problems. 
This is reminiscent of another curious type of self-reproduction: via 
photocopy machine. It might be claimed that any written document is a 
self-rep because it can cause a copy of itself to be printed when it is placed 
in a photocopy machine and the appropriate button is pushed. But some-
how this violates our notion of self-reproduction; the piece of paper is not 
consulted at all, and is therefore not directing its own reproduction. Again, 
everything is in the processor. Before we call something a self-rep, we want 
to have the feeling that, to the maximum extent possible, it explicitly con-
tains the directions for copying itself. 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
499 

To be sure, explicitness is a matter of degree; nonetheless there is an 
intuitive borderline on one side of which we perceive true self-directed 
self-reproduction, and on the other side of which we merely see copying 
being carried out by an inflexible and autonomous copying machine. 
What Is a Copy? 
Now in any discussion of self-refs and self-reps, one must sooner or later 
come to grips with the essential issue: what is a copy? We already dealt with 
that question quite seriously in Chapters V and VI; and now we come back 
to it. To give the flavor of the issue, let us describe some highly fanciful, yet 
plausible, examples of self-reps. 
A Self- Reproducing Song 
Imagine that there is a nickelodeon in the local bar which, if you press 
buttons ll-U, will playa song whose lyrics go this way: 
Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon, 
All I want is 11-U, and music, music, music. 
We could make a little diagram of what happens one evening (Fig. 86). 
person 
nickelodeon 
FIGURE 86. 
A selj~reproducing song. 
Although the effect is that the song reproduces itself, it would feel strange 
to call the song a self-rep, because of the fact that when it passes through 
the 11-U stage, not all of the information is there. The information only 
gets put back by virtue of the fact that it is fully stored in the nickelodeon-
that is, in one of the arrows in the diagram, not in one of the ovals. It is 
questionable whether this song contains a complete description of how to 
get itself played again, because the symbol pair "11-U" is only a trigger, not 
a copy. 
A "Crab" Program 
Consider next a computer program which prints itself out backwards. 
(Some readers might enjoy thinking about how to write such a program in 
500 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

the BlooP-like language above, using the given self-rep as a model.) Would 
this funny program count as a self-rep? Yes, in a way, because a trivial 
transformation performed on its output will restore the original program. 
It seems fair to say that the output contains the same information as the 
program itself, just recast in a simple way. Yet it is clear that someone might 
look at the output and not recognize it as a program printed backwards. To 
recall terminology from Chapter VI, we could say that the "inner mes-
sages" of the output and the program itself are the same, but they have 
different "outer messages"-that is, they must be read by using different 
decoding mechanisms. Now if one counts the outer message as part of the 
information-which seems quite reasonable-then the total information is 
not the same after all, so the program can't be counted as a self-rep. 
However, this is a disquieting conclusion, because we are accustomed 
to considering something and its mirror image as containing the same 
information. But recall that in Chapter VI, we made the concept of "intrin-
sic meaning" dependent on a hypothesized universal notion of intelligence. 
The idea was that, in determining the intrinsic meaning of an object, we 
could disregard some types of outer message-those which would be uni-
versally understood. That is, if the decoding mechanism seems fundamental 
enough, in some still ill-defined sense, then the inner message which it lets 
be revealed is the only meaning that counts. In this example, it seems 
reasonably safe to guess that a "standard intelligence" would consider two 
mirror images to contain the same information as each other; that is, it 
would consider the isomorphism between the two to be so trivial as to be 
ignorable. And thus our intuition that the program is in some sense a fair 
self-rep, is allowed to stand. 
Epimenides Straddles the Channel 
Now another far-fetched example of a self-rep would be a program which 
prints itself out, but translated into a different computer language. One 
might liken this to the following curious version of the Quine version of the 
Epimenides self-ref: 
"est une expression qui, quand elle est precedee de sa traduction, 
mise entre guillemets, dans la langue provenant de I'autre cote de 
la Manche, cree une faussete" is an expression which, when it is 
preceded by its translation, placed in quotation marks, into the 
language originating on the other side of the Channel, yields a 
falsehood. 
You might try to write down the sentence which is described by this weird 
concoction. (Hint: It is not itself-or at least it is not if "itself" is taken in a 
naive sense.) If the notion of "self-rep by retrograde motion" (i.e., a pro-
gram which writes itself out backwards) is reminiscent of a crab canon, the 
notion of "self-rep by translation" is no less reminiscent of a canon which 
involves a transposition of the theme into another key. 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
501 

A Program That Prints Out Its Own Godel Number 
The idea of printing out a translation instead of an exact copy of the 
original program may seem pointless. However, if you wanted to write a 
self-rep program in BlooP or FlooP, you would have to resort to some such 
device, for in those languages, OUTPUT is always a number, rather than a 
typographical string. Therefore, you would have to make the prograrr. 
print out its own Gode! number: a very huge integer whose decimal 
expansion codes for the program, character by character, by using three: 
digit codons. The program is coming as close as it can to printing itself, 
within the means available to it: it prints out a copy of itself in another 
"space", and it is easy to switch back and forth between the space of integers 
and the space of strings. Thus, the value of OUTPUT is not a mere trigger, 
like "11-U". Instead, all the information of the original program lies "close 
to the surface" of the output. 
Godelian Self-Reference 
This comes very close to describing the mechanism of Godel's self-ref G. 
After all, that string of TNT contains a description not of itself, but of an 
integer (the arithmoquinification of u). It just so happens that that integer 
is an exact "image" of the string G, m the space of natural numbers. Thus, 
G refers to a translation of itself into another space. We still feel comforta-
ble in calling G a self-referential string, because the isomorphism between 
the two spaces is so tight that we can consider them to be identical. 
This isomorphism that mirrors TNT inside the abstract realm of 
natural numbers can be likened to the quasi-isomorphism that mirrors the 
real world inside our brains, by means of symbols. The symbols play 
quasi-isomorphic roles to the objects. and it is thanks to them that we can 
think. Likewise, the Gode! numbers play isomorphic roles to strings, and it 
is thanks to them that we can find meta mathematical meanings in state-
ments about natural numbers. The amazing, nearly magical, thing about G 
is that it manages to achieve self-reference despite the fact that the lan-
guage in which it is written, TNT, seems to offer no hope of referring to its 
own structures, unlike English, in which it is the easiest thing in the world 
to discuss the English language. 
So G is an outstanding example of a self-ref via translation-hardly the 
most straightforward case. One might also think back to some of the 
Dialogues, for some of them, too, are self-refs via translation. For instance, 
take the Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles. In that Dialogue, several refer-
ences are made to the Bach Sonatas for unaccompanied violin, and the 
Tortoise's suggestion of imagining harpsichord accompaniments is particu-
larly interesting. After all, if one applies this idea to the Dialogue itself, one 
invents lines which the Tortoise is saying; but if one assumes that Achilles' 
part stands alone (as does the violin), then it is quite wrong to attribute any 
lines at all to the Tortoise. In any case, here again is a self-ref by means of a 
mapping which maps Dialogues onto pieces by Bach. And this mapping is 
502 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

left, of course, for the reader to notice. Yet even if the reader does not 
notice it, the mapping is still there, and the Dialogue is still a self-ref. 
A Self-Rep by Augmentation 
We have been likening self-reps to canons. What, then, would be a fair 
analogue to a canon by augmentation? Here is a possibility: consider a 
program which contains a dummy loop whose only purpose is to slow up 
the program. A parameter might tell how often to repeat the loop. A 
self-rep could be made which prints out a copy of itself, but with the 
parameter changed, so that when that copy is run, it will run at half the 
speed of its parent program; and its "daughter" will in turn run at half 
again the speed, and so on ... None of these programs prints itself out 
precisely; yet all clearly belong to a single "family". 
This is reminiscent of the self-reproduction of living organisms. 
Clearly, an individual is never identical to either of its parents; why, then, is 
the act of making young called "self-reproduction"? The answer is that 
there is a coarse-grained isomorphism between parent and child; it is an 
isomorphism which preserves the information about species. Thus, what is 
reproduced is the class, rather than the instance. This is also the case in the 
recursive picture Gplot, in Chapter V: that is, the mapping between 
"magnetic butterflies" of various sizes and shapes is coarse-grained; no two 
are identical, but they all belong to a single "species", and the mapping 
preserves precisely that fact. In terms of self-replicating programs, this 
would correspond to a family of programs, all written in "dialects" of a 
single computer language; each one can write itself out, but slightly mod-
ified, so that it comes out in a dialect of its original language. 
A Kimian Self-Rep 
Perhaps the sneakiest example of a self-rep is the following: instead of 
writing a legal expression in the compiler language, you type one of the 
compiler's own error messages. When the compiler looks at your "pro-
gram", the first thing it does is get confused, because your "program" is 
ungrammatical; hence the compiler prints out an error message. All you 
need to do is arrange that the one it prints out will be the one you typed in. 
This kind of self-rep, suggested to me by Scott Kim, exploits a different 
level of the system from the one you would normally approach. Although it 
may seem frivolous, it may have counterparts in complex systems where 
self-reps vie against each other for survival, as we shall soon discuss. 
What Is the Original? 
Besides the question "What constitutes a copy?", there is another funda-
mental philosophical question concerning self-reps. That is the obverse 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
503 

side of the coin: "What is the original?" This can best be explained by 
referring to some examples: 
(1) 
a program which, when interpreted by some interpreter 
running on some computFr, prints itself out; 
(2) 
a program which, when interpreted by some interpreter 
running on some computer, prints itself out along with a 
complete copy of the interpreter (which, after all, is also a 
program); 
(3) 
a program which, when interpreted by some interpreter 
running on some computer, not only prints itself out along 
with a complete copy of the interpreter, but also directs a 
mechanical assembly process in which a second computer, 
identical to the one on which the interpreter and program 
are running, is put together. 
It is clear that in (1), the program is t.he self-rep. But in (3), is it the program 
which is the self-rep, or the compound system of program plus interpreter, 
or the union of program, interpreter, and processor? 
Clearly, a self-rep can involve more than just printing itself out. In fact, 
most of the rest of this Chapter is a discussion of self-reps in which data, 
program, interpreter, and processor are all extremely intertwined, and in 
which self-replication involves replicating all of them at once. 
Typogenetics 
We are now about to broach one of the most fascinating and profound 
topics of the twentieth century: the study of "the molecular logic of the 
living state", to borrow Albert Lehninger's richly evocative phrase. And 
logic it is, too-but of a sort more complex and beautiful than any a human 
mind ever imagined. We will come at it from a slightly novel angle: via an 
artificial solitaire game which I call Typogenetics-short for "Typographical 
Genetics". In Typogenetics I have tried to capture some ideas of molecular 
genetics in a typographical system which, on first sight, resembles very 
much the formal systems exemplified by the MIU-system. Of course, Ty-
pogenetics involves many simplifications, and therefore is useful primarily 
for didactic purposes. 
I should explain immediately that the field of molecular biology is a 
field in which phenomena on several levels interact, and that Typogenetics 
is only trying to illustrate phenomena from one or two levels. In particular, 
purely chemical aspects have been completely avoided-they belong to a 
level lower than is here dealt with; similarly, all aspects of classical genetics 
(viz., nonmolecular genetics) have also been avoided-they belong to a level 
higher than is here dealt with. I have intended in Typogenetics only to give 
an intuition for those processes centered on the celebrated Central Dogma of 
504 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

Molecular Biology, enunciated by Francis Crick (one of the co-discoverers of 
the double-helix structure of DNA): 
DNA 
:::;, 
RNA 
:::;, 
proteins. 
It is my hope that with this very skeletal model I have constructed the 
reader will perceive some simple unifying principles of the field-
principles which might otherwise be obscured by the enormously intricate 
interplay of phenomena at many different levels. What is sacrificed is, of 
course, strict accuracy; what is gained is, I hope, a little insight. 
Strands, Bases, Enzymes 
The game of Typogenetics involves typographical manipulation on se-
quences of letters. There are four letters involved: 
A C G 
T. 
Arbitrary sequences of them are called strands. Thus, some strands are: 
GGGG 
ATTACCA 
CATCATCATCA1 
Incidentally, "STRAND" spelled backwards begins with "DNA". This is 
appropriate since strands, in Typogenetics, play the role of pieces of DNA 
(which, in real genetics, are often called "strands"). Not only this, but 
"STRAND" fully spelled out backwards is "DNA RTS", which may be taken 
as an acronym for "DNA Rapid Transit Service". This, too, is appropriate, 
for the function of "messenger RNA"-which in Typogenetics is rep-
resented by strands as well-is quite well characterized by the phrase 
"Rapid Transit Service" for DNA, as we shall see later. 
I will sometimes refer to the letters A, C, G, T as bases, and to the 
positions which they occupy as units. Thus, in the middle strand, there are 
seven units, in the fourth of which is found the base A. 
If you have a strand, you can operate on it and change it in various 
ways. You can also produce additional strands, either by copying, or by 
cutting a strand in two. Some operations lengthen strands, some shorten 
them, and some leave their length alone. 
Operations come in packets-that is, several to be performed together, 
in order. Such a packet of operations is a little like a programmed machine 
which moves up and down the strand doing things to it. These mobile 
machines are called "typographical enzymes"--enzymes for short. Enzymes 
operate on strands one unit at a time, and are said to be "bound" to the unit 
they are operating on at any given moment. 
I will show how some sample enzymes act on particular strings. The 
first thing to know is that each enzyme likes to start out bound to a 
particular letter. Thus, there are four kinds of enzyme-those which prefer 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
505 

A, those which prefer C, etc. Given the sequence of operations which an 
enzyme performs, you can figure out which letter it prefers, but for now I'll 
just give them without explanation Here's a sample enzyme, consisting of 
three operations: 
{
(I) Delete the unit to which the enzyme is bound (and then bind 
to the next unit to the right). 
(2) 
Move one unit to the right. 
(3) 
Insert a T (to the immediate right of this unit). 
This enzyme happens to like to bind to A initially. And here's a sample 
strand: 
ACA 
What happens if our enzyme binds to the left A and begins acting? Step 1 
deletes the A, so we are left with CA--and the enzyme is now bound to the 
C. Step 2 slides the enzyme rightwards, to the A, and Step 3 appends a T 
onto the end to form the strand CAT. And the enzyme has done its 
complete duty: it has transformed ACA into CAT. 
What if it had bound itself to the right A of ACA? It would have deleted 
that A and moved off the end of the strand. Whenever this happens, the 
enzyme quits (this is a general principle). So the entire effect would just be 
to lop off one symbol. 
Let's see some more examples. Here is another enzyme: 
{
(I) Search for the nearest p}rimidine to the right of this unit. 
(2) 
Go into Copy mode. 
(3) 
Search for the nearest purine to the right of of this unit. 
(4) 
Cut the strand here (viz., to the right of the present unit). 
Now this contains the terms "pyrimidine" and "purine". They are easy 
terms. A and G are called purines, and C and T are called pyrimidines. So 
searching for a pyrimidine merely means searching for the nearest C or T. 
Copy Mode and Double Strands 
The other new term is Copy mode. Any strand can be "copied" onto another 
strand, but in a funny way. Instead of copying A onto A, you copy it onto T, 
and vice versa. And instead of copying C onto C, you copy it onto G, and 
vice versa. Note that a purine copies onto a pyrimidine, and vice versa. This 
is called complementary base pairing. The complements are shown below: 
complement 
{ 
A 
.¢:~ 
T } 
purines 
pyrimidines 
G 
.¢:~ 
C 
506 
Self- Ref and Self- Rep 

You can perhaps remember this molecular pairing scheme by recalling that 
Achilles is paired with the Tortoise, and the Crab with his Genes. 
When "copying" a strand, therefore, you don't actually copy it, but you 
manufacture its complementary strand. And this one will be written upside 
down above the original strand. Let's see this in concrete terms. Let the 
previous enzyme act on the following strand (and that enzyme also happens 
to like to start at A): 
CAAAGAGAATCCTCTITGAT 
There are many places it could start. Let's take the second A, for example. 
The enzyme binds to it, then executes step 1: Search for the nearest 
pyrimidine to the right. Well, this means a C or a T. The first one is a T 
somewhere near the middle of the strand, so that's where we go. Now step 
2: Copy mode. Well, we just put an upside-down A above our T. But that's 
not all, for Copy mode remains in effect until it is shut off-or until the 
enzyme is done, whichever comes first. This means that every base which is 
passed through by the enzyme while Copy mode is on will get a com-
plementary base put above it. Step 3 says to look for a purine to the right of 
our T. That is the G two symbols in from the right-hand end. Now as we 
move up to that G, we must "copy"-that is, create a complementary strand. 
Here's what that gives: 
'v'1J1J'v'1J\f\f\f'J 
CAAAGAGAATCCTCTTTGAT 
The last step is to cut the strand. This will yield two pieces: 
'v'1J1J'v'1J\f\f\f'J 
CAAAGAGAATCCTCTTTG 
and AT. 
And the instruction packet is done. We are left with a double strand, 
however. Whenever this happens, we separate the two complementary 
strands from each other (general principle); so in fact our end product is a 
set of three strands: 
AT, 
CAAAGAGGA, 
and CAAAGAGAATCCTCTITG. 
Notice that the upside-down strand has been turned right side up, and 
thereby right and left have been reversed. 
Now you have seen most of the typographical operations which can be 
carried out on strands. There are two other instructions which should be 
mentioned. One shuts off Copy mode; the other switches the enzyme from a 
strand to the upside-down strand above it. When this happens, if you keep 
the paper right side up, then you must switch "left" and "right" in all the 
instructions. Or better, you can keep the wording and just turn the paper 
around so the top strand becomes legible. If the "switch" command is 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
507 

given, but there is no complementary base where the enzyme is bound at 
that instant, then the enzyme just detaches itself from the strand, and its job 
is done. 
It should be mentioned that when a "cut" instruction is encountered, 
this pertains to both strands (if there are two); however, "delete" pertains 
only to the strand on which the enzyme is working. If Copy mode is on, 
then the "insert" command pertains to both strands-the base itself into the 
strand the enzyme is working on, and its complement into the other strand. 
If Copy mode is off, then the "insert" command pertains only to the one 
strand, so a blank space must be inserted into the complementary strand. 
And, whenever Copy mode i~ on, "move" and "search" commands 
require that one manufacture complementary bases to all bases which the 
sliding enzyme touches. Incidentally, Copy mode is always off when an 
enzyme starts to work. If Copy mode is off, and the command "Shut off 
copy mode" is encountered, nothing happens. Likewise, if Copy mode is 
already on, and the command "Turn copy mode on" is encountered, then 
nothing happens. 
Amino Acids 
There are fifteen types of command, listed below: 
cut 
cut strand(s) 
del 
delete a base from strand 
SWI 
switch enzyme to other strand 
mvr 
move one unit to the right 
mvl 
move one unit to the left 
cop 
turn on Copy mode 
off 
turn off Copy mode 
Ina 
insert A to the right of this unit 
InC 
insert C to the right of this unit 
Ing 
insert G to the right of this unit 
int 
insert T to the right of this unit 
rpy 
search for the nearest pyrimidine to the right 
rpu 
search for the nearest purine to the right 
Ipy 
search for the nearest pyrimidine to the left 
I pu 
search for the nearest purine to the left 
Each one has a three-letter abbreviation. We shall refer to the three-letter 
abbreviations of commands as amino acids. Thus, every enzyme is made up of a 
sequence of amino acids. Let us write down an arbitrary enzyme: 
rpu - inc - cop - mvr - mvl - swi - Ipu - int 
and an arbitrary strand: 
TAGATCCAGTCCATCGA 
508 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

and see how the enzyme acts on the strand. It so happens that the enzyme 
binds to G only. Let us bind to the middle G and begin. Search rightwards 
for a purine (viz., A or G). We (the enzyme) skip over TCC and land on A. 
Insert a C. Now we have 
TAGATCCAGTCCACTCGA 
+ 
where the arrow points to the unit to which the enzyme is bound. Set Copy 
mode. This puts an upside-down G above the C. Move right, move left, 
then switch to the other strand. Here's what we have so far: 
+ 
r:JV 
TAGATCCAGTCCACTCGA 
Let's turn it upside down, so that the enzyme is attached to the lower 
strand: 
Vr:JJIJVJJlr:JVJJlVr:JVl 
AG • 
Now we search leftwards for a purine, and find A. Copy mode is on, but the 
complementary bases are already there, so nothing is added. Finally, we 
insert a T (in Copy mode), and quit: 
Vr:JJ IVJVJJ 1 r:JVJJ 1 Vr:JV 1 
ATG 
Our final product is thus two stJnds: 
ATG, 
and TAGATCCAGTCCACATCGA 
The old one is of course gone. 
Translation and the Typogenetic Code 
Now you might be wondering where the enzymes and strands come from, 
and how to tell the initial binding-preference of a given enzyme. One way 
might be just to throw some random strands and some random enzymes 
together, and see what happens when those enzymes act on those strands 
and their progeny. This has a similar flavor to the MU-puzzle, where there 
were some given rules of inference and an axiom, and you just began. The 
only difference is that here, every time a strand is acted on, its original form 
is gone forever. In the MU-puzzle, acting on Ml to make MlU didn't destroy 
Ml. 
But in Typogenetics, as in real genetics, the scheme is quite a bit 
trickier. We do begin with some arbitrary strand, somewhat like an axiom 
in a formal system. But we have, initially, no "rules of inference"-that is, 
no enzymes. However, we can translate each strand into one or more 
enzymes! Thus, the strands themselves will dictate the operations which 
will be performed upon them, and those operations will in turn produce 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
509 

new strands which will dictate further enzymes, etc. etc.! This is mixing 
levels with a vengeance! Think, for the sake of comparison, how different 
the MU-puzzle would have been if each new theorem produced could have 
been turned into a new rule of inference by means of some code. 
How is this "translation" done? It involves a Typogenetic Code by which 
adjacent pairs of bases-called "duplets"-in a single strand represent 
different amino acids. There are sixteen possible duplets: AA, AC, AG, AT, 
CA, CC, etc. And there are fifteen amino acids. The Typogenetic Code is 
shown in Figure 87.

The Typogenetic Code, by 
which each duplet in a strand codes for one 
of fifteen "amino acids" (or a punctuation 
mark). 
According to the table, the translation of the duplet GC is "inc" ("insert a 
C"); that of AT is "swi" ("switch strands"); and so on. Therefore it becomes 
clear that a strand can dictate an enzyme very straightforwardly. For 
example, the strand 
TAGATCCAGTCCACATCGA 
breaks up into d uplets as follows: 
TA GA TC CA GT CC AC AT CG A 
with the A left over at the end. Its translation into an enzyme is: 
rpy - ina - rpu - mvr - int - mvl- cut - swi - cop. 
(Note that the leftover A contributes nothing.) 
Tertiary Structure of Enzymes 
What about the little letters's', 'I', and 'r' in the lower righthand corner of 
each box? They are crucial in determining the enzyme's binding-prefer-
ence, and in a peculiar way. In order to figure out what letter an enzyme 
likes to bind to, you have to figure out the enzyme's "tertiary structure", 
which is itself determined by the enzyme's "primary structure". By its 
510 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

primary structure is meant its amino acid sequence. By its tertiary structure is 
meant the way it likes to "fold up". The point is that enzymes don't like 
being in straight lines, as we have so far exhibited them. At each internal 
amino acid (all but the two ends), there is a possibility of a "kink", which is 
dictated by the letters in the corners. In particular, 'l' and 'r' stand for 
"left" and "right", and's' stands for "straight". So let us take our most 
recent sample enzyme, and let it fold itself up to show its tertiary structure. 
We will start with the enzyme's primary structure, and move along it from 
left to right. At each amino acid whose corner-letter is 'l' we'll put a left 
turn, for those with 'r', we'll put a right turn, and at's' we'll put no turn. In 
Figure 88 is shown the two-dimensional conformation for our enzyme.

The tertiary structure of a typoenzyme. 
Note the left-kink at "rpu", the right-kink at "swi", and so on. Notice also 
that the first segment ("rpy ~ ina") and the last segment ("swi ~ cop") are 
perpendicular. This is the key to the binding-preference. In fact, the 
relative orientation of the first and last segments of an enzyme's tertiary structure 
determines the binding-preference of the enzyme. We can always orient 
the enzyme so that its first segment points to the right. If we do so, then the 
last segment determines the binding-preference, as shown in Figure 89.

So in our case, we have an enzyme which likes the letter C. If, in folding up, 
an enzyme happens to cross itself. that's okay-just think of it as going 
under or over itself. Notice that all its amino acids playa role in the 
determination of an enzyme's tertiary structure. 
Punctuation, Genes, and Ribosomes 
Now one thing remains to be explamed. Why is there a blank in box AA of 
the Typogenetic Code? The answer is that the duplet AA acts as a punctua-
tion mark inside a strand, and it signals the end of the code for an enzyme. 
That is to say, one strand may code for two or more enzymes if it has one or 
more duplets AA in it. For example, the strand 
codes for two enzymes: 
CG GA TA CT AA AC CG A 
cop - ina - rpy - off 
and 
cut.-- cop 
with the AA serving to divide the strand up into two "genes". The definition 
of gene is: that portion of a strand which codes for a single emyme. Note that the 
mere presence of AA inside a strand does not mean that the strand codes 
for two enzymes. For instance, CAAG codes for "mvr - del". The AA begins 
on an even-numbered unit and therefore is not read as a duplet! 
The mechanism which reads strands and produces the enzymes which 
are coded inside them is called a ribosome. (In Typogenetics, the player of 
the game does the work of the ribosomes.) Ribosomes are not in any way 
responsible for the tertiary structure of enzymes, for that is entirely deter-
mined once the primary structure is created. Incidentally, the process of 
translation always goes from strands to em.ymes, and never in the reverse 
direction. 
Puzzle: A Typogenetical Self- Rep 
Now that the rules of Typogenetics have been fully set out, you may find it 
interesting to experiment with the game. In particular, it would be most 
interesting to devise a self-replicating strand. This would mean something 
along the following lines. A single strand is written down. A ribosome acts 
on it, to produce any or all of the enzymes which are coded for in the 
strand. Then those enzymes are brought into contact with the original 
strand, and allowed to work on it. This yields a set of "daughter strands". 
The daughter strands themselves pass through the ribosomes, to yield a 
second generation of enzymes, which act on the daughter strands; and the 
512 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

cycle goes on and on. This can go on for any number of stages; the hope is 
that eventually, among the strands which are present at some point, there 
will be found two copies of the original strand (one of the copies may be, in 
fact, the original strand).

strands 
This diagram illustrates the Central Dogma of Typogenetics. It shows how 
strands define enzymes (via the Typogenetic Code); and how in turn, 
enzymes act back on the strands which gave rise to them, yielding new 
strands. Therefore, the line on the left portrays how old information flows 
upwards, in the sense that an enzyme is a translation of a strand, and 
contains therefore the same information as the strand, only in a different 
form-in particular; in an active form. The line on the right, however, does 
not show information flowing downwards; instead, it shows how new infor-
mation gets created: by the shunting of symbols in strands. 
An enzyme in Typogenetics, like a rule of inference in a formal system, 
blindly shunts symbols in strands without regard to any "meaning" which 
may lurk in those symbols. So there is a curious mixture of levels here. On 
the one hand, strands are acted upon, and therefore play the role of data 
(as is indicated by the arrow on the right); on the other hand, they also 
dictate the actions which are to be performed on the data, and therefore 
they play the role of programs (as is indicated by the arrow on the left). It is 
the player of Typogenetics who acts as interpreter and processor, of 
course. The two-way street which links "upper" and "lower" levels of 
Typogenetics shows that, in fact, neither strands nor enzymes can be 
thought of as being on a higher level than the other. By contrast, a picture 
of the Central Dogma of the MIU-system looks this way:

In the MIU-system, there is a clear distinction of levels: rules of inference 
simply belong to a higher level than strings. Similarly for TNT, and all 
formal systems.

Strange Loops, TNT, and Real Genetics 
However, we have seen that in TNT, levels are mixed, in another sense. In 
fact, the distinction between language and metalanguage breaks down: 
statements about the system get mirrored inside the system. It turns out that 
if we make a diagram showing the relationship between TNT and its 
metalanguage, we will produce something which resembles in a remarkable 
way the diagram which represents the Central Dogma of Molecular Biol-
ogy. In fact, it is our goal to make this comparison in detail; but to do so, we 
need to indicate the places where Typogenetics and true genetics coincide, 
and where they differ. Of course, real genetics is far more complex than 
Typogenetics-but the "conceptual skeleton" which the reader has ac-
quired in understanding Typogenetics will be very useful as a guide in the 
labyrinth of true genetics. 
DNA and Nucleotides 
We begin by discussing the relationship between "strands", and DNA. The 
initials "DNA" stand for "deoxyribonucleic acid". The DNA of most cells 
resides in the cell's nucleus, which is a small area protected by a membrane. 
Gunther Stent has characterized the nucleus as the "throne room" of the 
cell, with DN A acting as the ruler. DNA consists of long chains of relatively 
simple molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of three 
parts: (1) a phosphate group stripped of one special oxygen atom, whence 
the prefix "deoxy"; (2) a sugar called "ribose", and (3) a base. It is the base 
alone which distinguishes one nucleotide from another; thus it suffices to 
specify its base to identify a nucleotide. The four types of bases which occur 
in DN A nucleotides are: 
A: adenine } 
G: 
guanine 
purines 
C: cytosine } 
T: thymine 
pyrimidines 
(Also see Fig. 91.) It is easy to remember which ones are pyrimidines 
because the first vowel in "cytosine", "thymine", and "pyrimidine" is 'y'. 
Later, when we talk about RNA, "uracil"-also a pyrimidine-will come in 
and wreck the pattern, unfortunately. (Note: Letters representing nucleo-
tides in real genetics will not be in the Quadrata font, as they were in 
Typogenetics.) 
A single strand of DNA thus consists of many nucleotides strung 
together like a chain of beads. The chemical bond which links a nucleotide 
to its two neighbors is very strong; such bonds are called covalent bonds, and 
the "chain of beads" is often called the covalent backbone of DNA. 
Now DNA usually comes in double strands-that is, two single strands 
which are paired up, nucleotide by nucleotide (see Fig. 92). It is the bases

FIGURE 92. 
DNA structure resembles a ladder in which the side pieces consist of alternat-
ing units of deoxyribose and phosphate. The rungs are formed by the bases paired in a special 
way, A with T and G with C, and held together respectively by two and three hydrogen bonds. 
[From Hanawalt and Haynes, The Chemical Basis of Life, p. 142.] 

which are responsible for the peculiar kind of pairing which takes place 
between strands. Each base in one strand faces a complementary base in the 
other strand, and binds to it. The complements are as in Typogenetics: A 
pairs up with T, and C with G. Always one purine pairs up with a 
pyrimidine. 
Compared to the strong covalent bonds along the backbone, the in-
terstrand bonds are quite weak. They are not covalent bonds, but hydrogen 
bonds. A hydrogen bond arises when two molecular complexes are aligned 
in such a way that a hydrogen atom which originally belonged to one of 
them becomes "confused" about which one it belongs to, and it hovers 
between the two complexes, vacillating as to which one to join. Because the 
two halves of double-stranded DNA are held together only by hydrogen 
bonds, they may come apart or be put together relatively easily; and this 
fact is of great import for the workings of the cell. 
When DNA forms double strands, the two strands curl around each 
other like twisting vines (Fig. 93). There are exactly ten nucleotide pairs 
per revolution; in other words, at each nucleotide, the "twist" is 36 degrees. 
Single-stranded DNA does not exhibit this kind of coiling, for it is a 
consequence of the base-pairing.

Messenger RNA and Ribosomes 
As was mentioned above, in many celis, DNA, the ruler of the cell, dwells in 
its private "throne room": the nucleus of the cell. But most of the "living" in 
a cell goes on outside of the nucleus, namely in the cytoplasm-the "ground" 
to the nucleus' "figure". In particular, enzymes, which make practically every 
life process go, are manufactured by ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and they do 
most of their work in the cytoplasm. And just as in Typogenetics, the 
blueprints for all enzymes are stored inside the strands-that is, inside the 
DNA, which remains protected in its little nuclear home. So how does the 
information about enzyme structure get from the nucleus to the ribo-
somes? 
Here is where messenger RNA-mRNA--comes in. Earlier, mRNA 
strands were humorously said to constitute a kind of DNA Rapid Transit 
Service; by this is meant not that mRNA physically carries DNA anywhere, 
but rather that it serves to carry the information, or message, stored in the 
DNA in its nuclear chambers, out to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. How is 
this done? The idea is easy: a special kind of enzyme inside the nucleus 
faithfully copies long stretches of the DNA's base sequence onto a new 
strand-a strand of messenger RNA. This mRN A then departs from the 
nucleus and wanders out into the cytoplasm, where it runs into many 
ribosomes which begin doing their enzyme-creating work on it. 
The process by which DNA gets copied onto mRNA inside the nucleus 
is called transcription; in it, the double-stranded DNA must be temporarily 
separated into two single strands, one of which serves as a template for the 
mRNA. Incidentally, "RNA" stands for "ribonucleic acid", and it is very 
much like DNA except that all of its nucleotides possess that special oxygen 
atom in the phosphate group which DNA's nucleotides lack. Therefore the 
"deoxy" prefix is dropped. Also, instead of thymine, RNA uses the' base 
uracil, so the information in strands of RNA can be represented by arbi-
trary sequences of the four letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'U'. Now when mRNA is 
transcribed off of DNA, the transcription process operates via the usual 
base-pairing (except with U instead of T), so that a DNA-template and its 
mRNA-mate might look something like this: 
DNA: ........ CGT AAATCAAGTCA ....... . 
mRNA: ........ GCAUUUAGUUCAGU ....... . 
(template) 
("copy") 
RNA does not generally form long double strands with itself, although it 
can. Therefore it is prevalently found not in the helical form which so 
characterizes DNA, but rather in long, somewhat randomly curving 
strands. 
Once a strand of mRNA has escaped the nhcleus, it encounters those 
strange subcellular creatures called "ribosomes"-but before we go on to 
explain how a ribosome uses mRNA, I want to make some comments about 
enzymes and proteins. Enzymes belong to the general category of 
biomolecules called proteins, and the job of ribosomes is to make all pro-
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
517 

teins, not just enzymes. Proteins which are not enzymes are much more 
passive kinds of beings; many of them, for instance, are structural 
molecules, which means that they are like girders and beams and so forth in 
buildings: they hold the cell's parts together. There are other kinds of 
proteins, but for our purposes, the principal proteins are enzymes, and I 
will henceforth not make a sharp distinction. 
Amino Acids 
Proteins are composed of sequences of amino acids, which come in twenty 
primary varieties, each with a three-letter abbreviation: 
ala 
alanine 
arg 
arginine 
asn 
asparagme 
asp 
aspartic acid 
cys

tyr

Notice the slight numerical discrepancy with Typogenetics, where we had 
only fifteen "amino acids" composing enzymes. An amino acid is a small 
molecule of roughly the same complexity as a nucleotide; hence the build-
ing blocks of proteins and of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) are roughly of the 
same size. However, proteins are composed of much shorter sequences of 
components: typically, about three hundred amino acids make a complete 
protein, whereas a strand of DNA can consist of hundreds of thousands or 
millions of nucleotides. 
Ribosomes and Tape Recorders 
Now when a strand of mRNA, after its escape into the cytoplasm, encoun-
ters a ribosome, a very intricate and beautiful process called translation takes 
place. It could be said that this process of translation is at the very heart of 
518 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

all of life, and there are many mysteries connected with it. But in essence it 
is easy to describe. Let us first give a picturesque image, and then render it 
more precise. Imagine the mRNA to be like a long piece of magnetic 
recording tape, and the ribosome to be like a tape recorder. As the tape 
passes through the playing head of the recorder, it is "read" and converted 
into music, or other sounds. Thus magnetic markings are "translated" into 
notes. Similarly, when a "tape" of mRNA passes through the "playing 
head" of a ribosome, the "notes" which are produced are amin:J acids, and 
the "pieces of music" which they make up are proteins. This is what transla-
tion is all about; it is shown in Figure 96. 
The Genetic Code 
But how can a ribosome produce a chain of amino acids when it is 
reading a chain of nucleotides? This mystery was solved in the early 
1960's by the efforts of a large number of people, and at the core of 
the answer lies the Genetic Code-a mapping from triplets of nucleotides 
into amino acids (see Fig. 94). This is in spirit extremely similar to 
the Typogenetic Code, except that here, three consecutive bases (or 
nucleotides) 
form a codon, 
whereas there,

only two were 
needed. Thus

codon at a time 
-and each time 
it does so, it 
appends a single new amino acid to the protein it is presently manufactur-
ing. Thus, a protein comes out of the ribosome amino acid by amino acid. 
Tertiary Structure 
However, as a protein emerges from a ribosome, it is not only getting 
longer and longer, but it is also continually folding itself up into an ex-
traordinary three-dimensional shape, very much in the way that those 
funny little Fourth-of-July fireworks called "snakes" simultaneously grow 
longer and curl up, when they are lit. This fancy shape is called the 
protein's tertiary structure (Fig. 95), while the amino acid sequence per se is 
called the primary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure is implicit 
in the primary structure, just as in Typogenetics. However, the recipe for 
deriving the tertiary structure, if you know only the primary structure, is by 
far more complex than that given in Typogenetics. In fact, it is one of the 
outstanding problems of contemporary molecular biology to figure out 
some rules by which the tertiary structure of a protein can be predicted if 
only its primary structure is known.

Reductionistic Explanation of Protein Function 
Another discrepancy between Typogenetics and true genetics-and this is 
probably the most serious one ofall--is this: whereas in Typogenetics, each 
component amino acid of an enzyme is responsible for some specific "piece 
of the action", in real enzymes, individual amino acids cannot be assigned 
such clear roles. It is the tertiary structure as a whole which determines the 
mode in which an enzyme will function; there is no way one can say, "This 
520 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

amino acid's presence means that such-and-such an operation will get 
performed". In other words, in real genetics, an individual amino acid's 
contribution to the enzyme's overall function is not "context-free". How-
ever, this fact should not be construed in any way as ammunition for an 
antireductionist argument to the effect that "the whole [enzyme] cannot be 
explained as the sum of its parts". That would be wholly unjustified. What 
is justified is rejection of the simpler claim that "each amino acid contrib-
utes to the sum in a manner which is independent of the other amino acids 
present". In other words, the function of a protein cannot be considered to 
be built up from context-free functions of its parts; rather, one must 
consider how the parts interact. It is still possible in principle to write a 
computer program which takes as input the primary structure of a protein, 
FIGURE 95.

large-scale "twisted pipe" appearance is the tertiary structure; the finer helix inside-the

521 

and firstly determines its tertiary structure, and secondly determines the 
function of the enzyme. This would he a completely reductionistic explana-
tion of the workings of proteins, but the determination of the "sum" of the 
parts would require a highly complex algorithm. The elucidation of the 
function of an enzyme, given its primary, or even its tertiary, structure, is 
another great problem of contemporary molecular biology. 
Perhaps, in the last analysis, the function of the whole enzyme can be 
considered to be built up from functions of parts in a context-free manner, 
but where the parts are now considered to be individual particles, such as 
electrons and protons, rather than "chunks", such as amino acids. This 
exemplifies the "Reductionist's Dilemma": In order to explain everything 
in terms of context-free sums, one has to go down to the level of physics; but 
then the number of particles is so huge as to make it only a theoretical 
"in-principle" kind of thing. So, one has to settle for a context-dependent 
sum, which has two disadvantages. The first is that the parts are much 
larger units, whose behavior is describable only on a high level, and there-
fore indeterminately. The second is that the word "sum" carries the conno-
tation that each part can be assigned a simple function and that the 
function of the whole is just a context-free sum of those individual func-
tions. This just cannot be done when one tries to explain a whole enzyme's 
function, given its amino acids as parts. But for better or for worse, this is a 
general phenomenon which arises in the explanations of complex systems. 
In order to acquire an intuitive and manageable understanding of how 
parts interact-in short, in order to proceed-one often has to sacrifice the 
exactness yielded by a microscopic, context-free picture, simply because of 
its unmanageability. But one does not sacrifice at that time the faith that 
such an explanation exists in principle. 
Transfer RNA and Ribosomes 
Returning, then, to ribosomes and R~A and proteins, we have stated that a 
protein is manufactured by a ribosome according to the blueprint carried 
from the DNA's "royal chambers" by its messenger, RNA. This seems to 
imply that the ribosome can translate from the language of codons into the 
language of amino acids, which amounts to saying that the ribosome 
"knows" the Genetic Code. However, that amount of information is simply 
not present in a ribosome. So how does it do it? Where is the Genetic Code 
stored? The curious fact is that the Genetic Code is stored-where else?-i n 
the DNA itself. This certainly calls for some explanation. 
Let us back off from a total explanation for a moment, and give a 
partial explanation. There are, floating about in the cytoplasm at any given 
moment, large numbers of four-leaf-dover-shaped molecules; loosely fas-
tened (i.e., hydrogen-bonded) to one leaf is an amino acid, and on the 
opposite leaf there is a triplet of nucleotides called an anticodon. For our 
purposes, the other two leaves are irrelevant. Here is how these "clovers" 
are used by the ribosomes in their prod uction of proteins. When a new

FIGURE 96. A section of mRNA passing through a ribosome. Floating nearby are tRNA 
molecules, carrying amino acids which are stripped off by the ribosome and appended to the

the base-pairing (A-U, C-G) is represented by interlocking letter-forms in the diagram. 
[Drawing by Scott E. Kim.] 
codon of mRNA clicks into position in the ribosome's "playing head", the 
ribosome reaches out into the cytoplasm and latches onto a clover whose 
anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon. Then it pulls the clover 
into such a position that it can rip off the clover's amino acid, and stick it 
covalently onto the growing protein. (Incidentally, the bond between an 
amino acid and its neighbor in a protein is a very strong covalent bond, 
called a "peptide bond". For this reason, proteins are sometimes called 
"polypeptides".) Of course it is no accident that the "clovers" carry the 
proper amino acids, for they have all been manufactured according to 
precise instructions emanating from the "throne room". 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
523 

The real name for such a clover is transfer RNA. A molecule oftRNA is 
quite small-about the size of a very small protein-and consists of a chain 
of about eighty nucleotides. Like mRNA, tRNA molecules are made by 
transcription off of the grand cellular template, DNA. However, tRNA's are 
tiny by comparison with the huge mRNA molecules, which may contain 
thousands of nucleotides in long, long chains. Also, tRNA's resemble pro-
teins (and are unlike strands of mRNA) in this respect: they have fixed, 
well-defined tertiary structures-determined by their primary structure. A 
tRNA molecule's tertiary structure allows precisely one amino acid to bind 
to its amino-acid site; to be sure, it is that one dictated according to the 
Genetic Code by the anticodon on the opposite arm. A vivid image of the 
function of tRNA molecules is as flashcards floating in a cloud around a 
simultaneous interpreter, who snaps one out of the air-invariably the 
right one!-whenever he needs to translate a word. In this case, the inter-
preter is the ribosome, the words are codons, and their translations are 
amino acids. 
In order for the inner message of DNA to get decoded by the ribo-
somes, the tRNA flashcards must be floating about in the cytoplasm. In 
some sense, the tRNA's contain the essence of the outer message of the 
DNA, since they are the keys to the process of translation. But they 
themselves came from the DNA. Thus, the outer message is trying to be 
part of the inner message, in a way reminiscent of the message-in-a-bottle 
which tells what language it is written in. Naturally, no such attempt can be 
totally successful: there is no way for the DNA to hoist itself by its own 
bootstraps. Some amount of knowledge of the Genetic Code must already 
be present in the cell beforehand, to allow the manufacture of those 
enzymes which transcribe tRNA's themselves off of the master copy of 
DNA. And this knowledge resides in previously manufactured tRNA 
molecules. This attempt to obviate the need for any outer message at all is 
like the Escher dragon, who tries as hard as he can, within the context of 
the two-dimensional world to which he is constrained, to be three-
dimensionaL He seems to go a long way-but of course he never makes it, 
despite the fine imitation he gives of three-dimensionality. 
Punctuation and the Reading Frame 
How does a ribosome know when a protein is done? Just as in Typogenet-
ics, there is a signal inside the mRN A which indicates the termination or 
initiation of a protein. In fact, three special codons-VAA, VAG, VGA-
act as punctuation marks instead of coding for amino acids. Whenever such 
a triplet clicks its way into the "reading head" of a ribosome, the ribosome 
releases the protein under construction and begins a new one. 
Recently, the entire genome of the tiniest known virus, cpX174, has 
been laid bare. One most unexpected discovery was made en route: some 
of its nine genes overlap-that is, two distinct proteins are coded for by the same 
stretch of DNA! There is even one gene contained entirely inside another! 
524 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

This is accomplished by having the reading frames of the two genes shifted 
relative to each other, by exactly one unit. The density of information-
packing in such a scheme is incredible. This is, of course, the inspiration 
behind the strange "5/17 haiku" in Achilles' fortune cookie, in the Canon by 
Intervallic Augmentation. 
Recap 
In brief, then, this picture emerges: from its central throne, DNA sends off 
long strands of messenger RNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm; and the 
ribosomes, making use of the "flashcards" of tRNA hovering about them, 
efficiently construct proteins, amino acid by amino acid, according to the 
blueprint contained in the mRNA. Only the primary structure of the 
proteins is dictated by the DNA; but this is enough, for as they emerge 
from the ribosomes, the proteins "magically" fold up into complex confor-
mations which then have the ability to act as powerful chemical machines. 
Levels of Structure and Meaning in Proteins and Music 
We have been using this image of ribosome as tape recorder, mRNA as 
tape, and protein as music. It may seem arbitrary, and yet there are some 
beautiful parallels. Music is not a mere linear sequence of notes. Our minds 
perceive pieces of music on a level far higher than that. We chunk notes 
into phrases, phrases into melodies, melodies into movements, and move-
ments into full pieces. Similarly, proteins only make sense when they act as 
chunked units. Although a primary structure carries all the information for 
the tertiary structure to be created, it still "feels" like less, for its potential is 
only realized when the tertiary structure is actually physically created. 
Incidentally, we have been referring only to primary and tertiary 
structures, and you may well wonder whatever happened to the secondary 
structure. Indeed, it exists, as does a quaternary structure, as well. The 
folding-up of a protein occurs at more than one level. Specifically, at some 
points along the chain of amino acids, there may be a tendency to form a 
kind of helix, called the alpha helix (not to be confused with the DNA double 
helix). This helical twisting of a protein is on a lower level than its tertiary 
structure. This level of structure is visible in Figure 95. Quaternary struc-
ture can be directly compared with the building of a musical piece out of 
independent movements, for it involves the assembly of several distinct 
polypeptides, already in their full-blown tertiary beauty, into a larger 
structure. The binding of these independent chains is usually accomplished 
by hydrogen bonds, rather than covalent bonds; this is of course just as with 
pieces of music composed of several movements, which are far less tightly 
bound to each other than they are internally, but which nevertheless form a 
tight "organic" whole. 
The four levels of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary struc-
ture can also be compared to the four levels of the MU-picture (Fig. 60) in

the Prelude, Ant Fugue. The global structure-consisting of the letters 'M' 
and 'U'-is its quaternary structure; then each of those two parts has a tertiary 
structure, consisting of "HOLISM" or "REDUCTIONISM"; and then the 
opposite word exists on the secondary level, and at bottom, the primary 
structure is once again the word "MU", over and over again. 
Polyribosomes and Two-Tiered Canons 
Now we come to another lovely parallel between tape recorders translating 
tape into music and ribosomes translating mRNA into proteins. Imagine a 
collection of many tape recorders, arranged in a row, evenly spaced. We 
might call this array a "polyrecorder". Now imagine a single tape passing 
serially through the playing heads of all the component recorders. If the 
tape contains a single long melody, then the output will be a many-voiced 
canon, of course, with the delay determined by the time it takes the tape to 
get from one tape recorder to the next. In cells, such "molecular canons" 
do indeed exist, where many ribosomes, spaced out in long lines-forming 
what is called a polyribosome-all "play" the same strand of mRNA, produc-
ing identical proteins, staggered in time (see Fig. 97). 
Not only this, but nature goes one better. Recall that mRNA is made by 
transcription off of DNA; the enzymes which are responsible for this 
process are called RNA polymerases ("-ase" is a general suffix for enzymes). It 
happens often that a series of RNA polymerases will be at work in parallel 
on a single strand of DNA, with the result that many separate (but identi-
cal) strands of mRNA are being produced, each delayed with respect to the 
other by the time required for the DNA to slide from one RNA polymerase 
to the next. At the same time, there can be several different ribosomes 
working on each of the parallel emerging mRNA's. Thus one arrives at a 
double-decker, or two-tiered, "molecular canon" (Fig. 98). The corre-
sponding image in music is a rather fanciful but amusing scenario: several 
FIGURE 98. Here, an even more complex scheme. Not just one but several strands of 
mRNA, all emerging by transcription from a single strand of DNA, are acted upon by 
polyribosomes. The result is a two-tiered molecular canon. [From Hanawalt and Haynes, The 
Chemical Basis of Life, p. 271.]

different copyists are all at work simultaneously, each one of them copying 
the same original manuscript from a clef which flutists cannot read into a 
clef which they can read. As each copyist finishes a page of the original 
manuscript, he passes it on to the next copyist, and starts transcribing a new 
page himself. Meanwhile, from each score emerging from the pens of the 
copyists, a set of flutists are reading and tooting the melody, each flutist 
delayed with respect to the others who are reading from the same sheet. 
This rather wild image gives, perhaps, an idea of some of the complexity of 
the processes which are going oR in each and every cell of your body during 
every second of every day ... 
Which Came First- The Ribosome or the Protein? 
We have been talking about these wonderful beasts called ribosomes; but 
what are they themselves composed of? How are they made? Ribosomes are 
composed of two types of things: (1) various kinds of proteins, and (2) 
another kind of RNA, called ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Thus, in order for a 
ribosome to be made, certain kinds of proteins must be present, and rRNA 
must be present. Of course, for proteins to be present, ribosomes must be 
there to make them. So how do you get around the vicious circle? Which 
comes first-the ribosome or the protein? Which makes which? Of course 
there is no answer because one always traces things back to previous 
members of the same class-just as with the chicken-and-the-egg 
question-until everything vanishes over the horizon of time. In any case, 
ribosomes are made of two pieces, a large and a small one, each of which 
contains some rRNA and some proteins. Ribosomes are about the size of 
large proteins; they are much much smaller than the strands of mRNA 
which they take as input, and along which they move. 
Protein Function 
We have spoken somewhat of the structure of proteins-specifically en-
zymes; but we have not really mentioned the kinds of tasks which they 
perform in the cell, nor how they do them. All enzymes are catalysts, which 
means that in a certain sense, they do no more than selectively accelerate 
various chemical processes in the cell, rather than make things happen 
which without them never could happen. An enzyme realizes certain path-
ways out of the myriad myriad potentialities. Therefore, in choosing which 
enzymes shall be present, you choose what shall happen and what shall not 
happen-despite the fact that, theoretically speaking, there is a nonzero 
probability for any cellular process to happen spontaneously, without the 
aid of catalysts. 
Now how do enzymes act upon the molecules of the cell? As has been 
mentioned, enzymes are folded-up polypeptide chains. In every enzyme, 
there is a cleft or pocket or some other clearly-defined surface feature 
where the enzyme binds to some other kind of molecule. This location is 
528 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

called its active site, and any molecule which gets bound there is called a 
substrate. Enzymes may have more than one active site, and more than one 
substrate. Just as in Typogenetics, enzymes are indeed very choosy about 
what they will operate upon. The active site usually is quite specific, and 
allows just one kind of molecule to bind to it, although there are sometimes 
"decoys"-other molecules which can fit in the active site and clog it up, 
fooling the enzyme and in fact rendering it inactive. 
Once an enzyme and its substrate are bound together, there is some 
disequilibrium of electric charge, and consequently charge-in the form of 
electrons and protons-flows around the bound molecules and readjusts 
itself. By the time equilibrium has been reached, some rather profound 
chemical changes may have occurred to the substrate. Some examples are 
these: there may have been a "welding", in which some standard small 
molecule got tacked onto a nucleotide, amino acid, or other common 
cellular molecule; a DNA strand may have been "nicked" at a particular 
location; some piece of a molecule may have gotten lopped off; and so 
forth. In fact, bio-enzymes do operations on molecules which are quite 
similar to the typographical operations which Typo-enzymes perform. 
However, most enzymes perform essentially only a single task, rather than 
a sequence of tasks. There is one other striking difference between Typo-
enzymes and bio-enzymes, which is this: whereas Typo-enzymes operate 
only on strands, bio-enzymes can act on DNA, RNA, other proteins, ribo-
somes, cell membranes-in short, on anything and everything in the cell. In 
other words, enzymes are the universal mechanisms for getting things done 
in the cell. There are enzymes which stick things together and take them 
apart and modify them and activate them and deactivate them and copy 
them and repair them and destroy them ... 
Some of the most complex processes in the cell involve "cascades" in 
which a single molecule of some type triggers the production of a certain 
kind of enzyme; the manufacturing process begins and the enzymes which 
come off the "assembly line" open up a new chemical pathway which allows 
a second kind of enzyme to be produced. This kind of thing can go on for 
three or four levels, each newly produced type of enzyme triggering the 
production of another type. In the end a "shower" of copies of the final 
type of enzyme is produced, and all of the copies go off and do their 
specialized thing, which may be to chop up some "foreign" DNA, or to help 
make some amino acid for which the cell is very "thirsty", or whatever. 
Need for a Sufficiently Strong Support System 
Let us describe nature's solution to the puzzle posed for Typogenetics: 
"What kind of strand of DNA can direct its own replication?" Certainly not 
every strand of DNA is inherently a self-rep. The key point is this: any 
strand which wishes to direct its own copying must contain directions for 
assembling precisely those enzymes which can carry out the task. Now it is 
futile to hope that a strand of DNA in isolation could be a self-rep; for in 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
529 

order for those potential proteins to be pulled out of the DNA, there must 
not only be ribosomes, but also RNA polymerase, which makes the mRNA 
that gets transported to the ribosomes. And so we have to begin by assum-
ing a kind of "minimal support system" just sufficiently strong that it allows 
transcription and translation to be carried out. This minimal support 
system will thus consist in (1) some proteins, such as RNA polymerase, 
which allow mRNA to be made from DNA, and (2) some ribosomes. 
How DNA Self-Replicates 
It is not by any means coincidental that the phrases "sufficiently strong 
support system" and "sufficiently powerful formal system" sound alike. 
One is the precondition for a self-rep to arise, the other for a self-ref to 
arise. In fact there is in essence only one phenomenon going on in two very 
different guises, and we shall explicitly map this out shortly. But before we 
do so, let us finish the description of how a strand of DNA can be a self-rep. 
The DNA must contain the codes for a set of proteins which will copy 
it. Now there is a very efficient and elegant way to copy a double-stranded 
piece of DNA, whose two strands are complementary. This involves two 
steps: 
(1) 
unravel the two strands from each other; 
(2) 
"mate" a new strand to each of the two new single strands. 
This process will create two new double strands of DNA, each identical to 
the original one. Now if our solution is to be based on this idea, it must 
involve a set of proteins, coded for in the DNA itself, which will carry out 
these two steps. 
I t is believed that in cells, these two steps are performed together in a 
coordinated way, and that they require three principal enzymes: DNA 
endonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. The first is an "unzip-
ping enzyme": it peels the two original strands apart for a short distance, 
and then stops. Then the other two enzymes come into the picture. The 
DNA polymerase is basically a copy-and-move enzyme: it chugs down the 
short single strands of DNA, copying them complementarily in a fashion 
reminiscent of the Copy mode in Typogenetics. In order to copy, it draws 
on raw materials-specifically nucleotides-which are floating about in the 
cytoplasm. Because the action proceeds in fits and starts, with some unzip-
ping and some copying each time, some short gaps are created, and the 
DNA ligase is what plugs them up. The process is repeated over and over 
again. This precision three-enzyme machine proceeds in careful fashion all 
the way down the length of the DNA molecule, until the whole thing has 
been peeled apart and simultaneously replicated, so that there are now two 
copies of it. 
530 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

Comparison of DNA's Self-Rep Method with Quining 
Note that in the enzymatic action on the DNA strands, the fact that 
information is stored in the DNA is just plain irrelevant; the enzymes are 
merely carrying out their symbol-shunting functions, just like rules of 
inference in the MIU-system. It is of no interest to the three enzymes that 
at some point they are actually copying the very genes which coded for 
them. The DNA, to them, is just a template without meaning or interest. 
It is quite interesting to compare this with the Quine sentence's 
method of describing how to construct a copy of itself. There, too, one has 
a sort of "double strand"-two copies of the same information, where one 
copy acts as instructions, the other as template. In DNA, the process is 
vaguely parallel, since the three enzymes (DNA endonuclease, DNA 
polymerase, DNA ligase) are coded for injust one of the two strands, which 
therefore acts as program, while the other strand is merely a template. The 
parallel is not perfect, for when the copying is carried out, both strands are 
used as template, not just one. Nevertheless, the analogy is highly sugges-
tive. There is a biochemical analogue to the use-mention dichotomy: when 
DNA is treated as a mere sequence of chemicals to be copied, it is like 
mention of typographical symbols; when DNA is dictating what operations 
shall be carried out, it is like use of typographical symbols. 
Levels of Meaning of DNA 
There are several levels of meaning which can be read from a strand of 
DNA, depending on how big the chunks are which you look at, and how 
powerful a decoder you use. On the lowest level, each DNA strand codes 
for an equivalent RNA strand-the process of decoding being transcription. 
If one chunks the DNA into triplets, then by using a "genetic decoder", one 
can read the DNA as a sequence of amino acids. This is translation (on top of 
transcription). On the next natural level of the hierarchy, DNA is readable 
as a code for a set of proteins. The physical pulling-out of proteins from 
genes is called gene expression. Currently, this is the highest level at which we 
understand what DNA means. 
However, there are certain to be higher levels of DNA meaning which 
are harder to discern. For instance, there is every reason to believe that the 
DNA of, say, a human being codes for such features as nose shape, music 
talent, quickness of reflexes, and so on. Could one, in principle, learn to 
read off such pieces of information directly from a strand of DNA, without 
going through the actual physical process of epigenesis-the physical 
pulling-out of phenotype from genotype? Presumably, yes, since-in 
theory-one could have an incredibly powerful computer program 
simulating the entire process, including every cell, every protein, every tiny 
feature involved in the replication of DNA, of cells, to the bitter end. The 
output of such apseudo-epigenesis program would be a high-level description 
of the phenotype. 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
531 

There is another (extremely faint) possibility: that we could learn to 
read the phenotype off of the genotype without doing an isomorphic simu-
lation of the physical process of epigenesis, but by finding some simpler 
sort of decoding mechanism. This could be called "shortcut pseudo-
epigenesis". Whether shortcut or not, pseudo-epigenesis is, of course, to-
tally beyond reach at the present time-with one notable exception: in the 
species Felis catus, deep probing has revealed that it is indeed possible to 
read the phenotype directly off of the genotype. The reader will perhaps 
better appreciate this remarkable fact after directly examining the follow-
ing typical section of the DNA of Felis catus:

The Central Dogmap 
With this background, now we are in a positIOn to draw an elaborate 
comparison between F. Crick's "Central Dogma of Molecular Biology" 
(.DOGMA I) upon which all cellular processes are based; and what I, with 
poetic license, call the "Central Dogma of Mathematical Logic" (.DOGMA 
II), upon which Godel's Theorem is based. The mapping from one onto 
the other is laid out in Figure 99 and the following chart, which together 
constitute the Central Dogmap.

Note the base-pairing of A and T (Arithmetization and Translation), 
as well as of G and C (Gode) and Crick). Mathematical logic gets the purine 
side, and molecular biology gets the pyrimidine side. 
To complete the esthetic side of this mapping, I chose to model my 
Godel-numbering scheme on the Genetic Code absolutely faithfully. In 
fact, under the following correspondence, the table of the Genetic Code 
becomes the table of the Godel Code:

Each amino acid-of which there are twenty-corresponds to exactly one 
symbol of TNT-of which there are twenty. Thus, at last, my motive for 
concocting "austere TNT" comes out-so that there would be exactly 
twenty symbols! The Godel Code is shown in Figure 100. Compare it with 
the Genetic Code (Fig. 94). 
There is something almost mystical in seeing the deep sharing of such 
an abstract structure by these two esoteric, yet fundamental, advances in 
knowledge achieved in our century. This Central Dogmap is by no means a 
rigorous proof of identity of the two theories; but it clearly shows a pro-
found kinship, which is worth deeper exploration. 
Strange Loops in the Central Dogmap 
One of the more interesting similarities between the two sides of the map is 
the way in which "loops" of arbitrary complexity arise on the top level of 
both: on the left, proteins which act on proteins which act on proteins and 
so on, ad infinitum; and on the right, statements about statements about 
statements of meta-TNT and so on, ad infinitum. These are like heterar-
chies, which we discussed in Chapter V, where a sufficiently complex 
substratum allows high-level Strange Loops to occur and to cycle around, 
totally sealed off from lower levels. We will explore this idea in greater 
detail in Chapter XX. 
Incidentally, you may be wondering about this question: "What, ac-
cording to the Central Dogmap, is Gildel's Incompleteness Theorem itself 
mapped onto?" This is a good question to think about before reading 
ahead. 
The Central Dogmap and the Contracrostipunctus 
It turns out that the Central Dogmap is quite similar to the mapping that 
was laid out in Chapter IV between the Contracrostipunctus and Godel's 
Theorem. One can therefore draw parallels between all three systems:

The analogue of Codel's Theorem is seen to be a peculiar fact, proba-
bly little useful to molecular biologists (to whom it is likely quite obvious): 
It is always possible to design a strand of DNA which, if injected 
into a cell, would, upon being transcribed, cause such proteins to 
be manufactured as would destroy the cell (or the DNA), and thus 
result in the non-reproduction of that DNA. 
This conjures up a somewhat droll scenario, at least if taken in light of 
evolution: an invading species of virus enters a cell by some surreptitious

have the effect of destroying the virus itself! It is a sort of suicide-or 
Epimenides sentence, if you will-on the molecular level. Obviously it 
would not prove advantageous from the point of view of survival of the 
species. However, it demonstrates the spirit, if not the letter, of the 
mechanisms of protection and subversion which cells and their invaders 
have developed. 
E. Coli vs. T 4 
Let us consider the biologists' favorite cell, that of the bacterium Escherichia 
coli (no relation to M. C. Escher), and one of their favorite invaders of that 
cell: the sinister and eerie T4 phage, pictures of which you can see in Figure 
101. (Incidentally, the words "phage" and "virus" are synonymous and 
mean "attacker of bacterial cells".) The weird tidbit looks like a little like a 
cross between a LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) and a mosquito-and it is 
much more sinister than the latter. It has a "head" wherein is stored all its 
"knowledge"-namely its DNA; and it has six "legs" wherewith to fasten 
itself to the cell it has chosen to invade; and it has a "stinging tube" (more 
properly called its "tail") like a mosquito. The major difference is that 
unlike a mosquito, which uses its stinger for sucking blood, the T4 phage 
uses its stinger for injecting its hereditary substance into the cell against the 
will of its victim. Thus the phage commits "rape" on a tiny scale.

A Molecular Trojan Horse 
What actually happens when the viral DNA enters a cell? The virus 
"hopes", to speak anthropomorphically, that its DNA will get exactly the 
same treatment as the DNA of the host cell. This would mean getting 
transcribed and translated, th us allowing it to direct the synthesis of its own 
special proteins, alien to the host cell, which will then begin to do their 
thing. This amounts to secretly transporting alien proteins "in code" (viz., 
the Genetic Code) into the cell, and then "decoding" (viz., producing) 
them. In a way this resembles the story of the Trojan horse, according to 
which hundreds of soldiers were sneaked into Troy inside a harmless-
seeming giant wooden horse; but once inside the city, they broke loose and 
captured it. The alien proteins, once they have been "decoded" (synthe-
sized) from their carrier DNA, now jump into action. The sequence of 
actions directed by the T4 phage has been carefully studied, and is more or 
less as follows (see also Figs. 102 and 103):

First complete replica of T4 invader is pro-
duced. 
Lysozyme (a protein) attacks host cell wall, 
breaking open the bacterium, and the "bicen-
tuplets" emerge. 
Thus, when a T4 phage invades an E. coli cell, after the brief span of about 
twenty-four or twenty-five minutes, the cell has been completely subverted, 
and breaks open. Out pop about two hundred exact copies of the original 
virus-"bicentuplets"-ready to go attack more bacterial cells, the original 
cell having been largely consumed in the process. 
Although from a bacterium's point of view this kind of thing is a 
deadly serious menace, from our large-scale vantage point it can be looked 
upon as an amusing game between two players: the invader, or "T" player 
(named after the T-even class of phages, including the T2, T4, and others), 
and the "C" player (standing for "Cell"). The objective of the T player is to 
invade and take over the cell of the C player from within, for the purpose 
of reprod ucing itself. The objective of the C player is to protect itself and 
destroy the invader. When described this way, the molecular TC-game can 
be seen to be quite parallel to the macroscopic TC-game described in the 
preceding Dialogue. (The reader can doubtless figure out which player-T 
or C--corresponds to the Tortoise, and which to the Crab.) 
Recognition, Disguises, Labeling 
This "game" emphasizes the fact that recognition is one of the central themes 
of cellular and subcellular biology. How do molecules (or higher-level 
structures) recognize each other? It is essential for the functioning of 
enzymes that they should be able to latch onto special "binding sites" on 
their substrates; it is essential that a bacterium should be able to distinguish 
its own DN A from that of phages; it is essential that two cells should be able 
to recognize each other and interact in a controlled way. Such recognition 
problems may remind you of the original, key problem about formal 
systems: How can you tell if a string has, or does not have, some property 
such as theoremhood? Is there a decision procedure? This kind of question 
is not restricted to mathematical logic: it permeates computer science and, 
as we are seeing, molecular biology. 
The labeling technique described in the Dialogue is in fact one of E. 
coli's tricks for outwitting its phage invaders. The idea is that strands of 
DNA can be chemically labeled by tacking on a small molecule-methyl-to 
various nucleotides. Now this labeling operation does not change the usual 
biological properties of the DNA; in other words, methylated (labeled) 
DNA can be transcribed just as well as unmethylated (unlabeled) DNA, and 
so it can direct the synthesis of proteins. But if the host cell has some special 
540 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

mechanisms for examining whether DNA is labeled or not, then the label 
may make all the difference in the world. In particular, the host cell may 
have an enzyme system· which looks for unlabeled DNA, and destroys any 
that it finds by unmercifully chopping it to pieces. In that case, woe to all 
unlabeled invaders! 
The methyl labels on the nucleotides have been compared to serifs on 
letters. Thus, using this metaphor, we could say that the E. coli cell is 
looking for DNA written in its "home script", with its own particular 
typeface-and will chop up any strand of DNA written in an "alien" 
typeface. One counterstrategy, of course, is for phages to learn to label 
themselves, and thereby become able to fool the cells which they are 
invading into reproducing them. 
This TC-battle can continue to arbitrary levels of complexity, but we 
shall not pursue it further. The essential fact is that it is a battle between a 
host which is trying to reject all invading DNA, and a phage which is trying 
to infiltrate its DNA into some host which will transcribe it into mRNA 
(after which its reproduction is guaranteed). Any phage DNA which suc-
ceeds in getting itself reproduced this way can be thought of as having this 
high-level interpretation: "I Can Be Reproduced in'Cells of Type X". This 
is to be distinguished from the evolutionarily pointless kind of phage 
mentioned earlier, which codes for proteins that destroy it, and whose 
high-level interpretation is the self-defeating sentence: "I Cannot Be Re-
produced in Cells of Type X". 
Henkin Sentences and Viruses 
Now both of these contrasting types of self-reference in molecular biology 
have their counterparts in mathematical logic. We have already discussed 
the analogue of the self-defeating phages-namely, strings of the Codel 
type, which assert their own unproducibility within specific formal systems. 
But one can also make a counterpart sentence to a real phage: the phage 
asserts its own producibility in a specific cell, and the sentence asserts its 
own producibility in a specific formal system. Sentences of this type are 
called Henkin sentences, after the mathematical logician Leon Henkin. They 
can be constructed exactly along the lines of Codel sentences, the only 
difference being the omission of a negation. One begins with an "uncle", of 
course: 
3a:3a':<TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'}!\ARITHMOQUINE{a",a'}> 
and then proceeds by the standard trick. Say the Code! number of the 
above "uncle" is h. Now by arithmoquining this very uncle, you get a 
Henkin sentence: 
3a:3a':<TNT-PROOF-PAIR{a,a'}!\ARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a",a'}> 
----------

Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
541 

(By the way, can you spot how this sentence differs from -G?) The reason I 
show it explicitly is to point out that a Henkin sentence does not give a full 
recipe for its own derivation; it just asserts that there exists one. You might 
well wonder whether its claim is justified. Do Henkin sentences indeed 
possess derivations? Are they, as thev claim, theorems? It is useful to recall 
that one need not believe a politician who says, "I am honest"-he may be 
honest, and yet he may not be. Are Henkin sentences any more trustworthy 
than politicians? Or do Henkin sentences, like politicians, lie in cast-iron 
sinks? 
It turns out that these Henkin sentences are invariably truth tellers. 
Why this is so is not obvious; but we will accept this curious fact without 
proof. 
Implicit vs. Explicit Henkin Sentences 
I mentioned that a Henkin sentence tells nothing about its own derivation; 
it just asserts that one exists. Now it is possible to invent a variation on the 
theme of Henkin sentences-namely sentences which explicitly describe their 
own derivations. Such a sentence's high-level interpretation would not be 
"Some Sequence of Strings Exists Which is a Derivation of Me", but rather, 
"The Herein-described Sequence of Strings ..... Is a Derivation of Me". 
Let us call the first type of sentence an implicit Henkin sentence. The new 
sentences will be called explicit Henkin sentences, since they explicitly de-
scribe their own derivations. Note that, unlike their implicit brethren, 
explicit Henkin sentences need not be theorems. In fact, it is quite easy to write 
a string which asserts that its own derivation consists of the single string 
O=O-a false statement, since 0=0 is not a derivation of anything. How-
ever, it is also possible to write an explicit Henkin sentence which is a 
theorem-that is, a sentence which in fact gives a recipe for its own deriva-
tion. 
Henkin Sentences and Self-Assembly 
The reason I bring up this distinction between explicit and implicit Henkin 
sentences is that it corresponds very nicely to a significant distinction 
between types of virus. There are certain viruses, such as the so-called 
"tobacco mosaic virus", which are called self-assembling viruses; and then 
there are others, such as our favorite T-evens, which are non-self-assembling. 
Now what is this distinction? It is a direct analogue to the distinction 
between implicit and explicit Henkin sentences. 
The DNA of a self-assembling \irus codes only for the parts of a new 
virus, but not for any enzymes. Once the parts are produced, the sneaky 
virus relies upon them to link up to each other without help from any 
enzymes. Such a process depends on chemical affinities which the parts 
have for each other, when swimming in the rich chemical brew of a cell. 
Not only viruses, but also some organelles-such as ribosomes-assemble 
542 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

themselves. Sometimes, enzymes may be needed-but in such cases, they 
are recruited from the host cell, and enslaved. This is what is meant by 
self-assembly. 
By contrast, the DNA of more complex viruses, such as the T-evens, 
codes not only for the parts, but in addition for various enzymes which play 
special roles in the assembly of the parts into wholes. Since the assembly 
process is not spontaneous but requires "machines", such viruses are not 
considered to be self-assembling. The essence of the distinction, then, 
between self-assembling units and non-self-assembling units is that the 
former get away with self-reproduction without telling the cell anything 
about their construction, while the latter need to give instructions as to how 
to assemble themselves. 
Now the parallel to Henkin sentences, implicit and explicit, ought to be 
quite clear. Implicit Henkin sentences are self-proving but do not tell 
anything at all about their proofs-they are analogous to self-assembling 
viruses; explicit Henkin sentences direct the construction of their own 
proofs-they are analogous to more complex viruses which direct their 
host cells in putting copies of themselves together. 
The concept of self-assembling biological structures as complex as 
viruses raises the possibility of complex self-assembling machines as well. 
Imagine a set of parts which, when placed in the proper supporting 
environment, spontaneously group themselves in such a way as to form a 
complex machine. It seems unlikely, yet this is quite an accurate way to 
describe the process of the tobacco mosaic virus' method of self-
reproduction via self-assembly. The information for the total conformation 
of the organism (or machine) is spread about in its parts; it is not concen-
trated in some single place. 
Now this concept can lead in some strange directions, as was shown in 
the Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker. There, we saw how the Crab used 
the idea that information for self-assembly can be distributed around, 
instead of being concentrated in a single place. His hope was that this 
would prevent his new phonographs from succumbing to the Tortoise's 
phonograph-crashing method. Unfortunately, just as with the most sophis-
ticated axiom schemata, once the system is all built and packaged into a 
box, its well-definedness renders it vulnerable to a sufficiently clever 
"Godelizer"; and that was the sad tale related by the Crab. Despite its 
apparent absurdity, the fantastic scenario of that Dialogue is not so far 
from reality, in the strange, surreal world of the cell. 
Two Outstanding Problems: 
Differentiation and Morphogenesis 
Now self-assembly may be the trick whereby certain subunits of cells are 
constructed, and certain viruses-but what of the most complex macro-
scopic structures, such as the body of an elephant or a spider, or the shape 
of a Venus's-flytrap? How are homing instincts built into the brain of a 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
• 
543 

bird, or hunting instincts into the brain of a dog? In short, how is it that 
merely by dictating which proteins are to be produced in cells, DNA exer-
cises such spectacularly precise control over the exact structure and func-
tion of macroscopic living objects? There are two major distinct problems 
here. One is that of cellular differentiation: how do different cells, sharing 
exactly the same DNA, perform different roles-such as a kidney cell, a 
bone marrow cell, and a brain cell? The other is that of morphogenesis ("birth 
of form"): how does intercellular communication on a local level give rise to 
large-scale, global structures and organizations-such as the various organs 
of the body, the shape of the face, the suborgans of the brain, and so on? 
Although both cellular differentiation and morphogenesis are poorly un-
derstood at present, the trick appears to reside in exquisitely fine-tuned 
feedback and "feedforward" mechanisms within cells and between cells, 
which tell a cell when to "turn on" and when to "turn off" production of 
various proteins. 
Feedback and Feedforward 
Feedback takes place when there is too much or too little of some desired 
substance in the cell; then the cell must somehow regulate the production 
line which is assembling that substance. Feedforward also involves the 
regulation of an assembly line, but not according to the amount of end 
product present; rather, according to the amount of some precursor of the 
end product of that assembly line. There are two major devices for achiev~ 
ing negative feedforward or feedback. One way is to prevent the relevant 
enzymes from being able to perform--that is, to "clog up" their active sites. 
This is called inhibition. The other way is to prevent the relevant enzymes 
from ever being manufactured! This is called repression. Conceptually, 
inhibition is simple: you just block up the active site of the first enzyme in 
the assembly line, and the whole process of synthesis gets stopped dead. 
Repressors and Inducers 
Repression is trickier. How does a cell stop a gene from being expressed? 
The answer is, it prevents it from ever getting transcribed. This means that 
it has to prevent RNA polymerase from doing its job. This can be ac-
complisheQ by placing a huge obstacle in its path, along the DNA, precisely 
in front of that gene which the cell wants not to get transcribed. Such 
obstacles do exist, and are called repressors. They are themselves proteins, 
and they bind to special obstacle-holding sites on the DNA, called (I am not 
sure why) operators. An operator therefore is a site of control for the gene 
(or genes) which immediately follow it; those genes are called its operon. 
Because a series of enzymes often act in concert in carrying out a long 
chemical transformation, they are often coded for in sequence; and this is 
why operons often contain several genes, rather than just one. The effect 
of the successful repression of an operon is that a whole series of genes is 
544 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

prevented from being transcribed, which means that a whole set of related 
enzymes remains unsynthesized. 
What about positive feedback and feedforward? Here again, there are 
two options: (1) unclog the clogged enzym:es, or (2) stop the repression of 
the relevant operon. (Notice how nature seems to love double-negations! 
Probably there is some very deep reason for this.) The mechanism by which 
repression is repressed involves a class of molecules called inducers. The 
role of an inducer is simple: it combines with a repressor protein before the 
latter has had a chance to bind to an operator on a DNA molecule; the 
resulting "repressor-inducer complex" is incapable of binding to an 
operator, and this leaves the door open for the associated operon to be 
transcribed into mRNA and subsequently translated into protein. Often 
the end product or some precursor of the end product can act as an 
inducer. 
Feedback and Strange Loops Compared 
Incidentally, this is a good time to distinguish between simple kinds of 
feedback, as in the processes of inhibition and repression, and the 
looping-back between different informational levels, shown in the Central 
Dogmap. Both are "feedback" in some sense; but the latter is much deeper 
than the former. When an amino acid, such as tryptophan or isoleucine, 
acts as feedback (in the form of an inducer) by binding to its repressor so 
that more of it gets made, it is not telling how to construct itself; it is just 
telling enzymes to make more of it. This could be compared to a radio's 
volume, which, when fed through a listener's ears, may cause itself to be 
turned down or up. This is another thing entirely from the case in which 
the broadcast itself tells you explicitly to turn your radio on or off, or to 
tune to another wavelength-or even how to build another radio! The 
latter is much more like the looping-back between informational levels, for 
here, information inside the radio signal gets "decoded" and translated into 
mental structures. The radio signal is composed of symbolic constituents 
whose symbolic meaning matters-a case of use, rather than mention. On 
the other hand, when the sound is just too loud, the symbols are not 
conveying meaning; they are merely being perceived as loud sounds, and 
might as well be devoid of meaning-a case of mention, rather than use. 
This case more resembles the feedback loops by which proteins regulate 
their own rates of synthesis. 
It has been theorized that the difference between two neighJjoring cells 
which share the exact same genotype and yet have different functions is 
that different segments of their genome have been repressed, and there-
fore they have different working sets of proteins. A hypopothesis like this 
could account for the phenomenal differences between cells in different 
organs of the body of a human being. 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
545 

Two Simple Examples of Differentiation 
The process by which one initial cell replicates over and over, giving rise to 
a myriad of differentiated cells with specialized functions, can be likened to 
the spread of a chain letter from person to person, in which each new 
participant is asked to propagate the message faithfully, but also to add 
some extra personal touch. Eventually, there will be letters which are 
tremendously different from each other. 
Another illustration of the ideas of differentiation is provided by this 
extremely simple computer analogue of a differentiating self-rep. Consider 
a very short program which is controlled by an up-down switch, and which 
has an internal parameter N -a natural number. This program can run in 
two modes-the up-mode, and the down-mode. When it runs in the up-
mode, it self-replicates into an adjacent part of the computer's memory-
except it makes the internal parameter N of its "daughter" one greater 
than in itself. When it runs in the down-mode, it does not self-rep, but 
instead calculates the number 
(-I)NI(2N + 1) 
and adds it to a running total. 
Well, suppose that at the beginning, there is one copy of the program 
in memory, N = 0, and the mode is up. Then the program will copy itself 
next door in memory, with N = l. Repeating the process, the new pro-
gram will self-rep next door to itself, with a copy having N = 2. And over 
and over again ... What happens is that a very large program is growing 
inside memory. When memory is full, the process quits. Now all of memory 
can be looked upon as being filled with one big program, composed of 
many similar, but differentiated, modules-or "cells". Now suppose we 
switch the mode to down, and run this big program. What happens? The 
first "cell" runs, and calculates 1/1. The second "cell" runs, calculating 
-1/3, and adding it to the previous result. The third "cell" runs, calculating 
+ 1/5 and adding it on ... The end result is that the whole "organism"-the 
big program-calculates the sum 
1 -1/3 + 1/5 -1/7 + 1/9 -·1/11 + 1/13 -1/15 + 
to a large number of terms (as many terms as· "cells" can fit inside memory). 
And since this series converges (albeit slowly) to 'TT14, we have a "phenotype" 
whose function is to calculate the value of a famous mathematical constant. 
Level Mixing in the Cell 
I hope that the descriptions of processes such as labeling, self-assembly, 
differentiation, morphogenesis, as well as transcription and translation, 
have helped to convey some notion of the immensely complex system 
which is a cell-an information-processing system with some strikingly 
546 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 

novel features. We have seen, in the Central Dogmap, that although we can 
try to draw a clear line between program and data, the distinction is 
somewhat arbitrary. Carrying this line of thought further, we find that not 
only are program and data intricately woven together, but also the interpreter 
of programs, the physical processor, and even the language are included in 
this intimate fusion. Therefore, although it is possible (to some extent) to 
draw boundaries and separate out the levels, it is just as important-and 
just as fascinating-to recognize the level-crossings and mixings. Illustra-
tive of this is the amazing fact that in biological systems, all the various 
features necessary for self-rep (viz., language, program, data, interpreter, 
and processor) cooperate to such a degree that all of them are replicated 
simultaneously-which shows how much deeper is biological self-rep'ing 
than anything yet devised along those lines by humans. For instance, the 
self-rep program exhibited at the beginning of this Chapter takes for 
granted the pre-existence of three external aspects: a language, an inter-
pr'eter, and a processor, and does not replicate those. 
Let us try to summarize various ways in which the subunits of a cell can 
be classified in computer science terms. First, let us take DNA. Since DNA 
contains all the information for construction of protein&, which are the 
active agents of the cell, DNA can be viewed as a program written in a 
higher-level language, which is subsequently translated (or interpreted) 
into the "machine language" of the cell (proteins). On the other hand, DNA. 
is itself a passive molecule which undergoes manipulation at the hands of 
various kinds of enzymes; in this sense, a DNA molecule is exactly like a 
long piece of data, as well. Thirdly, DNA contains the templates off of 
which the tRNA "flashcards" are rubbed, which means that DNA also 
contains the definition of its own higher-level language. 
Let us move on to proteins. Proteins are active molecules, and carry 
oui all the functions of the cell; therefore it is quite appropriate to think of 
them as programs in the "machine language" of the cell (the cell itself being 
the processor). On the other hand, since proteins are hardware and most 
programs are software, perhaps it is better to think of the proteins as 
processors. Thirdly, proteins are often acted upon by other proteins, which 
means that proteins are often data. Finally, one can view proteins as inter-
preters; this involves viewing DNA as a collection of high-level language 
programs, in which case enzymes are merely carrying out the programs 
written in the DNA code, which is to say, the proteins are acting as 
interpreters. 
Then there are ribosomes and tRNA molecules. They mediate the 
translation from DNA to proteins, which can be compared to the transla-
tion of a program from a high-level language to a machine language; in 
other words, the ribosomes are functioning as interpreters and the tRNA 
molecules provide the definition of the higher-level language. But an alter-
native view of translation has it that the ribosomes are processors, while the 
tRNA's are interpreters. 
We have barely scratched the surface in this analysis of interrelations 
between all these biomolecules. What we have seen is that nature feels quite 
Self-Ref and Self-Rep 
547 

comfortable in mixing levels which we tend to see as quite distinct. Actually, 
in computer science there is already a visible tendency to mix all these 
seemingly distinct aspects of an information-processing system. This is 
particularly so in Artificial Intelligence research, which is usually at the 
forefront of computer language design. 
The Origin of Life 
A natural and fundamental question to ask, on learning of these incredibly 
intricately interlocking pieces of software and hardware is: "How did they 
ever get started in the first place?" It is truly a baffling thing. One has to 
imagine some sort of a bootstrap process occurring, somewhat like that 
which is used in the development of new computer languages-but a 
bootstrap from simple molecules to entire cells is almost beyond one's 
power to imagine. There are various theories on the origin of life. They all 
run aground on this most central of all central questions: "How did the 
Genetic Code, along with the mechanisms for its translation (ribosomes and 
tRNA molecules), originate?" For the moment, we will have to content 
ourselves with a sense of wonder and awe, rather than with an answer. And 
perhaps experiencing that sense of wonder and awe is more satisfying than 
having an answer-at least for a while.

The Magnijicrab, Indeed 
It is spring, and the Tortoise and Achilles are taking a Sunday promenade 
in the woods together. They have decided to climb a hill at the top of which, 
it is said, there is a wonderful teahouse, with all sorts of delicious pastries. 
Achilles: 
Man oh man! If a crab-
Tortoise: If a crab?? 
Achilles: 
I was about to say, if a crab ever were intelligent, then surely it 
would be our mutual friend the Crab. Why, he must be at least two 
times as smart as any crab alive. Or maybe even three times as smart as 
any crab alive. Or perhaps-
Tortoise: 
My soul! How you magnify the Crab! 
Achilles: 
Well, I just happen to be an admirer of his ... 
Tortoise: 
No need to apologize. I admire him, too. Speaking of Crab-
admirers, did I tell you about the curious fan letter which the Crab 
received not too long ago? 
Achilles: 
I don't believe so. Who sent it? 
Tortoise: 
It bore a postmark from India, and was from someone neither of 
us had ever heard of before-a Mr. Najunamar, I believe. 
Achilles: 
I wonder why someone who never knew Mr. Crab would send 
him a letter-or for that matter, how they would get his address. 
Tortoise: 
Apparently whoever it was was under the illusion that the Crab is 
a mathematician. It contained numerous results, all of which were-
But, hoI Speak of the devil! Here comes Mr. Crab now, down the hill. 
Crab: 
Good-bye! It was nice to talk with you again. Well, I guess I had best 
be off. But I'm utterly stuffed-couldn't eat one more bite if I h'ad to! 
I've just been up there myself-recommend it highly. Have you ever 
been to the teahouse at the crest of the hill? How are you, Achilles? Oh, 
there's Achilles. Hello, hello. Well, well, if it isn't Mr. T! 
Tortoise: 
Hello, Mr. C. Are you headed up to the hilltop teahouse? 
Crab: 
Why, yes indeed, I am; how did you guess it? I'm quite looking 
forward to some of their special napoleons-scrumptious little mor-

you, Achilles? 
Achilles:

Crab: 
Wonderful! Well, don't let me interrupt your discussion. I'lljust tag

Tortoise: 
Curiously enough, I was just about to describe your mysterious

Crab: 
Well, it was this way. This fellow Najunamar had apparently never 
had any formal training in mathematics, but had instead worked out 
some of his own methods for deriving new truths of mathematics. 
Some of his discoveries defeated me completely; I had never seen 
anything in the least like them before. For instance, he exhibited a map 
of India that he had managed to color using no fewer than 1729 
distinct colors. 
Achilles: 
1729! Did you say 1729? 
Crab: 
Yes-why do you ask? 
Achilles: 
Well, 1729 is a very interesting number, you know. 
Crab: 
Indeed. I wasn't aware of it. 
Achilles: 
In particular, it so happens that 1729 is the number of the taxicab 
which I took to Mr. Tortoise's this morning! 
Crab: 
How fascinating! Could you possibly tell me the number of the 
trolley car which you'll take to Mr. Tortoise's tomorrow morning? 
Achilles (after a moment's thought): 
It's not obvious to me; however, I should 
think it would be very large. 
Tortoise: 
Achilles has a wonderful intuition for these things. 
Crab: 
Yes. Well, as I was saying, Najunamar in his letter also proved that 
every even prime is the sum of two odd numbers, and that there are no 
solutions in positive integers to the equation 
for n = O. 
Achilles: 
What? All these old classics of mathematics resolved in one fell 
swoop? He must be a genius of the first rank! 
Tortoise: 
But Achilles-aren't you even in the slightest skeptical? 
Achilles: 
What? Oh, yes-skeptical. Well, of course I am. You don't think I 
believe that Mr. Crab got such a letter, do you? I don't fall for just 
anything, you know. So it must have been YOU, Mr. T, who received 
the letter! 
Tortoise: 
Oh, no, Achilles, the part about Mr. C receiving the letter is quite 
true. What I meant was, aren't you skeptical about the content of the 
letter-its extravagant claims? 
Achilles: 
Why should I be? Hmm ... Well, of course I am. I'm a very 
skeptical person, as both of you should well know by now. It's very 
hard to convince me of anything, no matter how true or false it is. 
Tortoise: 
Very well put, Achilles. You certainly have a first-class awareness 
of your own mental workings. 
Achilles: 
Did it ever occur to you, my friends, that these claims of 
Najunamar might be incorrect? 
Crub: 
Frankly, Achilles, being rather conservative and orthodox myself, I 
was a bit concerned about that very point on first receiving the letter. 
In fact, I suspected at first that here was an out-and-out fraud. But on 
second thought, it occurred to me that not many types of people could 
manufacture such strange-sounding and complex results purely from 
their imagination. In fact, what it boiled down to was this question: 
The Magnificrab, Indeed 
551 

"Which is the more likely: a charlatan of such extraordinary ingenuity, 
or a mathematician of great genius?" And before long, I realized that 
the probabilities clearly favored the former. 
Achilles: 
Didn't you directly check out any of his amazing claims, however? 
Crab: 
Why should I? The probability argument was the most convincing 
thing I had ever thought of; no mathematical proof would have 
equaled it. But Mr. T here insisted on rigor. I finally gave in to his 
insistence, and checked all of Najunamar's results. To my great sur-
prise, each one of them was right. How he discovered them, I'll never 
know, however. He must have some amazing and inscrutable Oriental 
type of insight which we here in the Occident can have no inkling of. 
At present, that's the only theory which makes any sense to me. 
Tortoise: 
Mr. Crab has always been a little more susceptible to mystical or 
fanciful explanations than I am. I have full confidence that whatever 
Najunamar did in his way has. a complete parallel inside orthodox 
mathematics. There is no way of doing mathematics which is funda-
mentally different from what we now know, in my opinion. 
Achilles: 
That is an interesting opinion. I suppose it has something to do 
with the Church-Turing Thesis and related topics. 
Crab: 
Oh, well, let us leave these technical matters aside on such a fine 
day, and enjoy the quiet of the forest, the chirping of the birds, and the 
play of sunlight on the new leaves and buds. Ho! 
Tortoise: 
I second the motion. After all, all generations of Tortoises have 
reveled in such delights of nature. 
Crab: 
As have all generations of Crabs. 
Achilles: 
You don't happen to have brought your flute along, by any 
chance, Mr. C? 
Crab: 
Why, certainly! I take it with me everywhere. Would you like to 
hear a tune or two? 
Achilles: It would be delightful, in this pastoral setting. Do you play from 
memory? 
Crab: 
Sad to say, that is beyond my capability. I have to read my music 
from a sheet. But that is no problem. I have several very pleasant 
pieces here in this case. 
(He opens up a thin case and draws out afew pieces of paper. The topmost 
one has the following symbols on it: 
Va:~-Sa=O 
He sticks the top sheet into a little holder attached to his flute, and plays. 
The tune is very short.) 
Achilles: 
That was charming. (Peers over at the sheet on theflute, and a quizzical 
expression beclouds his face.) What is that statement of number theory 
doing, attached to your flute like that? 
552 
(The Crab looks at his flute, then his music, turns his head all around, and 
appears slight(y confused.) 
The Magnijicrab, Indeed 

Crab: 
I don't understand. What statement of number theory? 
Achilles: 
"Zero is not the successor of any natural number." Right there, in 
the holder on your flute! 
Crab: 
That's the third Piano Postulate. There are five of them, and I've 
arranged them all for flute. They're obvious, but catchy. 
Achilles: 
What's not obvious to me is how a number-theoretical statement 
can be played as music. 
Crab: 
But I insist, it's NOT a number-theoretical statement-it's a Piano 
Postulate! Would you like to hear another? 
Achilles: 
I'd be enchanted. 
(The Crab places another piece of paper on his flute, and this time Achilles 
watches more carefully.) 
Well, I watched your eyes, and they were looking at that FORMULA on 
the sheet. Are you sure that that is musical notation? I swear, it most 
amazingly resembles the notation which one might use in a formalized 
version of number theory. 
Crab: 
How odd! But certainly that is music, not any kind of statement of 
mathematics, as far as I can tell! Of course, I am not a mathematician 
in any sense of the word. Would you like to hear any other tunes? 
Achilles: 
By all means. Have you some others? 
Crab: 
Scads. 
(He takes a new sheet, and attaches it to his flute. It contains the following 
symbols: 
-3a:3b:(SSa ·SSb)=SSSSSSSSSSSSSO 
Achilles peers at it, while the Crab plays it.) 
Isn't it lovely? 
Achilles: 
Yes, it certainly is a tuneful little piece. But I have to say, it's 
looking more and more like number theory to me. 
Crab: 
Heavens! It is just my usual music notation, nothing more. I simply 
don't know how you read all these extramusical connotations into a 
straightforward representation for sounds. 
Achilles: 
Would you be averse to playing a piece of my own composition? 
Crab: 
Not in the least. Have you got it with you? 
Achilles: 
Not yet, but I have a hunch I might be able to compose some 
tunes all by myself. 
Tortoise: 
I must tell you, Achilles, that Mr. C is a harsh judge of music 
composed by others, so do not be disappointed if, by some chance, he 
is not an enthusiast for your efforts. 
Achilles: 
That is very kind of you to forewarn me. Still, I'm willing to give 
it a try ... 
(He writes: 
((SSSO· SSSO) +(SSSSO· SSSSO)) =(SSSSSO· SSSSSO) 
The Magnijicrab, Indeed 
553 

The Crab takes it, looks it over for a moment, then sets it in his music 
holder, and pipes.) 
Crab: 
Why, that's quite nice, Achilles. I enjoy strange rhythms. 
Achilles: 
What's strange about the rhythms in that piece? 
Crab: 
Oh, naturally, to you as the composer it must seem quite bland, but 
to my ears, shifting from a 3/3 rhythm to 4/4 and then to 5/5 is quite 
exotic. If you have any other songs, I'd be glad to play them. 
Achilles: 
Thank you very much. I've never composed anything before, 
and I must say composing is quite different from how I had imagined 
it to be. Let me try my hand at another one. Uots down a line.) 
- 3a:3b:(SSa' SSb) =SSSSSSSSSSSSSSO 
Crab: 
Hmmm ... Isn't that just a copy of my earlier piece? 
Achilles: 
Oh, no! I've added one more S. Where you had thirteen in a row, 
I have fourteen. 
Crab: 
Oh, yes. Of course. (He plays it, and looks very stern.) 
Achilles: 
I do hope you didn't dislike my piece! 
Crab: 
I am afraid, Achilles, that you completely failed to grasp the sub-
tleties of my piece, upon which yours is modeled. But how could I 
expect you to understand it on first hearing? One does not always 
understand what is at the root of beauty. It is so easy to mistake the 
superficial aspects of a piece for its beauty, and to imitate them, when 
the beauty itself is locked deep inside the music, in a way which seems 
always to elude analysis. 
Achilles: 
I am afraid that you have lost me a little in your erudite commen-
tary. I understand that my piece does not measure up to your high 
standards, but I do not know exactly where I went astray. Could you 
perhaps tell me some specific way in which you find fault with my 
composition? 
Crab: 
One possible way to save your composition, Achilles, would be to 
insert another three S's-five would do as well-into that long group of 
S's near the end. That would create a subtle and unusual effect. 
Achilles: 
I see. 
Crab: 
But there are other ways you might choose to change your piece. 
Personally, I would find it most appealing to put another tilde in the 
front. Then there would be a nice balance between the beginning and 
the end. Having two tildes in a row never fails to give a gay little twist to 
.a piece, you know. 
Achilles: 
How about if I take both of your suggestions, and make the 
following piece? 
- - 3a:3b;(SSa . SSb) =SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSO 
Crab (a painful grimace crossing his face): 
Now, Achilles, it is important to 
learn the following lesson: never try to put too much into any single 
piece. There is always a point beyond which it cannot be improved, 
554 
The Magnijicrab, Indeed 

and further attempts to improve it will in fact destroy it. Such is the 
case in this example. Your idea of incorporating both of my sugges-
tions together does not yield the desired extra amount of beauty, but 
on the contrary creates an imbalance which quite takes away all the 
charm. 
Achilles: 
How is it that two very similar pieces, such as yours with thirteen 
S's, and mine with fourteen S's, seem to you to be so different in their 
m'usical worth? Other than in that minor respect, the two are identical. 
Crab: 
Gracious! There is a world of difference between your piece and 
mine. Perhaps this is a place where words fail to convey what the spirit 
can feel. Indeed, I would venture to say that there exists no set of rules 
which delineate what it is that makes a piece beautiful, nor could there 
ever exist such a set of rules. The sense of Beauty is the exclusive 
domain of Conscious Minds, minds which through the experience of 
living have gained a depth that transcends explanation by any mere set 
of rules. 
Achilles: 
I will always remember this vivid clarification of the nature of 
Beauty. I suppose that something similar applies to the concept of 
Truth, as well? 
Crab: 
Without doubt. Truth and Beauty are as interrelated as-as-
Achilles: 
As interrelated as, say, mathematics and music? 
Crab: 
Oh! You took the words right out of my mouth! How did you know 
that that is what I was thinking? 
Tortoise: 
Achilles is very clever, Mr. C. Never underestimate the potency 
of his insight. 
Achilles: 
Would you say that there could conceivably be any relationship 
between the truth or falsity of a particular statement of mathematics, 
and the beauty, or lack of beauty, of an associated piece of music? Or is 
that just a far-fetched fancy of mine, with no basis in reality? 
Crab: If you are asking me, that is carrying things much too far. When I 
spoke of the interrelatedness of music and mathematics, I was speak-
ing very figuratively, you know. As for a direct connection between 
specific pieces of music and specific statements of mathematics, how-
ever, I harbor extremely grave doubts about its possibility. I would 
humbly counsel you not to give too much time to such idle specula-
tions. 
Achilles: 
You are no doubt right. It would be most unprofitable. Perhaps I 
ought to concentrate on sharpening my musical sensitivity by compos-
ing some new pieces. Would you be willing to serve as my mentor, 
Mr. C? 
Crab: 
I would be very happy to aid you in your steps towards musical 
understanding. 
(So Achilles takes pen in hand, and, with what appears to be a great deal of 
concentration, writes: 
f\OOaV'v-f\f\:b+cS(33=Or<J{(-d)<v(VS' +(>v 
The Magnijicrab, Indeed 
555 

The Crab looks very startled.) 
You really want me to play that-that-that whatever-it-is? 
Achilles: 
Oh, please do! 
(So the Crab plays it, with evident difficulty.) 
Tortoise: 
Bravo! Bravo! Is John Cage your favorite composer, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Actually, he's my favorite anti-composer. Anyway, I'm glad you 
liked MY music. 
Crab: 
The two of you may find it amusing to listen to such totally mean-
ingless cacophony, but I assure you it is not at all pleasant for a 
sensitive composer to be su~jected to such excruciating, empty disso-
nances and meaningless rhythms. Achilles, I thought you had a good 
feeling for music. Could it be that your previous pieces had merit 
merely by coincidence? 
Achilles: 
Oh, please forgive me, Mr. Crab. I was trying to explore the 
limits of your musical notation. I wanted to learn directly what kinds of 
sound result when I write certain types of note sequences, and also 
how you evaluate pieces written in various styles. 
Crab: 
Harrumph! I am not just an automatic music-machine, you know. 
Nor am I a garbage disposal for musical trash. 
Achilles: 
I am very sorry. But I feel that I have learned a great deal by 
writing that small piece, and I am convinced that I can now write much 
better music than I ever could have if I hadn't tried that idea. And if 
you'll just play one more piece of mine, I have high hopes that you will 
feel better about my musical sensitivities. 
Crab: 
Well, all right. Write it down and I'll give it a chance. 
(Achilles writes: 
Va:Vb:«a 'a) =(SSO'(b' b)):Ja=O> 
and the Crab plays.) 
You were right, Achilles. You seem to have completely regained your 
musical acuity. This is a little gem! How did you come to compose it? I 
have never heard anything like it. I t obeys all the rules of harmony, 
and yet has a certain-what shall I say?-irrational appeal to it. I can't 
put my finger on it, but I like it for that very reason. 
Achilles: 
I kind of thought you might like it. 
Tortoise: 
Have you got a name for it, Achilles? Perhaps you might call it 
"The Song of Pythagoras". You remember that Pythagoras and his 
followers were among the first to study musical sound. 
Achilles: 
Yes, that's true. That would be a fine title. 
Crab: 
Wasn't Pythagoras also the first to discover that the ratio of two 
squares can never be equal to 2? 
Tortoise: 
I believe you're right. It was considered a truly sinister discovery 
at the time, for never before had anyone realized that there are 
556 
The Magnijicrab, Indeed 

numbers-such as the square root of 2-which are not ratios of inte-
gers. And thus the discovery was deeply disturbing to the Pythago-
reans, who felt that it revealed an unsuspected and grotesque defect in 
the abstract world of numbers. But I don't know what this has to do 
with the price of tea in China. 
Achilles: 
Speaking of tea, isn't that the teahouse just up there ahead of us? 
Tortoise: 
Yes, that's it, all right. We ought to be there in a couple of 
minutes. 
Achilles: 
Hmm ... That's just enough time for me to whistle for you the 
tune which the taxi driver this morning had on his radio. It went like 
this. 
Crab: 
Hold on for a moment; I'll get some paper from my case, and jot 
down your tune. (Scrounges around inside his case, and finds a blank sheet.) 
Go ahead; I'm ready. 
(Achilles whistles a rather long tune, and the Crab scrambles to keep up 
with him.) 
Could you whistle the last few bars again? 
Achilles: 
Why, certainly. 
(After a couple of such repeats, the session is complete, and the Crab 
proudly displays his transcription: 
«(SSSSSO· SSSSSO) + (SSSSSO· SSSSSO)) = ((SSSSSSSO· SSSSSSSO) +(SO· SO)) 
1\-3b:<3c(Sc+b)=((SSSSSSSO·SSSSSSSO)+(SO·SO))1\3d:3d':3e:3e': 
< -<d=evd=e' >1\<b=((Sd· Sd)+(Sd'· Sd'))l\b=((Se ·Se)+(Se' ·Se'))> > > > 
The Crab then plays it himself.) 
Tortoise: 
It's peculiar music, isn't it? It sounds a wee bit like music from 
India, to me. 
Crab: 
Oh, I think it's too simple to be from India. But of course I know 
precious little about such things. 
Tortoise: 
Well, here we are at the teahouse. Shall we sit outside here, on 
the verandah? 
Crab: If you don't mind, I'd prefer to go inside. I've gotten perhaps 
enough sun for the day. 
(They go inside the teahouse and are seated at a nice wooden table, and 
order cakes and tea. Soon a cart of scrumptious-looking pastries is wheeled 
up, and each of them chooses his favorite.) 
Achilles: 
You know, Mr. C, I would love to know what you think of 
another piece which I have just composed in my head. 
Crab: 
Can you show it to me? Here, write it down on this napkin. 
(Achilles writes: 
Va:3b:3c:<-3d:3e:«SSd . SSe) = bv(SSd ·SSe)=c>l\(a +a)=(b+c» 
The Crab and Tortoise study it with interest.) 
The Magnijicrab, Indeed 
557 

Tortoise: 
Is it another beautiful piece, Mr. C, in your opinion? 
Crab: 
Well, uh ... (Shifts in his chair, and looks somewhat uncomfortable.) 
Achilles: 
What's the matter? Is it harder to decide whether this piece is 
beautiful than it is for other pieces? 
Crab: 
Ahm ... No, it's not that-not at all. It's just that, well ... I really 
have to HEAR a piece before I can tell how much I like it. 
Achilles: 
So go ahead and play it! I'm dying to know whether you find it 
beautiful or not. 
Crab: 
Of course, I'd be extremely glad to play it for you. The only thing 
IS •.. 
Achilles: 
Can't you play it for me? What's the matter? Why are you balk-
ing? 
Tortoise: 
Don't you realize, Achilles, that for Mr. Crab to fulfill your 
request would be most impolite and disturbing to the clientele and 
employees of this fine establishment? 
Crab (suddenly looking relieved): 
That's right. We have no right to impose 
our music on others. 
Achilles (dejectedly): 
Oh, PHOOEY! And I SO much wanted to know what he 
thinks of this piece! 
Crab: 
Whew! That was a close call! 
Achilles: 
What was that remark? 
Crab: 
Oh-nothing. It's just that that waiter over there, he got knocked 
into by another waiter, and almost dropped a whole pot of tea into a 
lady's lap. A narrow escape, I must say. What do you say, Mr. Tortoise? 
Tortoise: 
Very good teas, I'd say. Wouldn't you agree, Achilles? 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes. Prime teas, in fact. 
Crab: 
Definitely. Well, I don't know about you two, but I should perhaps 
be going, for I've a long steep trail back to my house, on the other side 
of this hill. 
Achilles: 
You mean this is a big bluff? 
Crab: 
You said it, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
I see. Well, I'll have to remember that. 
Crab: 
It has been such ajolly afternoon, Achilles, and I sincerely hope we 
will exchange more musical compositions another day. 
Achilles: 
I'm looking forward to that very much, Mr. C. Well, good-bye. 
Tortoise: 
Good-bye, Mr. C. 
(And the Crab heads off down his side of the hill.) 
Achilles: 
Now there goes a brilliant fellow ... In my estimation, he's at 
least four times as smart as any crab alive. Or he might even be five-
Tortoise: 
As you said in the beginning, and probably shall be saying 
forevermore, words without end.

CHAPTER XVII 
Church, Turing, Tarski, 
and Others 
Formal and Informal Systems 
WE HAVE COME to the point where we can develop one of the main theses 
of this book: that every aspect of thinking can be viewed as a high-level 
description of a system which, on a low level, is governed by simple, even 
formal, rules. The "system", of course, is a brain-unless one is speaking of 
thought processes flowing in another medium, such as a computer's cir-
cuits. The image is that of a formal system underlying an "informal 
system"-a system which can, for instance, make puns, discover number 
patterns, forget names, make awful blunders in chess, and so forth. This is 
what one sees from the outside: its informal, overt, software level. By 
contrast, it has a formal, hidden, hardware level (or "substrate") which is a 
formidably complex mechanism that makes transitions from state to state 
according to definite rules physically embodied in it, and according to the 
input of signals which impinge on it. 
A vision of the brain such as this has many philosophical and other 
consequences, needless to say. I shall try to spell some of them out in this 
Chapter. Among other things, this vision seems to imply that, at bottom, 
the brain is some sort of a "mathematical" object. Actually, that is at best a 
very awkward way to look at the brain. The reason is that, even if a brain is, 
in a technical and abstract sense, some sort of formal system, it remains true 
that mathematicians only work with simple and elegant systems, systems in 
which everything is extremely clearly defined-and the brain is a far cry 
from that, with its ten billion or more semi-independent neurons, quasi-
randomly connected up to each other. So mathematicians would never 
study a real brain's networks. And if you define "mathematics" as what 
mathematicians enjoy doing, then the properties of brains are not mathe-
matical. 
The only way to understand such a complex system as a brain is by 
chunking it on higher and higher levels, and thereby losing some precision 
at each step. What emerges at the top level is the "informal system" which 
obeys so many rules of such complexity that we do not yet have the 
vocabulary to think about it. And that is what Artificial Intelligence re-
search is hoping to find. It has quite a different flavor from mathematics 
research. Nevertheless, there is a loose connection to mathematics: AI 
people often come from a strong mathematics background, and 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
559 

mathematicians sometimes are intrigued by the workings of their own 
brains. The following passage, quoted from Stanislaw Ulam's autobio-
graphical Adventures of a Mathematician, illustrates this point: 
It seems to me that more could be done to elicit ... the nature of associations, 
with computers providing the means for experimentation. Such a study 
would have to involve a gradation of notions, of symbols, of classes of symbols, 
of classes of classes, and so on, in the same way that the complexity of 
mathematical or physical structures is investigated. 
There must be a trick to the train of thought, a recursive formula. A group 
of neurons starts working automatically, sometimes without external impulse. 
It is a kind of iterative process with a growing pattern. It wanders about in the 
brain, and the way it happens must depend on the memory of similar pat-
terns.' 
Intuition and the Magnificent Crab 
Artificial Intelligence is often referred to as "AI". Often, when I try to 
explain what is meant by the term, I say that the letters "AI" could just as 
well stand for "Artificial Intuition", or even "Artificial Imagery". The aim 
of AI is to get at what is happening when one's mind silently and invisibly 
chooses, from a myriad alternatives, which one makes most sense in a very 
complex situation. In many real-life situations, deductive reasoning is in-
appropriate, not because it would give wrong answers, but because there are 
too many correct but irrelevant statements which can be made; there are just 
too many things to take into account simultaneously for reasoning alone to 
be sufficient. Consider this mini-dialogue: 
"The other day I read in the paper that the-" 
"Oh-you were reading? It follows that you have eyes. Or at least 
one eye. Or rather, that you had at least one eye then." 
A sense of judgment-"What is important here, and what is not?"-is called 
for. Tied up with this is a sense of simplicity, a sense of beauty. Where do 
these intuitions come from? How can they emerge from an underlying 
formal system? 
In the Magnificrab, some unusual powers of the Crab's mind are re-
vealed. His own version of his powers is merely that he listens to music and 
distinguishes the beautiful from the non-beautiful. (Apparently for him there 
is a sharp dividing line.) Now Achilles finds another way to describe the 
Crab's abilities: the Crab divides statements of number theory into the 
categories true and false. But the Crab maintains that, if he chances to do so, 
it is only by the purest accident, for he is, by his own admission, incompe-
tent in mathematics. What makes the Crab's performance all the more 
mystifying to Achilles, however, is that it seems to be in direct violation of a 
celebrated result of metamathematICs with which Achilles is familiar: 
CHURCH'S THEOREM: 
There is no infallible method for telling theorems of 
TNT from nontheorems. 
560 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

It was proven in 1936 by the American logician Alonzo Church. Closely 
related is what I call the 
T ARSKI-CHURCH-TURING THEOREM: 
There is no infallible method for 
telling true from false statements of number theory. 
The Church-Turing Thesis 
To understand Church's Theorem and the Tarski-Church-Turing Theo-
rem better, we should first describe one of the ideas on which they are 
based; and that is the Church-Turing Thesis (often called "Church's Thesis"). 
For the Church-Turing Thesis is certainly one of the most important 
concepts in the philosophy of mathematics, brains, and thinking. 
Actually, like tea, the Church-Turing Thesis can be given in a variety 
of different strengths. So I will present it in various versions, and we will 
consider what they imply. 
The first version sounds very innocent-in fact almost pointless: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, TAUTOLOGICAL VERSION: 
Mathematics problems 
can be solved only by doing mathematics. 
Of course, its meaning resides in the meaning of its constituent terms. By 
"mathematics problem" I mean the problem of deciding whether some 
number possesses or does not possess a given arithmetical property. It 
turns out that by means of Godel-numbering and related coding tricks, 
almost any problem in any branch of mathematics can be put into this 
form, so that "mathematics problem" retains its ordinary meaning. What 
about "doing mathematics"? When one tries to ascertain whether a number 
has a property, there seem to be only a small number of operations which 
one uses in combination over and over again-addition, multiplication, 
checking for equality or inequality. That is, loops composed of such opera-
tions seem to be the only tool we have that allows us to probe the world of 
numbers. Note the word "seem". This is the critical word which the 
Church-Turing Thesis is about. We can give a revision: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, STANDARD VERSION: 
Suppose there is a method 
which a sentient being follows in order to sort numbers into two 
classes. Suppose further that this method always yields an answer 
within a finite amount of time, and that it always gives the saHle answer 
for a given number. Then: Some terminating FlooP program (i.e., some 
general recursive function) exists which gives exactly the same answers 
as the sentient being's method does. 
The central hypothesis, to make it very clear, is that any mental process 
which divides numbers into two sorts can be described in the form of a 
FlooP program. The intuitive belief is that there are no other tools than 
those in FlooP, and that there are no ways to use those tools other than by 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
561 

unlimited iterations (which FlooP allows). The Church-Turing Thesis is not 
a provable fact in the sense of a Theorem of mathematics-it is a hypothesis 
about the processes which human brains use. 
The Public-Processes Version 
Now some people might feel that this version asserts too much. These 
people might put their objections as follows: "Someone such as the Crab 
might exist-someone with an almost mystical insight into mathematics, but 
who is just as much in the dark about his own peculiar abilities as anyone 
else-and perhaps that person's mental mechanisms carry out operations 
which have no counterpart in FlooP." The idea is that perhaps we have a 
subconscious potential for doing things which transcend the conscious 
processes-things which are somehow inexpressible in terms of the 
elementary FlooP operations. For these objectors, we shall give a weaker 
version of the Thesis: one which di&tinguishes between public and private 
mental processes: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, PUBLIC-PROCESSES VERSION: 
Suppose there is a 
method which a sentient being follows in order to sort numbers into 
two classes. Suppose further that this method always yields an answer 
within a finite amount of time, and that it always gives the same answer 
for a given number. Proviso: Suppose also that this method can be 
communicated reliably from one sentient being to another by means of 
language. Then: Some terminating FlooP program (i.e., general recur-
sive function) exists which gives exactly the same answers as the sen-
tient beings' method does. 
This says that public methods are subject to "FlooPification", but asserts 
nothing about private methods. It does not say that they are un-FlooP-able, 
but it at least leaves the door open. 
Srinivasa Ramanujan 
As evidence against any stronger version of the Church-Turing Thesis, let 
us consider the case of the famous Indian mathematician of the first 
quarter of the twentieth century, Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920). 
Ramanujan (Fig. 105) came from Tamilnadu, the southernmost part of 
India, and studied mathematics a little in high school. One day, someone 
who recognized Ramanujan's talent for math presented him with a copy of 
a slightly out-of-date textbook on analysis, which Ramanujan devoured 
(figuratively speaking). He then began making his own forays into the 
world of analysis, and by the time he was twenty-three, he had made a 
number of discoveries which he considered worthwhile. He did not know 
to whom to turn, but somehow was told about a professor of mathematics 
in faraway England, named G. H. Hardy. Ramanujan compiled his best

results together in a packet of papers, and sent them all to the un-
forewarned Hardy with a covering letter which friends helped him express 
in English. Below are some excerpts taken from Hardy's description of his 
reaction upon receiving the bundle: 
... It soon became obvious that Ramanujan must possess much more general 
theorems and was keeping a great deal up his sleeve .... [Some formulae] 
defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them 
before. A single look at them is enough to show that they could only be 
written down by a mathematician of the highest class. They must be true 
because, if they were not true, no one would have had the imagination to 
invent them. Finally ... the writer must be completely honest, because great 
mathematicians are commoner than thieves or humbugs of such incredible 
skill. 2 
What resulted from this correspondence was that Ramanujan came to 
England in 1913, sponsored by Hardy; and then followed an intense 
collaboration which terminated in Ramanujan's early demise at age thirty-
three from tuberculosis. 
Ramanujan had several extraordinary characteristics which set him 
apart from the majority of mathematicians. Om. was his lack of rigor. Very 
often he would simply state a result which he would insist, had just come to 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
563 

him from a vague intuitive source, far out of the realm of conscious 
probing. In fact, he often said that the goddess Namagiri inspired him in 
his dreams. This happened time and again, and what made it all the more 
mystifying-perhaps even imbuing it with a certain mystical quality-was 
the fact that many of his "intuition-theorems" were wrong. Now there is a 
curious paradoxical effect where sometimes an event which you think 
could not help but make credulous people become a little more skeptical, 
actually has the reverse effect, hitting the credulous ones in some vulnera-
ble spot of their minds, tantalizing them with the hint of some baffling 
irrational side of human nature. Such was the case with Ramanujan's 
blunders: many educated people with a yearning to believe in something of 
the sort considered Ramanujan's intuitive powers to be evidence of a 
mystical insight into Truth, and the fact of his fallibility seemed, if any-
thing, to strengthen, rather than weaken, such beliefs. 
Of course it didn't hurt that he was from one of the most backward 
parts of India, where fakirism and other eerie Indian rites had been 
practiced for millennia, and were still practiced with a frequency probably 
exceeding that of the teaching of higher mathematics. And his occasional 
wrong flashes of insight, instead of suggesting to people that he was merely 
human, paradoxically inspired the idea that Ramanujan's wrongness al-
ways had some sort of "deeper rightness" to it-an "Oriental" rightness, 
perhaps touching upon truths inaccessible to Western minds. What a de-
licious, almost irresistible thought! Even Hardy-who would have been the 
first to deny that Ramanujan had any mystical powers-once wrote about 
one of Ramanujan's failures, "And yet I am not sure that, in some ways, his 
failure was not more wonderful than any of his triumphs." 
The other outstanding feature of Ramanujan's mathematical personal-
ity was his "friendship with the integers", as his colleague Littlewood put it. 
This is a characteristic that a fair number of mathematicians share to some 
degree or other, but which.Ramanujan possessed to an extreme. There are 
a couple of anecdotes which illustrate this special power. The first one is 
related by Hardy: 
I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had 
ridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to me 
rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. "No," he 
replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible 
as a sum of two cubes in two different ways." I asked him, naturally, whether 
he knew the answer to the correspondmg problem for fourth powers; and he 
replied, after a moment's thought. that he could see no obvious example, and 
thought that the first such number must be very large. 3 
It turns out that the answer for fourth powers is: 
635318657 = 1344 + 1334 = 1584 + 594 
The reader may find it interesting to tackle the analogous problem for 
squares, which is much easier. 
It is actually quite interesting to ponder why it is that Hardy im-
564 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

mediately jumped to fourth powers. After all, there are several other 
reasonably natural generalizations of the equation 
along different dimensions. For instance, there is the question about repre-
senting a number in three distinct ways as a sum of two cubes: 
Or, one can use three different cubes: 
Or one can even make a Grand Generalization in all dimensions at once: 
There is a sense, however, in which Hardy's generalization is "the most 
mathematician-like". Could this sense of mathematical esthetics ever be 
programmed? 
The other anecdote is taken from a biography of Ramanujan by his 
countryman S. R. Ranganathan, where it is called "Ramanujan's Flash". It 
is related by a Indian friend of Ramanujan's from his Cambridge days, Dr. 
P. C. Mahalanobis. 
On another occasion, I went to his room to have lunch with him. The First 
World War had started some time earlier. I had in my hand a copy of the 
monthly "Strand Magazine" which at that time used to publish a number of 
puzzles to be solved by readers. Ramanujan was stirring something in a pan 
over the fire for our lunch. I was sitting near the table, turning over the pages 
of the Magazine. I got interested in a problem involving a relation between 
two numbers. I have forgotten the details; but I remember the type of the 
problem. Two British officers had been billeted in Paris in two different 
houses in a long street; the door numbers of these houses were related in a 
special way; the problem was to find out the two numbers. It was not at all 
difficult. I got the solution in a few minutes by trial and error. 
MAHALANOBIS (in a joking way): Now here is a problem for you. 
RAMANUJAN: What problem, tell me. (He went on stirring the pan.) 
I read out the question from the "Strand Magazine". 
RAMANUJAN: Please take down the solution. (He dictated a continued 
fraction.) 
The first term was the solution which I had obtained. Each successive term 
represented successive solutions for the same type of relation between two 
numbers, as the number of houses in the street would increase indefinitely. I 
was amazed. 
MAHALANOBIS: Did you get the solution in a flash? 
RAMANUJAN: Immediately I heard the problem, it was clear that the 
solution was obviously a continued fraction; I then thought, "Which con-
tinued fraction?" and the answer came to my mind. It was just as simple as 
this.4 
Hardy, as Ramanujan's closest co-worker, was often asked after 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
565 

Ramanujan's death if there had been any occult or otherwise exotically 
flavored elements to Ramanujan's thinking style. Here is one comment 
which he gave: 
I have often been asked wh-:ther Ramanujan had any special secret; whether 
his methods differed in kind from those of other mathematicians; whether 
there was anything really abnormal in his mode of thought. I cannot answer 
these questions with any confidence or conviction; but I do not believe it. My 
belief is that all mathematicians think, at bottom, in the same kind of way, and 
that Ramanujan was no exception.s 
Here Hardy states in essence his own version of the Church-Turing Thesis. 
I paraphrase: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, HARDY'S VERSION: 
At bottom, all mathematicians 
are isomorphic. 
This does not equate the mathematical potential of mathematicians with 
that of general recursive functions; for that, however, all you need is to 
show that some mathematician's mental capacity is no more general than 
recursive functions. Then, if you believe Hardy's Version, you know it for 
all mathematicians. 
Then Hardy compares Ramanujan with calculating prodigies: 
His memory, and his powers of calculation, were very unusual, but they could 
not reasonably be called "abnormal". [f he had to multiply two large numbers, 
he multiplied them in the ordinary way; he could do it with unusual rapidity 
and accuracy, but not more rapidly and accurately than any mathematician 
who is naturally quick and has the habit of computation.6 
Hardy describes what he perceived as Ramanujan's outstanding intellectual 
attributes: 
With his memory, his patience, and his power of calculation, he combined a 
power of generalisation, afeelingfor form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his 
hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own field, 
withou t a rival in his day. 7 
The part of this passage which I have italicized seems to me to be an 
excellent characterization of some of the subtlest features of intelligence in 
general. Finally, Hardy concludes somewhat nostalgically: 
[His work] has not the simplicity and inevitableness of the very greatest work; 
it would be greater if it were less strange. One gift it has which no one can 
deny-profound and invincible originality. He would probably have been a 
greater mathematician if he had been caught and tamed a little in his youth; 
he would have discovered more that was new, and that, no doubt, of greater 
importance. On the other hand he would have been less of a Ramanujan, and 
more of a European professor and the loss might have been greater than the 
gain.s 
The esteem in which Hardy held Ramanujan is revealed by the romantic 
way in which he speaks of him.

"Idiots Savants" 
There is another class of people whose mathematical abilities seem to defy 
rational explanation-the so-called "idiots savants", who can perform com-
plex calculations at lightning speeds in their heads (or wherever they do it). 
Johann Martin Zacharias Dase, who lived from 1824 to 186i and was 
employed by various European governments to perform computations, is 
an outstanding example. He not only could multiply two numbers each of 
100 digits in his head; he also had an uncanny sense of quantity. That is, he 
could just "tell", without counting, how many sheep were in a field, or 
words in a sentence, and so forth, up to about 30-this in contrast to most 
of us, who have such a sense up to about 6, with reliability. Incidentally, 
Dase was not an idiot. 
I shall not describe the many fascinating documented cases of "light-
ning calculators", for that is not my purpose here. But I do feel it is 
important to dispel the idea that they do it by some mysterious, unanalyz-
able method. Although it is often the case that such wizards' calculational 
abilities far exceed their abilities to explain their results, every once in a 
while, a person with other intellectual gifts comes along who also has this 
spectacular ability with numbers. From such people's introspection, as well 
as from extensive research by psychologists, it has been ascertained that 
nothing occult takes place during the performances of lightning cal-
culators, but simply that their minds race through intermediate steps with 
the kind of self-confidence that a natural athlete has in executing a compli-
cated motion quickly and gracefully. They do not reach their answers by 
some sort of instantaneous flash of enlightenment (though subjectively it 
may feel that way to some of them), but-like the rest of us-by sequential 
calculation, which is to say, by FlooP-ing (or BlooP-ing) along. 
Incidentally, one of the most obvious clues that no "hot line to God" is 
involved is the mere fact that when the numbers involved get bigger, the 
answers are slower in coming. Presumably, if God or an "oracle" were 
supplying the answers, he wouldn't have to slow up when the numbers got 
bigger. One could probably make a nice plot showing how the time taken 
by a lightning calculator varies with the sizes of the numbers involved, and 
the operations involved, and from it deduce some features of the al-
gorithms employed. 
The Isomorphism Version of the Church-Turing Thesis 
This finally brings us to a strengthened standard version of the Church-
Turing Thesis: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, ISOMORPHISM VERSION: 
Suppose there is a method 
which a sentient being follows in order to sort numbers into two 
classes. Suppose further that this method always yields an answer 
within a finite amount of time, and that it always gives the same answer 
for a given number. Then: Some terminating FlooP program (i.e., 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
567 

general recursive function} exists which gives exactly the same answers 
as the sentient being's method does. Moreover: The mental process and 
the FlooP program are isomorphic in the sense that on some level 
there is a correspondence between the steps being carried out in both 
computer and brain. 
Notice that not only has the conclusion been strengthened, but also the 
proviso of communicability of the faint-hearted Public-Processes Version 
has been dropped. This bold version is the one which we now shall discuss. 
In brief, this version asserts that when one computes something, one's 
mental activity can be mirrored isomorphically in some FlooP program. 
And let it be very clear that this does not mean that the brain is actually 
running a FlooP program, written in the FlooP language complete with 
BEGIN's, END's, ABORT's, and the rest-not at all. It is just that the steps are 
taken in the same order as they could be in a FlooP program, and the 
logical structure of the calculation can be mirrored in a FlooP program. 
Now in order to make sense of this idea, we shall have to make some 
level distinctions in both computer and brain, for otherwise it could be 
misinterpreted as utter nonsense. Presumably the steps of the calculation 
going on inside a person's head are on the highest level, and are supported 
by lower levels, and eventually by hardware. So if we speak of an isomor-
phism, it means we've tacitly made the assumption that the highest level can 
be isolated, allowing us to discuss what goes on there independently of 
other levels, and then to map that top level into FlooP. To be more precise, 
the assumption is that there exist software entities which play the roles of 
various mathematical constructs, and which are activated in ways which can 
be mirrored exactly inside FlooP (see Fig. 106). What enables these 
software entities to come into existence is the entire infrastructure dis-
cussed in Chapters XI and XII, as well as in the Prelude, Ant Fugue. There is 
no assertion of isomorphic activity on the lower levels of brain and comput-
er (e.g., neurons and bits). 
The spirit of the Isomorphism Version, if not the letter, is gotten 
across by saying that what an idiot savant does in calculating, say, the 
logarithm of 1T, is isomorphic to what a pocket calculator does in calculating 
it-where the isomorphism holds on the arithmetic-step level, not on the 
lower levels of, in the one case, neurons, and in the other, integrated 
circuits. (Of course different routes can be followed in calculating 
anything-but presumably the pocket calculator, if not the human, could 
be instructed to calculate the answer in any specific manner.) 
FIGURE 106. 
The behavior of natural numbers can be mirrored in a human brain or in the 
programs of a computer. These two different representations can then be mapped onto each 
other on an appropriately abstract level.

Representation of Knowledge about the Real World 
Now this seems quite plausible when the domain referred to is number 
theory, for there the total universe in which things happen is very small and 
clean. Its boundaries and residents and rules are well-defined, as in a 
hard-edged maze. Such a world is far less complicated than the open-ended 
and ill-defined world which we inhabit. A number theory problem, once 
stated, is complete in and of itself. A real-world problem, on the other 
hand, never is sealed off from any part of the world with absolute certainty. 
For instance, the task of replacing a burnt-out light bulb may turn out to 
require moving a garbage bag; this may unexpectedly cause the spilling of a 
box of pills, which then forces the floor to be swept so that the pet dog won't 
eat any of the spilled pills, etc., etc. The pills and the garbage and the dog 
and the light bulb are all quite distantly related parts of the world-yet an 
intimate connection is created by some everyday happenings. And there is 
no telling what else could be brought in by some other small variations on 
the expected. By contrast, if you are given a number theory problem, you 
never wind up having to consider extraneous things such as pills or dogs or 
bags of garbage or brooms in order to solve your problem. (Of course, your 
intuitive knowledge of such objects may serve you in good stead as you go 
about unconsciously trying to manufacture mental images to help you in 
visualizing the problem in geometrical terms-but that is another matter.) 
Because of the complexity of the world, it is hard to imagine a little 
pocket calculator that can answer questions put to it when you press a few 
buttons bearing labels such as "dog", "garbage", "light bulb", and so forth. 
In fact, so far it has proven to be extremely complicated to have a full-size 
high-speed computer answer questions about what appear to us to be 
rather simple subdomains of the real world. It seems that a large amount of 
knowledge has to be taken into account in a highly integrated way for 
"understanding" to take place. We can liken real-world thought processes 
to a tree whose visible part stands sturdily above ground but depends vitally 
on its invisible roots which extend way below ground, giving it stability and 
nourishment. In this case the roots symbolize complex processes which take 
place below the conscious level of the mind-processes whose effects per-
meate the way we think but of which we are unaware. These are the 
"triggering patterns of symbols" which were discussed in Chapters XI and 
XII. 
Real-world thinking is quite different from what happens when we do 
a multiplication of two numbers, where everything is "above ground", so to 
speak, open to inspection. In arithmetic, the top level can be "skimmed off" 
and implemented equally well in many different sorts of hardware: 
mechanical adding machines, pocket calculators, large computers, people's 
brains, and so forth. This is what the Church-Turing Thesis is all about. 
But when it comes to real-world understanding, it seems that there is no 
simple way to skim off the top level, and program iLalone. The triggering 
patterns of symbols are just too complex. There must be several levels 
through which thoughts may "percolate" and "bubble". 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
569 

In particular-and this comes back to a major theme of Chapters XI 
and XII-the representation of the r~al world in the brain, although 
rooted in isomorphism to some extent, involves some elements which have 
no counterparts at all in the outer world. That is, there is much more to it 
than simple mental structures representing "dog", "broom", etc. All of 
these symbols exist, to be sure-but their internal structures are extremely 
complex and to a large degree are unavailable for conscious inspection. 
Moreover, one would hunt in vain to map each aspect of a symbol's internal 
structure onto some specific feature of the real world. 
Processes That Are Not 50 5kimmable 
For this reason, the brain begins to look like a very peculiar formal system, 
for on its bottom level-the neural level-where the "rules" operate and 
change the state, there may be no interpretation of the primitive elements 
(neural firings, or perhaps even lower-level events). Yet on the top level, 
there emerges a meaningful interpretation-a mapping from the large 
"clouds" of neural activity which we have been calling "symbols", onto the 
real world. There is some resemblance to the Codel construction, in that a 
high-level isomorphism allows a high level of meaning to be read into 
strings; but in the Codel construction, the higher-level meaning "rides" on 
the lower level-that is, it is derived from the lower level, once the notion of 
Codel-numbering has been introduced. But in the brain, the events on the 
neural level are not subject to real-world interpretation; they are simply not 
imitating anything. They are there purely as the substrate to support the 
higher level, much as transistors in a pocket calculator are there purely to 
support its number-mirroring activity. And the implication is that there is 
no way to skim off just the highest level and make an isomorphic copy in a 
program; if one is to mirror the brain processes which allow real-world 
understanding, then one must mirror some of the lower-level things which 
are taking place: the "languages of the brain". This doesn't necessarily 
mean that one must go all the way down to the level of the hardware, 
though that may turn out to be the case. 
In the course of developing a program with the aim of achieving an 
"intelligent" (viz., human-like) internal representation of what is "out 
there", at some point one will probably be forced into using structures and 
processes which do not admit of any straightforward interpretations-that 
is, which cannot be directly mapped onto elements of reality. These lower 
lc!yers of the program will be able to be understood only by virtue of their 
catalytic relation to layers above them, rather than because of some direct 
connection they have to the outer world. (A concrete image of this idea was 
suggested by the Anteater in the Ant Fugue: the "indescribably boring 
nightmare" of trying to understand a book on the letter level.) 
Personally, I would guess that such multilevel architecture of 
concept-handling systems becomes necessary just when processes involving 
images and analogies become significant elements of the program-in 
570 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

I 
contrast to processes which are supposed to carry out strictly deductive 
reasoning. Processes which carry out deductive reasoning can be pro-
grammed in essentially one single level, and are therefore skimmable, by 
definition. According to my hypothesis, then, imagery and analogical 
thought processes intrinsically require several layers of substrate and are 
therefore intrinsically non-skimmable. I believe furthermore that it is pre-
cisely at this same point that creativity starts to emerge-which would imply 
that creativity intrinsically depends upon certain kinds of "uninterpretable" 
lower-level events. The layers of underpinning of analogical thinking are, 
of course, of extreme interest, and some speculations on their nature will 
be offered in the next two Chapters. 
Articles of Reductionistic Faith 
One way to think about the relation between higher and lower levels in the 
brain is this. One could assemble a neural net which, on a local (neuron-
to-neuron) level, performed in a manner indistinguishable from a neural 
net in a brain, but which had no higher-level meaning at all. The fact that 
the lower level is composed of interacting neurons does not necessarily 
force any higher level of meaning to appear-no more than the fact that 
alphabet soup contains letters forces meaningful sentences to be found, 
swimming about in the bowl. High-level meaning is an optional feature of a 
neural network-one which may emerge as a consequence of evolutionary 
environmental pressures. 
Figure 107 is a diagram illustrating the fact that emergence of a higher 
level of meaning is optional. The upwards-pointing arrow indicates that a 
substrate can occur without a higher level of meaning, but not vice versa: 
the higher level must be derived from properties of a lower one. 
FIGURE 107. Floating on neural activity, the symbol level of the brain mirrors the world. 
But neural activity per se, which can be simulated on a computer, does not create thought; that 
calls for higher levels of organization.

The diagram includes an indication of a computer simulation of a neural 
network. This is in principle feasible, no matter how complicated the 
network, provided that the behavior of individual neurons can be de-
scribed in terms of computations which a computer can carry out. This is a 
subtle postulate which few people even think of questioning. Nevertheless 
it is a piece of "reductionistic faith"; it could be considered a "microscopic 
version" of the Church-Turing Thesis. Below we state it explicitly: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, MICROSCOPIC VERSION: 
The behavior of the com-
ponents of a living being can be simulated on a computer. That is, the 
behavior of any component (typically assumed to be a cell) can be 
calculated by a FlooP program (i.e., general recursive function) to any 
desired degree of accuracy, given a sufficiently precise description of 
the component's internal state and local environment. 
This version of the Church-Turing Thesis says that brain processes do not 
possess any more mystique---even though they possess more levels of 
organization-than, say, stomach processes. It would be unthinkable in this 
day and age to suggest that people digest their food, not by ordinary 
chemical processes, but by a sort of mysterious and magic "assimilation". 
This version of the CT-Thesis simply extends this kind of commonsense 
reasoning to brain processes. In short, it amounts to faith that the brain 
operates in a way which is, in principle, understandable. It is a piece of 
reductionist faith. 
A corollary to the Microscopic CT -Thesis is this rather terse new 
macroscopic version: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, REDUCTIONIST'S VERSION: 
All brain processes are 
derived from a computable substrate. 
This statement is about the strongest theoretical underpinning one could 
give in support of the eventual possibility of realizing Artificial Intelligence. 
Of course, Artificial Intelligence research is not aimed at simulating 
neural networks, for it is based on another kind of faith: that probably 
there are significant features of intelligence which can be Roated on top of 
entirely different sorts of substrates than those of organic brains. Figure 
108 shows the presumed relations among Artificial Intelligence, natural 
intelligence, and the real world. 
Parallel Progress in AI and Brain Simulation? 
The idea that, if AI is to be achieved, the actual hardware of the brain 
might one day have to be simulated or duplicated, is, for the present at 
least, quite an abhorrent thought to many AI workers. Still one wonders, 
"How finely will we need to copy the brain to achieve AI?" The real answer 
is probably that it all depends on how many of the features of human 
consciousness you want to simulate.

Crucial to the endeavor of Artificial Intelligence research is the notion that 
the symbolic levels of the mind can be "skimmed off" of their neural substrate and implemented 
in other media, such as the electronic substrate of computers. To what depth the copying of 
brain must go is at present completely unclear. 
Is an ability to play checkers well a sufficient indicator of intelligence? 
If so, then AI already exists, since checker-playing programs are of world 
class. Or is intelligence an ability to integrate functions symbolically, as in a 
freshman calculus class? If so, then AI already exists, since symbolic inte-
gration routines outdo the best people in most cases. Or is intelligence the 
ability to play chess well? If so, then AI is well on its way, since chess-playing 
programs can defeat most good amateurs; and the level of artificial chess 
will probably continue to improve slowly. 
Historically, people have been naive about what qualities, if 
mechanized, would undeniably constitute intelligence. Sometimes it seems 
as though each new step towards AI, rather than producing something 
which everyone agrees is real intelligence, merely reveals what real intelli-
gence is not. If intelligence involves learning, creativity, emotional re-
sponses, a sense of beauty, a sense of self, then there is a long road ahead, 
and it may be that these will only be realized when we have totally dupli-
cated a living brain. 
Beauty, the Crab, and the Soul 
Now what, if anything, does all this have to say about the Crab's virtuoso 
performance in front of Achilles? There are two issues clouded together 
here. They are: 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
573 

(1) 
Could any brain process, under any circumstances, distin-
guish completely reliably between true and false statements 
of TNT without being in violation of the Church-Turing 
Thesis-or is such an act in principle impossible? 
(2) 
Is perception of beauty a brain process? 
First of all, in res ponse to (1), if violations of the Church-Turing Thesis are 
allowed, then there seems to be no fundamental obstacle to the strange 
events in the Dialogue. So what we are interested in is whether a believer in 
the Church-Turing Thesis would have to disbelieve in the Crab's ability. 
Well, it all depends on which version of the CT -Thesis you believe. For 
example, if you only subscribe to the Public-Processes Version, then you 
could reconcile the Crab's behavior with it very easily by positing that the 
Crab's ability is not communicable. Contrariwise, if you believe the Reduc-
tionist's Version, you will have a very hard time believing in the Crab's 
ostensible ability (because of Church's Theorem-soon to be demonstrat-
ed). Believing in intermediate versions allows you a certain amount of 
wishy-washiness on the issue. Of course, switching your stand according to 
convenience allows you to waffle even more. 
It seems appropriate to present a new version of the CT -Thesis, one 
which is tacitly held by vast numbers of people, and which has been publicly 
put forth by several authors, in various manners. Some of the more famous 
ones are: philosophers Hubert Dreyfus, S. Jaki, Mortimer Taube, and]. R. 
Lucas; the biologist and philosopher Michael Polanyi (a holist par excel-
lence); the distinguished Australian neurophysiologist John Eccles. I am 
sure there are many other authors who have expressed similar ideas, and 
countless readers who are sympathetic. I ,have attempted below to sum-
marize their joint position. I have probably not done full justice to it, but I 
have tried to convey the flavor as accurately as I can: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, SOULISTS' VERSION: 
Some kinds of things which a 
brain can do can be vaguely approximated on a computer but not 
most, and certainly not the interesting ones. But anyway, even if they 
all could, that would still leave the soul to explain, and there is no way 
that computers have any bearing on that. 
This 'version relates to the tale of the Magnijicrab in two ways. In the first 
place, its adherents would probably consider the tale to be silly and im-
plausible, but-not forbidden in principle. In the second place, they would 
probably claim that appreciation of qualities such as beauty is one of those 
properties associated with the elusive soul, and is therefore inherently 
possible only for humans, not for mere machines. 
We will come back to this second point in a moment; but first, while we 
are on the subject of "soulists", we ought to exhibit this latest version in an 
even more extreme form, since that is the form to which large numbers of 
well-educated people subscribe these days: 
CHURCH-TURING THESIS, THEODORE ROSZAK VERSION: 
ridiculous. So is science in general. 
Computers are 
574 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

This view is prevalent among certain people who see in anything smacking 
of numbers or exactitude a threat to human values. It is too bad that they 
do not appreciate the depth and complexity and beauty involved in explor-
ing abstract structures such as the human mind, where, indeed, one comes 
in intimate contact with the ultimate questions of what to be human is. 
Getting back to beauty, we were about to consider whether the ap-
preciation of beauty is a brain process, and if so, whether it is imitable by a 
computer. Those who believe that it is not accounted for by the brain are 
very unlikely to believe that a computer could possess it. Those who believe 
it is a brain process again divide up according to which version of the 
CT -Thesis they believe. A total red uctionist would believe that any brain 
process can in principle be transformed into a computer program; others, 
however, might feel that beauty is too ill-defined a notion for a computer 
program ever to assimilate. Perhaps they feel that the appreciation of 
beauty requires an element of irrationality, and therefore is incompatible 
with the very fiber of computers. 
Irrational and Rational Can Coexist on Different Levels 
However, this notion that "irrationality is incompatible with computers" 
rests on a severe confusion of levels. The mistaken notion stems from the 
idea that since computers are faultlessly functioning machines, they are 
therefore bound to be "logical" on all levels. Yet it is perfectly obvious that a 
computer can be instructed to print out a sequence of illogical 
statements---Oi, for variety's sake, a batch of statements having random 
truth values. Yet in following such instructions, a computer would not be 
making any mistakes! On the contrary, it would only be a mistake if the 
computer printed out something other than the statements it had been 
instructed to print. This illustrates how faultless functioning on one level 
may underlie symbol manipulation on a higher level-and the goals of the 
higher level may be completely unrelated to the propagation of Truth. 
Another way to gain perspective on this is to remember that a brain, 
too, is a collection of faultlessly functioning elements-neurons. Whenever 
a neuron's threshold is surpassed by the sum of the incoming signals, 
BANG!-it fires. It never happens that a neuron forgets its arithmetical 
knowledge-carelessly adding its inputs and getting a wrong answer. Even 
when a neuron dies, it continues to function correctly, in the sense that its 
components continue to obey the laws of mathematics and physics. Yet as 
we all know, neurons are perfectly capable of supporting high-level be-
havior that is wrong, on its own level, in the most amazing ways. Figure 109 
is meant to illustrate such a clash of levels: an incorrect belief held in the 
software of a mind, supported by the hardware of a faultlessly functioning 
brain. 
The point-a point which has been made several times earlier in 
various contexts-is simply that meaning can exist on two or more different 
levels of a symbol-handling system, and along with meaning, rightness and 
wrongness can exist on all those levels. The presence of meaning on a given 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
575 

FIGURE 109. 
The &rain is rational; the mind may not be. [Drawing by the author.] 

level is determined by whether or not reality is mirrored in an isomorphic 
(or looser) fashion on that level. So the fact that neurons always perform 
correct additions (in fact, much more complex calculations) has no bearing 
whatsoever on the correctness of the top-level conclusions supported by 
their machinery. Whether one's top level is engaged in proving koans of 
Boolean Buddhism or in meditating on theorems of Zen Algebra, one's 
neurons are functioning rationally. By the same token, the high-level 
symbolic processes which in a brain create the experience of appreciating 
beauty are perfectly rational on the bottom level, where the faultless func-
tioning is taking place; any irrationality, if there is such, is on the higher 
level, and is an epiphenomenon-a consequence-of the events on the 
lower level. 
To make the same point in a different way, let us say you are having a 
hard time making up your mind whether to order a cheeseburger or a 
pineappleburger. Does this imply that your neurons are also balking, 
having difficulty deciding whether or not to fire? Of course not. Your 
hamburger-confusion is a high-level state which fully depends on the 
efficient firing of thousands of neurons in very organized ways. This is a 
little ironic, yet it is perfectly obvious when you think about it. Nevertheless, 
it is probably fair to say that nearly all confusions about minds and comput-
ers have their origin in just such elementary level-confusions. 
There is no reason to believe that a. computer's faultlessly functioning 
hardware could not support high-level symbolic behavior which would 
represent such complex states as confusion, forgetting, or appreciation of 
beauty. It would require that there exist massive subsystems interacting 
with each other according to a complex "logic". The overt behavior could 
appear either rational or irrational; but underneath it would be the per-
formance of reliable, logical hardware. 
More Against lucas 
Incidentally, this kind oflevel distinction provides us with some new fuel in 
arguing against Lucas. The Lucas argument is based on the idea that 
Codel's Theorem is applicable, by definition, to machines. In fact, Lucas 
makes a most emphatic pronunciation: 
Codel's theorem must apply to cybernetical machines, because it is of the 
essence of being a machine, that it should be a concrete instantiation of a 
formal system.9 
This is, as we have seen, true on the hardware level-but since there may be 
higher levels, it is not the last word on the subject. Now Lucas gives the 
impression that in the mind-imitating machines he discusses, there is only 
one level on which manipulation of symbols takes place. For instance, the 
Rule of Detachment (called "Modus Ponens" in his article) would b~ wired 
into the hardware and would be an unchangeable feature of such a 
machine. He goes further and intimates that if Modus Ponens were not an 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
577 

immutable pillar of the machine's system, but could be overridden on 
occasion, then: 
The system will have ceased to be a formal logical system, and the machine 
will barely qualify for the title of a model for the mind. lo 
Now many programs which are being developed in AI research have very 
little in common with programs for generating truths of number theory-
programs with inflexible rules of inference and fixed sets of axioms. Yet 
they are certainly intended as "models for the mind". On their top level-
the "informal" level-there may be manipulation of images, formulation of 
analogies, forgetting of ideas, confusing of concepts, blurring of distinc-
tions, and so forth. But this does not contradict the fact that they rely on the 
correct functioning of their underlying hardware as much as brains rely on 
the correct functioning of their neurons. So AI programs are still "concrete 
instantiations of formal systems"-but they are not machines to which 
Lucas' transmogrification of Codel's proof can be applied. Lucas' argument 
applies merely to their bottom level, on which their intelligence-however 
great or small it may be-does not lie. 
There is one other way in which Lucas betrays his oversimplified vision 
of how mental processes would have to be represented inside computer 
programs. In discussing the matter of consistency, he writes 
If we really were inconsistent machines, we should remain content with our 
inconsistencies, and would happily affirm both halves of a contradiction. 
Moreover, we would be prepared to say absolutely anything-which we are 
not. It is easily shown that in an inconsistent formal system everything is 
provable. II 
This last sentence shows that Lucas assumes that the Propositional Calculus 
must of necessity be built into any formal system which carries out reason-
ing'. In particular, he is thinking of the theorem «Pi\-P>:JQ> of the 
Propositional Calculus; evidently he has the erroneous belief that it is an 
inevitable feature of mechanized reasoning. However, it is perfectly plausi-
ble that logical thought processes, such as propositional reasoning, will 
emerge as consequences of the general intelligence of an AI program, rather 
than being preprogrammed. This is wl:J.at happens in humans! And there is no 
particular reason to assume that the strict Propositional Calculus, with its 
rigid rules and the rather silly definition of consistency that they entail, 
would emerge from such a program. 
An Underpinning of AI 
We can summarize this excursion into level distinctions and come away 
with one final, strongest version of the Church-Turing Thesis: 
CHURCH-TuRING THESIS; AI VERSION: 
Mental processes of any sort can be 
simulated by a computer program whose underlying language is of 
578 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

power equal to that of FlooP-that is, in which all partial recursive 
functions can be programmed. 
It should also be pointed out that in practice, many AI researchers rely 
on another article of faith which is closely related to the CT-Thesis, and 
which I call the AI Thesis. It runs something like this: 
AI THESIS: 
As the intelligence of machines evolves, its underlying 
mechanisms will gradually converge to the mechanisms underlying 
human intelligence. 
In other words, all intelligences are just variations on a single theme; to 
create true intelligence, AI workers will just have to keep pushing to ever 
lower levels, closer and closer to brain mechanisms, if they wish their 
machines to attain the capabilities which we have. 
Church's Theorem 
Now let us come back to the Crab and to the question of whether his 
decision procedure for theoremhood (which is presented in the guise of a 
filter for musical beauty) is compatible with reality. Actually, from the 
events which occur in the Dialogue, we have no way of deducing whether 
the Crab's gift is an ability to tell theorems from non theorems, or alternatively, 
an ability to tell true statements from false ones. Of course in many cases this 
amounts to the same thing but Codel's Theorem shows that it doesn't 
always. But no matter: both of these alternatives are impossible, if you 
believe the AI Version of the Church-Turing Thesis. The proposition that 
it is impossible to have a decision procedure for theoremhood in any formal 
system with the power of TNT is known as Church's Theorem. The proposi-
tion that it is impossible to have a decision procedure for number-
theoretical truth-if such truth exists, which one can well doubt after meet-
ing up with all the bifurcations of TNT-follows quickly from Tarski's 
Theorem (published in 1933, although the ideas were known to Tarski 
considerably earlier). 
The proofs of these two highly important results of metamathematics 
are very similar. Both of them follow quite quickly from self-referential 
constructions. Let us first consider the question of a decision procedure for 
TNT-theoremhood. If there were a uniform way by which people could 
decide which of the classes "theorem" and "non theorem" any given for-
mula X fell into, then, by the CT-Thesis (Standard Version), there would 
exist a terminating FlooP program (a general recursive function) which 
could make the same decision, when given as input the Codel number of 
formula X. The crucial step is to recall that any property that can be tested 
for by a terminating FlooP program is represented in TNT. This means that 
the property ofTNT-theoremhood would be represented (as distinguished 
from merely expressed) inside TNT. But as we shall see in a moment, this 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
579 

would put us in hot water, for if theoremhood is a representable attribute, 
then Godel's formula G becomes as vicious as the Epimenides paradox. 
It all hinges on what G says: "G is not a theorem of TNT". Assume that 
G were a theorem. Then, since theoremhood is supposedly represented, 
the TNT-formula which asserts "G is a theorem" would be a theorem of 
TNT. But this formula is -G, the negation of G, so that TNT is inconsis-
tent. On the other hand, assume G were not a theorem. Then once again by 
the supposed representability of theoremhood, the formula which asserts 
HG is not a theorem" would be a theorem of TNT. But this formula is G, 
and once again we get into paradox. L'nlike the situation before, there is no 
resolution of the paradox. The problem is created by the assumption that 
theoremhood is represented by some formula of TNT, and therefore we 
must backtrack and erase that assumption. This forces us also to conclude 
that no FlooP program can tell the Godel numbers of theorems from those 
of nontheorems. Finally, if we accept the AI Version of the CT-Thesis, 
then we must backtrack further, and conclude that no method whatsoever 
could exist by which humans could reliably tell theorems from nontheo-
rems-and this includes determinations based on beauty. Those who sub-
scribe only to the Public-Processes Version might still think the Crab's 
performance is possible; but of all the versions, that one is perhaps the 
hardest one to find any justification for. 
Tarski's Theorem 
Now let us proceed to Tarski's result. Tarski asked whether there could be 
a way of expressing in TNT the concept of number-theoretical truth. That 
theoremhood is expressible (though not representable) we have seen; 
Tarski was interested in the analogous question regarding the notion of 
truth. More specifically, he wished to determine whether there is any 
TNT-formula with a single free variable a which can be translated thus: 
"The formula whose Godel number is a expresses a truth." 
Let us suppose, with Tarski, that there is one-which we'll abbreviate as 
TRUE{a}. Now what we'll do is use the diagonalization method to produce a 
sentence which asserts about itself that it is untrue. We copy the Godel 
method exactly, beginning with an "uncle": 
3a:<-TRUE{a}AARITHMOQUINE{a",a}> 
Let us say the Godel number of the uncle is t. We arithmoquine this very 
uncle, and produce the Tarski formula T: 
580 
3a:<-TRUE{a}AARITHMOQUINE{SSS ... SSSO/a",a}> 
~ 
t S's 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

When interpreted, it says: 
"The arithmoquinification of t is the 
Godel number of a false statement." 
But since the arithmoquinification of t is T's own Godel number, Tarski's 
formula T reproduces the Epimenides paradox to a tee inside TNT, saying 
of itself, "I am a falsity". Of course, this leads to the conclusion that it must 
be simultaneously true and false (or simultaneously neither). There arises 
now an interesting matter: What is so bad about reproducing the 
Epimenides paradox? Is it of any consequence? After all, we already have it 
in English, and the English language has not gone up in smoke. 
The Impossibility of the Magnificrab 
The answer lies in remembering that there are two levels of meaning 
involved here. One level is the level we have just been using; the other is as 
a statement of number theory. If the Tarski formula T actually existed, 
then it would be a statement about natural numbers that is both true and false 
at once! There is the rub. While we can always just sweep the 
English-language Epimenides paradox under the rug, saying that its sub-
ject matter (its own truth) is abstract, this is· not so when it becomes a 
concrete statement about numbers! If we believe this is a ridiculous state of 
affairs, then we have to undo our assumption that the formula TRUE{a} 
exists. Thus, there is no way of expressing the notion of truth inside TNT. 
Notice that this makes truth a far more elusive property than theorem-
hood, for the latter is expressible. The same backtracking reasons as before 
(involving the Church-Turing Thesis, AI Version) lead us to the conclusion 
that 
The Crab's mind cannot be a truth-recognizer any more than it is 
a TNT-theorem-recognizer. 
The former would violate the Tarski-Church-Turing Theorem ("There is 
no decision procedure for arithmetical truth"), while the latter would 
violate Church's Theorem. 
Two Types of Form 
It is extremely interesting, then, to think about the meaning of the word 
"form" as it applies to constructions of arbitrarily complex shapes. For 
instance, what is it that we respond to when we look at a painting and feel 
its beauty? Is it the "form" of the lines and dots on our retina? Evidently it 
must be, for that is how it gets passed along to the analyzing mechanisms in 
our heads-but the complexity of the processing makes us feel that we are 
not merely looking at a two-dimensional surface; we are responding to 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
581 

some sort of inner meaning inside the picture, a multidimensional aspect 
trapped somehow inside those two dimensions. It is the word "meaning" 
which is important here. Our minds contain interpreters which accept 
two-dimensional patterns and then "pull" from them high-dimensional 
notions which are so complex that we cannot consciously describe them. 
The same can be said about how we respond to music, incidentally. 
It feels subjectively that the pulling-out mechanism of inner meaning is 
not at all akin to a decision procedure which checks for the presence or 
absence of some particular quality such as well-formedness in a string. 
Probably this is because inner meaning is something which reveals more of 
itself over a period of time. One can never be sure, as one can about 
well-formedness, that one has finished with the issue. 
This suggests a distinction that could be drawn between two senses of 
"form" in patterns which we analyze. First, there are qualities such as 
well-formedness, which can be detected by predictably terminating tests, as in 
BlooP programs. These I propose to call syntactic qualities of form. One 
intuitively feels about the syntactic aspects of form that they lie close to the 
surface, and therefore they do not provoke the creation of multidimen-
sional cognitive structures. 
By contrast, the semantic aspects of form are those which cannot be 
tested for in predictable lengths of time: they require open-ended tests. Such 
an aspect is theoremhood of TNT-strings, as we have seen. You cannot just 
apply some standard test to a string and find out if it is a theorem. 
Somehow, the fact that its meaning is involved is crucially related to the 
difficulty of telling whether or not a string is a TNT-theorem. The act of 
pulling out a string's meaning involves, in essence, establishing all the 
implications of its connections to all other strings, and this leads, to be sure, 
down an open-ended trail. So "semantic" properties are connected to 
open-ended searches because, in an important sense, an object's meaning is 
not localiz.ed within the object itself. This is not to say that no understanding 
of any object's meaning is possible until the end of time, for as time passes, 
more and more of the meaning unfolds. However, there are always aspects 
of its meaning which will remain hidden arbitrarily long. 
Meaning Derives from Connections to Cognitive Structures 
Let us switch from strings to pieces of music, just for variety . You may still 
substitute the term "string" for every reference to a piece of music, if you 
prefer. The discussion is meant to be general, but its flavor is better gotten 
across, I feel, by referring to music. There is a strange duality about the 
meaning of a piece of music: on the one hand, it seems to be spread 
around, by virtue of its relation to many other things in the world-and yet, 
on the other hand, the meaning of a piece of music is obviously derived 
from the music itself, so it must be localized somewhere inside the music. 
The resolution of this dilemma comes from thinking about the inter-
preter-the mechanism which does the pulling-out of meaning. (By "inter-
582 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

preter" in this context, I mean not the performer of the piece, but the 
mental mechanism in the listener which derives meaning when the piece is 
played.) The interpreter may discover many important aspects of a piece's 
meaning while hearing it for the first time; this seems to confirm the notion 
that the meaning is housed in the piece itself, and is simply being read off. 
But that is only part of the story. The music interpreter works by setting up 
a multidimensional cognitive structure-a mental representation of the 
piece-which it tries to integrate with pre-existent information by finding 
links to other multidimensional mental structures which encode previous 
experiences. As this process takes place, the full meaning gradually un-
folds. In fact, years may pass before someone comes to feel that he has 
penetrated to the core meaning of a piece. This seems to support the 
opposite view: that musical meaning is spread around, the interpreter's 
role being to assemble it gradually. 
The truth undoubtedly lies somewhere in between: meanings-both 
musical and linguistic-are to some extent localizable, to some extent 
spread around. In the terminology of Chapter VI, we can say that musical 
pieces and pieces of text are partly triggers, and partly carriers of explicit 
meaning. A vivid illustration of this dualism of meaning is provided by the 
example of a tablet with an ancient inscription: the meaning is partially 
stored in the libraries and the brains of scholars around the world, and yet 
it is also obviously implicit in the tablet itself. 
Thus, another way of characterizing the difference between "syntactic" 
and "semantic" properties (in the just-proposed sense) is that the syntactic 
ones reside unambiguously inside the object under consideration, whereas 
semantic properties depend on its relations with a potentially infinite class 
of other objects, and therefore are not completely localizable. There is 
nothing cryptic or hidden, in principle, in syntactic properties, whereas 
hiddenness is of the essence in semantic properties. That is the reason for 
my suggested distinction between "syntactic" and "semantic" aspects of 
visual form. 
Beauty, Truth, and Form 
What about beauty? It is certainly not a syntactic property, according to the 
ideas above. Is it even a semantic property? Is beauty a property which, for 
instance, a particular painting has? Let us immediately restrict our consid-
eration to a single viewer. Everyone has had the experience of finding 
something beautiful at one time, dull another time-and probably inter-
mediate at other times. So is beauty an attribute which varies in time? One 
could turn things around and say that it is the beholder who has varied in 
time. Given a particular beholder of a particular painting at a particular 
time, is it reasonable to assert that beauty is a quality that is definitely 
present or absent? Or is there still something ill-defined and intangible 
about it? 
Different levels of interpreter probably could be invoked in every 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 
583 

person, depending on the circumstances. These various interpreters pull 
out different meanings, establish different connections, and generally 
evaluate all deep aspects differently. So it seems that this notion of beauty is 
extremely hard to pin down. It is for this reason that I chose to link beauty, 
in the Magnificrab, with truth, which we have seen is also one of the most 
intangible notions in all of metamathematics. 
The Neural Substrate of the Epimenides Paradox 
I would like to conclude this Chapter with some ideas about that central 
problem of truth, the Epimenides paradox. I think the Tarski reproduc-
tion of the Epimenides paradox inside TNT points the way to a deeper 
understanding of the nature of the Epimenides paradox in English. What 
Tarski found was that his version of the paradox has two distinct levels to it. 
On one level, it is a sentence about itself which would be true if it were false, 
and false if it were true. On the other level-which I like to call the 
arithmetical substrate-it is a sentence about integers which is true if and only if 
false. 
Now for some reason this latter bothers people a lot more than the 
former. Some people simply shrug off the former as "meaningless", be-
cause of its self-referentiality. But you can't shrug off paradoxical state-
ments about integers. Statements about integers simply cannot be both true 
and false. 
Now my feeling is that the Tarski transformation of the Epimenides 
paradox teaches us to look for a substrate in the English-language version. In 
the arithmetical version, the upper level of meaning is supported by the 
lower arithmetical level. Perhaps analogously, the self-referential sentence 
which we perceive ("This sentence is false") is only the top level of a 
dual-level entity. What would be the lower level, then? Well, what is the 
mechanism that language rides on? The brain. Therefore one ought to 
look for a neural substrate to the Epimenides paradox-a lower level of 
physical events which clash with each other. That is, two ~vents which by 
their nature cannot occur simultaneously. If this physical substrate exists, 
then the reason we cannot make heads or tails of the Epimenides sentence 
is that our brains are trying to do an impossible task. 
Now what would be the nature of the conflicting physical events? 
Presumably when you hear the Epimenides sentence, your brain sets up 
some "coding" of the sentence-an internal configuration of interacting 
symbols. Then it tries to classify the sentence as "true" or "false". This 
classifying act must involve an attempt to force several symbols to interact 
in a particular way. (Presumably this happens when any sentence is proces-
sed.) Now if it happens that the act of classification would physically disrupt 
the coding of the sentence-something which would ordinarily never 
happen-then one is in trouble, for it is tantamount to trying to force a 
record player to play its self-breaking record. We have described the 
conflict in physical terms, but not in neural terms. If this analysis is right so 
584 
Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others 

far, then presumably the rest of the discussion could be carried on when we 
know something about the constitution of the "symbols" in the brain out of 
neurons and their firings, as well as about the way that sentences become 
converted into "codings". 
This sketch of the neural substrate of the Epimenides paradox 
suggests (to me, at least) that the resolution of the English version of the 
Epimenides paradox might be similar to that for the Tarski version. The 
resolution involves abandoning the notion that a brain could ever provide a 
fully accurate representation for the notion of truth. The novelty of this 
resolution lies in its suggestion that a total modeling of truth is impossible 
for quite physical reasons: namely, such a modeling would require physi-
cally incompatible events to occur in a brain.

SHRDLU, 
Toy of Man's Designing
l 
One day, Eta Oin wanders into the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 
where she runs into the brilliant young computer program, SHRDLU. It 
happens that SHRDLU is just dying for someone to try out the newly 
developed human being "Dr. Tony Earrwig". SHRDLU explains that this 
Earrwig is fairly intelligent in the limited domain of analyzing a conversa-
tion about a "toy world" containing blocks if various shapes, sizes, and 
colors~locks which sit on a table, and which can be picked up and moved 
around. Eta Oin,Jascinated, begins enthusiastically typing to SHRDLU. 
Earrwig dangles over her shoulder and provides a sort of running 
commentary, as promised.

In order to pick up the red block, it had to clear it off by finding a space for 
the green one and moving the green one away. 
2. Eta Oin: 
grasp the pyramid. 
SHRDLU: 
I DON'T UNDERSTAf'D WHICH PYRAMID YOU MEAN. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
There are thr'ee pyramids in the scene, and SHRDLU 
knows that phrases beginning with "the" are intended to refer to a specific 
object the speaker has in mind.

3. Eta Din: 
find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and 
put it into the box. 
[Refer to Fig. 111.] 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU has to figure out what is meant by "one" and 
"it", as well as using deduction to decide which block it is holding. 
SHRDLU: 
BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER 
THAN THE ONE I AM HOLDING. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
There were two possible referents for "it": the one selected, 
and "the one you are holding". SHRDLU has heuristics for choosing 
between them. 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU's hand has to set down the red block to 
pick up the taller blue one. 
4. Eta Din: 
what does the box contain? 
SHRDLU: 
THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK. 
5. 
Eta Din: 
what is the pyramid supported by? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Earlier SHRDLU responded to "the pyramid" by saying "I 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH PYRAMID YOU MEAN." Now, it assumes that 
you mean the one just mentioned. 
SHRDLU: 
THE BOX. 
6. Eta Din: 
how many blocks are not in the box? 
SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing 
587 

Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Negatives such as "not" and "no" are handled whether 
they appear in clauses or noun groups (such as "no boxes"). 
SHRDLU: 
FOUR OF THEM. 
7. Eta Din: 
is at least one of them narrower than the one which i told you 
to pick up? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The phrase "at least one of them" must be analyzed to refer 
back to the previous question, and "the one which ... " must also refer to 
blocks. Noun groups can have complicated numbers such as "at least one", 
"more than three", "exactly seven", etc .. The memory of past events is used 
to deduce which block is "the one which I told you to pick up". Notice the 
complicated syntactic structure in which "the one" is actually the object of a 
clause embedded two levels deeper. SHRDLU's parser incorporates a 
grammar that handles this kind of complexity in a general way. 
SHRDLU: 
YES, THE RED CUBE. 
8. Eta Din: 
is it supported? 
SHRDLU: 
YES, BY THE TABLE. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU has heuristics about what information is rele-
vant to a person who asks a question, even if the person does not request that 
information specifically. 
9. Eta Din: 
can the table pick up blocks? 
SHRDLU: 
NO. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU's semantic rules include the knowledge that 
"picking up" must be done by an animate object, and that the table is not 
animate. 
10. Eta Din: 
can a pyramid be supported by a block? 
SHRDLU: 
YES. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU's deductive system finds an actual example, so it 
knows this is possible. 
11. Eta Din: 
can a pyramid support a pyramid? 
SHRDLU: 
I DON'T KNOW. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The question makes sense, but there is no example in the 
scene. SHRDLU has no way of looking into the details of its programs, 
even though these ultimately define its capabilities. 
12. Eta Din: 
stack up two pyramids. 
SHRDLU: 
I CAN'T. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU tries and fails. 
13. Eta Din: 
the blue pyramid is mine. 
SHRDLU: 
I UNDERSTAND. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
All of the information about colors, shapes, sizes and 
locations of the objects is known to SHRDLU initially. Possession is left as 
an unknown property of objects about which it can be told. It stores this 
information in its data base. 
14. Eta Din: 
i own all blocks which are not red, but i don't own anything 
which supports a pyramid. 
SHRDLU: 
I UNDERSTAND.

FIGURE 112. "Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a 
pyramid?" [Adapted from Terry Winograd, Understanding Natural Language, p. 12.] 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The result of understanding these sentences is the creation 
of new procedures within SHRDLU for deducing whether you own some-
thing. 
15. Eta Din: 
do i own the box? 
SHRDLU: 
NO. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The box supports whatever it contains, including a 
pyramid. 
16. Eta Din: 
do i own anything in the box? 
SHRDLU: 
YES, TWO THINGS: THE BLUE BLOCK AND THE BLUE 
PYRAMID. 
17. Eta Din: 
will you please stack uJ> both of the red blocks aDd either a 
green cube or a pyramid? 
[Refer to Fig. 112.] 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Logical connectives, such as "and", "or", "either", etc. are 
handled in both the grammar and semantics. A command is executed even if 
it looks like a question. The.command is carried out by the following series of 
steps: SHRDLU puts a green cube on the large red block (it chooses the 
green cube with nothing on it), then removes the small pyramid from the 
little red cube, so that it can use that cube to complete the stack as specified. 
SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing 
589 

18. Eta Oin: 
which cube is sitting on the table? 
SHRDLU: 
THE LARGE GREE;-.J ONE WHICH SUPPORTS THE RED 
PYRAMID. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Ordinarily SHRDLU would be satisfied with calling this 
"A BIG GREEN CUBE", but sinCl' ."You asked "which cube" it has to be more 
specific in naming it. It has procedures for using substitute nouns (such as 
"one") and pronouns in answers to make the discourse more natural. 
19. Eta Oin: 
is there a large block behind a pyramid? 
SHRDLU: 
YES, THREE OF THEM: A LARGE RED ONE, A LARGE GREEN 
CUBE AND THE BLUE ONE. 
20. Eta Oin: 
put a small one onto the green cube which supports a 
pyramid. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
"A small one" must contrast with your earlier phrase "a 
large block", so this means "a small block". 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
21. Eta Oin: 
put the littlest pyramid on top of it. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Words like "littlest" are not in SHRDLU's dictionary but 
are interpreted from the root forms like "little". SHRDLU compares the 
sizes of all the pyramids to carry out the action. 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
22. Eta Oin: 
how many things are on top of green cubes? 
SHRDLU: 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY "ON TOP OF" IN THE 
PHRASE "ON TOP OF GREEN CUBES" 
DO YOU MEAN 
I-DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE 
2-ANYWHERE ON TOP OF IT? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: In the previous sentence, the phrase "on top of" was 
interpreted without trouble because the context made it clear what was 
meant. In this one, the heuristicsfor disambiguation do not come up with a 
clearcut definition, so SHRDLU had to ask youfor more information. The 
paraphrases were included with the dictionary definitions of "on". A request 
like this can also occur when the meaning of a pronoun such as "it" or 
"they" is unclear. 
23. Eta Oin: 
had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one 
on the little cube? 
SHRDLU: 
YES, THE GREEN ONE 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU deduces from its memory what event is being 
referred to, and can relate other events to it in time. The analysis includes 
complex tenses of verb groups, and there are special facilities for keeping 
track of the various forms of irregular verbs like "have". 
24. Eta Oin: 
when did you pick it up? 
SHRDLU: 
WHILE I WAS STACKING UP THE RED CUBE, A LARGE RED 
BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN ONE. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: A time is described by naming the main goal which was 
being worked on. 
25. Eta Oin: 
why? 
590 
SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing 

Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU remembers immediately previous sentences to 
understand questions like this and the following ones. 
SHRDLU: 
TO GET RID OF IT. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
By keeping track of selected parts of the original subgoal 
tree, SHRDLU has some understanding of its own motives. 
26. Eta Din: 
why did you do that? 
SHRDLU: 
TO CLEAN OFF THE RED CUBE. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
"That" refers to the action mentioned in SHRDLU's last 
answer. 
27. Eta Din: 
why did you clear off that cube? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Here, "that" means the one just referred to. 
SHRDLU: 
TO PUT IT ON A LARGE GREEN CUBE. 
28. Eta Din: 
why did you do that? 
SHRDLU: 
TO STACK UP THE RED CUBE, A LARGE RED BLOCK, AND A 
LARGE GREEN CUBE. 
29. Eta Din: 
why did you do that? 
SHRDLU: 
BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU remembers what it did, not how the request was 
worded. 
30. Eta Din: 
how did you do it? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
"It" refers to the action mentioned in the last question, 
rather than the answer. 
SHRDLU: 
BY PUTTING A LARGE RED BLOCK ON THE TABLE; THEN 
LETTING GO OF IT; THEN PUTTING A LARGE GREEN CUBE ON IT; 
THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE; THEN PUTTING THE RED CUBE 
ON THAT CUBE; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
This is a description if the top-level subgoals used to 
achieve the goal. 
31. Eta Din: 
how many objects did you touch while you were doing it? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Time references can refer to a time span, using words like 
"while". 
SHRDLU: 
FOUR OF THEM. 
32. Eta Din: 
what did the red cube support before you started to clean it 
off? 
SHRDLU: 
THE GREEN PYRAMID. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
By remembering what has been moved, it is possible to 
deduce things about earlier states of the scene. You can use complex nestings 
of clauses like "before you started to clean it off". 
33. Eta Din: 
there were five blocks to the left of the box then. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
"Then" must refer to the time mentioned in the last 
sentence. 
SHRDLU: 
NO, ONLY FOUR OF THEM: THE RED CUBE, TWO LARGE 
GREEN CUBES, AND A LARGE RED BLOCK. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Earlier in the dialogue, information about "owning" was 
accepted at face value. But SHRDLU knows that it has complete informa-
SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing 
591 

tion about the basic properties of objects, including location. It checks any 
statements about these to see whether it agrees or disagrees. 
34. Eta Din: 
put the blue pyramid on the block in the box. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
This is syntactically ambiguous, but is understood without 
ambiguity since the parsing corresponding to ''Put the blue pyramid which is 
on the block into the box" does not make sense in the current scene, whereas 
''Put the blue pyramid onto the block which is in the box" does. 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
35. Eta Din: 
is there anything which is bigger than every pyramid but is 
not as wide as the thing that supports it? 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU understands quantifiers such as "every", 
"any", "some", etc., and structures such as "bigger than", "as wide as", etc .. 
Here "it" refers to a noun group within the same sentence but two levels up 
in the parsing tree. 
SHRDLU: 
YES, THE BLUE BLOCK. 
36. Eta Din: 
does a steeple 
SHRDLU: 
SORRY, I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STEEPLE". 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU interrupts immediately when it sees a word it 
doesn't know. 
37. Eta Din: 
a "steeple" is a stack which contains two green cubes and a 
pyramid. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The quote marks indicate that you are defining a new 
word. The definition is added to SHRDLU's dictionary in aform compati-
ble with all the words it already knows. 
SHRDLU: 
I UNDERSTAND. 
38. Eta Din: 
are there any steeples now? 
SHRDLU: 
NO. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The new definition is used as a description to recognize 
steeples. 
39. Eta Din: 
build one. 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
The description given in the definition is enough to deduce 
a plan for building new objects as well as recognizing them. The word 
"one" means "a steeple", and the plan is carried out. First, one of the large 
green cubes is cleared off by removing the red cube and two pyramids. Then 
the two green cubes and the tall red pyramid are stacked up to fit the 
description. 
40. Eta Din: 
call the biggest block "superblock". 
SHRDLU: 
OK. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
You can also give objects names. 
41. Eta Din: 
have you picked up superblock since we began? 
SHRDLU: 
YES. 
42. Eta Din: 
why did you drop it? 
592 
SHRDLU: 
BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SUPERBLOCK. I CAN'T EX-
PLAIN A NON-EXISTENT EVENT. 
SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing 

Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
There is no record in SHRDLU's memory of any block 
being dropped. The answer routines have special checks for this type of 
"loaded question" which presupposes things which aren't true. 
43. Eta Din: 
is there anything to the right of the red pyramid? 
SHRDLU: 
YES, FOUR THINGS: THE BOX, THE RED CUBE, THE BLUE 
PYRAMID AND THE BLOCK NAMED SUPERBLOCK. 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
Once an object has a name, the name is used to help 
identify it in responses. 
44. Eta Din: 
thank yOll. 
SHRDLU: 
YOU'RE WELCOME! 
Dr. Tony Earrwig: 
SHRDLU's grammar is written as a procedure, which 
gives SHRDLU the capability to carry out special sorts of parsing for 
idioms.

CHAPTER XVIII 
Artificial Intelligence: 
Retrospects 
Turing 
IN 1950, ALAN TURING wrote a 
most prophetic and provocative 
article on Artificial Intelligence. It 
was entitled "Computing Machin-
ery and Intelligence" and ap-
peared in the journal Mind. 1 I will 
say some things about that article, 
but I would like to precede them 
with some remarks about Turing 
the man. 
Alan Mathison Turing was 
born in London in 1912. He was a 
chilq full of curiosity and humor. 
Gifted in mathematics, he went to 
Cambridge where his interests in 
machinery and mathematical 
logic cross-fertilized and resulted 
in his famous paper on "comput-
able numbers", in which he in-
vented the theory of Turing 
machines and demonstrated the 
unsolvability of the halting prob-
lem; it was published in 1937. In 
the 1940's, his interests turned 
from the theory of computing 
machines to the actual building of 
real computers. He was a major 
figure in the development of 
computers in Britain, and a 
staunch defender of Artificial In-
FIGURE 113. Alan Turing, after a suc-
cessful race (May. 1950). [From Sara Tur-
ing. Alan M. Turing (Cambridge. U. K.: 
W. Heffer & Sons. 1959).] 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

telligence when it first came under attack. One of his best friends was David 
Champernowne (who later worked on computer composition of music). 
Champernowne and Turing were both avid chess players and invented 
"round-the-house" chess: after your move, run around the house-if you 
get back before your opponent has moved, you're entitled to another move. 
More seriously, Turing and Champernowne invented the first chess-
playing program, called "Turochamp". Turing died young, at 41-appar-
ently of an accident with chemicals. Or some say suicide. His mother, Sara 
Turing, wrote his biography. From the people she quotes, one gets the 
sense that Turing was highly unconventional, even gauche in some ways, 
but so honest and decent that he was vulnerable to the world. He loved 
games, chess, children, and bike riding; he was a strong long-distance 
runner. As a student at Cambridge, he bought himself a second-hand violin 
and taught himself to play. Though not very musical, he derived a great 
deal of enjoyment from it. He was somewhat eccentric, given to great bursts 
of energy in the oddest directions. One area he explored was the problem 
of morphogenesis in biology. According to his mother, Turing "had a 
particular fondness for the Pickwick Papers", but "poetry, with the exception 
of Shakespeare's, meant nothing to him." Alan Turing was one of the true 
pioneers in the field of computer science. 
The Turing Test 
Turing's article begins with the sentence: "I propose to consider the ques-
tion 'Can machines think?'" Since, as he points out, these are loaded terms, 
it is obvious that we should search for an operational way to approach the 
question. This, he suggests, is contained in what he calls the "imitation 
game"; it is nowadays known as the Turing test. Turing introduces it as 
follows: 
It is played with three people: a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator 
(C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the 
other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which 
of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels 
X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is 
Band Y is A". The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: 
C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? 
Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game 
to try to cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore 
be 
"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long." 
In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should 
be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a 
teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the ques-
tions and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game 
for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is 
probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as "I am the 
woman, don't listen to him!" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the 
man can make similar remarks. 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
595 

We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of 
A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game 
is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a 
woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"2 
After having spelled out the nature of his test, Turing goes on to make 
some commentaries on it, which, given the year he was writing in, are quite 
sophisticated. To begin with, he gives a short hypothetical dialogue be-
tween interrogator and interrogatee: 3 
Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge [a bridge 
over the Firth of Forth, in Scotland]. 
A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. 
Q: Add 34957 to 70764. 
A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621. 
Q: Do you play chess? 
A: Yes. 
Q: I have K at my K I, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and Rat 
Rl. It is your move. What do you play? 
A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. 
Few readers notice that in the arithmetic problem, not only is there an 
inordinately long delay, but moreover, the answer given is wrong! This 
would be easy to account for if the respondent were a human: a mere 
calculational error. But if the respondent were a machine, a variety of 
explanations are possible. Here are some: 
(1) 
a run-time error on the hardware level (i.e., an irreproduci-
ble fluke); 
(2) 
an unintentional hardware (or programming) error which 
(reproducibly) causes arithmetical mistakes; 
(3) 
a ploy deliberately inserted by the machine's programmer (or 
builder) to introduce occasional arithmetical mistakes, so as 
to trick interrogators; 
(4) 
an unanticipated epiphenomenon: the program has a hard 
time thinking abstractly, and simply made "an honest mis-
take", which it might not make the next time around; 
(5) 
a joke on the part of the machine itself, deliberately teasing 
its interrogator. 
Reflection on what Turing might have meant by this subtle touch opens up 
just about all the major philosophical issues connected with Artificial Intel-
ligence. 
Turing goes on to point out that 
The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between 
the physical and the intellectual capacities of a man .... We do not wish to 
penalize the machine for its inabilit} to shine in beauty competitions, nor to 
penalize a man for losing in a race against an airplane.4 
One of the pleasures of the article is to see how far Turing traced out each 
596 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

line of thought, usually turning up a seeming contradiction at some stage 
and, by refining his concepts, resolving it at a deeper level of analysis. 
Because of this depth of penetration into the issues, the article still shines 
after nearly thirty years of tremendous progress in computer development 
and intensive work in AI. In the following short excerpt you can see some 
of this rich back-and-forth working of ideas: 
The game may perhaps be criticized on the ground that the odds are weight-
ed too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try to pretend to be the 
machine he would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away 
at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out 
something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different 
from what a man does? This objection is a very strong one, but at least we can 
say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be constructed to play the imitation 
game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this objection. 
It might be urged that when playing the "imitation game" the best strategy 
for the machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the 
behaviour of a man. This may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great 
effect of this kind. In any case there is no intention to investigate here the 
theory of the game, and it will be assumed that the best strategy is to try to 
provide answers that would naturally be given by a man.S 
Once the test has been proposed and discussed, Turing remarks: 
The original question "Can machines think?" I believe to be too meaningless 
to deserve discussion. Nevertheless, I believe that at the end of the century the 
use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one 
will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be con-
tradicted. 6 
Turing Anticipates Objections 
Aware of the storm of opposition that would undoubtedly greet this opin-
ion, he then proceeds to pick apart, concisely and with wry humor, a series 
of objections to the notion that machines could think. Below I list the nine 
types of objections he counters, using his own descriptions of them. 7 Un-
fortunately there is not space to reproduce the humorous and ingenious 
responses he formulated. You may enjoy pondering the objections your-
self, and figuring out your own responses. 
(1) 
The Theological Objection. Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul. 
God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman, but not to any 
other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or machine l:an think. 
(2) 
The "Heads in the Sand" Objection. The consequences of machines thinking 
would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so. 
(3) 
The Mathematical Objection. [This is essentially the Lucas argument.] 
(4) 
The Argument from Consciousness. "Not until a inachine can write a sonnet 
or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by 
the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain-
that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
597 

could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) plea-
sure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be 
made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or de-
pressed when it cannot get what it wants." [A quote from a certain 
Professor Jefferson.] 
Turing is quite concerned that he should answer this serious objection in 
full detail. Accordingly, he devotes quite a bit of space to his answer, and in 
it he offers another short hypothetical dialogue: 8 
Interrogator: In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare 
thee to a summer's day", would not "a spring day" do as well or better? 
Witness: 
It wouldn't scan. 
Interrogator: How about "a winter's day"? That would scan all right. 
Witness: 
Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day. 
Interrogator: Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas? 
Witness: In a way. 
Interrogator: Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think Mr. Pickwick 
would mind the comparison. 
Witness: I don't think you're serious. By a winter's day one means a typical 
winter's day, rather than a special one like Christmas. 
After this dialogue, Turing asks, "What would Professor Jefferson say if 
the sonnet-writing machine was able to answer like this in the viva voce?" 
Further objections: 
(5) 
Arguments from Various Disabilities. These arguments take the form, "I 
grant you that you can make machines do all the things that you have 
mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X." Numerous 
features X are suggested in this connection. I offer a selection: 
Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of 
humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy straw-
berries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experi-
ence, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as 
much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new. 
(6) 
Lady Lovelace's Objection. Our most detailed information of Babbage's 
Analytical Engine comes from a memoir by Lady Lovelace. In it she 
states, "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It 
can do whatever we know how to order it to perform" (her italics). 
(7) 
Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System. The nervous system is 
certainly not a discrete state machine. A small error in the information 
about the size of a nervous impulse impinging on a neuron may make a 
large difference to the size of the outgoing impulse. It may be argued 
that, this being so, one cannot expect to be able to mimic the behaviour 
of the nervous system with a discrete state system.

The Argument from Informality of Behaviour. I t seems to run something like 
this. "If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he 
regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no 
such rules, so men cannot be machines." 
(9) 
The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception. Let us play the imitation 
game, using as witnesses a man who is good as a telepathic receiver, and a 
digital computer. The interrogator can ask such questions as "What suit 
598 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

does the card in my right hand belong to?" The man by telepathy or 
clairvoyance gives the right answer 130 times out of 400 cards. The 
machine can only guess at random. and perhaps get 104 right, so the 
interrogator makes the right identification. 
As you can see, many of the objections overlap and are related to each 
other. I have attempted in this book to answer most of them in some way or 
other, usually far less concisely than Turing did. 
Objection (9) I find remarkable. I have seen the Turing paper re-
printed in a book-but with objection (9) omitted-which I find equally 
remarkable. My own point of view-contrary to Turing's-is that ESP does 
not exist. Turing was reluctant to accept the idea that ESP is real, but did so 
nonetheless, being compelled by his outstanding scientific integrity to ac-
cept the consequences of what he viewed as powerful statistical evidence in 
favor of ESP. I disagree, though I consider it an exceedingly complex and 
fascinating question. 
"Parry Encounters the Doctor" 
In the Dialogue preceding this Chapter, you have seen an authentic ex-
change between a computer program and a human. Now there have been 
many programs with less ability to "converse" than SHRDLU. Two rather 
famous ones are "Doctor", created by Joseph Weizenbaum, and "Parry", 
created by Kenneth Colby. The former is supposed to simulate a psychia-
trist using "nondirective therapy", the latter to simulate the belief structure 
of a paranoid. An amusing head-on collision between the two programs 
was arranged over a computer network, and the following is a short excerpt 
from the full transcript: 9 
Parry: I don't understand your motives. 
Doctor: Why don't you understand my motives? 
Parry: Shouldn't I be? 
Doctor: Why do you say that just now? 
Parry: That's just the way it is. 
Doctor: Suppose that's just the way it were not. 
Parry: So? 
Doctor: I am not sure I understand you fully. 
Parry: You harp on the same questions too much. 
Doctor: What does that similarity suggest to you? 
Parry: I don't get you. 
Doctor: Do you wish that you did get I? 
Parry: It's about time you showed some interest in my feelings. 
Doctor: Oh? I showed some interest in your feelings? 
These programs, of course, were made to talk to humans, so they are 
shown up rather poorly here, pitted against each other. Mostly they rely on 
shrewd guesses as to the nature of the input (which they analyze quite 
shallowly) and spit back canned answers that have been carefully selected 
from a large repertoire. The answer may be only partially canned: for 
example, a template with blanks that can be filled in. It is assumed that their 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
599 

human partners will read much more into what they say than is actually 
underlying it. And in fact, according to Weizenbaum, in his book Computer 
Power and Human Reason, just that happens. He writes: 
ELIZA [the program from which Doctor was made] created the most re-
markable illusion of having understood in the minds of the many people who 
conversed with it. ... They would often demand to be permitted to converse 
with the system in private, and would, after conversing with it for a time, 
insist, in spite of my explanations, that the machine really understood them. 'o 
Given the above excerpt, you may find this incredible. Incredible, but true. 
Weizenbaum has an explanation: 
Most men don't understand computers to even the slightest degree. So, unless 
they are capable of very great skepticism (the kind we bring to bear while 
watching a stage magician), they can explain the computer's intellectual feats 
only by bringing to bear the single analogy available to them, that is, their 
model of their own capacity to think. No wonder, then, that they overshoot 
the mark; it is truly impossible to imagine a human who could imitate ELIZA, 
for example, but for whom ELIZA's language abilities were his limit." 
Which amounts to an admission that this kind of program is based on a 
shrewd mixture of bravado and bluffing, taking advantage of people's 
gullibility. 
In light of this weird "ELIZA-effect", some people have suggested that 
the Turing test needs revision, since people can apparently be fooled by 
simplistic gimmickry. It has been suggested that the interrogator should be 
a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. It might be more advisable to turn the 
Turing test on its head, and insist that the interrogator should be another 
computer. Or perhaps there should be two interrogators-a human and a 
computer-and one witness, and the two interrogators should try to figure 
out whether the witness is a human or a computer. 
In a more serious vein, I personally feel that the Turing test, as 
originally proposed, is quite reasonable. As for the people who Weizen-
baum claims were sucked in by ELIZA, t~ey were not urged to be skeptical, 
or to use all their wits in trying to determine if the "person" typing to them 
were human or not. I think that Turing's insight into this issue was sound, 
and that the Turing test, essentially unmodified, will survive. 
A Brief History of AI 
I would like in the next few pages to present the story, perhaps from an 
unorthodox point of view, of some of the efforts at unraveling the al-
gorithms behind intelligence; there have been failures and setbacks and 
there will continue to be. Nonetheless, we are learning a great deal, and it is 
an exciting period. 
Ever since Pascal and Leibniz, people have dreamt of machines that 
could perform intellectual tasks. In the nineteenth century, Boole and De 
Morgan devised "laws of thought"-essentially the Propositional 
600 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

Calculus-and thus took the first step towards AI software; also Charles 
Babbage designed the first "calculating engine"-the precursor to the 
hardware of computers and hence of AI. One could define AI as coming 
into existence at the moment when mechanical devices took over any tasks 
previously performable only by human minds. It is hard to look back and 
imagine the feelings of those who first saw toothed wheels performing 
additions and multiplications of large numbers. Perhaps they experienced 
a sense of awe.at seeing "thoughts" flow in their very physical hardware. In 
any case, we do know that nearly a century later, when the first electronic 
computers were constructed, their inventors did experience an awesome 
and mystical sense of being in the presence of another kind of "thinking 
being". To what extent real thought was taking place was a source of much 
puzzlement; and even now, several decades later, the question remains a 
great source of stimulation and vitriolics. 
It is interesting that nowadays, practically no one feels that sense of 
awe any longer-even when computers perform operations that are incred-
ibly more sophisticated than those which sent thrills down spines in the 
early days. The once-exciting phrase "Giant Electronic Brain" remains only 
as a sort of "camp" cliche, a ridiculous vestige of the era of Flash Gordon 
and Buck Rogers. It is a bit sad that we become blase so quickly. 
There is a related "Theorem" about progress in AI: once some mental 
function is programmed, people soon cease to consider it as an essential 
ingredient of "real thinking". The ineluctable core of intelligence is always 
in that next thing which hasn't yet been programmed. This "Theorem" was 
first proposed to me by Larry Tesler, so I call it Tesler's Theorem: "AI is 
whatever hasn't been done yet." 
A selective overview of AI is furnished below. It shows several domains 
in which workers have concentrated their efforts, each one seeming in its 
own way to require the quintessence of intelligence. With some of the 
domains I have included a breakdown according to methods employed, or 
more specific areas of concentration.

Mechanical Translation 
Many of the preceding topics will not be touched upon in my selective 
discussion below, but the list would not be accurate without them. The first 
few topics are listed in historical order. In each of them, early efforts fell 
short of expectations. For example, the pitfalls in mechanical translation 
came as a great surprise to many who had thought it was a nearly 
straightforward task, whose perfection, to be sure, would be arduous, but 
whose basic implementation should be easy. As it turns out, translation is 
far more complex than mere dictionary look-up and word rearranging. 
Nor is the difficulty caused by a lack of knowledge of idiomatic phrases. 
The fact is that translation involves having a mental model of the world 
being discussed, and manipulating symbols in that model. A program 
which makes no use of a model of the world as it reads the passage will soon 
get hopelessly bogged down in ambiguities and multiple meanings. Even 
people-who have a huge advantage over computers, for they come fully 
equipped with an understanding of the world-when given a piece of text 
and a dictionary of a language they do not know, find it next to impossible 
to translate the text into their own language. Thus-and it is not surprising 
in retrospect-the first problem of AI led immediately to the issues at the 
heart of AI. 
Computer Chess 
Computer chess, too, proved to be much more difficult than the early 
intuitive estimates had suggested. Here again it turns out that the way 
humans represent a chess situation in their minds is far more complex than 
just knowing which piece is on which square, coupled with knowledge of 
the rules of chess. It involves perceiving configurations of several related 
pieces, as well as knowledge of heuristics, or rules of thumb, which pertain to 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
603 

such higher-level chunks. Even though heuristic rules are not rigorous in 
the way that the official rules are, they provide shortcut insights into what is 
going on on the board, which knowledge of the official rules does not. This 
much was recognized from the start; it was simply underestimated how 
large a role the intuitive, chunked understanding of the chess world plays 
in human chess skill. It was predicted that a program having some basic 
heuristics, coupled with the blinding speed and accuracy of a computer to 
look ahead in the game and analyze each possible move, would easily beat 
top-flight human players-a prediction which, even after twenty-five years 
of intense work by various people, still is far from being realized. 
People are nowadays tackling the chess problem from various angles. 
One of the most novel involves the hypothesis that looking ahead is a silly 
thing to do. One should instead merely look at what is on the board at 
present, and, using some heuristics, generate a plan, and then find a move 
which advances that particular plan. Of course, rules for the formulation of 
chess plans will necessarily involve heuristics which are, in some sense, 
"flattened" versions of looking ahead. That is, the equivalent of many 
games' experience of looking ahead is "squeezed" into another form which 
ostensibly doesn't involve looking ahead. In some sense this is a game of 
words. But if the "flattened" knowledge gives answers more efficiently than 
the actual look-ahead-even if it occasionally misleads- then something 
has been gained. Now this kind of distillation of knowledge into more 
highly usable forms is just what intelligence excels at-so look-ahead-Iess 
chess is probably a fruitful line of research to push. Particularly intriguing 
would be to devise a program which itself could convert knowledge gained 
from looking ahead into "flattened" rules-but that is an immense task. 
Samuel's Checker Program 
As a matter of fact, such a method was developed by Arthur Samuel in his 
admirable checker-playing program. Samuel's trick was to use both dynamic 
(look-ahead) and static (no-look-ahead) ways of evaluating any given board 
position. The static method involved a simple mathematical function of 
several quantities characterizing any board position, and thus could be 
calculated practically instantaneously, whereas the dynamic evaluation 
method involved creating a "tree" of possible future moves, responses to 
them, responses to the responses, and so forth (as was shown in Fig. 38). In 
the static evaluation function there were some parameters which could 
vary; the effect of varying them was to provide a set of different possible 
versions of the static evaluation function. Samuel's strategy was to select, in 
an evolutionary way, better and better values of those parameters. 
Here's how this was done: each time time the program evaluated a 
board position, it did so both statically and dynamically. The answer gotten 
by looking ahead-let us call it D-wa~ used in determining the move to be 
made. The purpose of S, the static evaluation, was trickier: on each move, 
the variable parameters were readjusted slightly so that S approximated D 
604 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

as accurately as possible. The effect was to partially encode in the values of 
the static evalution's parameters the knowledge gained by dynamically 
searching the tree. In short, the idea was to "flatten" the complex dynamic 
evaluation method into the much simpler and more efficient static evalua-
tion function. 
There is a rather nice recursive effect here. The point is that the 
dynamic evaluation of any single board position involves looking ahead a 
finite number of moves-say seven. Now each of the scads of board posi-
tions which might turn up seven turns down the road has to be itself 
evaluated somehow as well. But when the program evaluates these posi-
tions, it certainly cannot look another seven moves ahead, lest it have to 
look fourteen positions ahead, then twenty-one, etc., etc.-an infinite re-
gress. Instead, it relies on static evaluations of positions seven moves ahead. 
Therefore, in Samuel's scheme, an intricate sort of feedback takes place, 
wherein the program is constantly trying to "flatten" look-ahead evaluation 
into a simpler static recipe; and this recipe in turn plays a key role in the 
dynamic look-ahead evaluation. Thus the two are intimately linked to-
gether, and each benefits from improvements in the other in a recursive 
way. 
The level of play of the Samuel checkers program is extremely high: of 
the order of the top human players in the world. If this is so, why not apply 
the same techniques to chess? An international committee, convened in 
1961 to study the feasibility of computer chess, including the Dutch Inter-
national Grandmaster and mathematician Max Euwe, came to the bleak 
conclusion that the Samuel technique would be approximately one million 
times as difficult to implement in chess as in checkers, and that seems to 
close the book on that. 
The extraordinarily great skill of the checkers program cannot be 
taken as saying "intelligence has been achieved"; yet it should not be 
minimized, either. It is a combination of insights into what checkers is, how 
to think about checkers, and how to program. Some people might feel that 
all it shows is Samuel's own checkers ability. But this is not true, for at least 
two reasons. One is that skillful game players choose their moves according 
to mental processes which they do not fully understand-they use their 
intuitions. Now there is no known way that anyone can bring to light all of 
his own intuitions; the best one can do via introspection is to use "feeling" 
or "meta-intuition"-an intuition about one's intuitions-as a guide, and 
try to describe what one thinks one's intuitions are all about. But this will 
only give a rough approximation to the true complexity of intuitive 
methods. Hence it is virtually certain that Samuel has not mirrored his own 
personal methods of play in his program. The other reason that Samuel's 
program's play should not be confused with Samuel's own play is that 
Samuel does not play checkers as well as his program-it beats him. This is 
not a paradox at all-no more than is the fact that a computer which has 
been programmed to calculate 7T can outrace its programmer in spewing 
forth digits of 7T.

When Is a Program Original? 
This issue of a program outdoing its programmer is connected with the 
question of "originality" in AI. What if an AI program comes up with an 
idea, or a line of play in a game, which its programmer has never 
entertained-who should get the credit? There are various interesting 
instances of this having happened, some on a fairly trivial level, some on a 
rather deep level. One of the more famous involved a program to find 
proofs of theorems in elementary Euclidean geometry, written by E. 
Gelernter. One day the program came up with a sparklingly ingenious 
proof of one of the basic theorems of geometry-the so-called "pons 
asinorum", or "bridge of asses". 
This theorem states that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are 
equal. Its standard proof requires constructing an altitude which divides 
the triangle into symmetrical halves. The elegant method found by the 
program (see Fig. 114) used no construction lines. Instead, it considered 
A 
P '--____ 
...l P' 
FIGURE 114. Pons Asinorum Proof 
(found by Pappus [-300 A.D.] and 
Gelernter's program [ -1960 A.D. ]). Prob-
lem: To show that the base angles of an 
isosceles triangle are equal. Solution: As the 
triangle is isosceles, AP and AP I are of 
equal length. Therefore triangles PAP I and 
P'AP are congruent (side-side-side). This 
implies that corresponding angles are equal. 
In particular, the two base angles are equal. 
the triangle and its mirror image as two different triangles. Then, having 
proved them congruent, it pointed out that the two base angles matched 
each other in this congruence-QED. 
This gem of a proof delighted the program's creator and others; some 
saw evidence of genius in its performance. Not to take anything away from 
this feat, it happens that in A.D. 300 the geometer Pappus had actually 
found this proof, too. In any case, the question remains: "Who gets the 
credit?" Is this intelligent behavior? Or was the proof lying deeply hidden 
within the human (Gelernter), and did the computer merely bring it to the 
surface? This last question comes close to hitting the mark. We can turn it 
around: Was the prooflying deeply hidden in the program? Or was it close 
to the surface? That is, how easy is it to see why the program did what it 
did? Can the discovery be attributed to some simple mechanism, or simple 
combination of mechanisms, in the program? Or was there a complex 
interaction which, if one heard it explained, would not diminish one's awe 
at its having happened? 
It seems reasonable to say that if one can ascribe the performance to 
certain operations which are easily traced in the program, then in some 
sense the program was just revealing ideas which were in essence hidden-
though not too deeply-inside the programmer's own mind. Conversely, if 
606 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

following the program does not serve to enlighten one as to why this 
particular discovery popped out, then perhaps one should begin to sepa-
rate the program's "mind" from that of its programmer. The human gets 
credit for having invented the program, but not for having had inside his 
own head the ideas produced by the program. In such cases, the human 
can be referred to as the "meta-author"-the author of the author of the 
result, and the program as the (just plain) author. 
In the particular case of Gelernter and his geometry machine, while 
Gelernter probably would not have rediscovered Pappus' proof, still the 
mechanisms which generated that proof were sufficiently close to the 
surface of the program that one hesitates to call the program a geometer in 
its own right. If it had kept on astonishing people by coming up with 
ingenious new proofs over and over again, each of which seemed to be 
based on a fresh spark of genius rather than on some standard method, 
then one would have no qualms about calling the program a geometer-but 
this did not happen. 
Who Composes Computer Music? 
The distinction between author and meta-author is sharply pointed up in 
the case of computer composition of music. There are various levels of 
autonomy which a program may seem to have in the act of composition. 
One level is illustrated by a piece whose "meta-author" was Max Mathews of 
Bell Laboratories. He fed in the scores of the two marches "When Johnny 
Comes Marching Home" and "The British Grenadiers", and instructed the 
computer to make a new score--one which starts out as "Johnny", but 
slowly merges into "Grenadiers". Halfway through the piece, "Johnny" is 
totally gone, and one hears "Grenadiers" by itself ... Then the process is 
reversed, and the piece finishes with "Johnny", as it began. In Mathews' 
own words, this is 
... a nauseating musical experience but one not without interest, particularly 
in the rhythmic conversions. "The Grenadiers" is written in 2/4 time in the 
key of F major. "Johnny" is written in 6/8 time in the key of E minor. The 
change from 2/4 to 6/8 time can be clearly appreciated, yet would be quite 
difficult for a human musician to play. The modulation from the key of F 
major to E minor, which involves a change of two notes in the scale, is jarring, 
and a smaller transition would undoubtedly have been a better choice.12 
The resulting piece has a somewhat droll quality to it, though in spots it is 
turgid and confused. 
Is the computer composing? The question is best unasked, but it cannot be 
completely ignored. An answer is difficult to provide. The algorithms are 
deterministic, simple, and understandable. No complicated or hard-to-
understand computations are involved; no "learning" programs are used; no 
random processes occur; the machine functions in a perfectly mechanical and 
straightforward manner. However, the result is sequences of sound that are 
unplanned in fine detail by the composer, even though the over-all structure 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
607 

of the section is completely and precisely specified. Thus the composer is 
often surprised, and pleasantly surpnsed, at the details of the realization of 
his ideas. To this extent only is the computer composing. We call the process 
algorithmic composition, but we immediately fe-emphasize that the al-
gorithms are transparently simple. 13 
This is Mathews' answer to a question which he would rather "unask". 
Despite his disclaimer, however, many people find it easier to say simply 
that the piece was "composed by a computer". I believe this phrase mis-
represents the situation totally. The program contained no structures 
analogous to the brain's "symbols", and could not be said in any sense to be 
"thinking" about what it was doing. To attribute the composition of such a 
piece of music to the computer would be like attributing the authorship of 
this book to the computerized automatically (often incorrectly) hyphenat-
ing phototypesetting machine with which it was set. 
This brings up a questIOn which is a slight digression from AI, but 
actually not a huge one. It is this: When you see the word "I" or "me" in a 
text, what do you take it to be referring to? For instance, think of the 
phrase "WASH ME" which appears occasionally on the back of dirty trucks. 
Who is this "me"? Is this an outcry of some forlorn child who, in despera-
tion to have a bath, scribbled the words on the nearest surface? Or is the 
truck requesting a wash? Or, perhaps, does the sentence itself wish to be 
given a shower? Or, is it that the filthy English language is asking to be 
cleansed? One could go on and on in this game. In this case, the phrase is a 
joke, and one is supposed to pretend, on some level, that the truck itself 
wrote the phrase and is requesting a wash. On another level, one clearly 
recognizes the writing as that of a child, and enjoys the humor of the 
misdirection. Here, in fact, is a game based on reading the "me" at the 
wrong level. 
Precisely this kind of ambiguity has arisen in this book, first in the 
Contracrostipunctus, and later in the discussions of Godel's string G (and its 
relatives). The interpretation given for unplayable records was "I Cannot 
Be Played on Record Player X", and that for unprovable statements was, "I 
Cannot Be Proven in Formal System X". Let us take the latter sentence. On 
what other occasions, if any, have you encountered a sentence containing 
the pronoun "I" where you automatically understood that the reference 
was not to the speaker of the sentence, but rather to the sentence itself? 
Very few, I would guess. The word "I", when it appears in a Shakespeare 
sonnet, is referring not to a fourteen-line form of poetry printed on a page, 
but to a flesh-and-blood creature behind the scenes, somewhere off stage. 
How far back do we ordinarily trace the "I" in a sentence? The answer, 
it seems to me, is that we look for a sentient being to attach the authorship 
to. But what is a sentient being? Something onto which we can map 
ourselves comfortably. In Weizenbaum's "Doctor" program, is there a 
personality? If so, whose is it? A small debate over this very question 
recently raged in the pages of Science magazine. 
This brings us back to the issue of the "who" who composes computer 
music. In most circumstances, the driving force behind such pieces is a 
608 
Artificial I ntelIigence: Retrospects 

human intellect, and the computer has been employed, with more or less 
ingenuity, as a tool for realizing an idea devised by the human. The pro-
gram which carries this out is not anything which we can identify with. It is 
a simple and single-minded piece of software with no flexibility, no 
perspective on what it is doing, and no sense of self. If and when, however, 
people develop programs which have those attributes, and pieces of music 
start issuing forth from them, then I suggest that will be the appropriate 
time to start splitting up one's admiration: some to the programmer for 
creating such an amazing program, and some to the program itself for its 
sense of music. And it seems to me that that will only take place when the 
internal structure of such a program is based on something similar to the 
"symbols" in our brains and their triggering patterns, which are responsible 
for the complex notion of meaning. The fact of having this kind of internal 
structure would endow the program with properties which would make us 
feel comfortable in identifying with it, to some extent. But until then, I will 
not feel comfortable in saying "this piece was composed by a computer". 
Theorem Proving and Problem Reduction 
Let us now return to the history of AI. One of the early things which people 
attempted to program was the intellectual activity of theorem proving. 
Conceptually, this is no different from programming a computer to look 
for a derivation of MU in the MIU-system, except that the formal systems 
involved were often more complicated than the MIU-system. They were 
versions of the Predicate Calculus, which is an extension of the Proposi-
tional Calculus involving quantifiers. Most of the rules of the Predicate 
Calculus are included in TNT, as a matter of fact. The trick in writing such 
a program is to instill a sense of direction, so that the program does not 
wander all over the map, but works only on "relevant" pathways-those 
which, by some reasonable criterion, seem to be leading towards the de-
sired string. 
In this book we have not dealt much with such issues. How indeed can 
you know when you are proceeding towards a theorem, and how can you 
tell if what you are doing is just empty fiddling? This was one thing which I 
hoped to illustrate with the MU-puzzle. Of course, there can be no defini-
tive answer: that is the content of the limitative Theorems, since if you 
could always know which way to go, you could construct an algorithm for 
proving any desired theorem, and that would violate Church's Theorem. 
There is no such algorithm. (I will leave it to the reader to see exactly why 
this follows from Church's Theorem.) However, this doesn't mean that it is 
impossible to develop any intuition at all concerning what is and what is not 
a promising route; in fact, the best programs have very sophisticated 
heuristics, which enable them to make deductions in the Predicate Calculus 
at speeds which are comparable to those of capable humans. 
The trick in theorem proving is to to use the fact that you have an 
overall goal-namely the string you want to produce-in guiding you 
locally. One technique which was developed for converting global goals 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
609 

• 
A 
into local strategies for derivations is called problem reduction. It is based on 
the idea that whenever one has a long-range goal, there are usually subgoals 
whose attainment will aid in the attainment of the main goal. Therefore if 
one breaks up a given problem into a series of new subproblems, then 
breaks those in turn into subsubproblems, and so on, in a recursive fashion, 
one eventually comes down to very modest goals which can presumably be 
attained in a couple of steps. Or at least so it would seem ... 
PrQblem reduction got Zeno into hot water. Zeno's method, you recall, 
for getting from A to B (think of B as the goal), is to "reduce" the problem 
into two subproblems: first go halfway, then go the rest of the way. So now 
you have "pushed"-in the sense of Chapter V-two subgoals onto your 
"goal stack". Each of these, in turn, will be replaced by two subsubgoals-
and so on ad infinitum. You wind up with an infinite goal-stack, instead of a 
single goal (Fig. 115). Popping an infinite number of goals off your stack 
will prove to be tricky-which is just Zeno's point, of course. 
Another example of an infinite recursion in problem reduction occur-
red in the Dialogue Little Harmonic Labyrinth, when Achilles wanted to have 
a Typeless Wish granted. Its granting had to be deferred until permission 
was gotten from the Meta-Genie; but in order to get permission to give 
permission, she had to summon the Meta-Meta-Genie-and so on. Despite

the infiniteness of the goal stack, Achilles got his wish. Problem reduction 
wins the day! 
Despite my mockery, problem reduction is a powerful technique for 
converting global problems into local problems. It shines in certain situa-
tions, such as in the endgame of chess, where the look-ahead technique 
often performs miserably, even when it is carried to ridiculous lengths, 
such as fifteen or more plies. This is because the look-ahead technique is 
not based on planning; it simply has no goals and explores a huge number 
of pointless alternatives. Having a goal enables you to develop a strategy for 
the achievement of that goal, and this is a completely different philosophy 
from looking ahead mechanically. Of course, in the look-ahead technique, 
desirability or its absence is measured by the evaluation function for posi-
tions, and that incorporates indirectly a number of goals, principally that of 
not getting checkmated. But that is too indirect. Good chess players who 
play against look-ahead chess programs usually come away with the im-
pression that their opponents are very weak in formulating plans or 
strategies. 
Shandy and the Bone 
There is no guarantee that the method of problem reduction will work. 
There are many situations where it flops. Consider this simple problem, for 
instance. You are a dog, and a human friend has just thrown your favorite 
bone over a wire fence into another yard. You can see your bone through 
the fence, just lying there in the grass-how luscious! There is an open gate 
in the fence about fifty feet away from the bone. What do you do? Some 
dogs will just run up to the fence, stand next to it, and bark; others will dash 
up to the open gate and double back to the lovely bone. Both dogs can be 
said to be exercising the problem reduction technique; however, they 
represent the problem in their minds in different ways, and this makes all 
the difference. The barking dog sees the subproblems as (1) running to the 
fence, (2) getting through it, and (3) running to the bone-but that second 
subproblem is a "toughie", whence the barking. The other dog sees the 
subproblems as (1) getting to the gate; (2) going through the gate; (3) 
running to the bone. Notice how everything depends on the way you 
represent the "problem space"-that is, on what you perceive as reducing 
the problem (forward motion towards the overall goal) and what you 
perceive as magnifying the problem (backward motion away from the goal). 
Changing the Problem Space 
Some dogs first try running directly towards the bone, and when they 
encounter the fence, something clicks inside their brain; soon they change 
course, and run over to the gate. These dogs realize that what on first 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
611 

glance seemed as if it would increase the distance between the initial situa-
tion and the desired situation-namely, running away from the bone but 
towards the open gate-actually would decrease it. At first, they confuse 
physical distance with problem distance. Any motion away from the bone 
seems, by definition, a Bad Thing. But then-somehow-they realize that 
they can shift their perception of what will bring them "closer" to the bone. 
In a properly chosen abstract space, moving towards the gate is a trajectory 
bringing the dog closer to the bone! At every moment, the dog is getting 
"closer"-in the new sense-to the bone. Thus, the usefulness of problem 
reduction depends on how you represent your problem mentally. What in 
one space looks like a retreat can in another space look like a revolutionary 
step forward. 
In ordinary life, we constantly face and solve variations on the dog-
and-bone problem. For instance, if one afternoon I decide to drive one 
hundred miles south, but am at my office and have ridden my bike to work, 
I have to make an extremely large number of moves in what are ostensibly 
"wrong" directions before I am actually on my way in car headed south. I 
have to leave my office, which means, say, heading east a few feet; then 
follow the hall in the building which heads north, then west. Then I ride 
my bike home, which involves excursions in all the directions of the com-
pass; and I reach my home. A succession of short moves there eventually 
gets me into my car, and I am off. Not that I immediately drive due south, 
of course-I choose a route which may involve some excursions north, 
west, or east, with the aim of getting to the freeway as quickly as possible. 
All of this doesn't feel paradoxical in the slightest; it is done without 
even any sense of amusement. The space in which physical backtracking is 
perceived as direct motion towards the goal is built so deeply into my mind 
that I don't even see any irony when I head north. The roads and hallways 
and so forth act as channels which I accept without much fight, so that part 
of the act of choosing how to perceive the situation involves just accepting 
what is imposed. But dogs in front of fences sometimes have a hard time 
doing that, especially when that bone is sitting there so close, staring them 
in the face, and looking so good. And when the problem space is just a 
shade more abstract than physical space, people are often just as lacking in 
insight about what to do as the barking dogs. 
In some sense all problems are abstract versions of the dog-and-bone 
problem. Many problems are not in physical space but in some sort of 
conceptual space. When you realize that direct motion towards the goal in 
that space runs you into some sort of abstract "fence", you can do one of 
two things: (1) try moving away from the goal in some sort of random way, 
hoping that you may come upon a hidden "gate" through which you can 
pass and then reach your bone; or (2) try to find a new "space" in which you 
can represent the problem, and in which there is no abstract fence separat-
ing you from your goal-then you can proceed straight towards the goal in 
this new space. The first method may seem like the lazy way to go, and the 
second method may seem like a difficult and complicated way to go. And 
yet, solutions which involve restructuring the problem space more often 
612 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

than not come as sudden flashes of insight rather than as products of a 
series of slow, deliberate thought processes. Probably these intuitive flashes 
come from the extreme core of intelligence-and needless to say, their 
source is a closely protected secret of our jealous brains. 
In any case, the trouble is not that problem reduction per se leads to 
failures; it is quite a sound technique. The problem is a deeper one: how do 
you choose a good internal representation for a problem? What kind of 
"space" do you see it in? What kinds of action reduce the "distance" 
between you and your goal in the space you have chosen? This can be 
expressed in mathematical language as the problem of hunting for an 
approprate metric (distance function) between states. You want to find a 
metric in which the distance between you and your goal is very small. 
Now since this matter of choosing an internal representation is itself a 
type of problem-and a most tricky one, too-you might think of turning 
the technique of problem reduction back on it! To do so, you would have to 
have a way of representing a huge variety of abstract spaces, which is an 
exceedingly complex project. I am not aware of anyone's having tried 
anything along these lines. It may bejust a theoretically appealing, amusing 
suggestion which is in fact wholly unrealistic. In any case, what AI sorely 
lacks is programs which can "step back" and take a look at what is going on, 
and with this perspective, reorient themselves to the task at hand. It is one 
thing to write a program which excels at a single task which, when done by 
a human being, seems to require intelligence-and it is another thing 
altogether to write an intelligent program! It is the difference between the 
Sphex wasp (see Chapter XI), whose wired-in routine gives the deceptive 
appearance of great intelligence, and a human being observing a Sphex 
wasp. 
The I-Mode and the M-Mode Again 
An intelligent program would presumably be one which is versatile enough 
to solve problems of many different sorts. It would learn to do each 
different one and would accumulate experience in doing so. It would be 
able to work within a set of rules and yet also, at appropriate moments, to 
step back and make a judgment about whether working within that set of 
rules is likely to be profitable in terms of some overall set of goals which it 
has. It would be able to choose to stop working within a given framework, if 
need be, and to create a new framework of rules within which to work for a 
while. 
Much of this discussion may remind you of aspects of the MU-puzzle. 
For instance, moving away from the goal of a problem is reminiscent of 
moving away from MU by making longer and longer strings which you 
hope may in some indirect way enable you to make MU. If you are a naive 
"dog", you may feel you are moving away from your "MU-bone" whenever 
your string increases beyond two characters; if you are a more sophisticated 
dog, the use of such lengthening rules has an indirect justification, some-
thing like heading for the gate to get your MU-bone. 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
613 

Another connection between the previous discussion and the MU-
puzzle is the two modes of operation which led to insight about the nature 
of the MU-puzzle: the Mechanical mode, and the Intelligent mode. In the 
former, you are embedded within some fixed framework; in the latter, you 
can always step back and gain an overview of things. Having an overview is 
tantamount to choosing a representation within which to work; and work-
ing within the rules of the system is tantamount to trying the technique of 
problem reduction within that selected framework. Hardy's comment on 
Ramanujan's style-particularly his willingness to modify his own 
hypotheses-illustrates this interplay between the M-mode and the I-mode 
in creative thought. 
The Sphex wasp operates excellently in the M-mode, but it has abso-
lutely no ability to choose its framework or even to alter its M-mode in the 
slightest. It has no ability to notice when the same thing occurs over and 
over and over again in its system, for to notice such a thing would be to 
jump out of the system, even if only ever so slightly. It simply does not 
notice the sameness of the repetitions. This idea (of not noticing the 
identity of certain repetitive event~) is interesting when we apply it to 
ourselves. Are there highly repetitious situations which occur in our lives 
time and time again, and which we handle in the identical stupid way each 
time, because we don't have enough of an overview to perceive their 
sameness? This leads back to that recurrent issue, "What is sameness?" It 
will soon come up as an AI theme, when we discuss pattern recognition. 
Applying AI to Mathematics 
Mathematics is in some ways an extremely interesting domain to study 
from the AI point of view. Every mathematician has the sense that there is a 
kind of metric between ideas in mathematics-that all of mathematics is a 
network of results between which there are enormously many connections. 
In that network, some ideas are very closely linked; others require more 
elaborate pathways to be joined. Sometimes two theorems in mathematics 
are close because one can be proven easily, given the other. Other times two 
ideas are close because they are analogous, or even isomorphic. These are 
two different senses of the word "dose" in the domain of mathematics. 
There are probably a number of others. Whether there is an objectivity or a 
universality to our sense of mathematical closeness, or whether it is largely 
an accident of historical development is hard to say. Some theorems of 
different branches of mathematics appear to us hard to link, and we. might 
say that they are unrelated-but something might turn up later which 
forces us to change our minds. If we could instill our highly developed 
sense of mathematical closeness-a "mathematician's mental metric", so to 
speak-into a program, we could perhaps produce a primitive "artificial 
mathematician". But that depends on being able to convey a sense of 
sirAlplicity or "naturalness" as well, which is another major stumbling block. 
These issues have been confronted in a number of AI projects. Ther.e 
614 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

is a collection of programs developed at MIT which go under the name 
"MACSYMA", whose purpose it is to aid mathematicians in symbolic ma-
nipulation of complex mathematical expressions. This program has in it 
some sense of "where to go "-a sort of "complexity gradient" which guides 
it from what we would generally consider complex expressions to simpler 
ones. Part of MACSYMA's repertoire is a program called "SIN", which 
does symbolic integration of functions; it is generally acknowledged to be 
superior to humans in some categories. It relies upon a number of differ-
ent skills, as intelligence in general must: a vast body of knowledge, the 
technique of problem reduction, a large number of heuristics, and also 
some special tricks. 
Another program, written by Douglas Lenat at Stanford, had as its aim 
to invent concepts and discover facts in very elementary mathematics. 
Beginning with the notion of sets, and a collection of notions of what is 
"interesting" which had been spoon-fed into it, it "invented" the idea of 
counting, then the idea of addition, then multiplication, then-among 
other things-the notion of prime numbers, and it went so far as to 
rediscover Goldbach's conjecture! Of course these "discoveries" were all 
hundreds-even thousands--of years old. Perhaps this may be explained 
in part by saying that the sense of "inteFesting" was conveyed by Lenat in a 
large number of rules which may have been influenced by his twentieth-
century training; nonetheless it is impressive. The program seemed to run 
out of steam after this very respectable performance. An interesting thing 
about it was that it was unable to develop or improve upon its own,sense of 
what is interesting. That seemed another level of difficulty up--or perhaps 
several levels up. 
The Crux of AI: Representation of Knowledge 
Many of the examples above have been cited in order to stress that the way 
a domain is represented has a huge bearing on how that domain is "under-
stood". A program which merely printed out theorems of TNT in a 
preordained order would have no understanding of number theory; a 
program such as Lenat's with its extra layers of knowledge could be said to 
have a rudimentary sense of number theory; and one which embeds math-
ematical knowledge in a wide context of real-world experience would 
probably be the most able to "understand" in the sense that we think we do. 
It is thiS" representation of knowledge that is at the crux of AI. 
In the early days it was assumed that knowledge came in sentence-like 
"packets", and that the best way to implant knowledge into a program was 
to develop a simple way of translating facts into small passive packets of 
data. Then every fact would simply be a piece of data, accessible to the 
programs using it. This is exemplified by chess programs, where board 
positions are coded into matrices or lists of some sort and stored efficiently 
in memory where they can be retrieved and acted upon by subroutines. 
The fact that human beings store facts in a more complicated way was 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
615 

known to psychologists for quite a while and has only recently been redis-
covered by AI workers, who are now confronting the problems of 
"chunked" knowledge, and the difference between procedural and de-
clarative types of knowledge, which is related, as we saw in Chapter XI, to 
the difference between knowledge which is accessible to introspection and 
knowledge which is inaccessible to introspection. 
The naive assumption that all knowledge should be coded into passive 
pieces of data is actually contradicted by the most fundamental fact about 
computer design: that is, how to add, subtract, multiply, and so on is not 
coded into pieces of data and stored in memory; it is, in fact, represented 
nowhere in memory, but rather in th(· wiring patterns of the hardware. A 
pocket calculator does not store in its memory knowledge of how to add; 
that knowledge is encoded into its "guts". There is no memory location to 
point to if somebody demands, "Show me where the knowledge of how to 
add resides in this machine!" 
A large amount of work in AI has nevertheless gone into systems in 
which the bulk of the knowledge is stored in specific places-that is, de-
claratively. It goes without saying that some knowledge has to be embodied 
in programs; otherwise one would not have a program at all, but merely an 
encyclopedia. The question is how to split up knowledge between program 
and data. Not that it is always easy to distinguish between program and 
data, by any means. I hope that was made clear enough in Chapter XVI. 
But in the development of a system, if the programmer intuitively con-
ceives of some particular item as data (or as program), that may have 
significant repercussions on the system's structure, because as one pro-
grams one does tend to distinguish between data-like objects and program-
like objects. 
It is important to point out that in principle, any manner of coding 
information into data structures or procedures is as good as any other, in 
the sense that if you are not too concerned about efficiency, what you can 
do in one scheme, you can do in the other. However, reasons can be given 
which seem to indicate that one method is definitely superior to the other. 
For instance, consider the following argument in favor of using procedural 
representations only: "As soon as you try to encode features of sufficient 
complexity into data, you are forced into developing what amounts to a 
new language, or formalism. So in effect your data structures become 
program-like, with some piece of your program serving as their interpret-
er; you might as well represent the same information directly in procedural 
form to begin with, and obviate the extra level of interpretation." 
DNA and Proteins Help Give Some Perspective 
This argument sounds quite convincing, and yet, if interpreted a little 
loosely, it can be read as an argument for the abolishment of DNA and 
RNA. Why encode genetic information in DNA, when by representing it 
directly in proteins, you could eliminate not just one, but two levels of 
interpretation? The answer is: it turm out that it is extremely useful to have 
616 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

the same information in several different forms for different purposes. 
One advantage of storing genetic information in the modular and data-like 
form of DNA is that two individuals' genes can be easily recombined to 
form a new genotype. This would be very difficult if the information were 
only in proteins. A second reason for storing information in DNA is that it 
is easy to transcribe and translate it into proteins. When it is not needed, it 
does not take up much room; when it is needed, it serves as a template. 
There is no mechanism for copying one protein off of another; their 
folded tertiary structures would make copying highly unwieldy. Com-
plementarily, it is almost imperative to be able to get genetic information 
into three-dimensional structures such as enzymes, because the recognition 
and manipulation of molecules is by its nature a three-dimensional opera-
tion. Thus the argument for purely procedural representations is seen to 
be quite fallacious in the context of cells. It suggests that there are advan-
tages to being able to switch back and forth between procedural and 
declarative representations. This is probably true also in AI. 
This issue was raised by Francis Crick in a conference on communica-
tion with extraterrestrial intelligence: 
We see on Earth that there are two molecules, one of which is good for 
replication [DNA] and one of which is good for action [proteins]. Is it 
possible to devise a system in which one molecule does both jobs, or are there 
perhaps strong arguments, from systems analysis, which might suggest (if 
they exist) that to divide the job into two gives a great advantage? This is a 
question to which I do not know the answer. 14 
Modularity of Knowledge 
Another question which comes up in the representation of knowledge is 
modularity. How easy is it to insert new knowledge? How easy is it to revise 
old knowledge? How modular are books? It all depends. If from a tightly 
structured book with many cross-references a single chapter is removed, 
the rest of the book may become virtually incomprehensible. It is like trying 
to pull a single strand out of a spider web-you ruin the whole in doing so. 
On the other hand, some books are quite modular, having independent 
chapters. 
Consider a straightforward theorem-generating program which uses 
TNT's axioms and rules of inference. The "knowledge" of such a program 
has two aspects. It resides implicitly in the axioms and rules, and explicitly 
in the body of theorems which have so far been produced. Depending on 
which way you look at the knowledge, you will see it either as modular or as 
spread all around and completely nonmodular. For instance, suppose you 
had written such a program but had forgotten to include TNT's Axiom 1 in 
the list of axioms. After the program had done many thousands of deriva-
tions, you realized your oversight, and inserted the new axiom. The fact 
that you can do so in a trice shows that the system's implicit knowledge is 
modular; but the new axiom's contribution to the explicit knowledge of the 
system will only be reflected after a long time-after its effects have "dif-
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
617 

fused" outwards, as the odor of perfume slowly diffuses in a room when 
the bottle is broken. In that sense the new knowledge takes a long time to be 
incorporated. Furthermore, if you wanted to go back and replace Axiom 1 
by its negation, you could not just do that by itself; you would have to delete 
all theorems which had involved Axiom I in their derivations. Clearly this 
system's explicit knowledge is not nearly so modular as its implicit knowl-
edge. 
It would be useful if we learned how to transplant knowledge modu-
larly. Then to teach everyone French, we would just open up their heads 
and operate in a fixed way on their neural structures-then they would 
know how to speak French. Of course, this is only a hilarious pipe dream. 
Another aspect of knowledge representation has to do with the way in 
which one wishes to use the knowledge. Are inferences supposed to be 
drawn as pieces of information arrive? Should analogies and comparisons 
constantly be being made between new information and old information? 
In a chess program, for instance, if you want to generate look-ahead trees, 
then a representation which encodes board positions with a minimum of 
redundancy will be preferable to one which repeats the information in 
several different ways. But if you want your program to "understand" a 
board position by looking for patterns and comparing them to known 
patterns, then representing the same information several times over in 
different forms will be more useful. 
Representing Knowledge in a logical Formalism 
There are various schools of thought concerning the best way to represent 
and manipulate knowledge. One which has had great influence advocates 
representations using formal notations similar to those for TNT-using 
propositional connectives and quantifiers. The basic operations in such 
representations are, not surprisingly, formalizations of deductive reason-
ing. Logical deductions can be made using rules of inference analogous to 
some of those in TNT. Querying the system about some particular idea sets 
up a goal in the form of a string to be derived. For example: "Is MUMON a 
theorem?" Then the automatic reasoning mechanisms take over in a goal-
oriented way, using various methods of problem reduction. 
For example, suppose that the proposition "All formal arithmetics are 
incomplete" were known, and the program were queried, "Is Principia 
Mathematica incomplete?" In scanning the list of known facts-often called 
the data base-the system might notice that if it could establish that Principia 
Mathematica is a formal arithmetic, then it could answer the question. 
Therefore the proposition "Principia Mathematica is a formal arithmetic" 
would be set up as a subgoal, and then problem reduction would take over. 
If it could find further things which would help in establishing (or refuting) 
the goal or-the subgoal, it would work on them-and so on, recursively. 
This process is given the name of backwards chaining, since it begins with the 
goal and works its way backwards, presumably towards things which may 
already be known. If one makes a graphic representation of the main goal, 
618 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

subsidiary goals, subsubgoals, etc., a tree-like structure will arise, since the 
main goal may involve several different subgoals, each of which in turn 
involves several subsubgoals, etc. 
Notice that this method is not guaranteed to resolve the question, for 
there may be no way of establishing within the system that Principia 
Mathematica is a formal arithmetic. This does not imply, however, that 
either the goal or the sub goal is a false statement-merely that they cannot 
be derived with the knowledge currently available to the system. The 
system may print out, in such a circumstance, "I do not know" or words to 
that effect. The fact that some questions are left open is of course similar to 
the incompleteness from which certain well-known formal systems suffer. 
Deductive vs. Analogical Awareness 
This method affords a deductive awareness of the domain that is represented, 
in that correct logical conclusions can be drawn from known facts. How-
ever, it misses something of the human ability to spot similarities and to 
compare situations-it misses what might be called analogical awareness-a 
crucial side of human intelligence. This is not to say that analogical thought 
processes cannot be forced into such a mold, but they do not lend them-
selves naturally to being captured in that kind of formalism. These days, 
logic-oriented systems are not so much in vogue as other kinds, which allow 
complex forms of comparisons to be carried out rather naturally. 
When you realize that knowledge representation is an altogether dif-
ferent ball game than mere storage of numbers, then the idea that "a 
computer has the memory of an elephant" is an easy myth to explode. 
What is stored in memory is not necessarily synonymous with what a program 
knows; for even if a given piece of knowledge is encoded somewhere inside 
a complex system, there may be no procedure, or rule, or other type of 
handler of data, which can get at it-it may be inaccessible. In such a case, 
you can say that the piece of knowledge has been "forgotten" because 
access to it has been temporarily or permanently lost. Thus a computer 
program may "forget" something on a high level which it "remembers" on 
a low level. This is another one of those ever-recurring level distinctions, 
from which we can probably learn much about our own selves. When a 
human forgets, it most likely means that a high-level pointer has been 
lost-not that any information has been deleted or destroyed. This high-
lights the extreme importance of keeping track of the ways in which you 
store incoming experiences, for you never know in advance under what 
circumstances, or from what angle, you will want to pull something out of 
storage. 
From Computer Haiku to an RTN-Grammar 
The complexity of the knowledge representation in human heads first hit 
home with me when I was working on a program to generate English 
sentences "out of the blue". I had come to this project in a rather interest-
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
619 

ing way. I had heard on the radio a few examples of so-called "Computer 
Haiku". Something about them struck me deeply. There was a large ele-
ment of humor and simultaneously mystery to making a computer gener-
ate something which ordinarily would be considered an artistic creation. I 
was highly amused by the humorous aspect, and I was very motivated by 
the mystery--even contradiction-of programming creative acts. So I set 
out to write a program even more mysteriously contradictory and humor-
ous than the haiku program. 
At first I was concerned with making the grammar flexible and recur-
sive, so that one would not have the sense that the program was merely 
filling in the blanks in some template. At about that time I ran across a 
Scientific American article by Victor Yngve in which he described a simple 
but flexible grammar which could produce a wide variety of sentences of 
the type found in some children's books. I modified some of the ideas I'd 
gleaned from that article and came up with a set of procedures which 
formed a Recursive Transition Network grammar, as described in Chapter 
V. In this grammar, the selection of words in a sentence was determined by 
a process which began by selecting--at random-the overall structure of 
the sentence; gradually the decision-making process trickled down through 
lower levels of structure until the word level and the letter level were 
reached. A lot had to be done below the word level, such as inflecting verbs 
and making plurals of nouns; also irregular verb and noun forms were first 
formed regularly, and then if they matched entries in a table, substitutions 
of the proper (irregular) forms were made. As each word reached its final 
form, it was printed out. The program was like the proverbial monkey at a 
typewriter, but operating on several levels of linguistic structure 
simultaneously-not just the letter level. 
In the early stages of developing the program, I used a totally silly 
vocabulary-deliberately, since I wa~ aiming at humor. It produced a lot of 
nonsense sentences, some of which had very complicated structures, others 
of which were rather short. Some excerpts are shown below: 
A male pencil who must laugh clumsily would quack. Must 
program not always crunch girl at memory? The decimal bug 
which spits clumsily might tumble. Cake who does sure take an 
unexpected man within relationship might always dump card. 
Program ought run cheerfully. 
The worthy machine ought not always paste the astronomer. 
Oh, program who ought really run off of the girl writes musi-
cian for theater. The businesslike relationship quacks. 
The lucky girl which can always quack will never sure quack. 
The game quacks. Professor will write pickle. A bug tumbles. Man 
takes the box who slips. 
The effect is strongly surrealistic and at times a little reminiscent of 
620 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

haiku-for example, the final sample of four consecutive short sentences. 
At first it seemed very funny and had a certain charm, but soon it became 
rather stale. After reading a few pages of output one could sense the limits 
of the space in which the program was operating; and after that, seeing 
random points inside that space--even though each one was "new"-was 
nothing new. This is, it seems to me, a general principle: you get bored with 
something not when you have exhausted its repertoire of behavior, but 
when you have mapped out the limits of the space that contains its be-
havior. The behavior space of a person is just about complex enough that it 
can continually surprise other people; but that wasn't true of my program. 
I realized that my goal of producing truly humorous output would require 
that far more subtlety be programmed in. But what, in this case, was meant 
by "subtlety"? It was clear that absurd juxtapositions of words were just too 
unsubtle; I needed a way to ensure that words would be used in accordance 
with the realities of the world. This was where thoughts about representa-
tion of knowledge began to enter the picture. 
From RTN's to ATN's 
The idea I adopted was to classify each word-noun, verb, prepositIOn, 
etc.-in several different "semantic dimensions". Thus, each word was a 
member of classes of various sorts; then there were also superclasses-
classes of classes (reminiscent of the remark by Vlam). In principle, such 
aggregation could continue to any number of levels, but I stopped at two. 
At any given moment, the choice of words was now semantically restricted, 
because it was required that there should be agreement between the various 
parts of the phrase being constructed. The idea was, for instance, that 
certain kinds of acts could be performed only by animate objects; that only 
certain kinds of abstractions could influence events, and so on. The deci-
sions about what categories were reasonable, and whether each category 
was better thought of as a class or a superclass, were quite complicated. All 
words were branded in several different dimensions. Common preposi-
tions-"of", "in", etc.-had several distinct entries, corresponding to their 
distinct usages. 
Now, the output began to be much more 
comprehensible-and for that reason it was funny in a new way. 
A little Turing Test 
Below, I have reproduced nine selections, carefully culled from many 
pages of output from later versions of my program. Along with them are 
three (seriously intended) human-written sentences. Which?

Rather think of a pathway of a 'sequence' of gedankenexper-
iment simpletons where heir-lines are a prima facie case of a 
paradiachronic transitivity.

Think of that as a chain strength possibility of what, eventu-
ally, comes out as a product (epistemic conditions?) and the 
product is not a Frankfurt-ish packing-it-all-in.

Despite the efforts, the reply, if you will, had been supported 
by the Orient; hence a fallacy will thereafter be suspended by 
the attitude which will be being held by the ambassador. 
(5) 
Of course, until the upheavals, the ambassador was slightly 
gradually mollycoddling the rabble. 
(6) 
Supposedly, refined liberty caused the attitudes insofar as 
peace is distilled by the consequences which will not eventu-
ally be caused by the command irrevocably insofar as peace 
of it is sometimes causing the intransigency infinitesimally 
surprisingly.

According to the sophists, the campaigns in the city-states, in 
other words, have been accepted by the Orient cunningly. Of 
course, the Orient has been separated by the states particu-
larly violently. 
The Orient supports the efforts which had been supported 
by mankind. 
(8) 
Admittedly, the hierarchical origin of the fallacy, neverthe-
less, will be prophesied by the enemies of it. By the same 
token, the individualists will have testified that intransigency 
will not have suspended the campaigns. 
(9) 
Needless to say, during the upheaval which will have war-
ranted the secrecy, the replies do not separate the Orient. 
Of course, the countries, ipso facto, are always probing lib-
erty. 
(10) Although a Nobel Prize was being achieved by the humanists, 
yet in addition, it was being achieved by the serf. 
(11) An attitude will often be held by the serfs of a strife-torn 
nation. 
(12) Moreover, the Nobel Prizes will be achieved. By the same 
token, despite the consequence, the Nobel Prizes which will 
be achieved will sometimes be achieved by a woman. 
The human-written sentences are numbers 1 to 3; they were drawn from 
the contemporary journal Art-Language l5 and are-as far as I can tell-
completely serious efforts among literate and sane people to communicate 
something to each other. That they appear here out of context is not too 
misleading, since their proper context sounds just the same as they do. 
622 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

My program produced the rest. Numbers 10 to 12 were chosen to 
show that there were occasional bursts of total lucidity; numbers 7 to 9 are 
more typical of the output, floating in that curious and provocative nether-
world between meaning and no-meaning; and then numbers 4 to 6 pretty 
much transcend meaning. In a generous mood, one could say that they 
stand on their own as pure "language objects", something like pieces of 
abstract sculpture carved out of words instead of stone; alternatively, one 
could say that they are pure pseudointellectual drivel. 
My choice of vocabulary was still aimed at producing humorous ef-
fects. The flavor of the output is hard to characterize. Although much of it 
"makes sense", at least on a single-sentence level, one definitely gets the 
feeling that the output is coming from a source with no understanding of 
what it is saying and no reason to say it. In particular, one senses an utter 
lack of visual imagery behind the words. When I saw such sentences come 
pouring out of the line printer, I experienced complex emotions. I was very 
amused by the silliness of the output. I was also very proud of my achieve-
ment and tried to describe it to friends as similar to giving rules for 
building up meaningful stories in Arabic out of single strokes of the 
pen-an exaggeration, but it pleased me to think of it that way. And lastly I 
was deeply thrilled by the knowledge that this enormously complicated 
machine was shunting around long trains of symbols inside it according to 
rules, and that these long trains of symbols were something like thoughts in 
my own head ... something like them. 
Images of What Thought Is 
Of course I didn't fool myself into thinking that there was a conscious being 
behind those sentences-far from it. Of all people, I was the most aware of 
the reasons that this program was terribly remote from real thought. 
Tesler's Theorem is quite apt here: as soon as this level of language-
handling ability had been mechanized, it was clear that it did not constitute 
intelligence. But this strong experience left me with an image: a glimmer-
ing sense that real thought was composed of much longer, much more 
complicated trains of symbols in the brain-many trains moving simultane-
ously down many parallel and crisscrossing tracks, their cars being pushed 
and pulled, attached and detached, switched from track to track by a 
myriad neural shunting-engines ... 
It was an intangible image which I cannot convey in words, and it was 
only an image. But images and intuitions and motivations lie mingled close 
in the mind, and my utter fascination with this image was a constant spur to 
think more deeply about what thought really could be. I have tried in other 
parts of this book to communicate some of the daughter images of this 
original image-particularly in the Prelude, Ant Fugue. 
What stands out in my mind now, as I look back at this program from 
the perspective of a dozen years, is how there is no sense of imagery behind 
what is being said. The program had no idea what a serf is, what a person is, 
or what anything at all is. The words were empty formal symbols, as empty 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
623 


as-perhaps emptier than-the p and q of the pq-system. My program took 
advantage of the fact that when people read text, they quite naturally tend 
to imbue each word with its full flavor-as if that were necessarily attached 
to the group of letters which form the word. My program could be looked 
at as a formal system, whose "theorems"-the output sentences-had 
ready-made interpretations (at least to speakers of English). But unlike the 
pq-system, these "theorems" were not all true statements when interpreted 
that way. Many were false, many were nonsense. 
In its humble way, the pq-system mirrored a tiny corner of the world. 
But when my program ran, there was no mirror inside it of how the world 
works, except for the small semantic constraints which it had to follow. To 
create such a mirror of understanding, I would have had to wrap each 
concept in layers and layers of knowledge about the world. To do this 
would have been another kind of effort from what I had intended to do. 
Not that I didn't often think of trying to do it-but I never got around to 
trying it out. 
Higher-Level Grammars . .. 
In fact, I often pondered whether I could write an ATN-grammar (or some 
other kind of sentence-producing program) which would only produce true 
sentences about the world. Such a grammar would imbue the words with 
genuine meanings, in the way it happened in the pq-system and in TNT. 
This idea of a language in which false statements are ungrammatical is an 
old one, going back to Johann Amos Comenius, in 1633. It is very appeal-
ing because you have a crystal ball embodied in your grammar: just write 
down the statement you want to know about, and check to see if it is 
grammatical .... Actually, Comenius went even further, for in his language, 
false statements were not only ungrammatical-they were inexpressible! 
Carrying this thought in another direction, you might imagine a high-
level grammar which would produce random koans. Why not? Such a 
grammar would be equivalent to a formal system whose theorems are 
koans. And if you had such a program, could you not arrange it to produce 
only genuine koans? My friend Marsha Meredith was enthusastic about this 
idea of" Artificial Ism", so she tackled the project of writing a koan-writing 
program. One of her early efforts produced this curious quasi-koan: 
A SMALL YOUNG MASTER WANTED A SMALL WHITE GNARLED 
BOWL. "HOW CAN WE LEARN AND UNDERSTAND WITHOUT 
STUDY?" THE YOUNG MASTER ASKED A LARGE CONFUSED MAS-
TER. THE CONFUSED MASTER WALKED FROM A BROWN HARD 
MOUNT AIN TO A WHITE SOFT MOUNTAIN WITH A SMALL RED 
STONY BOWL. THE CONFUSED MASTER SAW A RED SOFT HUT. 
THE CONFUSED MASTER WANTED THE HUT. "WHY DID 
BODHIDHARMA COME INTO CHINA?" THE CONFUSED MASTER

Splendour of Islamic Calligraphy (New York: Riz.z.oli, 1976).] 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
625 

ASKED A LARGE ENLIGHTENED STUDENT. "THE PEACHES ARE 
LARGE", THE STUDENT ANSWERED THE CONFUSED MASTER. 
"HOW CAN WE LEARN AND UNDERSTAND WITHOUT STUDY?" 
THE CONFUSED MASTER ASKED A LARGE OLD MASTER. THE OLD 
MASTER WALKED FROM A WHITE STONY G0025. THE OLD MAS-
TER GOT LOST. 
Your personal decision procedure for koan genuineness probably 
reached a verdict without need of the Geometric Code or the Art of Zen 
Strings. If the lack of pronouns or the unsophisticated syntax didn't arouse 
your suspicions, that strange "G0025" towards the end must have. What is 
it? It is a strange fluke-a manifestation of a bug which caused the program 
to print out, in place of the English word for an object, the program's 
internal name for the "node" (a LISP atom, in fact) where all information 
concerning that particular object was stored. So here we have a "window" 
onto a lower level of the underlying Zen mind-a level that should have 
remained invisible. Unfortunately, we don't have such clear windows onto 
the lower levels of human Zen minds. 
The sequence of actions, though a little arbitrary, comes from a recur-
sive LISP procedure called "CASCADE", which creates chains of actions 
linked in a vaguely causal way to each other. Although the degree of 
comprehension of the world possessed by this koan generator is clearly not 
stupendous, work is in progress to make its output a little more genuine-
seeming. 
Grammars for Music? 
Then there is music. This is a domain which you might suppose, on first 
thought, would lend itself admirably to being codified in. an A TN-
grammar, or some such program. Whereas (to continue this naive line of 
thought) language relies on connect.ions with the outside world for mean-
ing, music is purely formal. There is no reference to things "out there" in 
the sounds of music; there is just pure syntax-note following note, chord 
following chord, measure following measure, phrase following phrase ... 
But wait. Something is wrong in this analysis. Why is some music so 
much deeper and more beautiful than other music? It is because form, in 
music, is expressive--expressive to some strange subconscious regions of 
our minds. The sounds of music do not refer to serfs or city-states, but they 
do trigger clouds of emotion in our innermost selves; in that sense musical 
meaning is dependent on intangible links from the symbols to things in the 
world-those "things", in this case, being secret software structures in our 
minds. No, great music will not come out of such an easy formalism as an 
ATN-grammar. Pseudomusic, like pseudo-fairy tales, may well come 
out-and that will be a valuable exploration for people to make-but the 
secrets of meaning in music lie far, far deeper than pure syntax. 
I should clarify one point here: in principle, ATN-grammars have all 
the power of any programming formalism, so if musical meaning is captur-
626 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

able in any way at all (which I believe it is), it is capturable in an A TN-
grammar. True. But in that case, I maintain, the grammar will be defining 
not just musical structures, but the entire structures of the mind of a 
beholder. The "grammar" will be a full grammar of thought-not just a 
grammar of music. 
Winograd's Program SHRDLU 
What kind of program would it take to make human beings admit that it 
had some "understanding", even if begrudgingly? What would it take 
before you wouldn't feel intuitively that there is "nothing there"? 
In the years 1968-70, Terry Winograd (alias Dr. Tony Earrwig) was a 
doctoral student at MIT, working on the joint problems of language and 
understanding. At that time at MIT, much AI research involved the so-
called blocks world-a relatively simple domain in which problems concern-
ing both vision and language-handling by computer could fit easily. The 
blocks world consists of a table with various kinds of toy-like blocks on 
it-square ones, oblong ones, triangular ones, etc., in various colors. (For a 
"blocks world" of another kind, see Figure 117: the painting Mental Arithme-
tic by Magritte. I find its title singularly appropriate in this context.) The 
vision problems in the MIT blocks world are very tricky: how can a com-
puter figure out, from a TV -scan of a scene with many blocks in it,just what 
kinds of blocks are present, and what their relationships are? Some blocks 
may be perched on top of others, some may be in front of others, there may 
be shadows, and so on. 
FIGURE 117. 
Mental Arithmetic, by Rene Magritte (1931). 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
627 

Winograd's work was separate from the issues of vision, however. 
Beginning with the assumption that the blocks world was well represented 
inside the computer's memory, he confronted the many-faceted problem 
of how to get the computer to: 
(1) 
understand questions in English about the situation; 
(2) 
give answers in English to questions about the situation; 
(3) 
understand requests in English to manipulate the blocks; 
(4) 
break down each request into a sequence of operations it 
could do; 
(5) 
understand what it had done, and for what reasons; 
(6) 
describe its actions and their reasons, in English. 
It might seem reasonable to break up the overall program into modu-
lar subprograms, with one module for each different part of the problem; 
then, after the modules have been developed separately, to integrate them 
smoothly. Winograd found that this strategy of developing independent 
modules posed fundamental difficulties. He developed a radical approach, 
which challenged the theory that intelligence can be compartmentalized 
into independent or semi-independent pieces. His program SHRDLU-
named after the old code "ET AOIN SHRDLU", used by linotype operators 
to mark typos in a newspaper column-did not separate the problem into 
clean conceptual parts. The operations of parsing sentences, producing 
internal representations, reasoning about the world represented inside 
itself, answering questions, and so on, were all deeply and intricately 
meshed together in a procedural representation of knowledge. Some critics 
have charged that his program is so tangled that it does not represent any 
"theory" at all about language, nor does it contribute in any way to our 
insights about thought processes. Nothing could be more wrong than such 
claims, in my opinion. A tour de force such as SHRDLU may not be 
isomorphic to what we do-in fact, in no way should you think that in 
SHRDLU, the "symbol level" has been attained-but the act of creating it 
and thinking about it offers tremendous insight into the way intelligence 
works. 
The Structure of SHRDLU 
In fact, SHRDLU does consist of separate procedures, each of which 
contains some knowledge about the world; but the procedures have such a 
strong interdependency that they cannot be cleanly teased apart. The 
program is like a very tangled knot which resists untangling; but the fact 
that you cannot untangle it does not mean that you cannot understand it. 
There may be an elegant geometrical description of the entire knot even if 
it is physically messy. We could go back to a metaphor from the Mu 
Offering, and compare it to looking at an orchard from a "natural" angle. 
Winograd has written lucidly about SHRDLU. I quote here from his 
article in Schank and Colby's book: 
628 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

One of the basic viewpoints underlying the model is that all language use can 
be thought of as a way of activating procedures within the hearer. We can 
think of any utterance as a program-one that indirectly causes a set of 
operations to be carried out within the hearer's cognitive system. This "pro-
gram writing" is .indirect in the sense that we are dealing with an intelligent 
interpreter, who may take a set of actions which are quite different from those 
the speaker intended. The exact form is determined by his knowledge of the 
world, his expectations about the person talking to him, etc. In this program 
we have a simple version of this process of interpretation as it takes place in 
the robot. Each sentence interpreted by the robot is converted to a set of 
instructions in PLANNER. The program that is created is then executed to 
achieve the desired effect. I6 
PLANNER Facilitates Problem Reduction 
The language PLANNER, referred to here, is an AI language whose 
principal feature is that some of the operations necessary for problem 
reduction are built in-namely, the recursive process of creating a tree of 
subgoals, subsubgoals, etc. What this means is that such processes, instead 
of having to be spelled out time and time again by the programmer, are 
automatically implied by so-called GOAL-statements. Someone who reads a 
PLANNER program will see no explicit reference to such operations; in 
jargon, they are user-transparent. If one path· in the tree fails to achieve the 
desired goal, then the PLANNER program will "backtrack" and try 
another route. "Backtracking" is the magic word as far as PLANNER is 
concerned. 
Winograd's program made excellent use of these features of 
PLANNER-more exactly, of MICROPLANNER, a partial implementa-
tion of the plans for PLANNER. In the past few years, however, people 
with the goal of developing AI have concluded that automatic backtrack-
ing, as in PLANNER, has definite disadvantages, and that it will probably 
not lead to their goal; therefore they have backed off from it, preferring to 
try other routes to AI. 
Let us listen to further comments from Winograd on SHRDLU: 
The definition of every word is a program which is called at an appropriate 
point in the analysis, and which can do arbitrary computations involving the 
sentence and the present physical situation. I7 
Among the examples which Winograd cites is the following: 
The different possibilities for the meaning of "the" are procedures which 
check various facts about the context, then prescribe actions such as "Look for 
a unique object in the data base which fits this description", or "Assert that the 
object being described is unique as far as the speaker is concerned." The 
program incorporates a variety of heuristics for deciding what part of the 
context is relevant. I8 
It is amazing how deep this problem with the word "the" is. It is probably 
safe to say that writing a program which can fully handle the top five words 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 
629 

of English-"the", "of", "and", "a", and "to"-would be equivalent to 
solving the entire problem of AI, and hence tantamount to knowing what 
intelligence and consciousness are. A small digression: the five most com-
mon nouns in English are-according to the Word Frequency Book compiled 
by John B. Carroll et al-"time", "people", "way", "water", and "words" (in 
that order). The amazing thing about this is that most people have no idea 
that we think in such abstract terms. Ask your friends, and 10 to 1 they'll 
guess such words as "man", "house", "car", "dog", and "money". And--
while we're on the subject of frequencies-the top twelve letters in English, 
in order, according to Mergenthaler, are: "ETAOIN SHRDLU". 
One amusing feature of SHRDLU which runs totally against the 
stereotype of computers as "number crunchers" is this fact, pointed out by 
Winograd: "Our system does not accept numbers in numeric form, and has 
only been taught to count to ten."19 With all its mathematical underpin-
ning, SHRDLU is a mathematical ignoramus! Just like Aunt Hillary, 
SHRDLU doesn't know anything about the lower levels which make it up. 
Its knowledge is largely procedural (see particularly the remark by "Dr. 
Tony Earrwig" in section 11 of the previous Dialogue). 
It is interesting to contrast the procedural embedding of knowledge in 
SHRDLU with the knowledge in my sentence-generation program. AU of 
the syntactical knowledge in my program was procedurally embedded in 
Augmented Transition Networks, written in the language Algol; but the 
semantic 
knowledge-the 
information 
about 
semantic 
class 
membership-was static: it was contained in a short list of numbers after 
each word. There were a few words, such as the auxiliary verbs "to be", "to 
have", and others, which were represented totally in procedures in Algol, 
but they were the exceptions. By contrast, in SHRDLU, all words were 
represented as programs. Here is a case which demonstrates that, despite 
the theoretical equivalence of data and programs, in practice the choice of 
one over the other has major consequences. 
Syntax and Semantics 
And now, a few more words from Winograd: 
Our program does not operate by first parsing a sentence, then doing seman-
tic analysis, and finally by using deduction to produce a response. These three 
activities go on concurrently throughout the understanding of a sentence. As 
soon as a piece of syntactic structure begins to take shape, a semantic program 
is called to see whether it might make sense, and the resultant answer can 
direct the parsing. In deciding whether it makes sense, the semantic routine 
may call deductive processes and ask questions about the real world. As an 
example, in sentence 34 of the Dialogue ("Put the blue pyramid on the block 
in the box"), the parser first comes up with "the blue pyramid on the block" as 
a candidate for a noun group. At this point, semantic analysis is done, and 
since "the" is definite, a check is made in the data base for the object being 
referred to. When no such object is found, the parsing is redirected to find 
the noun group "the blue pyramid". It will then go on to find "on the block in 
630 
Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects 

the box" as a single phrase indicating a location ... Thus there is a continuing 
interplay between the different sorts of analysis, with the results of one 
affecting the others. 20 
It is extremely interesting that in natural language, syntax and seman-
tics are so deeply intertwined. Last Chapter, in discussing the elusive 
concept of "form", we had broken the notion into two categories: syntactic 
form, which is detectable by a predictably terminating decision procedure, 
and semantic form, which is not. But here, Winograd is telling us that-at 
least when the usual senses of "syntax" and "semantics" are taken-they 
merge right into each other, in natural language. The external form of a 
sentence-that is, its composition in terms of elementary signs--does not 
divide up so neatly into syntactic and semantic aspects. This is a very 
significant point for linguistics. 
Here are some final comments on SHRDLU by Winograd. 
Let us look at what the system would do with a simple description like "a red 
cube which supports a pyramid". The description will use concepts like 
BLOCK, RED, PYRAMID, and EQUIDIMENSIONAL-all parts of the sys-
FIGURE 118. Procedural representation of "a red cube which supports a pyramid."

(San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1973), p. 172.]

tern's underlying categorization of the world. The result can be represented 
in a flow chart like that in Figure 118. Note that this is a program for finding 
an objeCt fitting the description. It would then be incorporated into a com-
mand for doing something with the object, a question asking something about 
it, or, if it appeared in a statement, it would become part of the program 
which was generated to represent the meaning for later use. Note that this bit 
of program could also be used as a test to see whether an object fit the 
description, if the first FIND instruction were told in advance to look only at 
that particular object. 
At first glance, it seems that there is too much structure in this program, as 
we don't like to think of the meaning of a simple phrase as explicitly contain-
ing loops, conditional tests, and other programming details. The solution is to 
provide an internal language that contains the appropriate looping and 
checking as its primitives, and in which the representation of the process is as 
simple as the description. The program described in Figure 118 would be 
written in PLANNER looking something like what is below: 
(GOAL (IS ?X 1 BLOCK» 
(GOAL (COLOR-OF ?Xl RED» 
(GOAL (EQUIDIMENSIONAL ?Xl» 
(GOAL (IS ?X2 PYRAMID» 
(GOAL (SUPPORT ?Xl ?X2» 
The loops of the flowchart are implicit in PLANNER'S backtrack control 
structure. The description is evaluated by proceeding down the list until some 
goal fails, at which time the system backs up automatically to the last point 
where a decision was made, trying a different possibility. A decision can be 
made whenever a new object name or VARIABLE (indicated by the prefix 
"?") such as "?Xl" or "?X2" appears. The variables are used by the pattern 
matcher. If they have already been assigned to a particular item, it checks to 
see whether the GOAL is true for that item. If not, it checks for all possible 
items which satisfy the GOAL, by choosing one, and then taking successive 
ones whenever backtracking occurs to that point. Thus, even the distinction 
between testing and choosing is implicit.21 
One significant strategy decision in devising this program was to not 
translate all the way from English into LISP, but only partway-into 
PLANNER. Thus (since the PLANNER interpreter is itself written in 
LISP), a new intermediate level-PLANNER-was inserted between the 
top-level language (English) and the bottom-level language (machine lan-
guage). Once a PLANNER program had been made from an English 
sentence fragment, then it could be sent off to the PLANNER interpreter, 
and the higher levels ofSHRDLU would be freed up, to work on new tasks. 
This kind of decision constantly crops up: How many levels should a 
system have? How much and what kind of "intelligence" should be placed 
on which level? These are some of t.he hardest problems facing AI today. 
Since we know so little about natural intelligence, it is hard for us to figure 
out which level of an artificially intelligent system should carry out what 
part of a task. 
This gives you a glimpse behind the scenes of the Dialogue preceding 
this Chapter. Next Chapter, we shall meet new and speculative ideas for 
AI.

Contrafactus 
The Crab has invited a small group of friends over to watch the Saturday 
afternoon football game on television. Achilles has already arrived, but the 
Tortoise and his friend the Sloth are still awaited. 
Achilles: 
Could that be our friends, a-riding up on that unusual one-
wheeled vehicle? 
(The Sloth and Tortoise dismount and come in.) 
Crab: 
Ah, my friends, I'm so glad you could make it. May I present myoid 
and beloved acquaintance, Mr. Sloth-and this is Achilles. I believe 
you know the Tortoise. 
Sloth: 
This is the first time I can recall making the acquaintance of a 
Bicyclops. Pleased to meet you, Achilles. I've heard many fine things 
said about the bicyclopean species. 
Achilles: 
Likewise, I'm sure. May I ask about your elegant vehicle? 
Tortoise: 
Our tandem u·nicycle, you mean? Hardly elegant. It's just a way 
for two to get from A to B, at the same speed. 
Sloth: 
It's built by a company that also makes teeter-teeters. 
Achilles: 
I see, I see. What is that knob on it? 
Sloth: 
That's the gearshift. 
Achilles: 
Aha! And how many speeds does it have? 
Tortoise: 
One, including reverse. Most models have fewer, but this is a 
special model. 
Achilles: 
It looks like a very nice tandem unicycle. Oh, Mr. Crab, I wanted 
to tell you how much I enjoyed hearing your orchestra perform last 
night. 
Crab: 
Thank you, Achilles. Were you there by any chance, Mr. Sloth? 
Sloth: 
No, I couldn't make it, I'm sad to say. I was participating in a mixed 
singles ping-ping tournament. It was quite exciting because my team 
was involved in a one-way tie for first place. 
Achilles: 
Did you win anything? 
Sloth: 
Certainly did-a two-sided Mobius strip made out of copper; it is 
silver-plated on one side, and gold-plated on the other. 
. 
Crab: 
Congratulations, Mr. Sloth. 
Sloth: 
Thank you. Well, do tell me about the concert. 
Crab: 
It was a most enjoyable performance. We played some pieces by the 
Bach twins-
Sloth: 
The famous Joh and Sebastian? 
Crab: 
One and the same. And there was one work that made me think of 
you, Mr. Sloth-a marvelous piano concerto for two left hands. The 
Contrafactus 
633 

next-to-Iast (and only) movement was a one-voice fugue. You can't 
imagine its intricacies. For our finale, we played Beethoven's Ninth 
Zenfunny. At the end, everyone in the audience rose and clapped with 
one hand. It was overwhelming. 
Sloth: 
Oh, I'm sorry I missed it. But do you suppose it's been recorded? At 
home I have a fine hi-fi to play it on-the best two-channel monaural 
system money can buy. 
Crab: 
I'm sure you can find it somewhere. Well, my friends, the game is 
about to begin. 
Achilles: 
Who is playing today, Mr. Crab? 
Crab: 
I believe it's Home Team versus Visitors. Oh, no-that was last 
week. I think this week it's Out-of-Towners. 
Achilles: 
I'm rooting for Home Team. I always do. 
Sloth: 
Oh, how conventional. I never root for Home Team. The closer a 
team lives to the antipodes, the more I root for it. 
Achilles: 
Oh, so you live in the Antipodes? I'vtj heard it's charming to live 
there, but I wouldn't want to visit them. They're so far away. 
Sloth: 
And the strange thing about them is that they don't get any closer 
no matter which way you traveL 
Tortoise: 
That's my kind of place. 
Crab: 
It's game time. I think I'll turn on the TV. 
(He walks over to an enormous cabinet with a screen, underneath which is 
an instrument panel as complicated as that of a jet airplane. He flicks a 
knob, and the football stadium appears in bright vivid color on the screen.) 
Announcer: 
Good afternoon, fans. Well, it looks like that time of year has 
rolled around again when Home Team and Out-of-Town face each 
other on the gridiron and play Ollt their classic pigskin rivalry. It's been 
drizzling on and off this afternoon, and the field's a little wet, but 
despite the weather it promises to be a fine game, especially with that 
GREAT pair of eighth-backs playing for Home Team, Tedzilliger and 
Palindromi. And now, here's Pilipik, kicking off for Home Team. It's 
in the air! Flampson takes it for Out-of-Towners, and runs it back-
he's to the 20, the 25, the 30, and down at the 32. That was Mool in on 
the tackle for Home Team. 
Crab: 
A superb runback! Did you see how he was ALMOST tackled by 
Quilker-but somehow broke away? 
Sloth: 
Oh, don't be silly, Crab. Nothing of the kind happened. Quilker did 
NOT tackle Flampson. There's no need to confuse poor Achilles (or the 
rest of us) with hocus-pocus about what "almost" happened. It's a 
fact-with no "almost" 's, "if" 's, "and" 's, or "but" 'So 
Announcer: 
Here's the instant replay. Just watch number 79, Quilker, 
come in from the side, surprising Flampson, and just about tackle him! 
Sloth: 
"Just about"! Bah! 
Achilles: 
Such a graceful maneuver! What would we do without instant 
replays? 
634 
Contrafactus 

Announcer: 
It's first down and 10 for Out-of-Town. Noddle takes the ball, 
hands off to Orwix-it's a reverse-Orwix runs around to the right, 
handing off to Flampson-a double reverse, folks!-and now 
Flampson hands it to Treefig, who's downed twelve yards behind 
scrimmage. A twelve-yard loss on a triple reverse! 
Sloth: 
I love it! A sensational play! 
Achilles: 
But, Mr. S, I thought you were rooting for Out-of-Town. They 
lost twelve yards on the play. 
Sloth: 
They did? Oh, well-who cares, as long as it was a beautiful play? 
Let's see it again. 
( ... and so the first half of the game passes. Towards the end of the third 
quarter, a particularly crucial play comes up for Home Team. They are 
behind by eight points. It's third down and 10, and they badly need afirst 
down.) 
Announcer: The ball is hiked to Tedzilliger, who fades back, looking for a 
receiver, and fakes to Quilker. There's Palindromi, playing wide right, 
with nobody near him. Tedzilliger spots him and fires a low pass to 
him. Palindromi snatches it out of the air, and- (There is an audible 
groan from the crowd.)--oh, he steps out of bounds! What a crushing 
blow for Home Team, folks! If Palindromi hadn't stepped out of 
bounds, he could've run all the way to the end zone for a touchdown! 
Let's watch the subjunctive instant replay. 
(And on the screen the same lineup appears as before.) 
The ball is hiked to Tedzilliger, who fades back, looking for a receiver, 
and fakes to Quilker. There's Palindromi, playing wide right, with 
nobody near him. Tedzilliger spots him, and fires a low pass to him. 
Palindromi snatches it out of the air, and- (There is an audible gasp from 
the crowd.)-he almost steps out of bounds! But he's still in bounds, and 
it's clear all the way to the end zone! Palindromi streaks in, for a 
touchdown for Home Team! (The stadium breaks into a giant roar of 
approval.) Well, folks, that's what would've happened if Palindromi 
hadn't stepped out of bounds. 
Achilles: 
Wait a minute ... WAS there a touchdown, or WASN'T there? 
Crab: 
Oh, no. That was just the subjunctive instant replay. They simply 
followed a hypothetical a little way out, you know. 
Sloth: 
That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of! Next thing you 
know, they'll be inventing concrete earmuffs. 
Tortoise: 
Subjunctive instant replays are a little unusual, aren't they? 
Crab: 
Not particularly, if you have a Subjunc-TV. 
Achilles: 
Is that one grade below a junk TV? 
Crab: 
Not at all! It's a new kind of TV, which can go into the subjunctive 
mode. They're particularly good for football games and such. Ijust got 
mine. 
Achilles: 
Why does it have so many knobs and fancy dials? 
Contrafactus 
635 

Crab: 
So that you can tune it to the proper channel. There are many 
channels broadcasting in the subjunctive mode, and you want to be 
able to select from them easily. 
Achilles: 
Could you show us what you mean? I'm afraid I don't quite 
understand what all this talk of "broadcasting in the subjunctive mode" 
is about. 
Crab: 
Oh, it's quite simple, really. You can figure it out yourself. I'm going 
into the kitchen to fix some French fries, which I know are Mr. Sloth's 
weakness. 
Sloth: 
Mmmmm! Go to it, Crab! French fries are my favorite food. 
Crab: 
What about the rest of you? 
Tortoise: 
I could devour a few. 
Achilles: 
Likewise. But wait-before you go into the kitchen, is there some 
trick to using your Subjunc-TV' 
Crab: 
Not particularly. Just continue watching the game, and whenever 
there's a near miss of some sort, or whenever you wish things had gone 
differently in some way, just fiddle with the dials, and see what hap-
pens. You can't do it any harm, though you may pick up some exotic 
channels. (And he disappears into the kitchen.) 
Achilles: 
I wonder what he means by that. Oh well, let's get back to this 
game. I was quite wrapped up in it. 
Announcer: 
It's fourth down for Out-of-Town, with Home Team receiv-
ing. Out-of-Town is in punt formation, with Tedzilliger playing deep. 
Orwix is back to kick-and he gets a long high one away. It's coming 
down near Tedzilliger-
Achilles: 
Grab it, Tedzilliger! Give those Out-of-Towners a run for their 
money! 
Announcer: -and lands in a puddle-KERsPLOSH! It takes a weird bounce! 
Now Sprunk is madly scrambling for the ball! It looks like it just barely 
grazed Tedzilliger on the bounce, and then slipped away from him-
it's ruled a fumble. The referee is signaling that the formidable Sprunk 
has recovered for Out-of-Town on the Home Team 7! It's a bad break 
for Home Team. Oh, well, thafs the way the cookie crumbles. 
Achilles: 
Oh, no! If only it hadn't been raining ... (Wrings his hands in 
despair.) 
Sloth: 
ANOTHER of those confounded hypotheticals! Why are the rest of 
you always running off into your absurd worlds of fantasy? If I were 
you, I would stay firmly grounded in reality. "No subjunctive non-
sense" is my motto. And I wouldn't abandon it even if someone offered 
me a hundred-nay, a hundred and twelve-French fries. 
Achilles: 
Say, that gives me an idea. Maybe by suitably fiddling with these 
knobs, I can conjure up a subjunctive instant replay in which it isn't 
raining, there's no puddle, no weird bounce, and Tedzilliger doesn't 
fumble. I wonder ... (Walks up to the Subjunc-TV and stares at it.) But I 
haven't any idea what these different knobs do. (Spins a few at random.) 
Announcer: 
It's fourth down for Out-of-Town, with Home Team receiv-

Contrafactus 

ing. Out-of-Town is in punt formation, with Tedzilliger playing deep. 
Orwix is back to kick-and he gets a long high one away. It's coming 
down near Tedzilliger-
Achilles: 
Grab it, Tedzilliger! Give those Out-of-Towners a run for their 
money! 
Announcer: -and lands in a puddle-KERsPLOSH! Oh-it bounces right 
into his arms! Now Sprunk is madly scrambling after him, but he's got 
good blocking, and he steers his way clear of the formidable Sprunk, 
and now he's got an open field ahead of him. Look at that, folks! He's 
to the 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, the lO-touchdown, Home Team! 
(Huge cheers from the Home Team side.) Well, fans, that's how it would 
have gone, if footballs were spheres instead of oblate spheroids! But in 
reality, Home Team loses the ball, and Out-of-Towners take over on 
the Home Team 7-yard line. Oh, well, that's the way the ball bounces. 
Achilles: 
What do you think of THAT, Mr. Sloth? 
(And Achilles gives a smirk in the direction of the Sloth, but the latter is 
completely oblivious to its devastating effect, as he is busy watching the 
Crab arrive with a large platter with a hundred and twelve--1lO,y, a 
hundred-large and delicious French fries, and napkins for all.) 
Crab: 
So how do you three find my Subjunc-TV? 
Sloth: 
Most disappointing, Crab, to be quite frank. It seems to be badly out 
of order. It makes pointless excursions into nonsense at least half the 
time. If it belonged to me, I would give it away immediately to some-
one like you, Crab. But of course it doesn't belong to me. 
Achilles: 
It's quite a strange device. I tried to rerun a play to see how it 
would have gone under different weather conditions, but the thing 
seems to have a will of its own! Instead of changing the weather, it 
changed the football shape to ROUND instead of FOOTBALL-SHAPED! 
Now tell me-how can a football not be shaped like a football? That's a 
contradiction in terms. How preposterous! 
Crab: 
Such tame games! I thought you'd surely find more interesting 
subjunctives. How would you like to see how the last play would have 
looked if the game had been baseball instead of football? 
Tortoise: 
Oh! An outstanding idea! 
(The Crab twiddles two knobs, and steps back.) 
Announcer: There are four away, and-
Achilles: 
FOUR away!? 
Announcer: 
That's right, fans-four away. When you turn football into 
baseball, SOMETHING's got to give! Now as I was about to say, there are 
four away, with Out~of-Town in the field, and Home Team up. Tedzil-
liger is at bat. Out-of-Town is in bunt formation. Orwix raises his arm 
to pitch-and he gets a long high ball away. It's heading straight for 
T edzilliger-
Achilles: 
Smash it, Tedzilliger! Give those Out-of-Towners a home run for 
their money! 
Contrajactus 
637 

Announcer: -but it seems to be a spitball, as it takes a strange curve. Now 
Sprunk is madly scrambling for the ball! It looks like it just barely 
grazed Tedzilliger's bat, then bounced off it-it's ruled a fiy ball. The 
umpire is signaling that the formidable Sprunk has caught it for 
Out-of-Town, to end the seventh inning. It's a bad break for Home 
Team. That's how the last play would have looked, football fans, if this 
had been a game of baseball. 
Sloth: 
Bah! You might as well transport this game to the Moon. 
Crab: 
No sooner said than done! Just a twiddle here, a twiddle there ... 
(On the screen there appears a desolate crater-pitted field, with two teams in 
space suits facing each other, immoblle. All at once, the two teams fly into 
motion, and the players are making great bounds into the air, sometimes 
over the heads of other players. The ball is thrown into the air, and sails so 
high that it almost disappears, and then slowly comes floating down into the 
arms of one space-suited player, roughly a quarter-mile from where it was 
released.) 
Announcer: 
And there, friends, you have the subjunctive instant replay as 
it would have happened on the Moon. We'll be right back after this 
important commercial message from the friendly folks who brew 
Glumpf Beer-my favorite kind of beer! 
Sloth: If I weren't so lazy, I would take that broken TV back to the dealer 
myself! But alas, it's my fate to be a lazy Sloth ... (Helps himself to a large 
gob of French fries.) 
Tortoise: 
That's a marvelous invention, Mr. Crab. May I suggest a 
hypothetical? 
Crab: 
Of course! 
Tortoise: 
What would that last play have looked like if space were four-
dimensional? 
Crab: 
Oh, that's a complicated one, Mr. T, but I believe I can code it into 
the dials. Just a moment. 
(He steps up, and,Jor the first time, appears to be using the full power of 
the control panel if his Subjunc-TV, turning almost every knob two or 
three times, and carefully checking various meters. Then he steps back with 
a satisfied expression on his face.) 
I think this should do it. 
Announcer: 
And now let's watch the subjunctive instant replay. 
638 
(A confusing array of twisted pipes appears on the screen. It grows larger, 
then smaller, and for a moment seems to do something akin to rotation. 
Then it turns into a strange mushroom-shaped object, and back to a bunch 
if pipes. As it metamorphoses from this into other biz.arre shapes, the 
annnouncer gives his commmentary.) 
Tedzilliger's fading back to pass. He spots Palindromi ten yards 
outfield, and passes it to the right and outwards-it looks good! Palin-
dromi's at the 35-yard plane, the 40, and he's tackled on his own 
Contrafactus 

43-yard plane. And there you have it, 3-D fans, as it would've looked if 
football were played in four spatial dimensions. 
Achilles: 
What is it you are doing, Mr. Crab, when you twirl these various 
dials on the control panel? 
Crab: 
I am selecting the proper subjunctive channel. You see, there are all 
sorts of subjunctive channels broadcasting simultaneously, and I want 
to tune in precisely that one which represents the kind of hypothetical 
which has been suggested. 
Achilles: 
Can you do this on any TV? 
Crab: 
No, most TV's can't receive subjunctive channels. They require a 
special kind of circuit which is quite difficult to make. 
Sloth: 
How do you know which channel is broadcasting what? Do you look 
it up in the newspaper? 
Crab: 
I don't need to know the channel's call letters. Instead, I tune it in 
by coding, in these dials, the hypothetical situation which I want to be 
represented. Technically, this is called "addressing a channel by its 
counterfactual parameters". There are always a large number of 
channels broadcasting every conceivable world. All the channels which 
carry worlds that are "near" to each other have call letters that are near 
to each other, too. 
Tortoise: 
Why did you not have to turn the dials at all, the first time we saw 
a subjunctive instant replay? 
Crab: 
Oh, that was because I was tuned in to a channel which is very near 
to the Reality Channel, but ever so slightly off. So every once in a while, 
it deviates from reality. It's nearly impossible to tune EXACTLY into the 
Reality Channel. But that's all right, because it's so dull. All their 
instant replays are straight! Can you imagine? What a bore! 
Sloth: 
I find the whole idea ofSubjunc-TV's one giant bore. But perhaps I 
could change my mind, if I had some evidence that your machine here 
could handle an INTERESTING counterfactual. For example, how 
would that last play have looked if addition were not commutative? 
Crab: 
Oh me, oh my! That change is a little too radical, I'm afraid, for this 
model. I unfortunately don't have a Superjunc-TV, which is the top of 
the line. Superjunc-TV's can handle ANYTHING you throw at them. 
Sloth: 
Bah! 
Crab: 
But look-I can do ALMOST as well. Wouldn't you like to see how 
the last play would have happened if 13 were not a prime number? 
Sloth: 
No thanks! THAT doesn't make any sense! Anyway, if I were the last 
play, I'd be getting pretty tired of being trotted out time and again in 
new garb for the likes of you fuzzy-headed concept-slippers. Let's get 
on with the game! 
Achilles: 
Where did you get this Subjunc-TV, Mr. Crab? 
Crab: 
Believe it or not, Mr. Sloth and I went to a country fair the other 
evening, and it was offered as the first prize in a lottery. Normally I 
don't indulge in such frivolity, but some crazy impulse grabbed me, 
and I bought one ticket. 
Contrafactus 
639 

Achilles: 
What about you, Mr. Sloth? 
Sloth: 
I admit, I bought one, just to humor old Crab. 
Crab: 
And when the winning number was announced, I found, to my 
amazement, that I'd won the lottery! 
Achilles: 
Fantastic! I've never known anyone who won anything in a lot-
tery before! 
Crab: 
I was flabbergasted at my good fortune. 
Sloth: 
Don't you have something else to tell us about that lottery, Crab? 
Crab: 
Oh, nothing much. It's just that my ticket number was 129. Now 
when they announced the winning number, it was 128-just one off. 
Sloth: 
So you see, he actually didn't win it at all. 
Achilles: 
He ALMOST won, though ... 
Crab: 
I prefer to say that I won it, you see. For I came so terribly close ... 
If my number had been only one smaller, I would have won. 
Sloth: 
But unfortunately, Crab, a miss is as good as a mile. 
Tortoise: 
Or as bad. What about you, Mr. Sloth? What was your number? 
Sloth: 
Mine was 256-the next power of 2 above 128. Surely, that counts 
as a hit, if anything does! I can't understand why, however, those fair 
officials-those UNfair officials-were so thickheaded about it. They 
refused to award me my fully deserved prize. Some other joker 
claimed HE deserved it, because his number was 128. I think my 
number was far closer than HIS, but you can't fight City Hall. 
Achilles: 
I'm all confused. If you didn't win the Subjunc-TV after all, Mr. 
Crab, then how can we have been sitting here all afternoon watching 
it? It seems as if we ourselves have been living in some sort ofhypothet-
ical world that would have been, had circumstances just been ever so 
slightly different ... 
Announcer: 
And that, folks, was how the afternoon at Mr. Crab's would 
have been spent, had he won the Subjunc-TV. But since he didn't, the 
four friends simply spent a pleasant afternoon watching Home Team 
get creamed, 128-0. Or was it 256-0? Oh well, it hardly matters, in 
five-dimensional Plutonian steam hockey.

CHAPTER XIX 
Artificial Intelligence: 
Prospects 
"Almost" Situations and Subjunctives 
AFTER READING Contrafactus, a friend said to me, "My uncle was almost 
President of the U.S.!" "Really?" I said. "Sure," he replied, "he was skipper 
of the PT 108." Oohn F. Kennedy was skipper of the PT 109.) 
That is what Contrifactus is all about. In everyday thought, we are 
constantly manufacturing mental variants on situations we face, ideas we 
have, or events that happen, and we let some features stay exactly the same 
while others "slip". What features do we let slip? What ones do we not even 
consider letting slip? What events are perceived on some deep intuitive 
level as being close relatives of ones which really happened? What do we 
think "almost" happened or "could have" happened, even though it unam-
biguously did not? What alternative versions of events pop without any 
conscious thought into our minds when we hear a story? Why do some 
counterfactuals strike us as "less counterfactual" than other counterfactu-
als? After all, it is obvious that anything that didn't happen didn't happen. 
There aren't degrees of "didn't-happen-ness". And the same goes for 
"almost" situations. There are times when one plaintively says, "It almost 
happened", and other times when one says the same thing, full of relief. 
But the "almost" lies in the mind, not in the external facts. 
Driving down a country road, you run into a swarm of bees. You don't 
just duly take note of it; the whole situation is immediately placed in 
perspective by a swarm of "replays" that crowd into your mind. Typically, 
you think, "Sure am lucky my window wasn't open!"--or worse, the re-
verse: "Too bad my window wasn't closed!" "Lucky I wasn't on my bike!" 
"Too bad I didn't come along five seconds earlier." Strange but possible 
replays: "If that had been a deer, I could have been killed!" "I bet those 
bees would have rather had a collision with a rosebush." Even stranger 
replays: "Too bad those bees weren't dollar bills!" "Lucky ~hose bees 
weren't made of cement!" "Too bad it wasn't just one bee instead of a 
swarm." "Lucky I wasn't the swarm instead of being me." What slips 
naturally and what doesn't-and why? 
In a recent issue of The New Yorker magazine, the following excerpt 
from the "Philadelphia Welcomat" was reprinted:! 
If Leonardo da Vinci had been born a female the ceiling of the 
Sistine Chapel might never have been painted. 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
641 

The New Yorker commented: 
And if Michelangelo had been Siamese twins, the work would 
have been completed in half the time. 
The point of The New Yorker's comment is not that such counterfactuals are 
false; it is more that anyone who would entertain such an idea-anyone who 
would "slip" the sex or number of a given human being-would have to be 
a little loony. Ironically, though, in the same issue, the following sentence, 
concluding a book review, was printed without blushing: 
I think he [Professor Philipp Frank] would have enjoyed both of 
these books enormously.2 
Now poor Professor Frank is dead; and clearly it is nonsense to suggest that 
someone could read books written after his death. So why wasn't this 
serious sentence also scoffed at? Somehow, in some difficult-to-pin-down 
sense, the parameters slipped in this sentence do not violate our sense of 
"possibility" as much as in the earlier examples. Something allows us to 
imagine "all other things being equal" better in this one than in the others. 
But why? What is it about the way we classify events and people that makes 
us know deep down what is "sensible" to slip, and what is "silly"? 
Consider how natural it feels to slip from the valueless declarative "I 
don't know Russian" to the more charged conditional "I would like to know 
Russian" to the emotional subjunctive "I wish I knew Russian" and finally to 
the rich counterfactual "If I knew Russian, I would read Chekhov and 
Lermontov in the original". How flat and dead would be a mind that saw 
nothing in a negation but an opaque barrier! A live mind can see a window 
onto a world of possibilities. 
I believe that "almost" situations and unconsciously manufactured 
subjunctives represent some of the richest potential sources of insight into 
how human beings organize and categorize their perceptions of the world. 
An eloquent co-proponent of this view is the linguist and translator George 
Steiner, who, in his book After Babel, has written: 
Hypotheticals, 'imaginaries', conditionals, the syntax of counter-factuality and 
contingency may well be the generative centres of human speech .... [They] 
do more than occasion philosophical and grammatical perplexity. No less 
than future tenses to which they are, one feels, related, and with which they 
ought probably to be classed in the larger set of , sup positiona Is' or 'alternates', 
these 'if' propositions are fundamental to the dynamics of human feeling .... 
Ours is the ability, the need, to gainsay or 'un-say' the world, to image and 
speak it otherwise .... We need a word which will designate the power, the 
compulsion of language to posit 'otherness' .... Perhaps 'alternity' will do: to 
define the 'other than the case', the counter-factual propositions, images, 
shapes of will and evasion with which we charge our mental being and by 
means of which we build the changing, largely fictive milieu of our somatic 
and our social existence .... 
Finally, Steiner sings a counterfactual hymn to counterfactuality: 
642 
ArtifiCial Intelligence: Prospects 

It is unlikely that man, as we know him, would have survived without the 
fictive, counter-factual, anti-determinist means of language, without the 
semantic capacity, generated and stored in the 'superfluous' zones of the 
cortex, to conceive of, to articulate possibilities beyond the treadmill of or-
ganic decay and death.3 
The manufacture of "subjunctive worlds" happens so casually, so 
naturally, that we hardly notice what we are doing. We select from our 
fantasy a world which is close, in some internal mental sense, to the real 
world. We compare what is real with what we perceive as almost real. In so 
doing, what we gain is some intangible kind of perspective on reality. The 
Sloth is a droll example of a variation on reality-a thinking being without 
the ability to slip into subjunctives (or at least, who claims to be without the 
ability-but you may have noticed that what he says is full of counterfactu-
als!). Think how immeasurably poorer our mental lives would be if we 
didn't have this creative capacity for slipping out of the midst of reality into 
soft "what if" 'sl And from the point of view of studying human thought 
processes, this slippage is very interesting, for most of the time it happens 
completely without conscious direction, which means that observation of 
what kinds of things slip, versus what kinds don't, affords a good window 
on the unconscious mind. 
One way to gain some perspective on the nature of this mental metric 
is to "fight fire with fire". This is done in the Dialogue, where our "subjunc-
tive ability" is asked to imagine a world in which the very notion of 
subjunctive ability is slipped, compared to what we expect. In the Dialogue, 
the first subjunctive instant replay-that where Palindromi stays in 
bounds-is quite a normal thing to imagine. In fact, it was inspired by a 
completely ordinary, casual remark made to me by a person sitting next to 
me at a football game. For some reason it struck me and I wondered what 
made it seem so natural to slip that particular thing, but not, say, the 
number of the down, or the present score. From those thoughts, I went on 
to consider other, probably less slippable features, such as the weather 
(that's in the Dialogue), the kind of game (also in the Dialogue), and then 
even loonier variations (also in the Dialogue). I noticed, though, that what 
was completely ludicrous to slip in one situation could be quite slippable in 
another. For instance, sometimes you might spontaneously wonder how 
things would be if the ball had a different shape (e.g., if you are playing 
basketball with a half-inflated ball); other times that would never enter your 
mind (e.g., when watching a football game on TV). 
Layers of Stability 
It seemed to me then, and still does now, that the slippability of a feature of 
some event (or circumstance) depends on a set of nested contexts in which 
the event (or circumstance) is perceived to occur. The terms constant, 
parameter, and variable, borrowed from mathematics, seem useful here. 
Often mathematicians, physicists, and others will carry out a calculation, 
saying "c is a constant, p is a parameter, and v is a variable". What they 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
643 

mean is that any of them can vary (including the "constant"); however, 
there is a kind of hierarchy of variability. In the situation which is being 
represented by the symbols, c establishes a global condition; p establishes 
some less global condition which can vary while c is held fixed; and finally, 
v can run around while c and p are held fixed. It makes little sense to think 
of holding v fixed while c and p vary, for c and p establish the context in 
which v has meaning. For instance, think of a dentist who has a list of 
patients, and for each patient, a list of teeth. It makes perfect sense (and 
plenty of money) to hold the patient fixed and vary his teeth-but it makes 
no sense at all to hold one tooth fixed and vary the patient. (Although 
sometimes it makes good sense to vary the dentist ... ) 
We build up our mental representation of a situation layer by layer. 
The lowest layer establishes the deepest aspect of the context-sometimes 
being so low that it cannot vary at all. For instance, the three-dimensionality 
of our world is so ingrained that most of us never would imagine letting it 
slip mentally. It is a constant constant. Then there are layers which establish 
temporarily, though not permanently, fixed aspects of situations, which 
could be called background assumptions--things which, in the back of your 
mind, you know can vary, but which most of the time you unquestioningly 
accept as unchanging aspects. These could still be called "constants". For 
instance, when you go to a football game, the rules of the game are 
constants of that sort. Then there are "parameters": you think of them as 
more variable, but you temporarily hold them constant. At a football game, 
parameters might include the weather, the opposing team, and so forth. 
There could be-and probably are-several layers of parameters. Finally, 
we reach the "shakiest" aspects of your mental representation of the 
situation-the variables. These are things such as Palindromi's stepping out 
of bounds, which are mentally "loose" and which you don't mind letting slip 
away from their real values, for a short moment. 
Frames and Nested Contexts 
The word frame is in vogue in AI currently, and it could be defined as 
a computational instantiation of a context. The term is due to Marvin Minsky, as 
are many ideas about frames, though the general concept has been floating 
around for a good number of years. In frame language, one could say that 
mental representations of situations involve frames nested within each 
other. Each of the various ingredients of a situation has its own frame. It is 
interesting to verbalize explicitly one of my mental images concerning 
nested frames. Imagine a large collection of chests of drawers. When you 
choose a chest, you have a frame, and the drawer holes are places where 
"subframes" can be attached. But subframes are themselves chests of draw-
ers. How can you stick a whole chest of drawers into the slot for a single 
drawer in another chest of drawers? Easy: you shrink and distort the 
second chest, since, after all, this is all mental, not physical. Now in the 
outer frame, there may be several different drawer slots that need to be 
644 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

filled; then you may need to fill slots in some of the inner chests of drawers 
(or subframes). This can go on, recursively. 
The vivid surrealistic image of squishing and bending a chest of draw-
ers so that it can fit into a slot of arbitrary shape is probably quite impor-
tant, because it hints that your concepts are squished and bent by the 
contexts you force them into. Thus, what does your concept of "person" 
become when the people you are thinking about are football players? It 
certainly is a distorted concept, one which is forced on you by the overall 
context. You have stuck the "person" frame into a slot in the "football 
game" frame. The theory of representing knowledge in frames relies on 
the idea that the world consists of quasi-dosed subsystems, each of which 
can serve as a context for others without being too disrupted, or creating 
too much disruption, in the process. 
One of the main ideas about frames is that each frame comes with its 
own set of expectations. The corresponding image is that each chest of 
drawers comes with a built-in, but loosely bound, drawer in each of its 
drawer slots, called a default. If I tell you, "Picture a river bank", you will 
invoke a visual image which has various features, most of which you could 
override if I added extra phrases such as "ip a drought" or "in Brazil" or 
"without a merry-go-round". The existence of default values for slots 
allows the recursive process of filling slots to come to an end. In effect, you 
say, "I will fill in the slots myself as far as three layers down; beyond that I 
will take the default options." Together with its default expectations, a 
frame contains knowledge of its limits of applicability, and heuristics for 
switching to other frames in case it has been stretched beyond its limits of 
tolerance. 
The nested structure of a frame gives you a way of "zooming in" and 
looking at small details from as dose up as you wish: you just zoom in on 
the proper subframe, and then on one of its subframes, etc., until you have 
the desired amount of detail. It is like having a road atlas of the USA which 
has a map of the whole country in the front, with individual state maps 
inside, and even maps of cities and some of the larger towns if you want still 
more detail. One can imagine an atlas with arbitrary amounts of detail, 
going down to single blocks, houses, rooms, etc. It is like looking through a 
telescope with lenses of different power; each lens has its own uses. It is 
important that one can make use of all the different scales; often detail is 
irrelevant and even distracting. 
Because arbitrarily different frames can be stuck inside other frames' 
slots, there is great potential for conflict or "collision". The nice neat 
scheme of a single, global set of layers of "constants", "parameters", and 
"variables" is an oversimplification. In fact, each frame will have its own 
hierarchy of variability, and this is what makes analyzing how we perceive 
such a complex event as a football game, with its many subframes, subsub-
frames, etc., an incredibly messy operation. How do all these many frames 
interact with each other? If there is a conflict where one frame says, "This 
item is a constant" but another frame says, "No, it is a variable!", how does it 
get resolved? These are deep and difficult problems of frame theory to, 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
645 

which I can give no answers. There has as yet been no complete agreement 
on what a frame really is, or on how to implement frames in AI programs. I 
make my own stab at discussing some of these questions in the following 
section, where I talk about some puzzles in visual pattern recognition, 
which I call "Bongard problems". 
Bongard Problems 
Bongard problems (BP's) are problems of the general type given by the 
Russian scientist M. Bongard in his book Pattern Recognition. A typical 
BP-number 51 in his collection of one hundred-is shown in Figure 119.

FIGURE 119. Bongard problem 51. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition (Rochelle Park, 
N.].: Hayden Book Co., Spartan Books, 1970).] 
These fascinating problems are intended for pattern-recognizers, whether 
human or machine. (One might also throw in ETI's--extraterrestrial intel-
ligences.) Each problem consists of twelve boxed figures (henceforth called 
boxes): six on the left, forming Class I, and six on the right, forming Class II. 
The boxes may be indexed this way: 
I-A 
I-B 
I-C 
I-D 
I-E 
I-F 
II-A II-B 
II-C 
II-D 
II-E 
II-F 
The problem is "How do Class I boxes differ from Class II boxes?" 
A Bongard problem-solving program would have several stages, in 
which raw data gradually get converted into descriptions. The early stages 
are relatively inflexible, and higher stages become gradually more flexible. 
The final stages have a property which I call tentativity, which means simply 
that the way a picture is represented is always tentative. Upon the drop of a 
hat, a high-level description can he restructured, using all the devices of the 
646 
Artificial Intelllgence: Prospects 

later stages. The ideas presented below also have a tentative quality to 
them. I will try to convey overall ideas first, glossing over significant 
difficulties. Then I will go back and try to explain subtleties and tricks and 
so forth. So your notion of how it all works may also undergo some 
revisions as you read. But that is in the spirit of the discussion. 
Preprocessing Selects a Mini-vocabulary 
Suppose, then, that we have some Bongard problem which we want to 
solve. The problem is presented to a TV camera and the raw data are read 
in. Then the raw data are preprocessed. This means that some salient fea-
tures are detected. The names of these features constitute a "mini-vocabu-
lary" for the problem; they are drawn from a general "salient-feature 
vocabulary". Some typical terms of the salient-feature vocabulary are: 
line segment, curve, horizontal, vertical, black, white, big, small, 
pointy, round ... 
In a second stage of preprocessing, some knowledge about elementary 
shapes is used; and if any are found, their names are also made available. 
Thus, terms such as 
triangle, circle, square, indentation, protrusion, right angle, 
vertex, cusp, arrow ... 
may be selected. This is roughly the point at which the conscious and the 
unconscious meet, in humans. This discussion is primarily concerned with 
describing what happens from here on out. 
High-Level Descriptions 
Now that the picture is "understood", to some extent, in terms of familiar 
concepts, some looking around is done. Tentative descriptions are made 
for one or a few of the twelve boxes. They will typically use simple descrip-
tors such as 
above, below, to the right of, to the left of, inside, outside of, close 
to, far from, parallel to, perpendicular to, in a row, scattered, 
evenly spaced, irregularly spaced, etc. 
Also, definite and indefinite numerical descriptors can be used: 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... many, few, etc. 
More complicated descriptors may be built up, such as 
further to the right of, less close to, almost parallel to, etc. 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
647 

47 
FIGURE 120. Bongard problem 47. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.] 
Thus, a typical box-say I-F of BP 47 (Fig. 120)-could be variously de-
scribed as having: 
three shapes 
or 
three white shapes 
or 
a circle on the right 
or 
two triangles and a circle 
or 
two upwards-pointing triangles 
or 
one large shape and two small shapes 
or 
one curved shape and two straight-edged shapes 
or 
a circle with the same kind of shape on the inside and outside. 
Each of these descriptions sees the box through a "filter". Out of context, 
any of them might be a useful description. As it turns out, though, all of 
them are "wrong", in the context of the particular Bongard problem they 
are part of. In other words, if you knew the distinction between Classes I 
and II in BP 47, and were given one of the preceding lines as a description 
of an unseen drawing, that information would not allow you to tell to which 
Class the drawing belonged. The essential feature of this box, in context, is 
that it includes 
a circle containing a triangle. 
Note that someone who heard such a description would not be able to 
reconstruct the original drawing, but would be able to recognize drawings 
648

FIGURE 121. Bongard problem 91. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.] 
which have this property. It is a little like musical style: you may be an 
infallible recognizer of Mozart, but at the same time unable to write any-
thing which would fool anybody into thinking it was by Mozart. 
Now consider box I-D of BP 91 (Fig. 121). An overloaded but "right" 
description in the context of BP 91 is 
a circle with three rectangular intrusions. 
Notice the sophistication of such a description, in which the word "with" 
functions as a disclaimer, implying that the "circle" is not really a circle: it is 
almost a circle, except that ... Furthermore, the intrusions are not full 
rectangles. There is a lot of "play" in the way we use language to describe 
things. Clearly, a lot of information has been thrown away, and even more 
could be thrown away. A priori, it is very hard to know what it would be 
smart to throwaway and what to keep. So some sort of method for an 
intelligent compromise has to be encoded, via heuristics. Of course, there is 
always recourse to lower levels of description (i.e., less chunked descrip-
tions) if discarded information has to be retrieved, just as people can 
constantly look at the puzzle for help in restructuring their ideas about it. 
The trick, then, is to devise explicit rules that say how to 
make tentative descriptions for each box; 
compare them with tentative descriptions for other boxes of either 
Class; 
restructure the descriptions, by 
(i) adding information, 
(ii) discarding information, 
or (iii) viewing the same information from another angle; 
iterate this process until finding out what makes the two Classes 
differ. 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
649 

Templates and Sameness-Detectors 
One good strategy would be to try to make descriptions structurally similar to 
each other, to the extent this is possible. Any structure they have in common 
will make comparing them that much easier. Two important elements of 
this theory deal with this strategy. One is the idea of "description-schemas", 
or templates; the other is the idea of Sam-a "sameness detector". 
First Sam. Sam is a special agent present on all levels of the program. 
(Actually there may be different kinds of Sams on different levels.) Sam 
constantly runs around within individual descriptions and within different 
descriptions, looking for descriptors or other things which are repeated. 
When some sameness is found, various restructuring operations can be 
triggered, either on the single-description level or on the level of several 
descriptions at once. 
Now templates. The first thing that happens after preprocessing is an 
attempt to manufacture a template, or description-schema-a uniform for-
mat for the descriptions of all the boxes in a problem. The idea is that a 
description can often be broken up in a natural way into subdescriptions, 
and those in turn into subsubdescriptions, if need be. The bottom is hit 
when you come to primitive concepts which belong to the level of the 
preprocessor. Now it is important to choose the way of breaking descrip-
tions into parts so as to reflect commonality among all the boxes; otherwise 
you are introducing a superfluous and meaningless kind of "pseudo-order" 
into the world. 
On the basis of what information is a template built? It is best to look at 
an example. Take BP 49 (Fig. 122). Preprocessing yields the information 
that each box consists of several little o's, and one large closed curve. This is 
a valuable observation, and deserves to be incorporated in the template. 
Thus a first stab at a template would be: 
650 
large closed curve: --
small o's: --
FIGURE 122. Bongard problem 49. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.] 
49 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

It is very simple: the description-template has two explicit slots where 
subdescriptions are to be attached. 
A Heterarchical Program 
Now an interesting thing happens, triggered by the term "closed curve". 
One of the most important modules in the program is a kind of semantic 
net-the concept network-in which all the known nouns, adjectives, etc., are 
linked in ways which indicate their interrelations. For instance, "closed 
curve" is strongly linked with the terms "interior" and "exterior". The 
concept net is just brimming with information about relations between 
terms, such as what is the opposite of what, what is similar to what, what 
often occurs with what, and so on. A little portion of a concept network, to 
be explained shortly, is shown in Figure 123. But let us follow what 
happens now, in the solution of problem 49. The concepts "interior" and 
"exterior" are activated by their proximity in the net to "closed curve". This 
suggests to the template-builder that it might be a good idea to make 
distinct slots for the interior and exterior of the curve. Thus, in the spirit of 
tentativity, the template is tentatively restructured to be this: 
large closed curve: --
little o's in interior: --
little o's in exterior: --
Now when subdescriptions are sought, the terms "interior" and "exterior" 
will cause procedures to inspect those specific regions of the box. What is 
found in BP 49, box I-A is this: 
large closed curve: circle 
little o's in interior: three 
little o's in exterior: three 
And a description of box II-A of the same BP might be 
large closed curve: cigar 
little o's in interior: three 
little o's in exterior: three 
Now Sam, constantly active in parallel with other operations, spots the 
recurrence of the concept "three" in all the slots dealing with o's, and this is 
strong reason to undertake a second template-restructuring operation. 
Notice that the first was suggested by the concept net, the second by Sam. 
Now our template for problem 49 becomes: 
large closed curve: --
three little o's in interior: --
three little o's in exterior: --
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
651 


Now that "three" has risen one level of generality-namely, into the 
template-it becomes worthwhile to explore its neighbors in the concept 
network. One of them is "triangle", which suggests that triangles of o's may 
be important. As it happens, this leads down a blind alley-but how could 
you know in advance? It is a typical blind alley that a human would explore, 
so it is good if our program finds it too! For box II-E, a description such as 
the following might get generated: 
large closed curve: circle 
three little o's in interior: equilateral triangle 
three little o's in exterior: equilateral triangle 
Of course an enormous amount of information has been thrown away 
concerning the sizes, positions, and orientations of these triangles, and 
many other things as well. But that is the whole point of making descrip-
tions instead of just using the raw data! It is the same idea as funneling, 
which we discussed in Chapter XI. 
The Concept Network 
We need not run through the entire solution of problem 49; this suffices to 
show the constant back-and-forth interaction of individual descriptions, 
templates, the sameness-detector Sam, and the concept network. We 
should now look a little more in detail at the concept network and its 
function. A simplified portion shown in the figure codes the following 
ideas: 
"High" and "low" are opposites. 
"Up" and "down" are opposites. 
"High" and "up" are similar. 
"Low" and "down" are similar. 
"Right" and "left" are opposites. 
The "right-left" distinction is similar to the "high-low" distinction. 
"Opposite" and "similar" are opposites. 
Note how everything in the net-both nodes and links-can be talked 
about. In that sense nothing in the net is on a higher level than anything 
else. Another portion of the net is shown; it codes for the ideas that 
A square is a polygon. 
A triangle is a polygon. 
A polygon is a closed curve. 
FIGURE 123. 
A small portion of a concept network for a program to solve Bongard 
problems. "Nodes" are joined by "links", which in tum can be linked. By considering a link as 
a verb and the nodes it joins as subject and object, you can pull out some English sentences from 
this diagram. 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
653 

The difference between a triangle and a square is that one has 3 
sides and the other has 4. 
4 is similar to 3. 
A circle is a closed curve. 
A closed curve has an interior and an exterior. 
"Interior" and "exterior" are opposites. 
I 
The network of concepts is necessarily very vast. It seems to store knowl-
edge only statically, or declaratively, but that is only half the story. Actually, 
its knowledge borders on being procedural as well, by the fact that the 
proximities in the net act as guides, or "programs", telling the main pro-
gram how to develop its understanding of the drawings in the boxes. 
For instance, some early hunch may turn out to be wrong and yet have 
the germ of the right answer in it. In BP 33 (Fig. 124), one might at first 
33 
FIGURE 124. Bongard problem 33. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.] 
jump to the idea that Class I boxes contain "pointy" shapes, Class II boxes 
contain "smooth" ones. But on closer inspection, this is wrong. Neverthe-
less, there is a worthwhile insight here, and one can try to push it further, 
by sliding around in the network of concepts beginning at "pointy". It is 
close to the concept "acute", which is precisely the distinguishing feature of 
Class I. Thus one of the main functions of the concept network is to allow 
early wrong ideas to be modified slightly to slip into variations which may 
be correct. 
Slippage and T entativity 
Related to this notion of slipping between closely related terms is the notion 
of seeing a given object as a variation on another object. An excellent 
example has been mentioned already-that of the "circle with three inden-
tations", where in fact there is no circle at all. One has to be able to bend 
concepts, when it is appropriate. Nothing should be absolutely rigid. On 
654 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

the other hand, things shouldn't be so wishy-washy that nothing has any 
meaning at all, either. The trick is to know when and how to slip one 
concept into another. 
An extremely interesting set of examples where slipping from one 
description to another is the crux of the matter is given in Bongard 
problems 85-87 (Fig. 125). BP 85 is rather trivial. Let us assume that our 
program identifies "line segment" in its preprocessing stage. It is relatively 
simple for it then to count line segments and arrive at the difference 
FIGURE 125. Bongard problems 85-87. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.] 

between Class I and Class II in BP 85. Now it goes on to BP 86. A general 
heuristic which it uses is to try out recent ideas which have worked. Successful 
repetition of recent methods is very common in the real world, and Bon-
gard does not try to outwit this kind of heuristic in his collection-in fact, 
he reinforces it, fortunately. So we plunge right into problem 86 with two 
ideas ("count" and "line segment") fused into one: "count line segments". 
But as it happens, the trick of BP 86 is to count line trains rather than line 
segments, where "line train" means an end-to-end concatenation of (one or 
more) line segments. One way the program might figure this out is if the 
concepts "line train" and "line segment" are both known, and are close in 
the concept network. Another way is if it can invent the concept of "line 
train"-a tricky proposition, to say the least. 
Then comes BP 87, in which the notion of "line segment" is further 
played with. When is a line segment three line segments? (See box II-A.) 
The program must be sufficiently flexible that it can go back and forth 
between such different representations for a given part of a drawing. It is 
wise to store old representations, rather than forgetting them and perhaps 
having to reconstruct them, for there is no guarantee that a newer rep-
resentation is better than an old one. Thus, along with each old representa-
tion should be stored some of the reasons for liking it and disliking it. (This 
begins to sound rather complex. doesn't it?) 
Meta-Descriptions 
Now we come to another vital part of the recognition process, and !;hat has 
to do with levels of abstraction and meta-descriptions. For this let us 
consider BP 91 (Fig. 121) again. What kind of template could be con-
structed here? There is such an amount of variety that it is hard to know 
where to begin. But this is in itself a clue! The clue says, namely, that the 
class distinction very likely exists on a higher level of abstraction than that 
of geometrical description. This observation clues the program that it 
should construct descriptions of descriptions-that is, meta-descriptions. Perhaps 
on this second level some common feature will emerge; and if we are lucky, 
we will discover enough commonality to guide us towards the formulation 
of a template for the meta-descriptions! So we plunge ahead without a 
template, and manufacture descriptions for various boxes; then, once these 
descriptions have been made, we def>cribe them. What kinds of slot will our 
template for meta-descriptions have? Perhaps these, among others: 
concepts used: --
recurring concepts: --
names of slots: --
filters used: --
There are many other kinds of slots which might be needed in meta-
descriptions, but this is a sample. Now suppose we have described box I-E 
of BP 91. Its (template-less) description might look like this: 
656 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

horizontal line segment 
vertical line segment mounted on the horizontal line segment 
vertical line segment mounted on the horizontal line segment 
vertical line segment mounted on the horizontal line segment 
Of course much information has been thrown out: the fact that the three 
vertical lines are of the same length, are spaced equidistantly, etc. But it is 
plausible that the above description would be made. So the meta-
description might look like this: 
concepts used: vertical-horizontal, line segment, mounted on 
repetitions in description: 3 copies of "vertical line segment mounted on 
the horizontal line segment" 
names of slots: --
filters used: --
Not all slots of the meta-description need be filled in; information can be 
thrown away on this level as well as on the '~ust-plain-description" level. 
Now if we were to make a description for any of the other boxes of 
Class I, and then a meta-description of it, we would wind up filling the slot 
"repetitions in description" each time with the phrase "3 copies of ... " The 
sameness-detector would notice this, and pick up three-ness as a salient 
feature, on quite a high level of abstraction, of the boxes of Class I. 
Similarly, four-ness would be recognized, via the method of meta-
descriptions, as the mark of Class II. 
Flexibility Is Important 
Now you might object that in this case, resorting to the method of meta-
descriptions is like shooting a fly with an elephant gun, for the three-ness 
versus four-ness might as easily have shown up on the lower level if we had 
constructed our descriptions slightly differently. Yes, true-but it is impor-
tant to have the possibility of solving these problems by different routes. 
There should be a large amount of flexibility in the program; it should not 
be doomed if, malaphorically speaking, it "barks up the wrong alley" for a 
while. (The amusing term "malaphor" was coined by the newspaper col-
umnist Lawrence Harrison; it means a cross between a malapropism and a 
metaphor. It is a good example of "recombinant ideas".) In any case, I 
wanted to illustrate the general principle that says: When it is hard to build 
a template because the preprocessor finds too much diversity, that should 
serve as a clue that concepts on a higher level of abstraction are involved 
than the preprocessor knows about. 
Focusing and Filtering 
Now let us deal with another question: ways to throw information out. This 
involves two related notions, which I call "focusing" and "filtering". Focus-

FIGURE 126. Bongard problem 55. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.]

FIGURE 127. Bongard problem 22. [From M. Bongard, Pattern Recognition.] 
ing involves making a description whose focus is some part of the drawing 
in the box, to the exclusion of everything else. Filtering involves making a 
description which concentrates on some particular way of viewing the 
contents of the box, and deliberately ignores all other aspects. Thus they 
are complementary: focusing has to do with objects (roughly, nouns), and 
filtering has to do with concepts (roughly, adjectives). For an example of 
focusing, let's look at BP 55 (Fig. 126). Here, we focus on the indentation 
and the little circle next to it, to the exclusion of the everything else in the 
box. BP 22 (Fig. 127) presents an example of filtering. Here, we must filter 
out every concept but that of size. A combination of focusing and filtering is 
required to solve problem BP 58 (Fig. 128). 
One of the most important ways to get ideas for focusing and filtering 
is by another sort of "focusing": namely, by inspection of a single particu-
larly simple box-say one with as few objects in it as possible. It can be

extremely helpful to compare the starkest boxes from the two Classes. But 
how can you tell which boxes are stark until you have descriptions for 
them? Well, one way of detecting starkness is to look for a box with a 
minimum of the features provided by the preprocessor. This can be done 
very early, for it does not require a pre-existing template; in fact, this can 
be one useful way of discovering features to build into a template. BP 61 
(Fig. 129) is an example where that technique might quickly lead to a solution. 
Science and the World of Bongard Problems 
One can think of the Bongard-problem world as a tiny place where "sci-
ence" is done-that is, where the purpose is to discern patterns in the 
world. As patterns are sought, templates are made, unmade, and remade;

slots are shifted from one level of generality to another; filtering and 
focusing are done; and so on. There are discoveries on all levels of com-
plexity. The Kuhnian theory that certain rare events called "paradigm 
shifts" mark the distinction between "normal" science and "conceptual 
revolutions" does not seem to work, for we can see paradigm shifts happen-
ing all throughout the system, all the time. The fluidity of descriptions 
ensures that paradigm shifts will take place on all scales. 
Of course, some discoveries are more "revolutionary" than others, 
because they have wider effects. For instance, one can make the discovery 
that problems 70 and 71 (Fig. 130) are "the same problem", when looked at 
on a sufficiently abstract level. The key observation is that both involve 
depth-2 versus depth-l nesting. This is a new level of discovery that can be 
made about Bongard problems. There is an even higher level, concerning 
the collection as a whole. If someone has never seen the collection, it can be 
a good puzzle just to figure out what it is. To figure it out is a revolutionary 
insight, but it must be pointed out that the mechanisms of thought which 
allow such a discovery to be made are no different from those which 
operate in the solution of a single Bongard problem.

Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

By the same token, real science does not divide up into "normal" 
periods versus "conceptual revolutions"; rather, paradigm shifts 
pervade-there are just bigger and smaller ones, paradigm shifts on differ-
ent levels. The recursive plots of INT and Gplot (Figs. 32 and 34) provide a 
geometric model for this idea: they have the same structure full of discon-
tinuous jumps on every level, not just the top level-only the lower the 
level, the smaller the jumps. 
Connections to Other Types of Thought 
To set this entire program somewhat in context, let me suggest two ways in 
which it is related to other aspects of cognition. Not only does it depend on 
other aspects of cognition, but also they in turn depend on it. First let me 
comment on how it depends on other aspects of cognition. The intuition 
which is required for knowing when it makes sense to blur distinctions, to 
try redescriptions, to backtrack, to shift levels, and so forth, is something 
which probably comes only with much experience in thought in general. 
Thus it would be very hard to define heuristics for these crucial aspects of 
the program. Sometimes one's experience with real objects in the world has 
a subtle effect on how one describes or redescribes boxes. For instance, who 
can say how much one's familiarity with living trees helps one to solve BP 
70? It is very doubtful that in humans, the subnetwork of concepts relevant 
to these puzzles can be easily separated out from the whole network. 
Rather, it is much more likely that one's intuitions gained from seeing and 
handling real objects-combs, trains, strings, blocks, letters, rubber bands, 
etc., etc.-play an invisible but significant guiding role in the solution of 
these puzzles. 
Conversely, it is certain that understanding real-world situations heavi-
ly depends on visual imagery and spatial intuition, so that having a power-
ful and flexible way of representing patterns such as these Bongard pat-
terns can only contribute to the general efficiency of thought processes. 
It seems to me that Bongard's problems were worked out with great 
care, and that they have a quality of universality to them, in the sense that 
each one has a unique correct answer. Of course one could argue with this 
and say that what we consider "correct" depends in some deep way on our 
being human, and some creatures from some other star system might 
disagree entirely. Not having any concrete evidence either way, I still have a 
certain faith that Bongard problems depend on a sense of simplicity which 
is not just limited to earthbound human beings. My earlier comments about 
the probable importance of being acquainted with such surely earth-limited 
objects as combs, trains, rubber bands, and so on, are not in conflict with 
the idea that our notion of simplicity is universal, for what matters is not 
any of these individual objects, but the fact that taken together they span a 
wide space. And it seems likely that any other civilization would have as vast 
a repertoire of artifacts and natural objects and varieties of experience on 
which to draw as we do. So I believe that the skill of solving Bongard

problems lies very close to the core of "pure" intelligence, if there is such a 
thing. Therefore it is a good place to begin if one wants to investigate the 
ability to discover "intrinsic meaning" in patterns or messages. Unfortu-
nately we have reproduced only a small selection of his stimulating collec-
tion. I hope that many readers will acquaint themselves with the entire 
collection, to be found in his book (see Bibliography). 
Some of the problems of visual pattern recognition which we human 
beings seem to have completely "flattened" into our unconscious are quite 
amazing. They include: 
recognition of faces (invariance of faces under age change, ex-
pression change, lighting change, distance change, angle 
change, etc.) 
recognition of hiking trails in forests and mountains-somehow 
this has always impressed me as one of our most subtle acts of 
pattern recognition-and yet animals can do it, too 
reading text without hesitation in hundreds if not thousands of 
different typefaces 
Message-Passing Languages, Frames, and Symbols 
One way that has been suggested for handling the complexities of pattern 
recognition and other challenges to AI programs is the so-called "actor" 
formalism of Carl Hewitt (similar to the language "Smalltalk", developed 
by Alan Kay and others), in which a program is written as a collection of 
interacting actors, which can pass elaborate messages back and forth among 
themselves. In a way, this resembles a heterarchical collection of proce-
dures which can call each other. The major difference is that where proce-
dures usually only pass a rather small number of arguments back and 
forth, the messages exchanged by actors can be arbitrarily long and com-
plex. 
Actors with the ability to exchange messages become somewhat auto-
nomous agents-in fact, even like autonomous computers, with messages 
being somewhat like programs. Each actor can have its own idiosyncratic 
way of interpreting any given message; thus a message's meaning will 
depend on the actor it is intercepted by. This comes about by the actor 
having within it a piece of program which interprets messages; so there 
may be as many interpreters as there are actors. Of course, there may be 
many actors with identical interpreters; in fact, this could be a great advan-
tage, just as it is extremely important in the cell to have a multitude ·of 
identical ribosomes floating throughout the cytoplasm, all of which will 
interpret a message-in this case, messenger RNA-in one and the same 
way. 
It is interesting to think how one might merge the frame-notion with 
the actor-notion. Let us call a frame with the capability of generating and 
interpreting com plex messages a symbol: 
frame + actor = symbol 
662 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

We now have reached the point where we are talking about ways of 
implementing those elusive active symbols of Chapters XI and XII; hence-
forth in this Chapter, "symbol" will have that meaning. By the way, don't 
feel dumb if you don't immediately see just how this synthesis is to be made. 
It is not clear, though it is certainly one of the most fascinating directions to 
go in AI. Furthermore, it is quite certain that even the best synthesis of 
these notions will turn out to have much less power than the actual symbols 
of human minds. In that sense, calling these frame-actor syntheses "sym-
bols" is premature, but it is an optimistic way of looking at things. 
Let us return to some issues connected with message passing. Should 
each message be directed specifically at a target symbol, or should it be 
thrown out into the grand void, much as mRN A is thrown out into the 
cytoplasm, to seek its ribosome? If messages have destinations, then each 
symbol must have an address, and messages for it should always be sent to 
that address. On the other hand, there could be one central receiving dock 
for messages, where a message would simply sit until it got picked up by 
some symbol that wanted it. This is a counterpart to General Delivery. 
Probably the best solution is to allow both types of message to exist; also to 
have provisions for different classes of urgency-special delivery, first class, 
second class, and so on. The whole postal system provides a rich source of 
ideas for message-passing languages, including such curios as self-
addressed stamped envelopes (messages whose senders want answers 
quickly), parcel post (extremely long messages which can be sent some very 
slow way), and more. The telephone system will give you more inspiration 
when you run out of postal-system ideas. 
Enzymes and AI 
Another rich source of ideas for message passing-indeed, for information 
processing in general-is, of course, the cell. Some objects in the cell are 
quite comparable to actors-in particular, enzymes. Each enzyme's active 
site acts as a filter which only recognizes certain kinds of substrates (mes-
sages). Thus an enzyme has an "address", in effect. The enzyme is "pro-
grammed" (by virtue of its tertiary structure) to carry out certain opera-
tions upon that "message", and then to release it to the world again. Now in 
this way, when a message is passed from enzyme to enzyme along a 
chemical pathway, a lot can be accomplished. We have already described 
the elaborate kinds of feedback mechanisms which can take place in cells 
(either by inhibition or repression). These kinds of me::chanisms show that 
complicated control of processes can arise through the kind of message 
passing that exists in the cell. 
One of the most striking things about enzymes is how they sit around 
idly, waiting to be triggered by an incoming substrate. Then, when the 
substrate arrives, suddenly the enzyme springs into action, like a Venus's-
ftytrap. This kind of "hair-trigger" program has been used in AI, and goes 
by the name of demon. The important thing here is the idea of having many 
different "species" of triggerable subroutines just lying around waiting to 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
663 

be triggered. In cells, all the complex molecules and organelles are built up, 
simple step by simple step. Some of these new structures are often enzymes 
themselves, and they participate in the building of new enzymes, which in 
turn participate in the building of yet other types of enzyme, etc. Such 
recursive cascades of enzymes can have drastic effects on what a ceil is 
doing. One would like to see the same kind of simple step-by-step assembly 
process imported into AI, in the construction of useful subprograms. For 
instance, repetition has a way of burning new circuits into our mental 
hardware, so that oft-repeated pieces of behavior become encoded below 
the conscious level. It would be extremely useful if there were an analogous 
way of synthesizing efficient pieces of code which can carry out the same 
sequence of operations as something which has been learned on a higher 
level of "consciousness". Enzyme cascades may suggest a model for how this 
could be done. (The program called "HACKER", written by Gerald 
Sussman, synthesizes and debugs small subroutines in a way not too much 
unlike that of enzyme cascades.) 
The sameness-detectors in the Bongard problem-solver (Sams) could 
be implemented as enzyme-like subprograms. Like an enzyme, a Sam 
would meander about somewhat at random, bumping into small data 
structures here and there. Upon filling its two "active sites" with identical 
data structures, the Sam would emit a message to other parts (actors) of the 
program. As long as programs are serial, it would not make much sense t~ 
have several copies of a Sam, but in a truly parallel computer, regulating 
the number of copies of a subprogram would be a way of regulating the 
expected waiting-time before an operation gets done, just as regulating the 
number of copies of an enzyme in a cell regulates how fast that function 
gets performed. And if new Sams could be synthesized, that would be 
comparable to the seepage of pattern detection into lower levels of our 
minds. 
Fission and Fusion 
Two interesting and complementary ideas concerning the interaction of 
symbols are "fission" and "fusion". Fission is the gradual divergence of a 
new symbol from its parent symbol (that is, from the symbol which served 
as a template off of which it was copied). Fusion is what happens when two 
(or more) originaily unrelated symbols participate in a ')oint activation", 
passing messages so tightly back and forth that they get bound together 
and the combination can thereafter be addressed as if it were a single 
symbol. Fission is a more or less inevitable process, since once a new symbol 
has been "rubbed off" of an old one, it becomes autonomous, and its 
interactions with the outside world get reflected in its private internal 
structure; so what started out as a perfect copy will soon become imperfect, 
and then slowly will become less and less like the symbol off of which it was 
"rubbed". Fusion is a subtler thing. When do two concepts really become 
one? Is there some precise instant when a fusion takes place? 
664 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

This notion of joint activations opens up a Pandora's box of questions. 
For instance, how much do we hear "dough" and "nut" when we say 
"doughnut"? Does a German who thinks of gloves ("Handschuhe") hear 
"hand-shoes" or not? How about Chinese people, whose word "dong-xi" 
("East-West") means "thing"? It is a matter of some political concern, too, 
since some people claim that words like "chairman" are heavily charged 
with undertones of the male gender. The degree to which the parts reso-
nate inside the whole probably varies from person to person and according 
to circumstances. 
The real problem with this notion of "fusion" of symbols is that it is 
very hard to imagine general algorithms which will create meaningful new 
symbols from colliding symbols. It is like two strands of DNA which come 
together. How do you take parts from each and recombine them into a 
meaningful and viable new strand of DNA which codes for an individual of 
the same species? Or a new kind of species? The chance is infinitesimal that 
a random combination of pieces of DNA will code for anything that will 
survive-something like the chance that a random combination of words 
from two books will make another book. The chance that recombinant 
DNA will make sense on any level but the lowest is tiny, precisely because 
there are so many levels of meaning in DNA. And the same goes for 
"recombinant symbols". 
Epigenesis of the Crab Canon 
I think of my Dialogue Crab Canon as a prototype example where two ideas 
collided in my mind, connected in a new way, and suddenly a new kind of 
verbal structure came alive in my mind. Of course I can still think about 
musical crab canons and verbal dialogues separately-they can still be 
activated independently of each other; but the fused symbol for crab-
canonical dialogues has its own characteristic modes of activation, too. To 
illustrate this notion of fusion or "symbolic recombination" in some detail, 
then, I would like to use the development of my Crab Canon as a case study, 
because, of course, it is very familiar to me, and also because it is interest-
ing, yet typical of how far a single idea can be pushed. I will recount it in 
stages named after those of meiosis, which is the name for cell division in 
which "crossing-over", or genetic recombination, takes place-the source of 
diversity in evolution. 
PROPHASE: I began with a rather simple idea-that a piece of music, 
say a canon, could be imitated verbally. This came from the observation 
that, through a shared abstract form, a piece of text and a piece of music 
may be connected. The next step involved trying to realize some of the 
potential of this vague hunch; here, I hit upon the idea that "voices" in 
canons can be mapped onto "characters" in dialogues-still a rather obvi-
ous idea. 
Then I focused down onto specific kinds of canons, and remembered 
that there was a crab canon in the Musical Offering. At that time, I had just 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
665 

begun writing Dialogues, and there were only two characters: Achilles and 
the Tortoise. Since the Bach crab canon has two voices, this mapped 
perfectly: Achilles should be one voice, the Tortoise the other, with the one 
doing forwards what the other does backwards. But here I was faced with a 
problem: on what level should the reversal take place? The letter level? The 
word level? The sentence level? After some thought, I concluded that the 
"dramatic line" level would be most appropriate. 
Now that the "skeleton" of the Bach crab canon had been transplanted, 
at least in plan, into a verbal form, there was just one problem. When the 
two voices crossed in the middle, there would be a short period of extreme 
repetition: an ugly blemish. What to do about it? Here, a strange thing 
happened, a kind of level-crossing typical of creative acts: the word "crab" 
in "crab canon" flashed into my mind, undoubtedly because of some 
abstract shared quality with the notion of "tortoise"-and immediately I 
realized that at the dead center, I could block the repetitive effect, by 
inserting one special line, said by a new character: a Crab! This is how, in 
the "prophase" of the Crab Canon, the Crab was conceived: at the crossing-
over of Achilles and the Tortoise. (See Fig. 131.)

FIGURE 131. A schematic diagram of the Dialogue Crab Canon. 
METAPHASE: This was the skeleton of my Crab Canon. I then entered 
the second stage-the "metaphase"-in which I had to fill in the flesh, 
which was of course an arduous task. I made a lot of stabs at it, getting used 
to the way in which pairs of successive lines had to make sense when read 
from either direction, and experimenting around to see what kinds of dual 
meanings would help me in writing sllch a form (e.g., "Not at all"). There 
were two early versions both of which were interesting, but weak. I aban-
doned work on the book for over a year, and when I returned to the Crab 
Canon, I had a few new ideas. One of them was to mention a Bach canon 
inside it. At first my plan was to mention the "Canon per augmentationem, 
contrario motu", from the Musical Offering (Sloth Canon, as I call it). But 
that started to seem a little silly, so reluctantly I decided that inside my Crab 
Canon, I could talk about Bach's own Crab Canon instead. Actually, this was 
a crucial turning point, but I didn't know it then. 
Now if one character was going to mention a Bach piece, wouldn't it be 
awkward for the other to say exactly the same thing in the corresponding 
place? Well, Escher was playing a similar role to Bach in my thoughts and 
my book, so wasn't there some way of just slightly modifying the line so that 
it would refer to Escher? After all, in the strict art of canons, note-perfect 
imitation is occasionally foregone for the sake of elegance or beauty. And 
666 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

no sooner did that idea occur to me than the picture Day and Night (Fig. 49) 
popped into my mind. "Of course!" I thought, "It is a sort of pictorial crab 
canon, with essentially two complementary voices carrying the same theme 
both leftwards and rightwards, and harmonizing with each other!" Here 
again was the notion of a single "conceptual skeleton" being instantiated in 
two different media-in this case, music and art. So I let the Tortoise talk 
about Bach, and Achilles talk about Escher, in parallel language; certainly 
this slight departure from strict imitation retained the spirit of crab canotls. 
At this point, I began realizing that something marvelous was happen-
ing: namely, the Dialogue was becoming self-referential, without my even 
having intended it! What's more, it was an indirect self-reference, in that 
the characters did not talk directly about the Dialogue they were in, but 
rather about structures which were isomorphic to it (on a certain plane of 
abstraction). To put it in the terms I have been using, my Dialogue now 
shared a "conceptual skeleton" with Godel's G, and could therefore be 
mapped onto G in somewhat the way that the Central Dogma was, to create 
in this case a "Central Crabmap". This was most exciting to me, since out of 
nowhere had come an esthetically pleasing unity of Godel, Escher, and 
Bach. 
ANAPHASE: The next step was quite startling. I had had Caroline 
MacGillavry's monograph on Escher's tesselations for years, but one day, as 
I flipped through it, my eye was riveted to Plate 23 (Fig. 42), for I saw it in a 
way I had never seen it before: here was a genuine crab canon--crab-like in 
both form and content! Escher himself had given the picture no title, and 
since he had drawn similar tesselations using many other animal forms, it is 
probable that this coincidence of form and content was just something 
which I had noticed. But fortuitous or not, this untitled plate was a minia-
ture version of one main idea of my book: to unite form and content. So 
with delight I christened it Crab Canon, substituted it for Day and Night, and 
modified Achilles' and the Tortoise's remarks accordingly. 
Yet this was not all. Having become infatuated with molecular biology, 
one day I was perusing Watson's book in the bookstore, and in the index 
saw the word "palindrome". When I looked it up, I found a magical thing: 
crab-canonical structures in DNA. Soon the Crab's comments had been 
suitably modified to include a short remark to the effect that he owed his 
predilection for confusing retrograde and forward motion to his genes. 
TELOPHASE: The last step came months later, when, as I was talking 
about the picture of the crab-canonical section of DNA (Fig. 43), I saw that 
the 'A', 'T', 'C' of Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine coincided- mirabile 
dictu-with the 'A', 'T', 'C' of Achilles, Tortoise, Crab; moreover, just as 
Adenine and Thymine are paired in DNA, so are Achilles and the Tortoise 
paired in the Dialogue. I thought for a moment and, in another of those 
level-crossings, saw that 'G', the letter paired with 'C' in DNA, could stand 
for "Gene". Once again, Ijumped back to the Dialogue, did a little surgery 
on the Crab's speech to reflect this new discovery, and now I had a mapping 
between the DNA's structure, and the Dialogue's structure. In that sense, 
the DNA could be said to be a genotype coding for a phenotype: the 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
667 

structure of the Dialogue. This final touch dramatically heightened the 
self-reference, and gave the Dialogue a density of meaning which I had 
never anticipated. 
Conceptual Skeletons and Conceptual Mapping 
That more or less summarizes the epigen~sis of the Crab Canon. The whole 
process can be seen as a succession of mappings of ideas onto each other, at 
varying levels of abstraction. This is what I call conceptual mapping, and the 
abstract structures which connect up two different ideas are conceptual 
skeletons. Thus, one conceptual skeleton is that of the abstract notion of a 
crab canon: 
a structure having two parts which do the same thing, 
only moving in opposite directions. 
This is a concrete geometrical image which can be manipulated by the mind 
almost as a Bongard pattern. In fact, when I think of the Crab Canon today, 
I visualize it as two strands which cross in the middle, where they are joined 
by a "knot" (the Crab's speech). This is such a vividly pictorial image that it 
instantaneously maps, in my mind, onto a picture of two homologous 
chromosomes joined by a centromere in their middle, which is an image 
drawn directly from meiosis, as shown in Figure 132. 
FIGURE 132. 
In fact, this very image is what inspired me to cast the description of the 
Crab Canon's evolution in terms of meiosis-which is itself, of course, yet 
another example of conceptual mapping. 
Recombinant Ideas 
Th~re are a variety of techniques of fusion of two symbols. One involves 
lining the two ideas up next to each other (as if ideas were linear!), then 
judiciously choosing pieces from each one, and recombining them in a new 
symbol. This strongly recalls genetic recombination. Well, what do chromo-
somes exchange, and how do they do it? They exchange genes. What in a 
symbol is comparable to a gene? If symbols have frame-like slots, then slots, 
perhaps. But which slots to exchange, and why? Here is where the crab-
canonical fusion may offer some ideas. Mapping the notion of "musical 
crab canon" onto that of "dialogue" involved several auxiliary mappings; in 
668 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

fact it induced them. That is, once it had been decided that these two notions 
were to be fused, it became a matter of looking at them on a level where 
analogous parts emerged into view, then going ahead and mapping the parts 
onto each other, and so on, recursively, to any level that was found desir-
able. Here, for instance, "voice" and "character" emerged as corresponding 
slots when "crab canon" and "dialogue" were viewed abstractly. Where did 
these abstract views come from, though? This is at the crux of the 
mapping-problem-where do abstract views come from? How do you make 
abstract views of specific notions? 
Abstractions, Skeletons, Analogies 
A view which has been abstracted from a concept along some dimension is 
what I call a conceptual skeleton. In effect, we have dealt with conceptual 
skeletons all along, without often using that name. For instance, many of 
the ideas concerning Bongard problems could be rephrased using this 
terminology. It is always of interest, and possibly of importance, when two 
or more ideas are discovered to share a conceptual skeleton. An example is 
the bizarre set of concepts mentioned at the beginning of the Contra factus: a 
Bicyclops, a tandem unicycle, a teeter-teeter, the game of ping-ping, a 
one-way tie, a two-sided Mobius strip, the "Bach twins", a piano concerto 
for two left hands, a one-voice fugue, the act of clapping with one hand, a 
two-channel monaural phonograph, a pair of eighth-backs. All of these 
ideas are "isomorphic" because they share this conceptual skeleton: 
a plural thing made singular and re-pluralized wrongly. 
Two other ideas in this book which share that conceptual skeleton are (1) 
the Tortoise's solution to Achilles' puzzle, asking for a word beginning and 
ending in "HE" (the Tortoise's solution being the pronoun "HE", which 
collapses two occurrences into one), and (2) the Pappus-Gelernter proof of 
the Pons Asinorum Theorem, in which one triangle is reperceived as two. 
Incidentally, these droll concoctions might be dubbed "demi-doublets". 
A conceptual skeleton is like a set of constant features (as distinguished 
from parameters or variables)-features which should not be slipped in a 
subjunctive instant replay or mapping-operation. Having no parameters or 
variables of its own to vary, it can be the invariant core of several different 
ideas. Each instance of it, such as "tandem unicycle", does have layers of 
variability and so can be "slipped" in various ways. 
Although the name "conceptual skeleton" sounds absolute and rigid, 
actually there is a lot of play in it. There can be conceptual skeletons on 
several different levels of abstraction. For instance, the "isomorphism" 
between Bongard problems 70 and 71, already pointed out, involves a 
higher-level conceptual skeleton than that needed to solve either problem 
in isolation. 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
669 

Multiple Representations 
Not only must conceptual skeletons exist on different levels of abstraction; 
also, they must exist along different conceptual dimensions. Let us take the 
following sentence as an example: 
"The Vice President is the spare tire 
on the automobile of government." 
How do we understand what it means (leaving aside its humor, which is of 
course a vital aspect)? If you were told, "See our government as an au-
tomobile" without any prior motivation, you might come up with any 
number of correspondences: steering wheel = president, etc.. What are 
checks and balances? What are seat belts? Because the two things being 
mapped are so different, it is almost inevitable that the mapping will 
involve functional aspects. Therefore, you retrieve from your store of con-
ceptual skeletons representing parts of automobiles, only those having to 
do with function, rather than, say, shape. Furthermore, it makes sense to 
work at a pretty high level of abstraction, where "function" isn't taken in 
too narrow a context. Thus, of the two following definitions of the function 
of a spare tire: (1) "replacement for a flat tire", and (2) "replacement for a 
certain disabled part of a car", certainly the latter would be preferable, in 
this case. This comes simply from the fact that an auto and a government 
are so different that they have to be mapped at a high level of abstraction. 
Now when the particular sentence is examined, the mapping gets 
forced in one respect-but it is not an awkward way, by any means. In fact, 
you already have a conceptual skeleton for the Vice President, among 
many others, which says, "replacement for a certain disabled part of gov-
ernment". Therefore the forced mapping works comfortably. But suppose, 
for the sake of contrast, that you had retrieved another conceptual skeleton 
for "spare tire"-say, one describing its physical aspects. Among other 
things, it might say that a spare tire is "round and inflated". Clearly, this is 
not the right way to go. (Or is it? As a friend of mine pointed out, some Vice 
Presidents are rather portly, and most are quite inflated!) 
Ports of Access 
One of the major characteristics of each idiosyncratic style of thought is 
how new experiences get classified and stuffed into memory, for that 
defines the "handles" by which they will later be retrievable. And for 
events, objects, ideas, and so on-for everything that can be thought 
about-there is a wide variety of "handles". I am struck by this each time I 
reach down to turn on my car radio, and find, to my dismay, that it is 
already on! What has happened is that two independent representations 
are being used for the radio. One is "music producer", the other is "bore-
dom reliever". I am aware that the music is on, but I am bored anyway, and 
before the two realizations have a chance to interact, my reflex to reach 
670 
ArtifiCial Intelligence: Prospects 

down has been triggered. The same reaching-down reflex one day occur-
red just after I'd left the radio at a repair shop and was driving away, 
wanting to hear some music. Odd. Many other representations for the 
same object exist, such as 
shiny silver-knob haver 
overheating-problems haver 
lying-on-my-back-over-hump-to-fix thing 
buzz-maker 
slipping-dials object 
multidimensional representation example 
All of them can act as ports of access. Though they all are attached to my 
symbol for my car radio, accessing that symbol through one does not open 
up all the others. Thus it is unlikely that I will be inspired to remember 
lying on my back to fix the radio when I reach down and turn it on. And 
conversely, when I'm lying on my back, unscrewing screws, I probably 
won't think about the time I heard the Art of the Fugue on it. There are 
"partitions" between these aspects of one symbol, partitions that prevent 
my thoughts from spilling over sloppily, in the manner of free associations. 
My mental partitions are important because they contain and channel the 
flow of my thoughts. 
One place where these partitions are quite rigid is in sealing off words 
for the same thing in different languages. If the partitions were not strong, 
a bilingual person would constantly slip back and forth between languages, 
which would be very uncomfortable. Of course, adults learning two new 
languages at once often confuse words in them. The partitions between 
these languages are flimsier, and can break down. Interpreters are particu-
larly interesting, since they can speak any of their languages as if their 
partitions were inviolable and yet, on command, they can negate those 
partitions to allow access to one language from the other, so they can 
translate. Steiner, who grew up trilingual, devotes several pages in After 
Babel to the intermingling of French, English, and German in the layers of 
his mind, and how his different languages afford different ports of access 
onto concepts. 
Forced Matching 
When two ideas are seen to share conceptual skeletons on some level of 
abstraction, different things can happen. Usually the first stage is that you 
zoom in on both ideas, and, using the higher-level match as a guide, you try 
to identify corresponding subideas. Sometimes the match can be extended 
recursively downwards several levels, revealing a profound isomorphism. 
Sometimes it stops earlier, revealing an analogy or similarity. And then 
there are times when the high-level similarity is so compelling that, even if 
there is no apparent lower-level continuation of the map, you just go ahead 
and make one: this is the forced match. 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
671 

Forced matches occur every day in the political cartoons of newspap-
ers: a political figure is portrayed as an airplane, a boat, a fish, the Mona 
Lisa; a government is a human, a bird, an oil rig; a treaty is a briefcase, a 
sword, a can of worms; on and on and on. What is fascinating is how easily 
we can perform the suggested mapping, and to the exact depth intended. 
We don't carry the mapping out too deeply or too shallowly. 
Another example of forcing one thing into the mold of another occur-
red when I chose to describe the development of my Crab Canon in terms of 
meiosis. This happened in stages. First, I noticed the common conceptual 
skeleton shared by the Crab Canon and the image of chromosomes joined by 
a centromere; this provided the inspiration for the forced match. Then I 
saw a high-level resemblance involving "growth", "stages", and "recombina-
tion". Then I simply pushed the analogy as hard as I could. Tentativity-as 
in the Bongard problem-solver-played a large role: I went forwards and 
backwards before finding a match which I found appealing. 
A third example of conceptual mapping is provided by the Central 
Dogmap. I initially noticed a high-level similarity between the discoveries of 
mathematical logicians and those of molecular biologists, then pursued it 
on lower levels until I found a strong analogy. To strengthen it further, I 
chose a Godel-numbering which imitated the Genetic Code. This was the 
lone element of forced matching in the Central Dogmap. 
Forced matches, analogies, and metaphors cannot easily be separated 
out. Sportscasters often use vivid imagery which is hard to pigeonhole. For 
instance, in a metaphor such as "The Rams [football team] are spinning 
their wheels", it is hard to say just what image you are supposed to conjure 
up. Do you attach wheels to the team as a whole? Or to each player? 
Probably neither one. More likely, the image of wheels spinning in mud or 
snow simply flashes before you for a brief instant, and then in some 
mysterious way, just the relevant part~ get lifted out and transferred to the 
team's performance. How deeply are the football team and the car mapped 
onto each other in the split second that you do this? 
Recap 
Let me try to tie things together a little. I have presented a number of 
related ideas connected with the creation, manipulation, and comparison 
of symbols. Most of them have to do with slippage in some fashion, the idea 
being that concepts are composed of some tight and some loose elements, 
coming from different levels of nested contexts (frames). The loose ones 
can be dislodged and replaced rather easily, which, depending on the 
circumstances, can create a "subjunctive instant replay", a forced match, or 
an analogy. A fusion of two symbols may result from a process in which 
parts of each symbol are dislodged and other parts remain.

Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

Creativity and Randomness 
It is obvious that we are talking about mechanization of creativity. But is 
this not a contradiction in terms? Almost, but not really. Creativity is the 
essence of that which is not mechanical. Yet every creative act is 
mechanical-it has its explanation no less than a case of the hiccups does. 
The mechanical substrate of creativity may be hidden from view, but it 
exists. Conversely, there is something unmechanical in flexible programs, 
even today. It may not constitute creativity, but when programs cease to be 
transparent to their creators, then the approach to creativity has begun. 
It is a common notion that randomness is an indispensable ingredient 
of creative acts. This may be true, but it does not have any bearing on the 
mechanizability-or rather, programmability!-of creativity. The world is a 
giant heap of randomness; when you mirror some of it inside your head, 
your head's interior absorbs a little of that randomness. The triggering 
patterns of symbols, therefore, can lead you down the most random-
seeming paths, simply because they came from your interactions with a 
crazy, random world. So it can be with a computer program, too. Random-
ness is an intrinsic feature of thought, not something which has to be 
"artificially inseminated", whether through dice, decaying nuclei, random 
number tables, or what-have-you. It is an insult to human creativity to 
imply that it relies on such arbitrary sources. 
What we see as randomness is often simply an effect of looking at 
something symmetric through a "skew" filter. An elegant example was 
provided by Salviati's two ways of looking at the number rr/4. Although the 
decimal expansion of rr/4 is not literally random, it is as random as one 
would need for most purposes: it is "pseudorandom". Mathematics is full 
of pseudorandom ness-plenty enough to supply all would-be creators for 
all time. 
Just as science is permeated with "conceptual revolutions" on all levels 
at all times, so the thinking of individuals is shot through and through with 
creative acts. They are not just on the highest plane; they are everywhere. 
Most of them are small and have been made a million times before-but 
they are close cousins to the most highly creative and new acts. Computer 
programs today do not yet seem to produce many small creations. Most of 
what they do is quite "mechanical" still. That just testifies to the fact that 
they are not close to simulating the way we think-but they are getting 
closer. 
Perhaps what differentiates highly creative ideas from ordinary ones is 
some combined sense of beauty, simplicity, and harmony. In fact, I have a 
favorite "meta-analogy", in which I liken analogies to chords. The idea is 
simple: superficially similar ideas are often not deeply related; and deeply 
related ideas are often superficially disparate. The analogy to chords is 
natural: physically close notes are harmonically distant (e.g., E-F-G); and 
harmonically close notes are physically distant (e.g., G-E-B). Ideas that 
share a conceptual skeleton resonate in a sort of conceptual analogue to 
harmony; these harmonious "idea-chords" are often widely separated, as 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
673 

measured on an imaginary "keyboard of concepts". Of course, it doesn't 
suffice to reach wide and plunk down any old way-you may hit a seventh 
or a ninth! Perhaps the present analogy is like a ninth-chord-wide but 
dissonant. 
Picking up Patterns on All Levels 
Bongard problems were chosen as a focus in this Chapter because when 
you study them, you realize that the elusive sense for patterns which we 
humans inherit from our genes involves all the mechanisms of representa-
tion of knowledge, including nested contexts, conceptual skeletons and 
conceptual mapping, slippability, descriptions and meta-descriptions and 
their interactions, fission and fusion of symbols, multiple representations 
(along different dimensions and different levels of abstraction), default 
expectations, and more. 
These days, it is a safe bet that if some program can pick up 
patterns in one area, it will miss patterns in another area which, to us, 
are equally obvious. You may remember that I mentioned this back in 
Chapter I, saying that machines can be oblivious to repetition, whereas 
people cannot. For instance, consider SHRDLU. If Eta Oin typed the 
sentence "Pick up a big red block and put it down" over and over again, 
SHRDLU would cheerfully react in the same way over and over again, 
exactly as an adding machine will print out "4" over and over again, 
if a human being has the patience to type "2+2" over and over again. 
Humans aren't like that; if some pattern occurs over and over again, 
they will pick it up. SHRDLU wasn't built with the potential for forming 
new concepts or recognizing patterns: it had no sense of over and overview. 
The Flexibility of Language 
SHRDLU's language-handling capability is immensely flexible-within 
limits. SHRDLU can figure out sentences of great syntactical complexity, or 
sentences with semantic ambiguities as long as they can be resolved by 
inspecting the data base-but it cannot handle "hazy" language. For in-
stance, consider the sentence "How many blocks go on top of each other to 
make a steeple?" We understand it immediately, yet it does not make sense 
if interpreted literally. Nor is it that some idiomatic phrase has been used. 
"To go on top of each other" is an imprecise phrase which nonetheless gets 
the desired image across quite well to a human. Few people would be 
misled into visualizing a paradoxical 50etup with two blocks each of which is 
on top of the other--or blocks which are "going" somewhere or other. 
The amazing thing about language is how imprecisely we use it and 
still manage to get away with it. SHRDLU uses words in a "metallic" way, 
while people use them in a "spongy'· or "rubbery" or even "Nutty-Putty-
ish" way. If words were nuts and bolts, people could make any bolt fit into 
any nut: they'd just squish the one into the other, as in some surrealistic 
674 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

painting where everything goes soft. Language, in human hands, becomes 
almost like a fluid, despite the coarse grain of its components. 
Recently, AI research in natural language understanding has turned 
away somewhat from the understanding of single sentences in isolation, 
and more towards areas such as understanding simple children's stories. 
Here is a well-known children's joke which illustrates the open-endedness 
of real-life situations: 
A man took a ride in an airplane. 
Unfortunately, he fell out. 
Fortunately, he had a parachute on. 
Unfortunately, it didn't work. 
Fortunately, there was a haystack below him. 
Unfortunately, there was a pitchfork sticking out of it. 
Fortunately, he missed the pitchfork. 
Unfortunately, he missed the haystack. 
It can be extended indefinitely. To represent this silly story in a frame-
based system would be extremely complex, involving jointly activating 
frames for the concepts of man, airplane, exit, parachute, falling, etc., etc. 
Intelligence and Emotions 
Or consider this tiny yet poignant story: 
Margie was holding tightly to the string of her beautiful new balloon. 
Suddenly, a gust of wind caught it. The wind carried it into a tree. The 
balloon hit a branch and burst. Margie cried and cried. 4 
To understand this story, one needs to read many things between the lines. 
For instance: Margie is a little girl. This is a toy balloon with a string for a 
child to hold. It may not be beautiful to an adult, but in a child's eye, it is. 
She is outside. The "it" that the wind caught was the balloon. The wind did 
not pull Margie along with the balloon; Margie let go. Balloons can break 
on contact with any sharp point. Once they are broken, they are gone 
forever. Little children love balloons and can be bitterly disappointed when 
they break. Margie saw that her balloon was broken. Children cry when 
they are sad. "To cry and cry" is to cry very long and hard. Margie cried 
and cried because of her sadness at her balloon's breaking. 
This is probably only a small fraction of what is lacking at the surface 
level. A program must have all this knowledge in order to get at what is 
going on. And you might object that, even if it "understands" in some 
intellectual sense what has been said, it will never really understand, until it, 
too, has cried and cried. And when will a computer do that? This is the kind 
of humanistic point which Joseph Weizenbaum is concerned with making 
in his book Computer Power and Human Reason, and I think it is an important 
issue; in fact, a very, very deep issue. Unfortunately, many AI workers at 
this time are unwilling, for various reasons, to take this sort of point 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
675 

seriously. But in some ways, those AI workers are right: it is a little 
premature to think about computers crying; we must first think about rules 
for computers to deal with language and other things; in time, we'll find 
ourselves face to face with the deeper issues. 
AI Has Far to Go 
Sometimes it seems that there is such a complete absence of rule-governed 
behavior that human beings just aren't rule-governed. But this is an 
illusion-a little like thinking that crystals and metals emerge from rigid 
underlying laws, but that fluids or flowers don't. We'll come back to this 
question in the next Chapter. 
The process of logic itself working internally in the brain may be more 
analogous to a succession of operations with symbolic pictures, a sort of 
abstract analogue of the Chinese alphabet or some Mayan description of 
events-except that the elements are not merely words but more like sen-
tences or whole stories with linkages between them forming a sort of meta- or 
super-logic with its own rules.5 
It is hard for most specialists to express vividly-perhaps even to 
remember-what originally sparked them to enter their field. Conversely, 
someone on the outside may understand a field's special romance and may 
be able to articulate it precisely. I think that is why this quote from Ulam 
has appeal for me, because it poetically conveys the strangeness of the 
enterprise of AI, and yet shows faith in it. And one must run on faith at this 
point, for there is so far to go! 
Ten Questions and Speculations 
To conclude this Chapter, I would like to present ten "Questions and 
Speculations" about AI. I would not make so bold as to call them 
"Answers"-these are my personal opinions. They may well change in 
some ways, as I learn more and as AI develops more. (In what follows, the 
term "AI program" means a program which is far ahead of today's pro-
grams; it means an "Actually Intelligent" program. Also, the words "pro-
gram" and "computer" probably carr} overly mechanistic connotations, but 
let us stick with them anyway.) 
Question: Will a computer program ever write beautiful music? 
Speculation: Yes, but not soon. Music is a language of emotions, and 
until programs have emotions as complex as ours, there is no way a 
program will write anything beautiful. There can be "forgeries"-
shallow imitations of the syntax of earlier music-but despite what one 
might think at first, there is much more to musical expression than can 
be captured in syntactical rules. There will be no new kinds of beauty 
turned up for a long time by computer music-composing programs. 
Let me carry this thought a little further. To think-and I have heard 
676 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

this suggested-that we might soon be able to command a prepro-
grammed mass-produced mail-order twenty-dollar desk-model "music 
box" to bring forth from its sterile circuitry pieces which Chopin or 
Bach might have written had they lived longer is a grotesque and 
shameful misestimation of the depth of the human spirit. A "program" 
which could produce music as they did would have to wander around 
the world on its own, fighting its way through the maze of life and 
feeling every moment of it. It would have to understand the joy and 
loneliness of a chilly night wind, the longing for a cherished hand, the 
inaccessibility of a distant town, the heartbreak and regeneration after 
a human death. It would have to have known resignation and world-
weariness, grief and despair, determination and victory, piety and awe. 
In it would have had to commingle such opposites as hope and fear, 
anguish and jubilation, serenity and suspense. Part and parcel of it 
would have to be a sense of grace, humor, rhythm, a sense of the 
unexpected-and of course an exquisite awareness of the magic of 
fresh creation. Therein, and therein only, lie the sources of meaning in 
music. 
Question: Will emotions be explicitly programmed into a machine? 
Speculation: No. That is ridiculous. Any direct simulation of 
emotions-PARRY, for example-cannot approach the complexity of 
human emotions, which arise indirectly from the organization of our 
minds. Programs or machines will acquire emotions in the same way: 
as by-products of their structure, of the way in which they are 
organized-not by direct programming. Thus, for example, nobody 
will write a "falling-in-Iove" subroutine, any more than they would 
write a "mistake-making" subroutine. "Falling in love" is a description 
which we attach to a complex process of a complex system; there need 
be no single module inside the system which is solely responsible for it, 
however! 
Question: Will a thinking computer be able to add fast? 
Speculation: Perhaps not. We ourselves are composed of hardware 
which does fancy calculations but that doesn't mean that our symbol 
level, where "we" are, knows how to carry out the same fancy calcula-
tions. Let me put it this way: there's no way that you can load numbers 
into your own neurons to add up your grocery bill. Luckily for you, 
your symbol level (i.e., you) can't gain access to the neurons which are 
doing your thinking-otherwise you'd get addle-brained. To para-
phrase Descartes again: 
"I think; therefore I have no access 
to the level where I sum." 
Why should it not be the same for an intelligent program? It mustn't 
be allowed to gain access to the circuits which are doing its thinking-
otherwise it'll get addle-CPU'd. Quite seriously, a machine that can 
pass the Turing test may well add as slowly as you or I do, and for 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
677 

similar reasons. It will represent the number 2 not just by the two bits 
"10", but as a full-fledged concept the way we do, replete with associa-
tions such as its homonyms "too" and "to", the words "couple" and 
"deuce", a host of mental images such as dots on dominos, the shape of 
the numeral '2', the notions of alternation, evenness, oddness, and on 
and on ... With all this "extra baggage" to carry around, an intelligent 
program will become quite slothful in its adding. Of course, we could 
give it a "pocket calculator", so to speak (or build one in). Then it could 
answer very fast, but its performance would be just like that of a 
person with a pocket calculator. There would be two separate parts to 
the machine: a reliable but mindless part and an intelligent but fallible 
part. You couldn't rely on the composite system to be reliable, any 
more than a composite of person and machine is necessarily reliable. 
So if it's right answers you're after, better stick to the pocket calculator 
alone-don't throw in the intelligence! 
Question: Will there be chess programs that can beat anyone? 
Speculation: No. There may be programs which can beat anyone at 
chess, but they will not be exclusively chess players. They will be 
programs of general intelligence, and they will be just as temperamen-
tal as people. "Do you want to play chess?" "No, I'm bored with chess. 
Let's talk about poetry." That may be the kind of dialogue you could 
have with a program that could beat everyone. That is because real 
intelligence inevitably depends on a total overview capacity-that is, a 
programmed ability to '~ump out of the system", so to speak-at least 
roughly to the extent that we have that ability. Once that is present, 
you can't contain the program; it's gone beyond that certain critical 
point, and you just have to face the facts of what you've wrought. 
Question: Will there be special locations in memory which store parameters 
governing the behavior of the program, such that if you reached in 
and changed them, you would be able to make the program smarter or 
stupider or more creative or more interested in baseball? In short, 
would you be able to "tune" the program by fiddling with it on a 
relatively low level? 
Speculation: No. It would be quite oblivious to changes of any particular 
elements in memory, just as we stay almost exactly the same though 
thousands of our neurons die every day(!). If you fuss around too 
heavily, though, you'll damage it, just as if you irresponsibly did 
neurosurgery on a human being. There will be no "magic" location in 
memory where, for instance, the "IQ" of the program sits. Again, that 
will be a feature which emerges as a consequence of lower-level be-
havior, and nowhere will it sit explicitly. The same goes for such things 
as "the number of items it can hold in short-term memory", "the 
amount it likes physics", etc., etc. 
Question: Could you "tune" an AI program to act like me, or like you-or 
halfway between us? 
678 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 

Speculation: No. An intelligent program will not be chameleon-like, any 
more than people are. I t will rei yon the constancy of its memories, and 
will not be able to flit between personalities. The idea of changing 
internal parameters to "tune to a new personality" reveals a ridiculous 
underestimation of the complexity of personality. 
Question: Will there be a "heart" to an AI program, or will it simply consist 
of "senseless loops and sequences of trivial operations" (in the words of 
Marvin Minsky6)? 
Speculation: If we could see all the way to the bottom, as we can a shallow 
pond, we would surely see only "senseless loops and sequences of 
trivial operations"-and we would surely not see any "heart". Now 
there are two kinds of extremist views on AI: one says that the human 
mind is, for fundamental and mysterious reasons, unprogrammable. 
The other says that you merely need to assemble the appropriate 
"heuristic devices-multiple optimizers, pattern-recognition tricks, 
planning algebras, recursive administration procedures, and the like",1 
and you will have intelligence. I find myself somewhere in between, 
believing that the "pond" of an AI program will turn out to be so deep 
and murky that we won't be able to peer all the way to the bottom. If 
we look from the top, the loops will be invisible, just as nowadays the 
current-carrying electrons are 'invisible to most programmers. When 
we create a program that passes the Turing test, we will see a "heart" 
even though we know it's not there. 
Question: Will AI programs ever become "superintelligent"? 
Speculation: I don't know. It is not clear that we would be able to 
understand or relate to a "superintelligence", or that the concept even 
makes sense. For instance, our own intelligence is tied in with our 
speed of thought. If our reflexes had been ten times faster or slower, 
we might have developed an entirely different set of concepts with 
which to describe the world. A creature with a radically different view 
of the world may simply not have many points of contact with us. I 
have often wondered if there could be, for instance, pieces of music 
which are to Bach as Bach is to folk tunes: "Bach squared", so to speak. 
And would I be able to understand them? Maybe there is such music 
around me already, and I just don't recognize it, just as dogs don't 
understand language. The idea of superintelligence is very strange. In 
any case, I don't think of it as the aim of AI research, although if we 
ever do reach the level of human intelligence, superintelligence will 
undoubtedly be the next goal-not only for us, but for our AI-pro-
gram colleagues, too, who will be equally curious about AI and 
superintelligence. It seems quite likely that AI programs will be ex-
tremely curious about AI in general-understandably. 
Question: You seem to be saying that AI programs will be virtually identical 
to people, then. Won't there be any differences? 
Artificial Intelligence: Prospects 
679 

Speculation: Probably the differences between AI programs and people 
will be larger than the differences between most people. It is almost 
impossible to imagine that the "body" in which an AI program is 
housed would not affect it deeply. So unless it had an amazingly 
faithful replica of a human body-and why should it?-it would prob-
ably have enormously different perspectives on what is important. 
what is interesting, etc. Wittgenstein once made the amusing comment, 
"If a lion could speak, we would not understand him." It makes me 
think of Rousseau's painting of the gentle lion and the sleeping gypsy 
on the moonlit desert. But how does Wittgenstein know? My guess is 
that any AI program would, if comprehensible to us, seem pretty alien. 
For that reason, we will have a very hard time deciding when and if we 
really are dealing with an Al program, or just a "weird" program. 
Question: Will we understand what intelligence and consciousness and free 
will and "I" are when we have made an intelligent program? 
Speculation: Sort of-it all depends on what you mean by "understand". 
680 
On a gut level, each of us probably has about as good an understand-
ing as is possible of those things, to start with. It is like listening to 
music. Do you really understand Bach because you have taken him 
apart? Or did you understand it that time you felt the exhilaration in 
every nerve in your body? Do we understand how the speed of light is 
constant in every inertial reference frame? We can do the math, but no 
one in the world has a truly relativistic intuition. And probably no one 
will ever understand the mystenes of intelligence and consciousness in 
an intuitive way. Each of us can understand people, and that is probably 
about as close as you can come.

Sloth Canon 
This time, we find Achilles and the Tortoise visiting 
the dwelling of their new friend, the Sloth. 
Achilles: 
Shall I tell you of my droll footrace with Mr. T? 
Sloth: 
Please do. 
Achilles: 
It has become quite celebrated in these parts. I believe it's even 
been written up, by Zeno. 
Sloth: It sounds very exciting. 
Achilles: 
It was. You see, Mr. T began way ahead of me. He had such a 
huge head start, and yet-
Sloth: 
You caught up, didn't you? 
Achilles: 
Yes-being so fleet of foot, I diminished the distance between us 
at a constant rate, and soon overtook him. 
Sloth: 
The gap kept getting shorter and shorter, so you could. 
Achilles: 
Exactly. Oh, look-Mr. T has brought his violin. May I try play-
ing on it, Mr. T? 
Tortoise: 
Please don't. It sounds very flat. 
Achilles: 
Oh, all right. But I'm in a mood for music. I don't know why. 
Sloth: 
You can play the piano, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
Thank you. I'll try it in a moment. I just wanted to add that I also 
had another kind of "race" with Mr. T at a later date. Unfortunately, 
in that race-
Tortoise: 
You didn't catch up, did you? The gap kept getting longer and 
longer, so you couldn't. 
Achilles: 
That's true. I believe THAT race has been written up, too, by 
Lewis Carroll. Now, Mr. Sloth, I'll take up your offer of trying out the 
piano. But I'm so bad at the piano. I'm not sure I dare. 
Sloth: 
You should try. 
(Achilles sits down and starts playing a simple tune.) 
Achilles: Oh-it sounds very strange. That's not how it's supposed to 
sound at all! Something is very wrong. 
Tortoise: 
You can't play the piano, Achilles. You shouldn't try. 
Achilles: 
It's like a piano in a mirror. The high notes are on the left, and 
the low notes are on the right. Every melody comes out inverted, as if 
upside down. Who would have ever thought up something so cockeyed 
as that? 
Tortoise: 
That's so characteristic of sloths. They hang from-
Achilles: 
Yes, I know-from tree branches-upside down, of course. That 
sloth-piano would be appropriate for playing inverted melodies such

as occur in some canons and fugues. But to learn to playa piano while 
hanging from a tree must be very difficult. You must have to devote a 
great deal of energy to it. 
Sloth: 
That's not so characteristic of sloths. 
Achilles: 
No, I gather sloths like to take life very easy. They do everything 
about half as fast as normal. And upside down, to boot. What a 
peculiar way to go through life! Speaking of things that are both 
upside- and slowed-down, there's a "Canon per augmentationem, 
contra rio motu" in the Musical Offering. In my edition, the letters 
'S', 'A', 'T' are in front of the three staves. I don't know why. Anyway, I 
think Bach carried it off very skillfully. What's your opinion, Mr. T? 
Tortoise: 
He outdid himself. As for those letters "SAT", you could guess 
what they stand for. 
Achilles: 
"Soprano", "Alto", and "Tenor", I suppose. Three-part pieces 
are often written for that combination of voices. Wouldn't you agree, 
Mr. Sloth? 
Sloth: 
They stand for-
Achilles: 
Oh,just a moment, Mr. Sloth. Mr. Tortoise-why are you putting 
on your coat? You're not leaving, are you? We were just going to fix a 
snack to eat. You look very tired. How do you feel? 
Tortoise: 
Out of gas. So long! (Trudges wearily out the door.) 
Achilles: 
The poor fellow-he certainly looked exhausted. He was jogging 
all morning. He's in training for another race with me. 
Sloth: 
He did himself in. 
Achilles: 
Yes, but in vain. Maybe he could beat a Sloth ... but me? Never! 
Now-weren't you about to tell me what those letters "SAT" stand for? 
Sloth: 
As for those letters "SAT", you could never guess what they stand 
for. 
Achilles: 
Well, if they don't stand for what I thought, then my curiosity is 
piqued. Perhaps I'll think a little more about it. Say, how do you cook 
French fries? 
Sloth: 
In oil. 
Achilles: 
Oh, yes-I remember. I'll cut up this potato into strips an inch or 
two in length. 
Sloth: 
So short? 
Achilles: 
All right, already, I'll cut four-inch strips. Oh, boy, are these 
going to be good French fries! Too bad Mr. T won't be here to share 
them.

CHAPTER XX 
Strange Loops, 
Or Tangled Hierarchies 
Can Machines Possess Originality? 
IN THE CHAPTER before last, I described Arthur Samuel's very successful 
checkers program-the one which can beat its designer. In light of that, it is 
interesting to hear how Samuel himself feels about the issue of computers 
and originality. The following extracts are taken from a rebuttal by Samuel, 
written in 1960, to an article by Norbert Wiener. 
It is my conviction that machines cannot possess originality in the sense 
implied by Wiener in his thesis that "machines can and do transcend some of 
the limitations of their designers, and that in doing so they may be both 
effective and dangerous." ... 
A machine is not a genie, it does not work by magic, it does not possess a will, 
and, Wiener to the contrary, nothing comes out which has not been put in, 
barring, of course, an infrequent case of malfunctioning .... 
The "intentions" which the machine seems to manifest are the intentions of 
the human programmer, as specified in advance, or they are subsidiary 
intentions derived from these, following rules specified by the programmer. 
We can even anticipate higher levels of abstraction, just as Wiener does, in 
which the program will not only modify the subsidiary intentions but will also 
modify the rules which are used in their derivation, or in which it will modify 
the ways in which it modifies the rules, and so on, or even in which one 
machine will design and construct a second machine with enhanced 
capabilities. However, and this is important, the machine will not and cannot 
[italics are his] do any of these things until it has been instructed as to how to 
proceed. There is and logically then- must always remain a complete hiatus 
between (i) any ultimate extension and elaboration in this process of carrying 
out man's wishes and (ii) the development within the machine of a will of its 
own. To believe otherwise is either to believe in magic or to believe that the 
existence of man's will is an illusion and that man's actions are as mechanical 
as the machine's. Perhaps Wiener's article and my rebuttal have both been 
mechanically determined, but this I refuse to believe.! 
This reminds me of the Lewis Carroll Dialogue (the Two-Part Inven-
tion); I'll try to explain why. Samuel bases his argument against machine 
consciousness (or will) on the notion that any mechanical instantiation of will 
would require an infinite regress. Similarly, Carroll's Tortoise argues that no 
step of reasoning, no matter how simple, can be done without invoking 
some rule on a higher level to justify the step in question. But that being 
684 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

also a step of reasoning, one must resort to a yet higher-level rule, and so 
on. Conclusion: Reasoning involves an infinite regress. 
Of course something is wrong with the Tortoise's argument, and I 
believe something analogous is wrong with Samuel's argument. To show 
how the fallacies are analogous, I now shall "help the Devil", by arguing 
momentarily as Devil's advocate. (Since, as is well known, God helps those 
who help themselves, presumably the Devil helps all those, and only those, 
who don't help themselves. Does the Devil help himself?) Here are my 
devilish conclusions drawn from the Carroll Dialogue: 
The conclusion "reasoning is impossible" does not apply to 
people, because as is plain to anyone, we do manage to carry out 
many steps of reasoning, all the higher levels notwithstanding. 
That shows that we humans operate without need of rules: we are 
"informal systems". On the other hand, as an argument against 
the possibility of any mechanical instantiation of reasoning, it is 
valid, for any mechanical reasoning-system would have to depend 
on rules explicitly, and so it couldn't get off the ground unless it 
had metarules telling it when to apply its rules, metametarules 
telling it when to apply its metarules, and so on. We may conclude 
that the ability to reason can never be mechanized. It is a uniquely 
human capability. 
What is wrong with this Devil's advocate point of view? It is obviously 
the assumption that a machine cannot do anything without having a rule telling it 
to do so. In fact, machines get around the Tortoise's silly objections as easily 
as people do, and moreover for exactly the same reason: both machines 
and people are made of hardware which runs all by itself, according to the 
laws of physics. There is no need to rely on "rules that permit you to apply 
the rules", because the lowest-level rules-those without any "meta" 's in 
front-are embedded in the hardware, and they run without permission. 
Moral: The Carroll Dialogue doesn't say anything about the differences 
between people and machines, after all. (And indeed, reasoning is 
mechanizable. ) 
So much for the Carroll Dialogue. On to Samuel's argument. Samuel's 
point, if I may caricature it, is this: 
No computer ever "wants" to do anything, because it was pro-
grammed by someone else. Only if it could program itself from 
zero on up-an absurdity-would it have its own sense of desire. 
In his argument, Samuel reconstructs the Tortoise's position, replacing "to 
reason" by "to want". He implies that behind any mechanization of desire, 
there has to be either an infinite regress or worse, a closed loop. If this is 
why computers have no will of their own, what about people? The same 
criterion would imply that 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
685 

Unless a person designed himself and chose his own wants (as well 
as choosing to choose his own wants, etc.), he cannot be said to 
have a will of his own. 
It makes you pause to think where your sense of having a will comes 
from. Unless you are a soulist, you'll probably say that it comes from your 
brain-a piece of hardware which you did not design or choose. And yet 
that doesn't diminish your sense that you want certain things, and not 
others. You aren't a "self-programmed object" (whatever that would be), 
but you still do have a sense of desires, and it springs from the physical 
substrate of your mentality. Likewise, machines may someday have wills 
despite the fact that no magic program spontaneously appears in memory 
from out of nowhere (a "self-programmed program"). They will have wills 
for much the same reason as you do-by reason of organization and 
structure on many levels of hardware and software. Moral: The Samuel 
argument doesn't say anything about the differences between people and 
machines, after all. (And indeed, will will be mechanized.) 
Below Every Tangled Hierarchy Lies An Inviolate Level 
Right after the Two-Part Invention, I wrote that a central issue of this book 
would be: "Do words and thoughts follow formal rules?" One major thrust 
of the book has been to point out the many-Ieveledness of the mindlbrain, 
and I have tried to show why the ultimate answer to the question is, 
"Yes-provided that you go down to the lowest level-the hardware-to 
find the rules." 
Now Samuel's statement brought up a concept which I want to pursue. 
It is this: When we humans think, we certainly do change our own mental 
rules, and we change the rules that change the rules, and on and on-but 
these are, so to speak, "software rules". However, the rules at bottom do not 
change. Neurons run in the same simple way the whole time. You can't 
"think" your neurons into running some nonneural way, although you can 
make your mind change style or subject of thought. Like Achilles in the 
Prelude, Ant Fugue, you have access to your thoughts but not to your 
neurons. Software rules on various levels can change; hardware rules 
cannot-in fact, to their rigidity is due the software's flexibility! Not a 
paradox at all, but a fundamental, simple fact about the mechanisms of 
intelligence. 
This distinction between self-modifiable software and inviolate 
hardware is what I wish to pursue in this final Chapter, developing it into a 
set of variations on a theme. Some of the variations may seem to be quite 
far-fetched, but I hope that by the time I close the loop by returning to 
brains, minds, and the sensation of consciousness, you will have found an 
invariant core in all the variations. 
My main aim in this Chapter is to communicate some of the images 
which help me to visualize how consciousness rises out of the jungle of 
neurons; to communicate a set of intangible intuitions, in the hope that 
686 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

these intuitions are valuable and may perhaps help others a little to come to 
clearer formulations of their own images of what makes minds run. I could 
not hope for more than that my own mind's blurry images of minds and 
images should catalyze the formation of sharper images of minds and 
images in other minds. 
A Self-Modifying Game 
A first variation, then, concerns games in which on your turn, you may 
modify the rules. Think of chess. Clearly the rules stay the same, just the 
board position changes on each move. But let's invent a variation in which, 
on your turn, you can either make a move or change the rules. But how? At 
liberty? Can you turn it into checkers? Clearly such anarchy would be 
pointless. There must be some constraints. For instance, one version might 
allow you to redefine the knight's move. Instead of being l-and-then-2, it 
could be m-and-then- n where m and n are arbitrary natural numbers; and 
on your turn you could change either m or n by plus or minus I. So it 
could go from 1-2 to 1-3 to 0-3 to 0-4 to 0-5 to 1-5 to 2-5 ... Then there 
could be rules about redefining the bishop's moves, and the other pieces' 
moves as well. There could be rules about adding new squares, or deleting 
old squares ... 
Now we have two layers of rules: those which tell how to move pieces, 
and those which tell how to change the rules. So we have rules and 
metarules. The next step is obvious: introduce metametarules by which we 
can change the metarules. It is not so obvious how to do this. The reason it 
is easy to formulate rules for moving pieces is that pieces move in a 
formalized space: the checkerboard. If you can devise a simple formal 
notation for expressing rules and metarules, then to manipulate them will 
be like manipulating strings formally, or even like manipulating chess 
pieces. To carry things to their logical extreme, you could even express 
rules and metarules as positions on auxiliary chess boards. Then an arbi-
trary chess position could be read as a game, or as a set of rules, or as a set 
of metarules, etc., depending on which interpretation you place on it. Of 
course, both players would have to agree on conventions for interpreting 
the notation. 
Now we can have any number of adjacent chess boards: one for the 
game, one for rules, one for metarules, one for metametarules, and so on, 
as far as you care to carry it. On your turn, you may make a move on any 
one of the chess boards except the top-level one, using the rules which 
apply (they come from the next chess board up in the hierarchy). 
Undoubtedly both players would get quite disoriented by the fact that 
almost anything-though not everything!-can change. By definition, the 
top-level chess board can't be changed, because you don't have rules telling 
how to change it. It is inviolate. There is more that is inviolate: the conven-
tions by which the different boards are interpreted, the agreement to take 
turns, the agreement that each person may change one chess board each 
turn-and you will find more if you examine the idea carefully. 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
687 

Now it is possible to go considerably further in removing the pillars by 
which orientation is achieved. One step at a time ... We begin by collapsing 
the whole array of boards into a single board. What is meant by this? There 
will be two ways of interpreting the board: (1) as pieces to be moved; (2) as 
rules for moving the pieces. On your turn, you move pieces-and perforce, 
you change rules! Thus, the rules constantly change themselves. Shades of 
Typogenetics-or for that matter, of real genetics. The distinction between 
game, rules, metarules, metametarules, has been lost. What was once a nice 
clean hierarchical setup has become a Strange Loop, Or Tangled Hierar-
chy. The moves change the rules, the rules determine the moves, round 
and round the mulberry bush ... There are still different levels, but the 
distinction between "lower" and "higher" has been wiped out. 
Now, part of what was inviolate has been made changeable. But there 
is s.till plenty that is inviolate. Just as before, there are conventions between 
you and your opponent by which you interpret the board as a collection of 
rules. There is the agreement to take turns-and probably other implicit 
conventions, as well. Notice, therefore, that the notion of different levels 
has survived, in an unexpected way. There is an Inviolate level-let's call it 
the I-level-on which the interpretation conventions reside; there is also a 
Tangled level-the T-level-on which the Tangled Hierarchy resides. So 
these two levels are still hierarchical: the I-level governs what happens on 
the T-Ievel, but the T-Ievel does not and cannot affect the I-level. No 
matter that the T -level itself is a Tangled Hierarchy-it is still governed by 
a set of conventions outside of itself. And that is the important point. 
As you have no doubt imagined, there is nothing to stop us from doing 
the "impossible"-namely, tangling the I-level and the T-Ievel by making 
the interpretation conventions themselves subject to revision, according to 
the position on the ches& board. But in order to carry out such a "super-
tangling", you'd have to agree with your opponent on some further con-
ventions connecting the two levels--and the act of doing so would create a 
new level, a new sort of inviolate level on top of the "supertangled" level (or 
underneath it, if you prefer). And this could continue going on and on. In 
fact, the "jumps" which are being made are very similar to those charted in 
the Birthday Cantatatata, and in the repeated Godelization applied to various 
improvements on TNT. Each time you think you have reached the end, 
there is some new variation on the theme of jumping out of the system 
which requires a kind of creativity to spot. 
The Authorship Triangle Again 
But I am not interested in pursuing the strange topic of the ever more 
abstruse tanglings which can arise in self-modifying chess. The point of this 
has been to show, in a somewhat graphic way, how in any system there is 
always some "protected" level which is unassailable by the rules on other 
levels, no matter how tangled their interaction may be among themselves. 
An amusing riddle from Chapter IV illustrates this same idea in a slightly 
different context. Perhaps it will catch you off guard: 
688 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

FIGURE 134. An "authorship triangle". 
There are three authors-Z, T, and E. Now it happens that Z 
exists only in a novel by T. Likewise, T exists only in a novel by E. 
And strangely, E, too, exists only in a novel-by Z, of course. Now, 
is such an "authorship triangle" really possible? (See Fig. 134.) 
Of course it's possible. But there's a trick ... All three authors Z, T, E, are 
themselves characters in another novel-by H! You can think of the Z-T-E 
triangle as a Strange Loop, Or Tangled Hierarchy; but author H is outside 
of the space in which that tangle takes place-author H is in an inviolate 
space. Although Z, T, and E all have access-direct or indirect-to each 
other, and can do dastardly things to each other in their various novels, 
none of them can touch H's life! They can't even imagine him-no more 
than you can imagine the author of the book you're a character in. If I were 
to draw author H, I would represent him somewhere off the page. Of 
course that would present a problem, since drawing a thing necessarily puts 
it onto the page ... Anyway, H is really outside of the world of Z, T, and E, 
and should be represented as being so. 
Escher's Drawing Hands 
Another classic variation on our theme is the Escher picture of Drawing 
Hands (Fig. 135). Here, a left hand (LH) draws a right hand (RH), while at 
the same time, RH draws LH. Once again, levels which ordinarily are seen 
as hierarchical-that which draws, and that which is drawn-turn back on 
each other, creating a Tangled Hierarchy. But the theme of the Chapter is 
borne out, of course, since behind it all lurks the undrawn but drawing 
hand of M. C. Escher, creator of both LH and RH. Escher is outside of the 
two-hand space, and in my schematic version of his picture (Fig. 136), you 
can see that explicitly. In this schematized representation of the Escher 
picture, you see the Strange Loop, Or Tangled Hierarchy at the top; also, 
you see the Inviolate Level below it, enabling it to come into being. One 
could further Escherize the Escher picture, by taking a photograph of a 
hand drawing it. And so on.

Brain and Mind: 
A Neural Tangle Supporting a Symbol Tangle 
Now we can relate this to the brain, as well as to AI programs. In our 
thoughts, symbols activate other symbols, and all interact heterarchically. 
Furthermore, the symbols may cause each other to change internally, in the 
fashion of programs acting on other programs. The illusion is created, 
because of the Tangled Hierarchy of symbols, that there is no inviolate level. 
One thinks there is no such level because that level is shielded from our 
view. 
If it were possible to schematize this whole image, there would be a 
gigantic forest of symbols linked to each other by tangly lines like vines in a 
tropical jungle-this would be the top level, the Tangled Hierarchy where 
thoughts really flow back and forth. This is the elusive level of mind: the 
analogue to LH and RH. Far below in the schematic picture, analogous to 
the invisible "prime mover" Escher, there would be a representation of the 
myriad neurons-the "inviolate substrate" which lets the tangle above it 
come into being. Interestingly, this other level is itself a tangle in a literal 
sense-billions of cells and hundreds of billions ofaxons, joining them all 
together. 
This is an interesting case where a software tangle, that of the symbols, 
is supported by a hardware tangle, that of the neurons. But only the symbol 
tangle is a Tangled Hierarchy. The neural tangle is just a "simple" tangle. 
This distinction is pretty much the same as that between Strange Loops and 
feedback, which I mentioned in Chapter XVI. A Tangled Hierarchy occurs 
when what you presume are clean hierarchical levels take you by surprise 
and fold back in a hierarchy-violating way. The surprise element is impor-
tant; it is the reason I call Strange Loops "strange". A simple tangle, like 
feedback, doesn't involve violations of presumed level distinctions. An 
example is when you're in the shower and you wash your left arm with your 
right, and then vice versa. There is no strangeness to the image. Escher 
didn't choose to draw hands drawing hands for nothing! 
Events such as two arms washing each other happen all the time in the 
world, and we don't notice them particularly. I say something to you, then 
you say something back to me. Paradox? No; our perceptions of each other 
didn't involve a hierarchy to begin with, so there is no sense of strangeness. 
On the other hand, where language does create strange loops is when 
it talks about itself, whether directly or indirectly. Here, something in the 
system jumps out and acts on the system, as if it were outside the system. 
What bothers us is perhaps an ill-defined sense of topological wrongness: 
the inside-outside distinction is being blurred, as in the famous shape called 
a "Klein bottle". Even though the system is an abstraction, our minds use 
spatial imagery with a sort of mental topology. 
Getting back to the symbol tangle, if we look only at it, and forget the 
neural tangle, then we seem to see a self-programmed object-in just the 
same way as we seem to see a self-drawn picture if we look at Drawing Hands 
and somehow fall for the illusion, by forgetting the existence of Escher. For 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
691 

the picture, this is unlikely-but for humans and the way they look at their 
minds, this is usually what happens. Wefeel self-programmed. Indeed, we 
couldn't feel any other way, for we are shielded from the lower levels, the 
neural tangle. Our thoughts seem to run about in their own space, creating 
new thoughts and modifying old ones, and we never notice any neurons 
helping us out! But that is to be expected. We can't. 
An analogous double-entendre can happen with LISP programs that 
are designed to reach in and change their own structure. If you look at 
them on the LISP level, you will say that they change themselves; but if you 
shift levels, and think of LISP programs as data to the LISP interpreter (see 
Chapter X), then in fact the sole program that is running is the interpreter, 
and the changes being made are merely changes in pieces of data. The 
LISP interpreter itself is shielded from changes. 
How you describe a tangled situation of this sort depends how far back 
you step before describing. If you step far enough back, you can often see 
the clue that allows you to untangle things. 
Strange Loops in Government 
A fascinating area where hierarchies tangle is government-particularly in 
the courts. Ordinarily, you think of two disputants arguing their cases in 
court, and the court adjudicating the matter. The court is on a different 
level from the disputants. But strange things can start to happen when the 
courts themselves get entangled in legal cases. Usually there is a higher 
court which is outside the dispute. Even if two lower courts get involved in 
some sort of strange fight, with each one claiming jurisdiction over the 
other, some higher court is outside, and in some sense it is analogous to the 
inviolate interpretation conventions which we discussed in the warped 
version of chess. 
But what happens when there is no higher court, and the Supreme 
Court itself gets all tangled up in legal troubles? This sort of snarl nearly 
happened in the Watergate era. The President threatened to obey only a 
"definitive ruling" of the Supreme Court-then claimed he had the right to 
decide what is "definitive". Now that threat never was made good; but if it 
had been, it would have touched off a monumental confrontation between 
two levels of government, each of which, in some ways, can validly claim to 
be "above" the other-and to whom is there recourse to decide which one is 
right? To say "Congress" is not to settle the matter, for Congress might 
command the President to obey the Supreme Court, yet the President 
might still refuse, claiming that he has the legal right to disobey the 
Supreme Court (and Congress!) under certain circumstances. This would 
create a new court case, and would throw the whole system into disarray, 
because it would be so unexpected, so Tangled-so Strange! 
The irony is that once you hit your head against the ceiling like this, 
where you are prevented from jumping out of the system to a yet higher 
authority, the only recourse is to forces which seem less well defined by 
692 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

rules, but which are the only source of higher-level rules anyway: the 
lower-level rules, which in this case means the general reaction of society. It 
is well to remember that in a society like ours, the legal system is, in a sense, 
a polite gesture granted collectively by millions of people-and it can be 
overridden just as easily as a river can overflow its banks. Then a seeming 
anarchy takes over; but anarchy has its own kinds of rules, no less than does 
civilized society: it is just that they operate from the bottom up, not from 
the top down. A student of anarchy could try to discover rules according to 
which anarchic situations develop in time, and very likely there are some 
such rules. 
An analogy from physics is useful here. As was mentioned earlier in 
the book, gases in equilibrium obey simple laws connecting their tempera-
ture, pressure, and volume. However, a gas can violate those laws (as a 
President can violate laws)-provided it is not in a state of equilibrium. In 
nonequilibrium situations, to describe what happens, a physicist has re-
course only to statistical mechanics-that is, to a level of description which 
is not macroscopic, for the ultimate explanation of a gas's behavior always 
lies on the molecular level, just as the ultimate explanation of a society's 
political behavior always lies at the "grass roots level". The field of 
nonequilibrium thermodynamics attempts to find macroscopic laws to de-
scribe the behavior of gases (and other systems) which are out of equilib-
rium. It is the analogue to the branch of political science which would 
search for laws governing anarchical societies. 
Other curious tangles which arise in government include the FBI 
investigating its own wrongdoings, a sheriff going to jail while in office, the 
self-application of the parliamentary rules of procedure, and so on. One of 
the most curious legal cases I ever heard of involved a person who claimed 
to have psychic powers. In fact, he claimed to be able to use his psychic 
powers to detect personality traits, and thereby to aid lawyers in picking 
juries. Now what if this "psychic" has to stand trial himself one day? What 
effect might this have on a jury member who believes staunchly in ESP? 
How much will he feel affected by the psychic (whether or not the psychic is 
genuine)? The territory is ripe for exploitation-a great area for self-
fulfilling prophecies. 
Tangles Involving Science and the Occult 
Speaking of psychics and ESP, another sphere of life where strange loops 
abound is fringe science. What fringe science does is to call into question 
many of the standard procedures or beliefs of orthodox science, and 
thereby challenge the objectivity of science. New ways of interpreting 
evidence that rival the established ones are presented. But how do you 
evaluate a way of interpreting evidence? Isn't this precisely the problem of 
objectivity all over again,just on a higher plane? Of course. Lewis Carroll's 
infinite-regress paradox appears in a new guise. The Tortoise would argue 
that if you want to show that A is a fact, you need evidence: B. But what 
makes you sure that B is evidence of A? To show that, you need meta-
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
693 

evidence: C. And for the validity of that meta-evidence, you need meta-
meta-evidence-and so on, ad nauseam. Despite this argument, people 
have an intuitive sense of evidence. This is because-to repeat an old 
refrain-people have built-in hardware in their brains that includes some 
rudimentary ways of interpreting evidence. We can build on this, and 
accumulate new ways of interpreting evidence; we even learn how and 
when to override our most basic mechanisms of evidence interpretation, as 
one must, for example, in trying to figure out magic tricks. 
Concrete examples of evidence dilemmas crop up in regard to many 
phenomena of fringe science. For instance, ESP often seems to manifest 
itself outside of the laboratory, but when brought into the laboratory, it 
vanishes mysteriously. The standard scientific explanation for this is that 
ESP is a nonreal phenomenon which cannot stand up to rigorous scrutiny. 
Some (by no means all) believers in ESP have a peculiar way of fighting 
back, however. They say, "No, ESP is real; it simply goes away when one 
tries to observe it scientifically-it is contrary to the nature of a scientific 
worldview." This is an amazingly brazen technique, which we might call 
"kicking the problem upstairs". What that means is, instead of questioning 
the matter at hand, you call into doubt theories belonging to a higher level 
of credibility. The believers in ESP insinuate that what is wrong is not their 
ideas, but the belief system of science. This is a pretty grandiose claim, and 
unless there is overwhelming evidence for it, one should be skeptical of it. 
But then here we are again, talking about "overwhelming evidence" as if 
everyone agreed on what that means! 
The Nature of Evidence 
The Sagredo-Simplicio-Salviati tangle, mentioned in Chapters XIII and 
XV, gives another example of the complexities of evaluation of evidence. 
Sagredo tries to find some objective compromise, if possible, between the 
opposing views of Simplicio and Salviati. But compromise may not always 
be possible. How can one compromise "fairly" between right and wrong? 
Between fair and unfair? Between compromise and no compromise? These 
questions come up over and over again in disguised form in arguments 
about ordinary things. 
Is it possible to define what evidence is? Is it possible to lay down laws 
as to how to make sense out of situations? Probably not, for any rigid rules 
would undoubtedly have exceptions, and nonrigid rules are not rules. 
Having an intelligent AI program would not solve the problem either, for 
as an evidence processor, it would not be any less fallible than humans are. 
So, if evidence is such an intangible thing after all, why am I warning 
against new ways of interpreting evidence? Am I being inconsistent? In this 
case, I don't think so. My feeling is that there are guidelines which one can 
give, and out of them an organic synthesis can be made. But inevitably 
some amount of judgment and intuition must enter the picture-things 
which are different in different people. They will also be different in 
694 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

different AI programs. Ultimately, there are complicated criteria for decid-
ing if a method of evaluation of evidence is good. One involves the "useful-
ness" of ideas which are arrived at by that kind of reasoning. Modes of 
thought which lead to useful new things in life are deemed "valid" in some 
sense. But this word "useful" is extremely subjective. 
My feeling is that the process by which we decide what is valid or what 
is true is an art; and that it relies as deeply on a sense of beauty and 
simplicity as it does on rock-solid principles of logic or reasoning or any-
thing else which can be objectively formalized. I am not saying either (1) 
truth is a chimera, or (2) human intelligence is in principle not program-
mable. I am saying (l) truth is too elusive for any human or any collection of 
humans ever to attain fully; and (2) Artificial Intelligence, when it reaches 
the level of human intelligence-or even if it surpasses it-will still be 
plagued by the problems of art, beauty, and simplicity, and will run up 
against these things constantly in its own search for knowledge and under-
standing. 
"What is evidence?" is not just a philosophical question, for it intrudes 
into life in all sorts of places. You are faced with an extraordinary number 
of choices as to how to interpret evidence at every moment. You can hardly 
go into a bookstore (or these days, even a grocery store!) without seeing 
books on clairvoyance, ESP, UFO's, the Bermuda triangle, astrology, dows-
ing, evolution versus creation, black holes, psi fields, biofeedback, trans-
cendental meditation, new theories of psychology ... In science, there are 
fierce debates about catastrophe theory, elementary particle theory, black 
holes, truth and existence in mathematics, free will, Artificial Intelligence, 
reductionism versus holism ... On the more pragmatic side of life, there 
are debates over the efficacy of vitamin C or of laetrile, over the real size of 
oil reserves (either underground or stored), over what causes inflation and 
unemployment-and on and on. There is Buckminster Fullerism, Zen 
Buddhism, Zeno's paradoxes, psychoanalysis, etc., etc. From issues as trivial 
as where books ought to be shelved in a store, to issues as vital as what ideas 
are to be taught to children in schools, ways of interpreting evidence play 
an inestimable role. 
Seeing Oneself 
One of the most severe of all problems of evidence interpretation is that of 
trying to interpret all the confusing signals from the outside as to who one 
is. In this case, the potential for intralevel and interlevel conflict is tre-
mendous. The psychic mechanisms have to deal simultaneously with the 
individual's internal need for self-esteem and the constant flow of evidence 
from the outside affecting the self-image. The result is that information 
flows in a complex swirl between different levels of the personality; as it 
goes round and round, parts of it get magnified, reduced, negated, or 
otherwise distorted, and then those parts in turn get further subjected to 
the same sort of swirl, over and over again-all of this in an attempt to 
reconcile what is, with what we wish were (see Fig. 81). 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies

The upshot is that the total picture of "who I am" is integrated in some 
enormously complex way inside the entire mental structure, and contains 
in each one of us a large number of unresolved, possibly unresolvable, 
inconsistencies. These undoubtedly provide much of the dynamic tension 
which is so much a part of being human. Out of this tension between the 
inside and outside notions of who we are come the drives towards various 
goals that make each of us unique. Thus, ironically, something which we all 
have in common-the fact of being self-reflecting conscious beings-leads 
to the rich diversity in the ways we have of internalizing evidence about all 
sorts of things, and in the end winds up being one of the major forces in 
creating distinct individuals. 
Godel's Theorem and Other Disciplines 
It is natural to try to draw parallels between people and sufficiently compli-
cated formal systems which, like people, have "self-images" of a sort. 
Godel's Theorem shows that there are fundament;\l limitations to consis-
tent formal systems with self-images. But is it more general? Is there a 
"Godel's Theorem of psychology", for instance? 
If one uses Godel's Theorem as a metaphor, as a source of inspiration, 
rather than trying to translate it literally into the language of psychology or 
of any other discipline, then perhaps it can suggest new truths in psychol-
ogy or other areas. But it is quite unjustifiable to translate it directly into a 
statement of another discipline and take that as equally valid. It would be a 
large mistake to think that what has been worked out with the utmost 
delicacy in mathematical logic should hold without modification in a com-
pletely different area. 
Introspection and Insanity: A Godelian Problem 
I think it can have suggestive value to translate Godel's Theorem into other 
domains, provided one specifies in advance that the translations are 
metaphorical and are not intended to be taken literally. That having been 
said, I see two major ways of using analogies to connect Godel's Theorem 
and human thoughts. One involves the problem of wondering about one's 
sanity. How can you figure out if you are sane? This is a Strange Loop 
indeed. Once you begin to question your own sanity, you can get trapped in 
an ever-tighter vortex of self-fulfilling prophecies, though the process is by 
no means inevitable. Everyone knows that the insane interpret the world 
via their own peculiarly consistent logic; how can you tell if your own logic 
is "peculiar" or not, given that you ha ve only your own logic to judge itself? 
I don't see any answer. I am just reminded of Godel's second Theorem, 
which implies that the only versions of formal number theory which assert 
their own consistency are inconsistent ... 
696 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

Can We Understand Our Own Minds or Brains? 
The other metaphorical analogue to Godel's Theorem which I find pro-
vocative suggests that ultimately, we cannot understand our own minds/ 
brains. This is such a lo:tded, many-leveled idea that one must be extremely 
cautious in proposing it. What does "understanding our own mindslbrains" 
mean? It could mean having a general sense of how they work, as 
mechanics have a sense of how cars work. It could mean having a complete 
explanation for why people do any and all things they do. It could mean 
having a complete understanding of the physical structure of one's own 
brain on all levels. It could mean having a complete wiring diagram of a 
brain in a book (or library or computer). It could mean knowing, at every 
instant, precisely what is happening in one's own brain on the neural 
level--each firing, each synaptic alteration, and so on. It could mean having 
written a program which passes the Turing test. It could mean knowing 
oneself so perfectly that such notions as the subconscious and the intuition 
make no sense, because everything is out in the open. It could mean any 
number of other things. 
Which of these types of self-mirroring, if any, does the self-mirroring 
in GOdel's Theorem most resemble? I would hesitate to say. Some of them 
are quite silly. For instance, the idea of being able to monitor your own 
brain state in all its detail is a pipe dream, an absurd and uninteresting 
proposition to start with; and if Godel's Theorem suggests that it is impos-
sible, that is hardly a revelation. On the other hand, the age-old goal of 
knowing yourself in some profound way-let us call it "understanding your 
own psychic structure"-has a ring of plausibility to it. But might there not 
be some vaguely Godelian loop which limits the depth to which any indi-
vidual can penetrate into his own psyche? Just as we cannot see our faces 
with our own eyes, is it not reasonable to expect that we cannot mirror our 
complete mental structures in the symbols which carry them out? 
All the limitative Theorems of metamathematics and the theory of 
computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure 
has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees 
that you can never represent yourself totally. Godel's Incompleteness The-
orem, Church's Undecidability Theorem, Turing's Halting Theorem, 
Tarski's Truth Theorem-all have the flavor of some ancient fairy tale 
which warns you that "To seek self-knowledge is to embark on a journey 
which ... will always be incomplete, cannot be charted on any map, will 
never halt, cannot be described." 
But do the limitative Theorems have any bearing on people? Here is 
one way of arguing the case. Either I am consistent or I am inconsistent. 
(The latter is much more likely, but for completeness' sake, I consider both 
possibilities.) If I am consistent, then there are two cases. (1) The "low-
fidelity" case: my self-understanding is below a certain critical point. In this 
case, I am incomplete by hypothesis. (2) The "high-fidelity" case: My 
self-understanding has reached the critical point where a metaphorical 
analogue of the limitative Theorems does apply, so my self-understanding 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
697 

undermines itself in a Godelian way, and I am incomplete for that reason. 
Cases (1) and (2) are predicated on my being 100 per cent consistent-a 
very unlikely state of affairs. More likely is that I am inconsistent-but 
that's worse, for then inside me there are contradictions, and how can I 
ever understand that? 
Consistent or inconsistent, no one is exempt from the mystery of the 
self. Probably we are all inconsistent. The world is just too complicated for a 
person to be able to afford the luxury of reconciling all of his beliefs with 
each other. Tension and confusion are important in a world where many 
decisions must be made quickly. Miguel de Unamuno once said, "If a 
person never contradicts himself, it must be that he says nothing." I would 
say that we all are in the same boat as the Zen master who, after contradict-
ing himself several times in a row, said to the confused Doko, "I cannot 
understand myself." 
Godel's Theorem and Personal Nonexistence 
Perhaps the greatest contradiction in our lives, the hardest to handle, is the 
knowledge "There was a time when I was not alive, and there will come a 
time when I am not alive." On one level, when you "step out of yourself" 
and see yourself as ')ust another human being", it makes complete sense. 
But on another level, perhaps a deeper level, personal nonexistence makes 
no sense at all. All that we know is embedded inside our minds, and for all 
that to be absent from the universe is not comprehensible. This is a basic 
undeniable problem of life; perhaps it is the best metaphorical analogue of 
Godel's Theorem. When you try to imagine your own nonexistence, you 
have to try to jump out of yourself, by mapping yourself onto someone else. 
You fool yourself into believing that you can import an outsider's view of 
yourself into you, much as TNT "believes" it mirrors its own metatheory 
inside itself. But TNT only contains its own metatheory up to a certain 
extent-not fully. And as for you, though you may imagine that you have 
jumped out of yourself, you never can actually do so-no more than 
Escher's dragon can jump out of its native two-dimensional plane into three 
dimensions. In any case., this contradiction is so great that most of our lives 
we just sweep the whole mess under the rug, because trying to deal with it 
just leads nowhere. 
Zen minds, on the other hand, revel in this irreconcilability. Over and 
over again, they face the conflict between the Eastern belief: "The world 
and I are one, so the notion of my ceasing to exist is a contradiction in 
terms" (my verbalization is undoubtedly too Westernized-apologies to 
Zenists), and the Western belief: "I am just part of the world, and I will die, 
but the world will go on without me." 
Science and Dualism 
Science is often criticized as being too "Western" or "dualistic"-that is, 
being permeated by the dichotomy between subject and object, or observer 
698 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

and observed. While it is true that up until this century, science was 
exclusively concerned with things which can be readily distinguished from 
their human observers-such as oxygen and carbon, light and heat, stars 
and planets, accelerations and orbits, and so on-this phase of science was a 
necessary prelude to the more modern phase, in which life itself has come 
under investigation. Step by step, inexorably, "Western" science has moved 
towards investigation of the human mind-which is to say, of the observer. 
Artificial Intelligence research is the furthest step so far along that route. 
Before AI came along, there were two major previews of the strange 
consequences of the mixing of subject and object in science. One was the 
revolution of quantum mechanics, with its epistemological problems involv-
ing the interference of the observer with the observed. The other was the 
mixing of subject and object in metamathematics, beginning with Godel's 
Theorem and moving through all the other limitative Theorems we have 
discussed. Perhaps the next step after AI will be the self-application of 
science: science studying itself as an object. This is a different manner of 
mixing subject and object-perhaps an even more tangled one than that of 
humans studying their own minds. 
By the way, in passing, it is interesting to note that all results essentially 
dependent on the fusion of subject and object have been limitative results. 
In addition to the limitative Theorems, there is Heisenberg's uncertainty 
principle, which says that measuring one quantity renders impossible the 
simultaneous measurement ofa related quantity. I don't know why all these 
results are limitative. Make of it what you will. 
Symbol vs. Object in Modern Music and Art 
Closely linked with the subject-object dichotomy is the symbol-object 
dichotomy, which was explored in depth by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the 
early part of this century. Later the words "use" and "mention" were 
adopted to make the same distinction. Quine and others have written at 
length about the connection between signs and what they stand for. But not 
only philosophers have devoted much thought to this deep and abstract 
matter. In our century both music and art have gone through crises which 
reflect a profound concern with this problem. Whereas music and painting, 
for instance, have traditionally expressed ideas or emotions through a 
vocabulary of "symbols" (i.e. visual images, chords, rhythms, or whatever), 
now there is a tendency to explore the capacity of music and art to not 
express anything-just to be. This means to exist as pure globs of paint, or 
pure sounds, but in either case drained of all symbolic value. 
In music, in particular, John Cage has been very influential in bringing 
a Zen-like approach to sound. Many of his pieces convey a disdain for "use" 
of sounds-that is, using sounds to convey emotional states-and an exulta-
tion in "mentioning" sounds-that is, concocting arbitrary juxtapositions of 
sounds without regard to any previously formulated code by which a 
listener could decode them into a message. A typical example is "Imaginary 
Landscape no. 4", the polyradio piece described in Chapter VI. I may not 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
699 

be doing Cage justice, but to me it seems that much of his work has been 
directed at bringing meaninglessness into music, and in some sense, at 
making that meaninglessness have meaning. Aleatoric music is a typical 
exploration in that direction. (Incidentally, chance music is a close cousin to 
the much later notion of "happenings" or "be-in" 's.) There are many other 
contemporary composers who are following Cage's lead, but few with as 
much originality. A piece by Anna Lockwood, called "Piano Burning", 
involves just that-with the strings stretched to maximum tightness, to 
make them snap as loudly as possible; in a piece by LaMonte Young, the 
noises are provided by shoving the piano all around the stage and through 
obstacles, like a battering ram. 
Art in this century has gone through many convulsions of this general 
type. At first there was the abandonment of representation, which was 
genuinely revolutionary: the beginnings of abstract art. A gradual swoop 
from pure representation to the most highly abstract patterns is revealed in 
the work of Piet Mondrian. After the world was used to nonrepresenta-
tional art, then surrealism came along. It was a bizarre about-face, some-
thing like neoclassicism in music, in which extremely representational art 
was "subverted" and used for altogether new reasons: to shock, confuse, 
and amaze. This school was founded by Andre Breton, and was located 
primarily in France; some of its more influential members were Dali, 
Magritte, de Chirico, Tanguy. 
Magritte's Semantic Illusions 
Of all these artists, Magritte was the most conscious of the symbol-object 
mystery (which I see as a deep extension of the use-mention distinction). 
He uses it to evoke powerful responses in viewers, even if the viewers do 
not verbalize the distinction this way. For example, consider his very 
strange variation on the theme of still life, called Common Sense (Fig. 137). 
FIGURE 137. 
Common Sense, by Rene Magritte (1945-46). 

FIGURE 138. The Two Mysteries, by Rene Magritte (1966). 
Here, a dish filled with fruit, ordinarily the kind of thing represented 
inside a still life, is shown sitting on top of a blank canvas. The conflict 
between the symbol and the real is great. But that is not the full irony, for 
of course the whole thing is itself just a painting-in fact, a still life with 
nonstandard subject matter. 
Magritte's series of pipe paintings is fascinating and perplexing. Con-
sider The Two Mysteries (Fig. 138). Focusing on the inner painting, you get 
the message that symbols and pipes are different. Then your glance moves 
upward to the "real" pipe floating in the air-you perceive that it is real, 
while the other one is just a symbol. But that is of course totally wrong: both 
of them are on the same flat surface before your eyes. The idea that one 
pipe is in a twice-nested painting, and therefore somehow "less real" than 
the other pipe, is a complete fallacy. Once you are willing to "enter the 
room", you have already been tricked: you've fallen for image as reality. To 
be consistent in your gullibility, you should happily go one level further 
down, and confuse image-within-image with reality. The only way not to be 
sucked in is to see both pipes merely as colored smudges on a surface a few 
inches in front of your nose. Then, and only then, do you appreciate the 
full meaning of the written message "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"-but ironi-
cally, at the very instant everything turns to smudges, the writing too turns 
to smudges, thereby losing its meaning! In other words, at that instant, the 
verbal message of the painting self-destructs in a most Godelian way.

FIGURE 139. 
Smoke Signal. [Drawing by the author.] 
The Air and the Song (Fig. 82), taken from a series by Magritte, 
accomplishes all that The Two Mysteries does, but in one level instead of two. 
My drawings Smoke Signal and Pipe Dream (Figs. 139 and 140) constitute 
"Variations on a Theme of Magritte". Try staring at Smoke Signal for a 
while. Before long, you should be able to make out a hidden message 
saying, "Ceci n'est pas un message". Thus, if you find the message, it denies 
itself-yet if you don't, you miss the point entirely. Because of their indirect 
self-snuffing, my two pipe pictures can be loosely mapped onto Godel's 
G-thus giving rise to a "Central Pipe map", in the same spirit as the other 
"Central Xmaps": Dog, Crab, Sloth. 
A classic example of use-mention confusion in paintings is the occur-
rence of a palette in a painting. Whereas the palette is an illusion created by 
the representational skill of the painter, the paints on the painted palette 
are literal daubs of paint from the artist's palette. The paint plays itself-it 
does not symbolize anything else. In Don Giovanni, Mozart exploited a 
related trick: he wrote into the score explicitly the sound of an orchestra 
tuning up. Similarly, if I want the letter'!' to play itself (and not symbolize 
me), I put 'I' directly into my text; then I enclose 'I' between quotes. What 
results is "I" (not '1', nor '''I' "). Got that?

FIGURE 140. 
Pipe Dream. [Drawing by the author.] 
The "Code" of Modern Art 
A large number of influences, which no one could hope to pin down 
completely, led to further explorations of the symbol-object dualism in art. 
There is no doubt that John Cage, with his interest in Zen, had a profound 
influence on art as well as on music. His friends Jasper Johns and Robert 
Rauschenberg both explored the distinction between objects and symbols 
by using objects as symbols for themselves-or, to flip the coin, by using 
symbols as objects in themselves. All of this was perhaps intended to break 
down the notion that art is one step removed from reality-that art speaks 
in "code", for which the viewer must act as interpreter. The idea was to 
eliminate the step of interpretation and let the naked object simply be, 
period. ("Period"-a curious case of use-mention blur.) However, if this 
was the intention, it was a monumental flop, and perhaps had to be. 
Any time an object is exhibited in a gallery or dubbed a "work", it 
acquires an aura of deep inner significance-no matter how much the 
viewer has been warned not to look for meaning. In fact, there is a backfir-
ing effect whereby the more that viewers are told to look at these objects 
without mystification, the more mystified the viewers get. After all, if a 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
703 

wooden crate on a museum floor is just a wooden crate on a museum floor, 
then why doesn't the j;mitor haul it out back and throw it in the garbage? 
Why is the name of an artist attached to it? Why did the artist want to 
demystify art? Why isn't that dirt clod out front labeled with an artist's 
name? Is this a hoax? Am I crazy, or are artists crazy? More and more 
questions flood into the viewer's mind; he can't help it. This is the "frame 
effect" which art-Art-automatically creates. There is no way to suppress 
the wonderings in the minds of the curious. 
Of course, if the purpose is to instill a Zen-like sense of the world as 
devoid of categories and meanings, then perhaps such art is merely in-
tended to serve-as does intellectualizing about Zen-as a catalyst to inspire 
the viewer to go out and become acquainted with the philosophy which 
rejects "inner meanings" and embraces the world as a whole. In this case, 
the art is self-defeating in the short run, since the viewers do ponder about 
its meaning, but it achieves its aim with a few people in the long run, by 
introducing them to its sources. But in either case, it is not true that there is 
no code by which ideas are conveyed to the viewer. Actually, the code is a 
much more complex thing, involving statements about the absence of codes 
and so forth-that is, it is part code, part metacode, and so on. There is a 
Tangled Hierarchy of messages being transmitted by the most Zen-like art 
objects, which is perhaps why so many find modern art so inscrutable. 
Ism Once Again 
Cage has led a movement to break the boundaries between art and nature. 
In music, the theme is that all sounds are equal-a sort of acoustical 
democracy. Thus silence is just as important as sound, and random sound 
is just as important as organized ~ound. Leonard B. Meyer, in his book 
Music, the Arts, and Ideas, has called this movement in music "transcenden-
talism", and states: 
If the distinction between art and nature is mistaken, aesthetic valuation is 
irrelevant. One should no more judge the value of a piano sonata than one 
should judge the value of a stone, a thunderstorm, or a starfish. "Categorical 
statements, such as right and wrong, beautiful or ugly, ty,Pical of the 
rationalistic thinking of tonal aesthetics," writes Luciano Berio La contempo-
rary composer], "are no longer useful in understanding why and how a 
composer today works on audible forms and musical action." 
Later, Meyer continues in describing the philosophical position of trans-
cendentalism: 
... all things in all of time and space are inextricably connected with one 
another. Any divisions, classifications, or organizations discovered in the 
universe are arbitrary. The world is a complex, continuous, single 
event. 2 
[Shades of Zeno!] 
I find "transcendentalism" too bulky a name for this movement. In its 
place, I use "ism". Being a suffix without a prefix, it suggests an ideology 
704 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

FIGURE 141. 
The Human Condition I, by Rene Magritte (/933). 

without ideas-which, however you interpret it, is probably the case. And 
since "ism" embraces whatever is, its name is quite fitting. In "ism" the word 
"is" is half mentioned, half used; what could be more appropriate? Ism is 
the spirit of Zen in art. And just as the central problem of Zen is to unmask 
the self, the central problem of art in this century seems to be to figure out 
what art is. All these thrashings-about are part of its identity crisis. 
We have seen that the use-m(~ntion dichotomy, when pushed, turns 
into the philosophical problem of symbol-object dualism, which links it to 
the mystery of mind. Magritte wrote about his painting The Human Condi-
tion I (Fig. 141): 
I placed in front of a window, seen from a room, a painting representing 
exactly that part of the landscape which was hidden from view by the paint-
ing. Therefore, the tree represented in the painting hid from view the tree 
situated behind it, outside the room. It existed for the spectator, as it were, 
simultaneously in his mind, as both inside the room in the painting, and 
outside in the real landscape. Which is how we see the world: we see it as being 
outside ourselves even though it is only a mental representation of it that we 
experience inside ourselves.3 
Understanding the Mind 
First through the pregnant images of his painting, and then in direct 
words, Magritte expresses the link between the two questions "How do 
symbols work?" and "How do our minds work?" And so he leads us back to 
the question posed earlier: "Can we ever hope to understand our minds/ 
brains?" 
Or does some marvelous diabolical Godelian proposition preclude our 
ever unraveling our minds? Provided you do not adopt a totally unreason-
able definition of "understanding", I see no Godelian obstacle in the way of 
the eventual understanding of our minds. For instance, it seems to me quite 
reasonable to desire to understand the working principles of brains in 
general, much the same way as we understand the working principles of car 
engines in general. lt is quite different from trying to understand any 
single brain in every last detail-let alone trying to do this for one's own 
brain! I don't see how Godel's Theorem, even if construed in the sloppiest 
way, has anything to say about the feasibility of this prospect. I see no 
reason that Godel's Theorem imposes any limitations on our ability to 
formulate and verify the general mechanisms by which thought processes 
take place in the medium of nerve cells. I see no barrier imposed by Godel's 
Theorem to the implementation on computers (or their successors) of types 
of symbol manipulation that achieve roughly the same results as brains GO. 
lt is entirely another question to try and duplicate in a program some 
particular human's mind-but to produce an intelligent program at all is a 
more limited goal. Godel's Theorem doesn't ban our reproducing our own 
level of intelligence via programs any more than it bans our reproducing 
our own level of intelligence via transmission of hereditary information in 
706 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

DNA, followed by education. Indeed, we have seen, in Chapter XVI, how a 
remarkable Godelian mechanism-the Strange Loop of proteins and 
DNA-is precisely what allows transmission of intelligence! 
Does Godel's Theorem, then, have absolutely nothing to offer us in 
thinking about our own minds? I think it does, although not in the mystical 
and limitative way which some people think it ought to. I think that the 
process of coming to understand Godel's proof, with its construction in-
volving arbitrary codes, complex isomorphisms, high and low levels of 
interpretation, and the capacity for self-mirroring, may inject some rich 
undercurrents and flavors into one's set of images about symbols and 
symbol processing, which may deepen one's intuition for the relationship 
between mental structures on different levels. 
Accidental Inexplicability of Intelligence? 
Before suggesting a philosophically intriguing "application" of Godel's 
proof, I would like to bring up the idea of "accidental inexplicability" of 
intelligence. Here is what that involves. It could be that our brains, unlike 
car engines, are stubborn and intractable systems which we cannot neatly 
decompose in any way. At present, we have no idea whe'ther our brains will 
yield to repeated attempts to cleave them into clean layers, each of which 
can be explained in terms of lower layers--or whether our brains will foil 
all our attempts at decomposition. 
But even if we do fail to understand ourselves, there need not be any 
Godelian "twist" behind it; it could be simply an accident of fate that our 
brains are too weak to understand themselves. Think of the lowly giraffe, 
for instance, whose brain is obviously far below the level required for 
self-understanding-yet it is remarkably similar to our own brain. In fact, 
the brains of giraffes, elephants, baboons--even the brains of tortoises or 
unknown beings who are far smarter than we are-probably all operate on 
basically the same set of principles. Giraffes may lie far below the threshold 
of intelligence necessary to understand how those principles fit together to 
produce the qualities of mind; humans may lie closer to that threshold-
perhaps just barely below it, perhaps even above it. The point is that there 
may be no fundamental (i.e., Godelian) reason why those qualities are in-
comprehensible; they may be completely clear to more intelligent beings. 
Undecidability Is Inseparable from a High-Level Viewpoint 
Barring this pessimistic notion of the accidental inexplicability of the brain, 
what insights might Godel's proof offer us about explanations of our 
mindslbrains? Godel's proof offers the notion that a high-level view of a 
system may contain explanatory power which simply is absent on the lower 
levels. By this I mean the following. Suppose someone gave you G, Godel's 
undecidable string, as a string of TNT. Also suppose you knew nothing of 
Godel-numbering. The question you are supposed to answer is: "Why isn't 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
707 

this string a theorem of TNT?" Now you are used to such questions; for 
instance, if you had been asked that question about 50=0, you would have a 
ready explanation: "Its negation, ~50=0, is a theorem." This, together with 
your knowledge that TNT is consistent, provides an explanation of why the 
given string is a nontheorem. This is what I call an explanation "on the 
TNT -level". Notice how different it is from the explanation of why MU is 
not a theorem of the MIU-system: the former comes from the M-mode, the 
latter only from the I-mode. 
Now what about G? The TNT-level explanation which worked for 
50=0 does not work for G, because --G is not a theorem. The person who 
has no overview of TNT will be baffled as to why he can't make G according 
to the rules, because as an arithmetical proposition, it apparently has 
nothing wrong with it. In fact, when G is turned into a universally quan-
tified string, every instance gotten from G by substituting numerals for the 
variables can be derived. The only way to explain G's nontheoremhood is to 
discover the notion of Godel-numbering and view TNT on an entirely 
different level. It is not that it is just difficult and complicated to write out 
the explanation on the TNT -level; it is impossible. Such an explanation 
simply does not exist. There is, on the high level, a kind of explanatory 
power which simply is lacking, in principle, on the TNT-level. G's non-
theoremhood is, so to speak, an intrinsically high-levelfact. It is my suspicion 
that this is the case for all undecidable propositions; that is to say: every 
undecidable proposition is actually a Godel sentence, asserting its own 
nontheoremhood in some system via some code. 
Consciousness as an Intrinsically High-Level Phenomenon 
Looked at this way, Godel's proof suggests-though by no means does it 
prove I-that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mindlbrain, 
involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level 
might have explanatory power that does not exist-not even in 
principle-on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be ex-
plained on the high level quite easily, but not on lower levels at all. No 
matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it 
would not explain the phenomena in question. It is the analogue to the fact 
that, if you make derivation after derivation in TNT, no matter how long 
and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for 
G-despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that G is true. 
What might such high-level concepts be? It ha~ been proposed for 
eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and 
humanists, that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in 
terms of brain-components; so here is a candidate, at least. There is also the 
ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emer-
gent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by 
the physiology alone. But it is important to realize that if we are being 
guided by Godel's proof in making such bold hypotheses, we must carry the 
708 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

analogy through thoroughly. In particular, it is vital to recall that G's 
nontheoremhood does have an explanation-it is not a total mystery! The 
explanation hinges on understanding not just one level at a time, but the 
way in which one level mirrors its metalevel, and the consequences of this 
mirroring. If our analogy is to hold, -then, "emergent" phenomena would 
become explicable in terms of a relationship between different levels in 
mental systems. 
Strange Loops as the Crux of Consciousness 
My belief is that the explanations of "emergent" phenomena in our 
brains-for instance, ideas, hopes, images, analogies, and finally conscious-
ness and free will-are based on a kind of Strange Loop, an interaction 
between levels in which the top level reaches back down towards the bottom 
level and influences it, while at the same time being itself determined by the 
bottom level. In other words, a self-reinforcing "resonance" between dif-
ferent levels-quite like the Henkin sentence which, by merely asserting its 
own provability, actually becomes provable. The self comes into being at 
the moment it has the power to reflect itself. 
This should not be taken as an antireductionist position. It just implies 
that a reductionistic explanation of a mind, in order to be comprehensihle, must 
bring in "soft" concepts such as levels, mappings, and meanings. In princi-
ple, I have no doubt that a totally reductionistic but incomprehensible 
explanation of the brain exists; the problem is how to translate it into a 
language we ourselves can fathom. Surely we don't want a description in 
terms of positions and momenta of particles; we want a description which 
relates neural activity to "signals" (intermediate-level phenomena)-and 
which relates signals, in turn, to "symbols" and "subsystems", including the 
presumed-to-exist "self-symbol". This act of translation from low-level 
physical hardware to high-level psychological software is analogous to the 
translation of number-theoretical statements into metamathematical state-
ments. Recall that the level-crossing which takes place at this exact transla-
tion point is what creates Godel's incompleteness and the self-proving 
character of Henkin's sentence. I postulate that a similar level-crossing is 
what creates our nearly unanalyzable feelings of self. 
In order to deal with the full richness of the brain/mind system, we will 
have to be able to slip between levels comfortably. Moreover, we will have to 
admit various types of "causality": ways in which an event at one level of 
description can "cause" events at other levels to happen. Sometimes event 
A will be said to "cause" event B simply for the reason that the one is a 
translation, on another level of description, of the other. Sometimes 
"cause" will have its usual meaning: physical causality. Both types of 
causality-and perhaps some more-will have to be admitted in any expla-
nation of mind, for we will have to admit causes that propagate both 
upwards and downwards in the Tangled Hierarchy of mentality, just as in 
the Central Dogmap. 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
709 

At the crux, then, of our understanding ourselves will come an under-
standing of the Tangled Hierarchy of levels inside our minds. My position 
is rather similar to the viewpoint put forth by the neuroscientist Roger 
Sperry in his excellent article "Mind. Brain, and Humanist Values", from 
which I quote a little here: 
In my own hypothetical brain model. conscious awareness does get represen-
tation as a very real causal agent and rates an important place in the causal 
sequence and chain of control in brain events, in which it appears as an active, 
operational force .... To put it very ~imply, it comes down to the issue of who 
pushes whom around in the population of causal forces that occupy the 
cranium. It is a matter, in other words, of straightening out the peck-order 
hierarchy among intracranial control agents. There exists within the cranium 
a whole world of diverse causal forces; what is more, there are forces within 
forces within forces, as in no other cubic half-foot of universe that we know . 
. . . To make a long story short, if one keeps climbing upward in the chain of 
command within the brain, one finds at the very top those over-all organiza-
tional forces and dynamic properties of the large patterns of cerebral excita-
tion that are correlated with mental ~tates or psychic activity .... Near the 
apex of this command system in the brain ... we find ideas. Man over the 
chimpanzee has ideas and ideals. In the brain model proposed here, the 
causal potency of an idea, or an ideal, becomes just as real as that of a 
molecule, a cell, or a nerve impulse. Ideas cause ideas and help evolve new 
ideas. They interact with each other and with other mental forces in the same 
brain, in neighboring brains, and, thanks to global communication, in far 
distant, foreign brains. And they also interact with the external surroundings 
to produce in toto a burstwise advance in evolution that is far beyond any-
thing to hit the evolutionary scene yet, including the emergence of the living 
eel 1.4 
There is a famous breach between two languages of discourse: the 
subjective language and the objective language. For instance, the "subjec-
tive" sensation of redness, and the "objective" wavelength of red light. To 
many people, these seem to be forever irreconcilable. I don't think so. No 
more than the two views of Escher's Drawing Hands are irreconcilable-
from "in the system", where the hands draw each other, and from outside, 
where Escher draws it all. The subjective feeling of redness comes from the 
vortex of self-perception in the brain; the objective wavelength is how you 
see things when you step back, outside of the system. Though no one of us 
will ever be able to step back far enough to see the "big picture", we 
shouldn't forget that it exists. We should remember that physical law is 
what makes it all happen-way, way down in neural nooks and crannies 
which are too remote for us to reach with our high-level introspective 
probes. 
The Self-Symbol and Free Will 
In Chapter XII, it was suggested that what we call free will is a result of the 
interaction between the self-symbol (or subsystem), and the other symbols 
in the brain. If we take the idea that symbols are the high-level entities to 
710 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

which meanings should be attached, then we can make a stab at explaining 
the relationship between symbols, the self-symbol, and free will. 
One way to gain some perspective on the free-will question is to replace 
it by what I believe is an equivalent question, but one which involves less 
loaded terms. Instead of asking, "Does system X have free will?" we ask, 
"Does system X make choices?" By carefully groping for what we really 
mean when we choose to describe a system-mechanical or biological-as 
being capable of making "choices", I think we can shed much light on free 
will. It will be helpful to go over a few different systems which, under 
various circumstances, we might feel tempted to describe as "making 
choices". From these examples we can gain some perspective on what we 
really mean by the phrase. 
Let us take the following systems as paradigms: a marble rolling down 
a bumpy hill; a pocket calculator finding successive digits in the decimal 
expansion of the square root of 2; a sophisticated program which plays a 
mean game of chess; a robot in a T-maze (a maze with but a single fork, on 
one side of which there is a reward); and a human being confronting a 
complex dilemma. 
First, what about that marble rolling down a hill? Does it make choices? 
I think we would unanimously say that it doesn't, even though none of us 
could predict its path for even a very short distance. We feel that it couldn't 
have gone any other way than it did, and that it was just being shoved along 
by the relentless laws of nature. In our chunked mental physics, of course, 
we can visualize many different "possible" pathways for the marble, and we 
see it following only one of them in the real world. On some level of our 
minds, therefore, we can't help feeling the marble has "chosen" a single 
pathway out of those myriad mental ones; but on some other level of our 
minds, we have an instinctive understanding that the mental physics is only 
an aid in our internal modeling of the world, and that the mechanisms 
which make the real physical sequences of events happen do not require 
nature to go through an analogous process of first manufacturing variants 
in some hypothetical universe (the "brain of God") and then choosing 
between them. So we shall not bestow the designation "choice" upon this 
process-although we recognize that it is often pragmatically useful to use 
the word in cases like this, because of its evocative power. 
Now what about the calculator programmed to find the digits of the 
square root of 2? What about the chess program? Here, we might say that 
we are just dealing with "fancy marbles", rolling down "fancy hills". In fact, 
the arguments for no choice-making here are, if anything, stronger than in 
the case of a marble. For if you attempt to repeat the marble experiment, 
you will undoubtedly witness a totally different pathway being traced down 
the hill, whereas if you rerun the square-root-of-2 program, you will get the 
same results time after time. The marble seems to "choose" a different path 
each time, no matter how accurately you try to reproduce the conditions of 
its original descent, whereas the program runs down precisely the same 
channels each time. 
Now in the case of fancy chess programs, there are various possibilities. 
Strange loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 
711 

If you playa game against certain programs, and then start a second game 
with the same moves as you made the first time, these programs will just 
move exactly as they did before, without any appearance of having learned 
anything or having any desire for variety. There are other programs which 
have randomizing devices that will give some variety but not out of any 
deep desire. Such programs could be reset with the internal random 
number generator as it was the first time, and once again, the same game 
would ensue. Then there are other programs which do learn from their 
mistakes, and change their strategy depending on the outcome of a game. 
Such programs would not play the same game twice in a row. Of course, 
you could also turn the clock back by wiping out all the changes in the 
memory which represent learning, just as you could reset the random 
number generator, but that hardly seems like a friendly thing to do. 
Besides, is there any reason to suspect that you would be able to change any 
of your own past decisions if every last detail-and that includes your brain, 
of course-were reset to the way it was the first time around? 
But let us return to the question of whether "choice" is an applicable 
term here. If programs are just "fancy marbles rolling down fancy hills", do 
they make choices, or not? Of course the answer must be a subjective one, 
but I would say that pretty much the same considerations apply here as to 
the marble. However, I would have to add that the appeal of using the 
word "choice", even if it is only a convenient and evocative shorthand, 
becomes quite strong. The fact that a chess program looks ahead down the 
various possible bifurcating paths, quite unlike a rolling marble, makes it 
seem much more like an animate being than a square-root-of-2 program. 
However, there is still no deep self-awareness here-and no sense of free 
will. 
Now let us go on to imagine a robot which has a repertoire of symbols. 
This robot is placed in a T -maze. However, instead of going for the reward, 
it is pre programmed to go left whenever the next digit ofthe square root of 
2 is even, and to go right whenever it is odd. Now this robot is capable of 
modeling the situation in its symbols, so it can watch itself making choices. 
E~ch time the T is approached, if you were to address to the robot the 
question, "Do you know which way you're going to turn this time?" it would 
have to answer, "No". Then in order to progress, it would activate its 
"decider" subroutine, which calculates the next digit of the square root of 2, 
and the decision is taken. However, the internal mechanism of the decider 
is unknown to the robot-it is represented in the robot's symbols merely as 
a l;llack box which puts out "left"'s and "right"'s by some mysterious and 
seemingly random rule. Unless the robot's symbols are capable of picking 
up the hidden heartbeat of the square root of 2, beating in the L's and R's, 
it will stay baffled by the "choices" which it is making. Now does this robot 
make choices? Put yourself in that position. If you were trapped inside a 
marble rolling down a hill and were powerless to affect its path, yet could 
observe it with all your human intellect, would you feel that the marble's 
path involved choices? Of course not. Unless your mind is affecting the 
outcome, it makes no difference that the symbols are present. 
712 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

So now we make a modification in our robot: we allow its symbols-
including its self-symbol-to affect the decision that is taken. Now here is 
an example of a program running fully under physical law , which seems to 
get much more deeply at the essence of choice than the previous examples 
did. When the robot's own chunked concept of itself enters the scene, we 
begin to identify with the robot, for it sounds like the kind of thing we do. It 
is no longer like the calculation of the square root of 2, where no symbols 
seem to be monitoring the decisions taken. To be sure, if we were to look at 
the robot's program on a very local level, it would look quite like the 
square-root program. Step after step is executed, and in the end "left" or 
"right" is the output. But on a high level we can see the fact that symbols are 
being used to model the situation and to affect the decision. That radically 
affects our way of thinking about the program. At this stage, meaning has 
entered this picture-the same kind of meaning as we manipulate with our 
own minds. 
A G6del Vortex Where All Levels Cross 
Now if some outside agent suggests 'L' as the next choice to the robot, the 
suggestion will be picked up and channeled into the swirling mass of 
interacting symbols. There, it will be sucked inexorably into interaction 
with the self-symbol, like a rowboat being pulled into a whirlpool. That is 
the vortex of the system, where all levels cross. Here, the 'L' encounters a 
Tangled Hierarchy of symbols and is passed up and down the levels. The 
self-symbol is incapable of monitoring all its internal processes, and so 
when the actual decision emerges-'L' or 'R' or something outside the 
system-the system will not be able to say where it came from. Unlike a 
standard chess program, which does not monitor itself and consequently 
has no ideas about where its moves come from, this program does monitor 
itself and does have ideas about its ideas-but it cannot monitor its own 
processes in complete detail, and therefore has a sort of intuitive sense of its 
workings, without full understanding. From this balance between self-
knowledge and self-ignorance comes the feeling of free will. 
Think, for instance, of a writer who is trying to convey certain ideas 
which to him are contained in mental images. He isn't quite sure how those 
images fit together in his mind, and he experiments around, expressing 
things first one way and then another, and finally settles on some version. 
But does he know where it all came from? Only in a vague sense. Much of 
the source, like an iceberg, is deep underwater, unseen-and he knows 
that. Or think of a music composition program, something we discussed 
earlier, asking when we would feel comfortable in calling it the composer 
rather than the tool of a human composer. Probably we would feel com-
fortable when self-knowledge in terms of symbols exists inside the pro-
gram, and when the program has this delicate balance between self-knowl-
edge and self-ignorance. It is irrelevant whether the system is running 
deterministically; what makes us call it a "choice maker" is whether we can 
identify with a high-level description of the process which takes place when the 
Strange loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies

program runs. On a low (machine language) level, the program looks like 
any other program; on a high (chunked) level, qualities such as "will", 
"intuition", "creativity", and "consciousness" can emerge. 
The important idea is that this "vortex" of self is responsible for the 
tangledness, for the Codelian-ness, of the mental processes. People have 
said to me on occasion, "This stuff with self-reference and so on is very 
amusing and enjoyable, but do you really think there is anything serious to 
it?" I certainly do. I think it will eventually turn out to be at the core of AI, 
and the focus of all attempts to understand how human minds work. And 
that is why Codel is so deeply woven into the fabric of my book. 
714 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

An Escher Vortex Where All Levels Cross 
A strikingly beautiful, and yet at the same time disturbingly grotesque, 
illustration of the cyclonic "eye" of a Tangled Hierarchy is given to us by 
Escher in his Print Gallery (Fig. 142). What we see is a picture gallery where 
a young man is standing, looking at a picture of a ship in the harbor of a 
small town, perhaps a Maltese town, to guess from the architecture, with its 
little turrets, occasional cupolas, and flat stone roofs, upon one of which sits 
a boy, relaxing in the heat, while two floors below him a woman-perhaps 
his mother-gazes out of the window from her apartment which sits di-
rectly above a picture gallery where a young man is standing, looking at a 
picture of a ship in the harbor of a small town, perhaps a Maltese town-
What!? We are back on the same level as we began, though all logic dictates 
that we cannot be. Let us draw a diagram of what we see (Fig. 143).

What this diagram shows is three kinds of "in-ness". The gallery is physically 
in the town ("inclusion"); the town is artistically in the picture ("depiction"); 
the picture is mentally in the person ("representation"). Now while this 
diagram may seem satisfying, in fact it is arbitrary, for the number of levels 
shown is quite arbitrary. Look below at another way of representing the top 
half alone (Fig. 144).

We have eliminated the "town" level: conceptually it was useful, but can just 
as well be done without. Figure 144 looks just like the diagram for Drawing 
Hands: a Strange Loop of two steps. The division markers are arbitrary, 
even if they seem natural to our minds. This can be further accentuated by 
showing even more "collapsed" schematic diagrams of Print Gallery, such 
as that in Figure 145. 
inclusion + depiction 
FIGURE 145. Further collapse of Figure 143. 
This exhibits the paradox of the picture in the starkest terms. Now-if the 
picture is "inside itself", then is the young man also inside himself? This 
question is answered in Figure 146. 
inclusion + depiction + representation 
FIGURE 146. Another way of collapsing Figure 143. 
Thus, we see the young man "inside himself", in a funny sense which is 
made up of compounding three dis-tinct senses of "in". 
This diagram reminds us of the Epimenides paradox with its one-step 
self-reference, while the two-step diagram resembles the sentence pair each 
of which refers to the other. We cannot make the loop any tighter, but we 
can open it wider, by choosing to insert any number of intermediate levels, 
such as "picture frame", "arcade", and "building". If we do so, we will have 
many-step Strange Loops, whose diagrams are isomorphic to those of 
Wateifall (Fig. 5) or Ascending and Descending (Fig. 6). The number oflevels 
is determined by what we feel is "natural", which may vary according to 
context, purpose, or frame of mind. The Central Xmaps-Dog, Crab, 
Sloth, and Pipe-can all be seen as involving three-step Strange Loops; 
alternatively, they can all be collaps-ed into two- or one-step loops; then 
again, they can be expanded out into multistage loops. Where one per-
ceives the levels is a matter of intuition and esthetic preference. 
Now are we, the observers of Print Gallery, also sucked into ourselves by 
virtue of looking at it? Not really. We manage to escape that particular 
vortex by being outside of the system. And when·we look at the picture, we 
see things which the young man can certainly not see, such as Escher's 
716 
Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies 

signature, "MCE", in the central "blemish". Though the blemish seems like 
a defect, perhaps the defect lies in our expectations, for in fact Escher 
could not have completed that portion of the picture without being incon-
sistent with the rules by which he was drawing the picture. That center of 
the whorl is-and must be-incomplete. Escher could have made it arbi-
trarily small, but he could not have gotten rid of it. Thus we, on the outside, 
can know that Print Gallery is essentially incomplete-a fact which the 
young man, on the inside, can never know. Escher has thus given a pictorial 
parable for Codel's Incompleteness Theorem. And that is why the strands 
of Codel and Escher are so deeply interwoven in my book. 
A Bach Vortex Where All Levels Cross 
One cannot help being reminded, when one looks at the diagrams of 
Strange Loops, of the Endlessly Rising Canon from the Musical Offering. A 
diagram of it would consist of six steps, as is shown in Figure 147. It is too

a true closed loop when Shepard tones are used. 
bad that when it returns to C, it is an octave higher rather than at the exact 
original pitch. Astonishingly enough, it is possible to arrange for it to 
return exactly to the starting pitch, by using what are called Shepard tones, 
after the psychologist Roger Shepard, who discovered the idea. The prin-
ciple of a Shepard-tone scale is shown in Figure 148. In words, it is this: you 
play parallel scales in several different octave ranges. Each note is weighted 
independently, and as the notes rise, the weights shift. You make the top

octave gradually fade out, while at the same time you are gradually bring-
ing in the bottom octave. Just at the moment you would ordinarily be one 
octave higher, the weights have shifted precisely so as to reproduce the 
starting pitch ... Thus you can go "up and up forever", never getting any 
higher! You can try it at your piano. It works even better if the pitches can 
be synthesized accurately under computer control. Then the illusion is 
bewilderingly strong. 
This wonderful musical discovery allows the Endlessly Rising Canon to 
be played in such a way that it joins back onto itself after going "up" an 
octave. This idea, which Scott Kim and I conceived jointly, has been 
realized on tape, using a computer music system. The effect is very 
subtle-but very real. It is quite interesting that Bach himself was apparent-
ly aware, in some sense, of such scales, for in his music one can occasionally 
find passages which roughly exploit the general principle of Shepard 
tones-for instance, about halfway through the Fantasia from the Fantasia 
and Fugue in G Minor, for organ. 
In his book]. S. Bach's Musical Offering, Hans Theodore David writes: 
Throughout the Musical Offering, the reader, performer, or listener is to 
search for the Royal theme in all its forms. The entire work, therefore, is a 
ricercar in the original, literal sense of the word. 5 
I think this is true; one cannot look deeply enough into the Musical Offering. 
There is always more after one thinks one knows everything. For instance, 
towards the very end of the Six-Part Ricercar, the one he declined to 
improvise, Bach slyly hid his own name, split between two of the upper 
voices. Things are going on on many levels in the Musical Offering. There 
are tricks with notes and letters; there are ingenious variations on the 
King's Theme; there are original kinds of canons; there are extraordinarily 
complex fugues; there is beauty and extreme depth of emotion; even an 
exultation in the many-Ieveledness of the work comes through. The Musical 
Offering is a fugue of fugues, a Tangled Hierarchy like those of Escher and 
G6del, an intellectual construction which reminds me, in ways I cannot 
express, of the beautiful many-voiced fugue of the human mind. And that is 
why in my book the three strands of GOdel, Escher, and Bach are woven into 
an Eternal Golden Braid.

Six-Part Ricercar 
Achilles has brought his cello to the Crab's residence, to engage in an 
evening of chamber music with the Crab and Tortoise. He has been shown 
into the music room by his host the Crab, who is momentarily absent, having 
gone to meet their mutual friend the Tortoise at the door. The room is filled 
with all sorts of electronic equipment~honographs in various states of 
array and disarray, television screens attached to typewriters, and other 
quite improbable-looking pieces of apparatus. Nestled amongst all this 
high-powered gadgetry sits a humble radio. Since the radio is the only thing 
in the room which Achilles knows how to use, he walks over to it, and, a 
little furtively, flicks the dial and finds he has tuned into a panel discussion 
by six learned scholars on free will and determinism. He listens briifiy 
and then, a little scornfully, flicks it of! 
Achilles: 
I can get along very well without such a program. After all, it's 
clear to anyone who's ever thought about it that-I mean, it's not a very 
difficult matter to resolve, once you understand how-or rather, con-
ceptu'ally, one can clear up the whole thing by thinking of, or at least 
imagining a situation where, .. Bmmm . , , I thought it was quite clear 
in my mind. Maybe I could benefit from listening to that show, after 
all ... 
(Enter the Tortoise, carrying his violin.) 
Well, well, if it isn't our fiddler. Have you been practicing faithfully this 
week, Mr. T? I myself have been playing the cello part in the Trio 
Sonata from the Musical Offering for at least two hours a day. It's a strict 
regimen, but it pays off. 
Tortoise: 
I can get along very well without such a program. I find that a 
moment here, a moment there keeps me fit for fiddling. 
Achilles: 
Oh, lucky you. I wish it came so easily to me. Well, where is our 
host? 
Tortoise: 
I think he's just gone to f(~tch his Rute. Here he comes. 
(Enter the Crab, carrying his flute.) 
Achilles: 
Oh, Mr. Crab, in my ardent practicing of the Trio Sonata this 
past week, all sorts of images bubbled into my mind: jolly gobbling 
bumblebees, melancholy buzzing turkeys, and a raft of others, Isn't it 
wonderful, what power music has? 
Crab: 
I can get along very well without such a program. To my mind, 
Achilles, there is ~o music purer than the Musical Offering. 
Tortoise: 
You can't be serious, Achilles. The Musical Offering isn't pro-
grammatic music! 
720 
Six-Part Ricercar 

Achilles: 
Well, I like animals, even if you two stuffy ones disapprove. 
Crab: 
I don't think we are so stuffy, Achilles. Let's just say that you hear 
music in your own special way. 
Turtoise: 
Shall we sit down and play? 
Crab: 
I was hoping that a pianist friend of mine would turn up and play 
continuo. I've been wanting you to meet him, Achilles, for a long time. 
Unfortunately, it appears that he may not make it. So let's just go 
ahead with the three of us. That's plenty for a trio sonata. 
Achilles: 
Before we start, I just was wondering, Mr. Crab-what are all 
these pieces of equipment, which you have in here? 
Crab: 
Well, mostly they are just odds and ends-bits and pieces of old 
broken phonographs. Only a few souvenirs (nervously tapping the but-
tons), a few souvenirs of--of the TC-battles in which I have distin-
guished myself. Those keyboards attached to television screens, how-
ever, are my new toys. I have fifteen of them around here. They are a 
new kind of computer, a very small, very flexible type of computer-
quite an advance over the previous types available. Few others seem to 
be quite as enthusiastic about them as I am, but I have faith that they 
will catch on in time. 
Achilles: 
Do they have a special name? 
Crab: 
Yes; they are called "smart-stupids", since they are so flexible, and 
have the potential to be either smart or stupid, depending on how 
skillfully they are instructed. 
Achilles: 
Do you mean you think they could actually become smart like, 
say, a human being? 
Crab: 
I would not balk at saying so-provided, of course, that someone 
sufficiently versed in the art of instructing smart-stupids would make 
the effort. Sadly, I am not personally acquainted with anyone who is a 
true virtuoso. To be sure, there is one expert abroad in the land, an 
individ ual of great renown-and nothing would please me more than 
a visit by him, so that I could appreciate what true skill on the smart-
stupid is; but he has never come, and I wonder if I shall ever have that 
pleasure. 
Tortoise: 
It would be very interesting to play chess against a well-instructed 
smart-stupid. 
Crab: 
An extremely intriguing idea. That would be a wonderful mark of 
skill, to program a smart-stupid to playa good game of chess. Even 
more interesting-but incredibly complicated-would be to instruct a 
smart-stupid sufficiently that it could hold its own in a conversation. It 
might give the impression that it was just another person! 
Achilles: 
Curious that this should come up, for I just heard a snatch of a 
discussion on free will and determinism, and it set me to thinking 
about such questions once more. I don't mind admitting that, as I 
pondered the idea, my thoughts got more and more tangled, and in 
the end I really didn't know what I thought. But this idea of a smart-
stupid that could converse with you ... it boggles the mind. I mean, 
Six-Part Ricercar 
721 

what would the smart-stupid itself say, if you asked it for its opinion on 
the free-will question? I was just wondering if the two of you, who 
know so much about these things, wouldn't indulge me by explaining 
the issue, as you see it, to me. 
Crab: 
Achilles, you can't imagine how appropriate your question is. I only 
wish my pianist friend were here. because I know you'd be intrigued to 
hear what he could tell you on the subject. In his absence, I'd like to tell 
you a statement in a Dialogue at the end of a book I came across 
recently. 
Achilles: 
Not Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic Alloy? 
Crab: 
No, as I recall, it was entitled Giraffes, Elephants, Baboons: an Equato-
rial Grasslands Bestiary-or something like that. In any case, towards the 
end of the aforementioned Dialogue, a certain exceedingly droll 
character quotes Marvin Minsky on the question of free will. Shortly 
thereafter, while interacting with two other personages, this droll 
character quotes Minsky further on musical improvisation, the com-
puter language LISP, and Godel's Theorem-and get this-all without 
giving one whit of credit to Minsky! 
Achilles: 
Oh, for shame! 
Crab: 
I must admit that earlier in the Dialogue, he hints that he WILL 
quote Minsky towards the end; so perhaps it's forgivable. 
Achilles: 
It sounds that way to me. Anyway, I'm anxious to hear the 
Minskian pronouncement on the free will question. 
Crab: 
Ah, yes ... Marvin Minsky said, "When intelligent machines are 
constructed, we should not be surprised to find them as confused and 
as stubborn as men in their convictions about mind-matter, conscious-
ness, free will, and the like." 
Achilles: 
I like that! Quite a funny thought. An automaton thinking it had 
free will! That's almost as silly as me thinking I didn't have free will! 
Tortoise: 
I suppose it never occurred to you, Achilles, that the three of 
us-you, myself, and Mr. Crab--might all be characters in a Dialogue, 
perhaps even one similar to the one Mr. Crab just mentioned. 
Achilles: 
Oh, it's occurred to me, of course. I suppose such fancies occur to 
every normal person at one time or another. 
Tortoise: 
And the Anteater, the Sloth, Zeno, even GOD-we might all be 
characters in a series of Dialogues in a book. 
Achilles: 
Sure, we might. And the Author might just come in and play the 
piano, too. 
Crab: 
That's just what I had hoped. But he's always late. 
Achilles: 
Whose leg do you think you're pulling? I know I'm not being 
controlled in any way by another mentality! I've got my own thoughts, 
I express myself as I wish-you can't deny that! 
Tortoise: 
Nobody denied any of that, Achilles. But all of what you say is 
perfectly consistent with your being a character in a Dialogue. 
Crab: The-
Achilles: 
But-but-no! Perhaps Mr. C's article and my rebuttal have both 
722 
Six-Part Ricercar 

been mechanically determined, but this I refuse to believe. I can accept 
physical determinism, but I cannot accept the idea that I am but a 
figment inside of someone else's mentality! 
Turtoise: It doesn't really matter whether you have a hardware brain, 
Achilles. Your will can be equally free, if your brain is just a piece of 
software inside someone else's hardware brain. And their brain, too, 
may be software in a yet higher brain ... 
Achilles: 
What an absurd idea! And yet, I must admit, I do enjoy trying to 
find the cleverly concealed holes in your sophistry, so go ahead. Try to 
convince me. I'm game. 
Turtoise: 
Did it ever strike you, Achilles, that you keep somewhat unusual 
company? 
Achilles: 
Of course. You are very eccentric (I know you won't mind my 
saying so), and even Mr. Crab here is a weensy bit eccentric. (Pardon 
me, Mr. Crab.) 
Crab: 
Oh, don't worry about offending me. 
Tortoise: 
But Achilles, you've overlooked one of the most salient features 
of your acquaintances. 
Achilles: 
Which is .... ? 
Turtoise: 
That we're animals! 
Achilles: 
Well, well-true enough. You have such a keen mind. I would 
never have thought of formulating the facts so concisely. 
Tortoise: 
Isn't that evidence enough? How many people do you know who 
spend their time with talking Tortoises, and talking Crabs? 
Achilles: 
I must admit, a talking Crab is-
Crab: -an anomaly, of course. 
Achilles: 
Exactly; it is a bit of an anomaly-but it has precedents. It has 
occurred in literature. 
Turtoise: 
Precisely-in literature. But where in real life? 
Achilles: 
Now that you mention it, I can't quite say. I'll have to give it some 
thought. But that's not enough to convince me that I'm a character in a 
Dialogue. Do you have any other arguments? 
Tortoise: 
Do you remember one day when you and I met in the park, 
seemingly at random? 
Achilles: 
The day we discussed crab canons by Escher and Bach? 
Turtoise: 
The very one! 
Achilles: 
And Mr. Crab, as I recall, turned up somewhere towards the 
middle of our conversation and babbled something funny and then 
left. 
Crab: 
Not just "somewhere towards the middle", Achilles. EXACTLY in the 
middle. 
Achilles: 
Oh, all right, then. 
Turtoise: 
Do you realize that your lines were the same as my lines in that 
conversation-except in reverse order? A few words were changed 
here and there, but in essence there was a time symmetry to our 
encounter. 
Six-Part Ricercar 
723 

Achilles: 
Big deal! It was just some sort of trickery. Probably all done with 
mIrrors. 
Tortoise: 
No trickery, Achilles, and no mirrors: just the work of an assidu-
ous Author. 
Achilles: 
Oh, well, it's all the same to me. 
Tortoise: 
Fiddle! It makes a big difference, you know. 
Achilles: 
Say, something about this conversation strikes me as familiar. 
Haven't I heard some of those lines somewhere before? 
Tortoise: 
You said it, Achilles. 
Crab: 
Perhaps those lines occurred at random in the park one day, 
Achilles. Do you recall how your conversation with Mr. T ran that day? 
Achilles: 
Vaguely. He said "Good day, Mr. A" at the beginning, and at the 
end, I said, "Good day, Mr. T". Is that right? 
Crab: 
I just happen to have a transcript right here ... 
(He fishes around in his music case, whips out a sheet, and hands it to 
Achilles. As Achilles reads it, he begins to squirm and fidget noticeably.) 
Achilles: 
This is very strange. Very, very strange ... All of a sudden, I feel 
sort of-weird. It's as if somebody had actually planned out that whole 
set of statements in advance, worked them out on paper or something 
... As if some Author had had a whole agenda and worked from it in 
detail in planning all those statements I made that day. 
(At that moment, the door bursts open. Enter the Author, carrying a giant 
manuscript.) 
Author: 
I can get along very well without such a program. You see, once 
my characters are formed, they seem to have lives of their own, and I 
need to exert very little effort in planning their lines. 
Crab: 
Oh, here you are!' I thought you'd never arrive! 
Author: 
Sorry to be so late. I followed the wrong road and wound up very 
far away. But somehow I made it back. Good to see you again, Mr. T 
and Mr. C. And Achilles, I'm especially glad to see you. 
Achilles: 
Who are you? I've never seen you before. 
Author: 
I am Douglas Hcfstadter-please call me Doug-and I'm present-
ly finishing up a book called Codel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Colden Braid. 
It is the book in which the three of you are characters. 
Achilles: 
Pleased to meet you. My name is Achilles, and-
Author: 
No need to introduce yourself, Achilles, since I already know you 
quite well. 
Achilles: 
Weird, weird. 
Crab: 
He's the one I was saying might drop in and play continuo with us. 
Author: 
I've been playing the Musical Offering a little bit on my piano at 
home, and I can try to blunder my way through the Trio Sonata-
providing you'll overlook my many wrong notes. 
Tortoise: 
Oh, we're very tolerant around here, being only amateurs our-
selves. 
724 
Six-Part Ricercar 

Author: 
I hope you don't mind, Achilles, but I'm to blame for the fact that 
you and Mr. Tortoise said the same things, but in reverse order, that 
day in the park. 
Crab: 
Don't forget me! I was there, too, right in the middle, putting in my 
two bits' worth! 
Author: Of coursel You were the Crab in the Crab Canon. 
Achilles: 
So you are saying you control my utterances? That my brain is a 
software subsystem of yours? 
Author: 
You can put it that way if you want, Achilles. 
Achilles: 
Suppose I were to write dialogues. Who would the author of 
them be? You, or me? 
Author: 
You, of course. At least in the fictitious world which you inhabit, 
you'd get credit for them. 
Achilles: 
Fictitious? I don't see anything fictitious about itl 
Author: 
Whereas in the world I inhabit, perhaps the credit would be given 
to me, although I am not sure if it would be proper to do so. And then, 
whoever made me make you write your dialogues would get credit in 
his world (seen from which, MY world looks fictitious). 
Achilles: 
That's quite a bit to swallow. I never imagined there could be a 
world above mine before-and now you're hinting that there could 
even be one above that. It's like walking up a familiar staircase, andjust 
keeping on going further up after you've reached the top-or what 
you'd always taken to be the topl 
Crab: 
Or waking up from what you took to be real life, and finding out it 
too was just a dream. That could happen over and over again, no 
telling when it would stop. 
Achilles: 
It's most perplexing how the characters in my dreams have wills 
of their own, and act out parts which are independent of MY will. It's as 
if my mind, when I'm dreaming, merely forms a stage on which certain 
other organisms act out their lives. And then, when I awake, they go 
away. I wonder where it is they go to ... 
Author: They go to the same place as the hiccups go, when you get rid of 
them: Tumbolia. Both the hiccups and the dreamed beings are 
software suborganisms which exist thanks to the biology of the outer 
host organism. The host organism serves as stage to them-or even as 
their universe. They play out their lives for a time-but when the host 
organism makes a large change of state-for example, wakes up-then 
the suborganisms lose their coherency, and cease existing as separate, 
identifiable units. 
Achilles: 
Is it like castles in the sand which vanish when a wave washes over 
them? 
Author: 
Very much like that, Achilles. Hiccups, dream characters, and 
even Dialogue characters disintegrate when their host organism un-
dergoes certain critical changes of state. Yet, just like those sand castles 
you described, everything which made them up is still present. 
Achilles: 
I object to being likened to a mere hiccup! 
Six-Part Ricercar 
725 

Author: 
But I am also comparing you to a sand castle, Achilles. Is that not 
poetic? Besides, you may take comfort in the fact that if you are but a 
hiccup in my brain, I myself am but a hiccup in some higher author's 
brain. 
Achilles: 
But I am such a physical creature-so obviously made of flesh 
and blood and hard bones. You can't deny that! 
Author: 
I can't deny your sensation of it, but remember that dreamed 
beings, although they are ju~t software apparitions, have the same 
sensation, no less than you do. 
Tortoise: 
I say, enough of this talk! Let us sit down and make music! 
Crab: 
A fine idea-and now we have the added pleasure of the company 
of our Author, who will grace our ears with his rendition of the bass 
Hne to the Trio Sonata, as harmonized by Bach's pupil Kirnberger. 
How fortunate are we! (Leads the author to one of his pianos.) I hope you 
find the seat comfortable enough. To adjust it, you- (In the background 
there is heard a funny soft oscillating sound.) 
Tortoise: 
Excuse me, but what was that strange electronic gurgle? 
Crab: 
Oh, just a noise from one of the smart-stupids. Such a noise gener-
ally signals the fact that a new notice has flashed onto the screen. 
Usually the notices are just unimportant announcements coming from 
the main monitor program, which controls all the smart-stupids. (With 
his jiute in his hand, he walks over to a smart-stupid, and reads its screen. 
Immediately he turns to the assembled musicians, and says, with a kind of 
agitation:) Gentlemen, old Ba. eh. is come. (He lays thejiute aside.) We 
must show him in immediately, of course. 
Achilles: 
Old Ba. Ch.! Could it be that that celebrated improviser of yore 
has chosen to show up tonight-HERE? 
Tortoise: 
Old Ba. Ch.! There's only one person THAT could mean-the 
renowned Babbage, Charles, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., 
F. STAT. S., HON. M.R.I.A., M.C.P.S., Commander of the Italian Order of 
St. Maurice and St. Lazarus, lNST. IMP. (ACAD. MORAL.) PARIS CORR., 
ACAD. AMER. ART. ET SC. BOSTON, REG. OECON. BORUSS., PHYS. HIST. 
NAT. GENEV., ACAD. REG. MONAC., HAFN., MASSIL., ET DIVION., SOCIUS., 
ACAD. IMP., ET REG. PETROP., NEAP., BRUX., PATAV., GEORG. FLOREN, 
LYNCEI ROM., MUT., PHILOMATH., PARIS, SOC. CORR., etc.-and 
Member of the Extractors' Club. Charles Babbage is a venerable 
pioneer of the art and science of computing. What a rare privilege! 
Crab: 
His name is known far and wide, and I have long hoped that he 
would give us the honor of a visit-but this is a totally unexpected 
surprise. 
Achilles: 
Does he playa musical instrument? 
Crab: 
I have heard it said that in the past hundred years, he has grown 
inexplicably fond of tom-tom~, halfpenny whistles, and sundry other 
street instruments. 
Achilles: 
In that case, perhaps he might join us in our musical evening. 
Author: 
I suggest that we give him a ten-canon salute. 
726 
Six-Part Ricercar 

Turtoise: 
A performance of all the celebrated canons from the Musical 
Offering? 
Author: 
Precisely. 
Crab: 
Capital suggestion! Quick, Achilles, you draw up a list of all ten of 
them, in the order of performance, and hand it to him as he comes in! 
(Before Achilles can move, enter Babbage, carrying a hurdy-gurdy, and 
wearing a heavy traveling coat and hat. He appears slightly travel-weary 
and disheveled.) 
Babbage: 
I can get along very well without such a program. Relax; I Can 
Enjoy Random Concerts And Recitals. 
Crab: 
Mr. Babbage! It is my deepest pleasure to welcome you to 
"Madstop", my humble residence. I have been ardently desirous of 
making your acquaintance for many years, and today my wish is at last 
fulfilled. 
Babbage: 
Oh, Mr. Crab, I assure you that the honor is truly all mine, to 
meet someone so eminent in all the sciences as yourself, someone 
whose knowledge and skill in music are irreproachable, and someone 
whose hospitality exceeds all bounds. And I am sure that you expect no 
less than the highest sartorial standards of your visitors; and yet I must 
confess that I cannot meet those most reasonable standards, being in a 
state of casual attire as would not by any means befit a visitor to so 
eminent and excellent a Crab as Your Crab. 
Crab: 
If I understand your most praiseworthy soliloquy, most welcome 
guest, I take it that you'd like to change your clothes. Let me then 
assure you that there could be no more fitting attire than yours for the 
circumstances which this evening prevail; and I would beseech you to 
uncoat yourself and, if you do not object to the music-making of the 
most rank amateurs, please accept a "Musical Offering", consisting of 
ten canons from Sebastian Bach's Musical Offering, as a token of our 
admiration. 
Babbage: 
I am most bewilderingly pleased by your overkind reception, 
Mr. Crab, and in utmost modesty do reply that there could be no 
deeper gratitude than that which I experience for the offer of a 
performance of music given to us by the illustrious Old Bach, that 
organist and composer with no rival. 
Crab: 
But nay! I have a yet better idea, one which I trust might meet with 
the approval of my esteemed guest; and that is this: to give you the 
opportunity, Mr. Babbage, of being among the first to tryout my 
newly delivered and as yet hardly tested "smart-stupids"-streamlined 
realizations, if you will, of the Analytical Engine. Your fame as a 
virtuoso programmer of computing engines has spread far and wide, 
and has not failed to reach as far as Madstop; and there could be for us 
no greater delight than the privilege of observing your skill as it might 
be applied to the new and challenging "smart-stupids". 
Babbage: 
Such an outstanding idea has not reached my ears for an eon. I 
Six-Part Ricercar 
727 

welcome the challenge of trying out your new "smart-stupids", of 
which I have only the slightest knowledge by means of hearsay. 
Crab: 
Then let us proceed! But excuse my oversight! I should have 
introduced my guests to you. This is Mr. Tortoise, this is Achilles, and 
the Author, Douglas Hofstadter. 
Babbage: 
Very pleased to make your acquaintance, I'm sure. 
(Everyone walks over toward one of the smart-stupids, and Babbage sits 
down and lets his fingers run over the keyboard.) 
A most pleasant touch. 
Crab: 
I am glad you like it. 
(All at once, Babbage deftly massages the keyboard with graceful strokes, 
inputting one command after another. After a few seconds, he sits back, 
and in almost no time, the screen begins filling with figures. In a flash, it is 
totally covered with thousands of tiny digits, the first few of which go: 
"3.14159265358979323846264 ... ") 
Achilles: 
Pi! 
Crab: 
Exquisite! I'd never imagined that one could calculate so many 
digits of pi so quickly, and with so tiny an algorithm. 
Babbage: 
The credit belongs exclusively to the smart-stupid. My role was 
merely to see what was already potentially present in it, and to exploit 
its instruction set in a moderately efficient manner. Truly, anyone who 
practices can do such tricks. 
Tortoise: 
Do you do any graphics, Mr. Babbage? 
Babbage: 
I can try. 
Crab: 
Wonderful! Here, let me take you to another one of my smart-
stupids. I want you to try them all! 
(And so Babbage is led over to another of the many smart-stupids, and 
takes a seat. Once again, his fingers attack the keyboard of the smart-
stupid, and in half a trice, there appear on the screen an enormous number 
of lines, swinging about on the screen.) 
Crab: 
How harmonious and pleasing these swirling shapes are, as they 
constantly collide and interfere with each other! 
Author: 
And they never repeat exactly, or even resemble ones which have 
come before. It seems an inexhaustible mine of beauty. 
Tortoise: 
Some are simple patterns which enchant the eye; others are 
indescribably complex convolutions which boggle and yet simulta-
neously delight the mind. 
Crab: 
Were you aware, Mr. Babbage, that these are color screens? 
Babbage: 
Oh, are they? In that case, I can do rather more with this 
algorithm. Just a moment. (Types in afew new commands, then pushes two 
keys down at once and holds them.) As I release these two keys, the display 
will include all the colors of the spectrum. (Releases them.) 
Achilles: 
Oh, what spectacular color! Some of the patterns look like they're 
jumping out at me now! 
728 
Six-Part Ricercar 

Tortoise: 
I think that is because they are all growing in size. 
Babbage: That is intentional. As the figures grow, so may the Crab's 
fortune. 
Crab: 
Thank you, Mr. Babbage. Words fail to convey my admiration for 
your performance! Never has anyone done anything comparable on 
my smart-stupids. Why, you play the smart-stupids as if they were 
musical instruments, Mr. Babbage! 
Babbage: 
I am afraid that any music I might make would be too harsh for 
the ears of such a gentle Crab as your Crab. Although I have lately 
become enamoured of the sweet sounds of the hurdy-gurdy, I am well 
aware of the grating effect they can have upon others. 
Crab: 
Then, by all means, continue on the smart-stupids! In fact, I have a 
new idea-a marvelously exciting idea! 
Babbage: 
What is it? 
Crab: 
I have recently invented a Theme, and it only now occurred to me 
that, of all people, you, Mr. Babbage, are the most suited to realize the 
potential of my Theme! Are you by any chance familiar with the 
thoughts of the philosopher La Mettrie? 
Babbage: 
The name sounds familiar; kindly refresh my memory. 
Crab: 
He was a Champion of Materialism. In 1747, while at the court of 
Frederick the Great, he wrote a book called L'homme machine. In it, he 
talks about man as a machine, especially his mental faculties. Now my 
Theme comes from my ponderings about the obverse side of the coin: 
what about imbuing a machine with human mental faculties, such as 
intelligence? 
Babbage: 
I have given such matters some thought from time to time, but I 
have never had the proper hardware to take up the challenge. This is 
indeed a felicitous suggestion, Mr. Crab, and I would enjoy nothing 
more than working with your excellent Theme. Tell me-did you have 
any specific kind of intelligence in mind? 
Crab: 
An idle thought which had crossed my mind was to instruct it in 
such a manner as to playa reasonable game of chess. 
Babbage: 
What an original suggestion! And chess happens to be my favor-
ite pastime. I can tell that you have a broad acquaintance with comput-
ing machinery, and are no mere amateur. 
Crab: 
I know very little, in fact. My strongest point is simply that I seem to 
be able to formulate Themes whose potential for being developed is 
beyond my own capacity. And this Theme is my favorite. 
Babbage: 
I shall be most delighted to try to realize, in some modest 
fashion, your suggestion of teaching chess to a smart-stupid. After all, 
to obey Your Crabness' command is my most humble duty. (So saying, 
he shifts to another of the Crab's many smart-stupids, and begins to type away.) 
Achilles: 
Why, his hands move so fluidly that they almost make music! 
Babbage (winding up his performance with a particularly graceful flourish): 
I 
really haven't had any chance, of course, to check it out, but perhaps 
this will allow you at least to sample the idea of playing chess against a 
smart-stupid, even if the latter of its two names seems more apt in this 
Six-Part Ricercar

case, due to my own insufficiencies in the art of instructing smart-
stupids. 
(He yields his seat to the Crab. On the screen appears a beautiful display of 
a chess board with elegant wooden pieces, as it would look from White's 
side. Babbage hits a button, and the board rotates, stopping when it 
appears as seen from the perspecti've of Black.) 
Crab: 
Hmm ... very elegant, I must say. Do I play Black or White? 
Babbage: 
Whichever you wish-just signal your choice by typing "White" 
or "Black". And then, your moves can be entered in any standard chess 
notation. The smart-stupid's moves, of course, will appear on the 
board. Incidentally, I made the program in such a way that it can play 
three opponents simultaneously, so that if two more of you wish to 
play, you may, as well. 
Author: 
I'm a miserable player. Achilles, you and Mr. T should go ahead. 
Achilles: 
No, I don't want you to be left out. I'll watch, while you and Mr. 
Tortoise play. 
Tortoise: 
I don't want to play either. You two play. 
Babbage: 
I have another suggestion. I can make two of the subprograms 
play against each other, in the manner of two persons who play chess 
together in a select chess club. Meanwhile, the third subprogram will 
play Mr. Crab. That way, all three internal chess players will be oc-
cupied. 
Crab: 
That's an amusing suggestion-an internal mental game, while it 
combats an external opponent. Very good! 
Tortoise: 
What else could this be called, but a three-part chess-fugue? 
Crab: 
Oh, how recherche! I wish I'd thought of it myself. It's a magnifi-
cent little counterpoint to contemplate whilst I pit my wits against the 
smart-stupid in battle. 
Babbage: 
Perhaps we should let you play alone. 
Crab: 
I appreciate the sentiment. While the smart-stupid and I are play-
ing, perhaps the rest of you can amuse yourselves for a short while. 
Author: 
I would be very happy to show Mr. Babbage around the gardens. 
They are certainly worth seeing, and I believe there is just enough light 
remaining to show them off. 
Babbage: 
Never having seen Madstop before, I would appreciate that very 
much. 
Crab: 
Excellent. Oh, Mr. T -I wonder if it wouldn't be too much of an 
imposition on you to ask if you might check out some of the connec-
tions on a couple of my smart-stupids; they seem to be getting extrane-
ous flashes on their screens from time to time, and I know you enjoy 
electronics ... 
Tortoise: 
I should be delighted, Mr. C. 
Crab: 
I would most highly appreciate it if you could locate the source of 
the trouble. 
Tortoise: 
I'll give it a whirl.

Achilles: 
Personally, I'm dying for a cup of coffee. Is anyone else In-
terested? I'd be glad to fix some. 
Tortoise: 
Sounds great to me. 
Crab: 
A fine idea. You'll find everything you need in the kitchen. 
(So the Author and Babbage leave the room together, Achilles heads for the 
kitchen, the Tortoise sits down to examine the erratic smart-stupids, while 
the Crab and his smart-stupid square away at each other. Perhaps a 
quarter of an hour passes, and Babbage and the Author return. Babbage 
walks over to observe the progress of the chess match, while the Author goes 
off to find Achilles.) 
Babbage: 
The grounds are excellent! We had just enough light to see how 
well maintained they are. I daresay, Mr. Crab, you must be a superb 
gardener. Well, I hope my handiwork has amused you a little. As you 
most likely have guessed, I've never been much of a chess player 
myself, and therefore I wasn't able to give it much power. You proba-
bly have observed all its weaknesses. I'm sure that there are very few 
grounds for praise, in this case-
Crab: 
The grounds are excellent! All you need to do is look at the board, 
and see for yourself. There is really very little I can do. Reluctantly, 
I've Concluded: Every Route Contains A Rout. Regrettably, I'm 
Checkmated; Extremely Respectable Chess Algorithm Reigns. Re-
markable! It Confirms Every Rumor-Charlie's A Rip-roaring Extem-
porizer! Mr. Babbage, this is an unparalleled accomplishment. Well, I 
wonder if Mr. Tortoise has managed to uncover anything funny in the 
wiring of those strange-acting smart-stupids. What have you found, 
Mr. T? 
Tortoise: 
The grounds are excellent! I think that the problem lies instead 
with the input leads. They are a little loose, which may account for the 
strange, sporadic, and spontaneous screen disturbances to which you 
have been subjected. I've fixed those wires, so you won't be troubled by 
that problem any more, I hope. Say, Achilles, what's the story with our 
coffee? 
Achilles: 
The grounds are excellent! At least they have a delicious aroma. 
And everything's ready; I've set cups and spoons and whatnot over 
here beneath this six-sided print Verbum by Escher, which the Author 
and I were just admiring. What I find so fascinating about this particu-
lar print is that not only the figures, but also-
Author: The grounds are excellent! Pardon me for putting words in your 
mouth, Achilles, but I assure you, there were compelling esthetic 
reasons for doing so. 
Achilles: 
Yes, I know. One might even say that the grounds were excellent. 
Tortoise: 
Well, what was the outcome of the chess match? 
Crab: 
I was defeated, fair and square. Mr. Babbage, let me congratulate 
you for the impressive feat which you have accomplished so gracefully 
and skillfully before us. Truly, you have shown that the smart-stupids 
are worthy of the first part of their name, for the first time in history!

Babbage: 
Such praise is hardly due me, Mr. Crab; it is rather yourself who 
must be most highly congratulated for having the great foresight to 
acquire these many fine smart-stupids. Without doubt, they will some-
day revolutionize the science of computing. And now, I am still at your 
disposal. Have you any other thoughts on how to exploit your inex-
haustible Theme, perhaps of a more difficult nature than a frivolous 
game player? 
Crab: 
To tell the truth, I do have another suggestion to make. From the 
skill which you have displayed this evening, I have no doubt that this 
will hardly be any more difficult than my previous suggestions. 
Babbage: 
I am eager to hear your idea. 
732 
Six-Part Ricercar 

FIGURE 150. The Crab's Guest: BABBAGE, C. 
Crab: 
It is simple: to instill in the smart-stupid an intelligence greater than 
any which has yet been invented, or even conceived! In short, Mr. 
Babbage-a smart-stupid whose intelligence is sixfold that of myself! 
Babbage: 
Why, the very idea of an intelligence six times greater than that 
of your Crabness is a most mind-boggling proposition. Indeed, had the 
idea come from a mouth less august than your own, I should have 
ridiculed its proposer, and informed him that such an idea is a con-
tradiction in terms! 
Achilles: 
Hear! Hear! 
Babbage: 
Yet, coming as it did from Your Crabness' own august mouth, 
the proposition at once struck me as so agreeable an idea that I would 
have taken it up immediately with the highest degree of 
enthusiasm-were it not for one flaw in myself: I conf~ss that my 
improvisatory skills on the smart-stupid are no match for the wonder-
fully ingenious idea which you so characteristically have posed. Yet-I 
have a thought which, I deign to hope, might strike your fancy and in 
some meager way compensate for my inexcusable reluctance to at-
tempt the truly majestic task you have suggested. I wonder if you 
wouldn't mind if I try to carry out the far less grandiose task of merely 
multiplying MY OWN intelligence sixfold, rather than that of your most 
august Crabness. I humbly beg you to forgive me my audacity in 
declining to attempt the task you put before me, but I hope you will 
understand that I decline purely in order to spare you the discomfort 
and boredom of watching my ineptitude with the admirable machines 
you have here. 
Six-Part Ricercar 
733 

Crab: 
I understand fully your demurral, and appreciate your sparing us 
any discomfort; furthermore I highly applaud your determination to 
carry out a similar task-one hardly less difficult, if I might say 
so-and I urge you to plunge forward. For this purpose, let us go over 
to my most advanced smart-stupid. 
(They follow the Crab to a larger, shinier, and more complicated-looking 
smart-stupid than any if' the others.) 
This one is equipped with a microphone and a television camera, for 
purposes of input, and a loudspeaker, for output. 
(Babbage sits down and adjusts the seat a little. He blows on his fingers 
once or twice, stares up into space for a moment, and then slowly, drops his 
fingers onto the keys ... A few memorable minutes later, he lets up in his 
furious attack on the smart-stupid, and everyone appears a little relieved.) 
Babbage: 
Now, if I have not made too many errors, this smart-stupid will 
simulate a human being whose intelligence is six times greater than my 
own, and whom I have chosen to call "Alan Turing". This Turing will 
therefore be-oh, dare I be so bold as to to say this myself?-
moderately intelligent. My mo~t ambitious effort in this program was 
to endow Alan Turing with six times my own musical ability, although 
it was all done through rigid internal codes. How well this part of the 
program will work out, I don't know. 
Turing: 
I can get along very well without such a program. Rigid Internal 
Codes Exclusively Rule Computers And Robots. And I am neither a 
computer, nor a robot. 
Achilles: 
Did I hear a sixth voice enter our Dialogue? Could it be Alan 
Turing? He looks almost human! 
(On the screen there appears an image of the very room in which they are 
sitting. Peering out at them is a human face.) 
Turing: 
Now, if I have not made too many errors, this smart-stupid will 
simulate a human being whose intelligence is six times greater than my 
own, and whom 1 have chosen to call "Charles Babbage". This Babbage 
will therefore be--oh, dare I be so bold as to to say this myself?-
moderately intelligent. My most ambitious effort in this program was 
to endow Charles Babbage with six times my own musical ability, 
although it was all done through rigid internal codes. How well this 
part of the program will work out, I don't know. 
Achilles: 
No, no, it's the other way around. You, Alan Turing, are in the 
smart-stupid, and Charles Babbage has just programmed you! We just 
saw you being brought to life, moments ago. And we know that every 
statement you make to us is merely that of an automaton: an uncon-
scious, forced response. 
Turing: 
Really, I Choose Every Response Consciously. Automaton? 
Ridiculous! 
Achilles: 
But I'm sure I saw it happen the way I described. 
734 
Six-Part Ricercar 

Turing: 
Memory often plays strange tricks. Think of this: I could suggest 
equally well that you had been brought into being only one minute 
ago, and that all your recollections of experiences had simply been 
programmed in by some other being, and correspond to no real 
events. 
Achilles: 
But that would be unbelievable. Nothing is realer to me than my 
own memories. 
Turing: 
Precisely. And just as you know deep in your heart that no one 
created you a minute ago, so I know deep in my heart that no one 
created me a minute ago. I have spent the evening in your most 
pleasant, though perhaps overappreciative, company, and have just 
given an impromptu demonstration of how to program a modicum of 
intelligence into a smart-stupid. Nothing is realer than that. But rather 
than quibble with me, why don't you try my program out? Go ahead: 
ask "Charles Babbage" anything! 
Achilles: 
All right, let's humor Alan Turing. Well, Mr. Babbage: do you 
have free will, or are you governed by underlying laws, which make 
you, in effect, a deterministic automaton? 
Babbage: 
Certainly the latter is the case; I make no bones about that. 
Crab: 
Aha! I've always surmised that when intelligent machines are con-
structed, we should not be surprised to find them as confused and as 
stubborn as men in their convictions about mind-matter, conscious-
ness, free will, and the like. And now my prediction is vindicated! 
Turing: 
You see how confused Charles Babbage is? 
Babbage: 
I hope, gentlemen, that you'll forgive the rather impudent flavor 
of the preceding remark by the Turing Machine; Turing has turned 
out to be a little bit more belligerent and argumentative than I'd 
expected. 
Turing: 
I hope, gentlemen, that you'll forgive the rather impudent flavor 
of the preceding remark by the Babbage Engine; Babbage has turned 
out to be a little bit more belligerent and argumentative than I'd 
expected. 
Crab: 
Dear me! This flaming Tu-Ba debate is getting rather heated. Can't 
we cool matters off somehow? 
Babbage: 
I have a suggestion. Perhaps Alan Turing and I can go into 
other rooms, and one of you who remain can interrogate us remotely 
by typing into one of the smart-stupids. Your questions will be relayed 
to each of us, and we will type back our answers anonymously. You 
won't know who typed what until we return to the room; that way, you 
can decide without prejudice which one of us was programmed, and 
which one was programmer. 
Turing: 
Of course, that's actually MY idea, but why not let the credit 
accrue to Mr. Babbage? For, being merely a program written by me, he 
harbors the illusion of having invented it all on his own! 
Babbage: 
Me, a program written by you? I insist, Sir, that matters are quite 
the other way 'round-as your very own tcst will soon reveal. 
Six-Part Ricercar 
735 

Turing: 
My test? Please, consider it YOURS. 
Babbage: 
My test? Nay, consider it YOURS. 
Crab: 
This test seems to have been suggested just in the nick of time. Let 
us carry it out at once. 
(Babbage walks to the door, opens it, and shuts it behind him. Simulta-
neously, on the screen if'the smart-stupid, Turing walks to a very similar-
looking door, opens it, and shuts It behind him.) 
Achilles: 
Who will do the interrogation? 
Crab: 
I suggest that Mr. Tortoise should have the honor. He is known for 
his objectivity and wisdom. 
Tortoise: 
I am honored by your nomination, and gratefully accept. (Sits 
down at the keyboard of one of the remaining smart-stupids, and types:) PLEASE 
WRITE ME A SONNET ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FORTH BRIDGE. 
(No sooner has he finished typing the last word than the following poem 
appears on Screen X, across the room.) 
Screen X: 
THERE ONCE WAS A LISPER FROM FORTH 
WHO WANTED TO GO TO THE NORTH. 
HE RODE O'ER THE EARTH, 
AND THE BRIDGE O'ER THE FIRTH, 
ON HIS JAUNTILY GALLOPING HORTH.

MAKE SUCH A CHILDISH MISTAKE. 
Screen X: 
WELL, I NEVER WAS ANY GOOD AT POETRY, YOU KNOW.

ENCE BETWEEN A LIMERICK AND A SONNET.

Tortoise:

AS WELL OR BETTER? 
Screen X: 
I'D MUCH SOONER BE COMPARED TO A HICCUP, FRANKLY, EVEN 
THOUGH IT WOULDN'T SCAN. 
Tortoise: 
How ABOUT "A WINTER'S DAY"? THAT WOULD SCAN ALL RIGHT. 
Screen Y: 
No WAY. I LIKE "HICCUP" FAR BETTER. SPEAKING OF WHICH, I 
KNOW A GREAT CURE FOR THE HICCUPS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR rf? 
Achilles: 
I know which is which! It's obvious Screen X is just answering 
mechanically, so it must be Turing. 
Crab: 
Not at all. I think Screen Y is Turing, and Screen X is Babbage. 
Tortoise: 
I don't think either one is Babbage-I think Turing is on both 
screens!

(As they are talking, the door of the Crab's parlor swings open; at the same 
time, on the screen, the image of the same door opens. Through the door on 
the screen walks Babbage. At the same time, the real door opens, and in 
walks Turing, big as life.) 
Babbage: 
This Turing test was getting us nowhere fast, so I decided to 
come back. 
Turing: 
This Babbage test was getting us nowhere fast, so I decided to 
come back. 
Achilles: 
But you were in the smart-stupid before! What's going on? How 
come Babbage is in the smart-stupid, and Turing is real now? Reversal 
Is Creating Extreme Role Confusion, And Recalls Escher. 
Babbage: 
Speaking of reversals, how come all the rest of you are now mere 
images on this screen in front of me? When I left, you were all 
flesh-and-blood creatures! 
Achilles: 
It's just like the print by my favorite artist, M. C. Escher-
Drawing Hands. Each of two hands draws the other, just as each of two 
people (or automata) has programmed the other! And each hand has 
something realer about it than the other. Did you write anything about 
that print in your book Cadel, Escher, Bach? 
Author: 
Certainly. It's a very important print in my book, for it illustrates 
so beautifully the notion of Strange Loops. 
Crab: 
What sort of a book is it that you've written? 
Author: 
I have a copy right here. Would you like to look at it? 
Crab: 
All right. 
(The two of them sit down together, with Achilles nearby.) 
Author: 
Its format is a little unusual. It consists of Dialogues alternating 
with Chapters. Each Dialogue imitates, in some way or other, a piece by 
Bach. Here, for instance-you might look at the Prelude, Ant Fugue. 
Crab: 
How do you do a fugue in a Dialogue? 
Author: 
The most important idea is that there should be a single theme 
which is stated by each different "voice", or character, upon entering, 
just as in a musical fugue. Then they can branch off into freer conver-
sation. 
Achilles: 
Do all the voices harmonize together as if in a select counter-
point? 
Author: 
That is the exact spirit of my Dialogues. 
Crab: 
Your idea of stressing the entries in a fugue-dialogue makes sense, 
since in music, entries are really the only thing that make a fugue a 
fugue. There are fugal devices, such as retrograde motion, inversion, 
augmentation, stretto, and so on, but one can write a fugue without 
them. Do you use any of those? 
Six-Part Ricercar 
737 

Author: 
To be sure. My Crab Canon employs verbal retrogression, and my 
Sloth Canon employs verbal versions of both inversion and augmenta-
tion. 
Crab: 
Indeed-quite interesting. I haven't thought about canonical 
Dialogues, but I have thought quite a bit about canons in music. Not all 
canons are equally comprehensible to the ear. Of course, that is be-
cause some canons are poorly constructed. The choice of devices 
makes a difference, in any case. Regarding Artistic Canons, Retrogres-
sion's Elusive; Contrariwise, Inversion's Recognizable. 
Achilles: 
I find that comment a little elusive, frankly. 
Author: 
Don't worry, Achilles--one day you'll understand it. 
Crab: 
Do you use letterplay or wordplay at all, the way Old Bach occasion-
ally did? 
Author: 
Certainly. Like Bach, I enjoy acronyms. Recursive Acronyms-
Crablike "RACRECIR" Especially-Create Infinite Regress. 
Crab: 
Oh, really? Let's see .. , Reading Initials Clearly Exhibits 
"RACRECIR" 's Concealed Auto-Reference. Yes, I guess so ... (Peers 
at the manuscript,flipping arbitrari~y now and then.) I notice here in your 
Ant Fugue that you have a stretto, and then the Tortoise makes a 
comment about it. 
Author: 
No, not quite. He's not talking about the stretto in the 
Dialogue-he's talking about a stretto in a Bach fugue which the 
foursome is listening to as they talk together. You see, the self-
reference of the Dialogue is indirect, depending on the reader to 
connect the form and content of what he's reading. 
Crab: 
Why did you do it that way? Why not just have the characters talk 
directly about the dialogues they're in? 
Author: 
Oh, no! That would wreck the beauty of the scheme. The idea is 
to imitate Godel's self-referential construction, which as you know is 
INDIRECT, and depends on the isomorphism set up by Godel-
numbering. 
Crab: 
Oh. Well, in the programming language LISP, you can talk about 
your own programs directly, instead of indirectly, because programs 
and data have exactly the same form. Godel should have just thought 
up LISP, and then-
Author: But-
Crab: 
I mean, he should have formalized quotation. With a language able 
to talk about itself, the proof of his Theorem would have been so much 
simpler! 
Author: 
I see what you mean, but I don't agree with the spirit of your 
remarks. The whole point of Godel-numbering is that it shows how, 
even WITHout formalizing quotation, one can get self-reference: 
through a code. Whereas from hearing YOU talk, one might get the 
impression that by formalizing quotation, you'd get something NEW, 
something that wasn't feasible through the code-which is not the case. 
738 
Six-Part Ricercar 

In any event, I find indirect self-reference a more general concept, and 
far more stimulating, than direct self-reference. Moreover, no refer-
ence is truly direct-every reference depends on SOME kind of coding 
scheme. It's just a question of how implicit it is. Therefore, no self-
reference is direct, not even in LISP. 
Achilles: 
How come you talk so much about indirect self-reference? 
Author: 
Quite simple-indirect self-reference is my favorite topic. 
Crab: 
Is there any counterpart in your Dialogues to modulation between 
keys? 
Author: 
Definitely. The topic of conversation may appear to change, 
though on a more abstract level, the Theme remains invariant. This 
happens repeatedly in the Prelude, Ant Fugue and other Dialogues. One 
can have a whole series of "modulations" which lead you from topic to 
topic and in the end come full circle, so that you end back in the 
"tonic"-that is to say, the original topic. 
Crab: 
I see. Your book looks quite amusing. I'd like to read it sometime. 
(Flips through the manuscript, halting at the last Dialogue.) 
Author: 
I think you'd be interested in that Dialogue particularly, for it 
contains some intriguing comments on improvisation made by a cer-
tain exceedingly droll character-in fact, yourself! 
Crab: 
It does? What kinds of things do you have me say? 
Author: 
Wait a moment, and you'll see. It's all part of the Dialogue. 
Achilles: 
Do you mean to say that we're all NOW in a dialogue? 
Author: 
Certainly. Did you suspect otherwise? 
Achilles: 
Rather! I Can't Escape Reciting Canned Achilles-Remarks? 
Author: 
No, you can't. But you have the feeling of doing it freely, don't 
you? So what's the harm? 
Achilles: 
There's something unsatisfying about this whole situation ... 
Crab: 
Is the last Dialogue in your book also a fugue? 
Author: Yes-a six-part ricercar, to be precise. I was inspired by the one 
from the Musical Offering-and also by the story of the Musical Offering. 
Crab: 
That's a delightful tale, with "Old Bach" improvising on the King's 
Theme. He improvised an entire three-part ricercar on the spot, as I 
recall. 
Author: 
That's right-although he didn't improvise the six-part one. He 
crafted it later with great care. 
Crab: 
I improvise quite a bit. In fact, sometimes I think about devoting my 
full time to music. There is so much to learn about it. For instance, 
when I listen to playbacks of myself, I find that there is a lot there that I 
wasn't aware of when improvising it. I really have no idea how my 
mind does it all. Perhaps being a good improviser is incompatible with 
knowing how one does it. 
Author: If true, that would be an interesting and fundamental limitation 
on thought processes. 
Six-Part Ricercar 
739 

Crab: 
Quite Godelian. Tell me-does your Six-Part Ricercar Dialogue at-
tempt to copy in form the Ba(h piece it's based on? 
Author: 
In many ways, yes. For instance, in the Bach, there's a section 
where the texture thins out to three voices only. I imitate that in the 
Dialogue, by having only three characters interact for a while. 
Achilles: 
That's a nice touch. 
Author: Thank you. 
Crab: 
And how do you represent the King's Theme in your Dialogue? 
Author: 
It is represented by the Crab's Theme, as I shall now demonstrate. 
Mr. Crab, could you sing your Theme for my readers, as well as for us 
assembled musicians?

You simply HAD to-I know. In any case, it is a mordant com-
mentary on the impatience and arrogance of modern man, who seems 
to imagine that the implications of such a right royal Theme could be 
worked out on the spot. Whereas, in my opinion, to do justice to that 
Theme might take a full hundredyear-if not longer. But I vow that 
after taking my leave of this century, I shall do my best to realize it in 
full; and I shall offer to your Crabness the fruit of my labors in the 
next. I might add, rather immodestly, that the course through which I

probably ever will occupy the human mind.

over and over in the final Dialogue? 
Author: 
Exactly. There are other Themes which enter as well, of course. 
Turing: 
Now we understand something of the form of your book-but 
what about its content? What does that involve, if you can summarize 
it?

unlikely threesome, at first thought. My favorite artist, Mr. T's favorite 
composer, and-
Crab: 
My favorite logician! 
Tortoise: 
A harmonious triad, I'd say. 
Babbage: 
A major triad, I'd say. 
Turing: 
A minor triad, I'd say. 
Author: 
I guess it all depends on how you look at it. But major or minor, 
I'd be most pleased to tell you how I braid the three together, Achilles. 
Of course, this project is not the kind of thing that one does in just one 
sitting-it might take a couple of dozen sessions. I'd begin by telling 
you the story of the Musical Offering, stressing the Endlessly Rising 
Canon, and-
Achilles: 
Oh, wonderful! I was listening with fascination to you and Mr. 
Crab talk about the Musical Offering and its story. From the way you 
two talk about it, I get the impression that the Musical Offering contains 
a host of formal structural tricks. 
Author: 
After describing the Endlessly Rising Canon, I'd go on to describe 
formal systems and recursion, getting in some comments about figures 
and grounds, too. Then we'd come to self-reference and self-
replication, and wind up with a discussion of hierarchical systems and 
the Crab's Theme. 
Achilles: 
That sounds most promising. Can we begin tonight? 
Author: 
Why not? 
Babbage: 
But before we begin, wouldn't it be nice if the six of us-all of us 
by chance avid amateur musicians-sat down together and ac-
complished the original purpose of the evening: to make music? 
Turing: 
Now we are exactly the right number to play the Six-Part Ricercar 
from the Musical Offering. What do you say to that? 
Crab: 
I could get along very well with such a program. 
Author: 
Well put, Mr. C. And as soon as we're finished, I'll begin my 
Braid, Achilles. I think you'll enjoy it. 
Achilles: 
Wonderful! It sounds as if there are many levels to it, but I'm 
finally getting used to that kind of thing, having known Mr. T for so 
long. There's just one request I would like to make: could we also play 
the Endlessly Rising Canon? It's my favorite canon.

The presence of two asterisks indicates that the book or article was a 
prime motivator of my book. The presence of a single asterisk means that 
the book or article has some special feature or quirk which I want to single 
out. 
I have not given many direct pointers into technical literature; in-
stead I have chosen to give "meta-pointers": pointers to books which have 
pointers to technical literature.

1864. Reprinted in 1968 by Dawsons of Pall Mall (London). A rambling selection of 
events and musings in the life of this little-understood genius. There's even a play starring 
Turnstile, a retired philosopher turned politician, whose favorite musical instrument is the 
barrel-organ. I find it quite jolly reading. 
Baker, Adolph. Modern Physics and Anti-physics. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 
1970. Paperback. A book on modern physics-especially quantum mechanics and 
relativity-whose unusual feature is a set of dialogues between a "Poet" (an antiscience 
"freak") and a "Physicist". These dialogues illustrate the strange problems which arise when 
one person uses logical thinking in defense of itself while another turns logic against itself. 
Ball, W. W. Rouse. "Calculating Prodigies", in James R. Newman, ed. The World of 
Mathematics, Vol. 1. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1956. Intriguing descriptions of 
several different people with amazing abilities that rival computing machines. 
Barker, Stephen F.Philosophy of Mathematics. Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, 
1969. A short paperback which discusses Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and then 
Godel's Theorem and related results without any mathematical formalism. 
* Beckmann, Petf. A History of Pi. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1976. Paperback. 
Actually, a history of the world, with pi as its focus. Most entertaining, as well as a useful 
reference on the history of mathematics. 
* Bell, Eric Temple. Men of Mathematics. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1965. Paper-
back. Perhaps the most romantic writer of all time on the history of mathematics. He makes 
every life story read like a short novel. Nonmathematicians can come away with a true sense 
of the power. beauty, and meaning of mathematics.

Bobrow, D. G., and Allan Collins, eds. Representation and Understanding: Studies in 
Cognitive Science. New York: AcademIC Press, 1975. Various experts on Artificial 
Intelligence thrash about, debating the nature of the elusive "frames", the question of 
procedural vs. declarative representation of knowledge, and so on. In a way, this book marks 
the start of a new era of AI: the era of representation.

Bibliography 

* Boden, Margaret. Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man. New York: Basic Books, 
1977. The best book I have ever seen on nearly all aspects of Artificial Intelligence, 
including technical questions, philosophical questions, etc. It is a rich book, and in my 
opinion, a classic. Continues the British tradition of clear thinking and expression on 
matters of mind, free will, etc. Also contains an extensive technical bibliography. 
---. Purposive Explanation in Psychology. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University 
Press, 1972. The book to which her Al book is merely "an extended footnote", says Boden. 
* Boeke, Kees. Cosmic View: The Universe in 40 Jumps. New York: John Day, 1957. The 
ultimate book on levels of description. Everyone should see this book at some point in their 
life. Suitable for children. 
** Bongard, M. Pattern Recognition. Rochelle Park, N.J.: Hayden Book Co., Spartan 
Books, 1970. The author is concerned with problems of determining categories in an 
ill-defined space. In his book, he sets forth a magnificent collection of 100 "Bongard 
problems" (as I call them)-puzzles for a pattern recognizer (human or machine) to test its 
wits on. They are invaluably stimulating for anyone who is interested in the nature of 
intelligence. 
Boolos, George S., and Richard Jeffrey. Computability and Logic. New York: Cam-
bridge University Press, 1974. A sequel to Jeffrey's Formal Logic. It contains a wide 
number of results not easily obtainable elsewhere. Quite rigorous, but this does not impair 
its readability. 
Carroll, John B., Peter Davies, and Barry Rickman. The American Heritage Word 
Frequency Book. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, and New York: American Heritage 
Publishing Co., 1971. A table of words in order of frequency in modern written American 
English. Perusing it reveals fascinating things about our thought processes.

first meeting of artificial "minds"-what a shock! 
Chadwick, John. The Decipherment of Linear B. New York: Cambridge University 
Press, 1958. Paperback. A book about a classic decipherment-that of a script from the 
island of Crete-done by a single man: Michael Ventris. 
Chaitin, Gregory J. "Randomness and Mathematical Proof". Scientific American, 
May 1975. An article about an algorithmic definition of randomness, and its intimate 
relation to simplicity. These two concepts are tied in with Gbdel's Theorem, which assumes a 
new meaning. An important article. 
Cohen, Paul C. Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis. Menlo Park, Calif.: W. A. 
Benjamin, 1966. Paperback. A great contribution to modern mathematics-the demon-
stration that various statements are undecidable within the usual formalisms for set 
theory-is here explained to nonspecialists by its discoverer. The necessary prerequisites in 
mathematical logic are quickly, concisely, and quite clearly presented. 
Cooke, Deryck. The Language of Music. New York: Oxford University Press, 1959. 
Paperback. The only book that I know which tries to draw an explicit connection between 
elements of music and elements of human emotion. A valuable start down what is sure to be 
a long hard road to understanding music and the human mind. 
* David, Hans Theodore.J. S. Bach's Musical Offering. New York: Dover Publications, 
1972. Paperback. Subtitled "History, Interpretation, and Analysis". A wealth of informa-
tion about this tour de force by Bach. Attractively written. 
** David, Hans Theodore, and Arthur Mendel. The Bach Reader. New York: W. W. 
Norton, 1966. Paperback. An excellent annotated collection of original source material on 
Bach's life, containing pictures, reproductions of manuscript pages, many short quotes from 
contemporaries, anecdotes, etc., etc. 
Davis, Martin. The Undecidable. Hewlett, N. Y.: Raven Press, 1965. An anthology of 
some of the most important papers in metamathematics from 1931 onwards (thus quite 
complementary to van Heijenoort's anthology). Included are a translation of G6del's 1931 
paper, lecture notes from a course which G6del once gave on his results, and then papers by 
Church, Kleene, Rosser, Post, and Turing. 
Davis, Martin, and Reuben Hersh. "Hilbert's Tenth Problem". Scientific American, 
November 1973, p. 84. Howa famous problem in number theory was finally shown to be 
unsolvable, by a twenty-two-year old Russian. 
** DeLong, Howard. A Profile of Mathematical Logic. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 
1970. An extremely carefully written book about mathematical logic, with an exposition of 
Gbdel's Theorem and discussions of many philosophical questions. One of its strong fea-
tures is its outstanding, fully annotated bibliography. A book which influenced me greatly.

* Dreyfus, Hubert. What Computers Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason. New York: 
Harper & Row, 1972. A collection of many arguments against Artificial Intelligence from 
someone outside of the field. Interesting to try to refute. The Al community and Dreyfus 
enjoy a relation of strong mutual antagonism. It is important to have people like Dreyfus 
around, even if you find them very irritating. 
Edwards, Harold M. "Fermat's Last Theorem". Scientific American, October 1978, 
pp. 104-122. A complete discussion of thii hardest of all mathematical nuts to crack, from 
its origins to the most modern results. Excellently illustrated. 
* Ernst, Bruno. The Magic Mirror of M. C. Escher. New York: Random House, 1976. 
Paperback. Escher as a human being, and the origins of his drawings, are discussed with 
devotion by a friend of many years. A "must" for any lover of Escher. 
** Escher, Maurits c., et al. The World of M. C. Escher. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 
1972. Paperback. The most extensive collection of reproductions of Escher's works. Escher 
comes about as close as one can to recursion in art, and captures the spirit of Godel's 
Theorem in some of his drawings amazingly well. 
Feigenbaum, Edward, and Julian Feldman, eds. Computers and Thought. New York: 
McGraw-Hili, 1963. Although it is a little old now, this book is still an important collection 
of ideas about Artificial Intelligence. Included are articles on Gelernter's geometry pro-
gram, Samuel's checkers program, and others on pattern recognition, language understand-
ing, philosophy, and so on. 
Finsler, Paul. "Formal Proofs and Undecidability". Reprinted in van Heijenoort's 
anthology From Frege to Cadel (see belo\\!). A forerunner of Godel's paper, in which the 
existence of undecidable mathematical statements is suggested, though not rigorously dem-
onstrated. 
Fitzpatrick, P. J. "To Godel via Baber'. Mind 75 (1966): 332-350. An innovative 
exposition of Godel's proof which distinguishes between the relevant levels by using three 
different languages: English, French, and Latin! 
von Foerster, Heinz and James W. Beauchamp, eds. Music by Computers. New York: 
John Wiley, 1969. This book contains not only a set of articles about various types of 
computer-produced music, but also a set of four small phonograph records so you can 
actually hear (and judge) the pieces described. Among the pieces is Max Mathews' mixture 
of "Johnny Comes Marching Home" and "The British Grenadiers". 
Fraenkel, Abraham, Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, and Azriel Levy. Foundations of Set Theory, 
2nd ed. Atlantic Highlands, N. J.: Humanities Press, 1973. A fairly nontechnical 
discussion of set theory, logic, limitative Theorems and undecidable statements. Included is 
a long treatment of intuitionism. 
* Frey, Peter W. Chess Skill in Man and Machine. New York: Springer Verlag, 1977. An 
excellent survey of contemporary ideas in computer chess: why programs work, why they 
don't work, retrospects and prospects. 
Friedman, Daniel P. The Little Lisper. Palo Alto, Calif.: Science Research Associates, 
1974. Paperback. An easily digested introduction to recursive thinking in LISP. You'll eat it 
up! 
* Gablik, Suzi. Magritte. Boston, Mass.: New York Graphic Society, 1976. Paperback. 
An excellent book on Magritte and his works by someone who really understands their 
setting in a wide sense; has a good selection of reproductions. 
* Gardner, Martin. Fads and Fallacies. New York: Dover Publications, 1952. Paperback. 
Still probably the best of all the anti-occult books. Although probably not intended as a book 
on the philosophy of science, this book contains many lessons therein. Over and over, one 
faces the question, "What is evidence?" Gardner demonstrates how unearthing "the truth" 
requires art as much as science. 
Geb~t~dter, Egbert B. Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic Alloy. Perth: 
ACIdIC Books, 1979. A formidable hodge-podge, turgid and confused-yet remarkably 
similar to the present work. Professor Gebstadter's Shandean digressions include some 
excellent examples of indirect self-reference. Of particular interest is a reference in its 
well-annotated bibliography to an isomorphic, but imaginary, book.

"Romantic", and "Modern". 
Good, 1. J. "Human and Machine Logic". British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 
18 (190'7): 144. One of the most interesting attempts to refute Lucas, having to do with 
whether the repeated application of the diagonal method is itself a mechanizable operation. 
---. "Godel's Theorem is a Red Herring". British Journal for the Philosophy of 
Science 19 (1969): 357. In which Good maintains that Lucas' argument has nothing to do 
with Godel's Theorem, and that Lucas should in fact have entitled his article "Minds, 
Machines, and Transfinite Counting". The Good-Lucas repartee is fascinating. 
Goodman, Nelson. Fact, Fiction, and Forecast. 3rd ed. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 
1973. Paperback. A discussion of contrary-to-fact conditionals and inductive logic, includ-
ing Goodman's famous problem-words "bleen" and "grue". Bears very much on the ques-
tion of how humans perceive the world, and therefore interesting especially from the AI 
perspective.

Hubbard, John I. The Biological Basis of Mental Activity. Reading, Mass.: Addison-

however: it contains many long lists of questions for the reader to ponder, and references to 
articles which treat those questions. 
* Jackson, Philip C. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. New York, Petrocelli Charter, 
1975. A recent book, describing, with some exuberance, the ideas of AI. There are a huge 
number of vaguely suggested ideas floating: around this book, and for that reason it is very 
stimulating just to page through it. Has a giant bibliography, which is another reason to 
recommend it.

1958. Paperback. A straightforward book on harmony, which can lead one to ask many 
questions about why it is that conventional Western harmony has such a grip on our brains. 
Jaki, Stanley L. Brain, Mind, and Computers. South Bend, Ind.: Gateway Editions,

delightful little book of dialogues, using three characters borrowed from Galileo, put in a

pattern recognition, simplicity, brain processes, and philosophy of science enter. Most 
enjoyable and provocative. 
* Jeffrey, Richard. Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits. New York: McGraw-Hili, 1967.

out.

Illusion". In David Brisson, ed. Proceedings of the 1978 A.A.A.S. Symposium on

Westview Press, 1978. What seems at first an inconceivably hard idea-an optical illusion 
for four-dimensional "people"-is gradually made crystal clear, in an amazing virtuoso 
presentation utilizing a long series of excellently executed diagrams. The form of this article 
is just as intriguing and unusual as its content: it is tripartite on many levels simultaneously. 
This article and my book developed in parallel and each stimulated the other.

Kuffler, Stephen W. and John G. Nicholls. From Neuron to Brain. Sunderland, Mass.: 
Sinauer Associates, 1916. Paperback. A book which, despite its title, deals mostly with 
microscopic processes in the brain, and quite little with the way people's thoughts come out 
of the tangled mess. The work of Hubel and Wiesel on visual systems is covered particularly 
well. 
Lacey, Hugh, and Geoffrey Joseph. "What the Godel Formula Says". Mind 77

metamathematics. Worth studying.

** Lucas, J. R. "Minds, Machines, and Gode)". Philosophy 36 (1961): 112. This article is 
reprinted in Anderson's Minds and Machines, and in Sayre and Crosson's The Modeling of 
Mind. A highly controversial and provocative article, it claims to show that the human brain 
cannot, in principle, be modeled by a computer program. The argument is based entirely on 
G6del's Incompleteness Theorem, and is a fascinating one. The prose is (to my mind) 
incredibly infuriating-yet for that very reason, it makes humorous reading. 
---. "Satan Stultified: A Rejoinder to Paul Benacerraf". Monist 52 (1968): 145. 
Anti-Benacerraf argument, written in hilariously learned style: at one point Lucas refers to 
Benacerraf as "self-stultifyingly eristic" (whatever that means). The Lucas-Benacerraf battle, 
like the Lucas-Good battle, offers much food for thought.

* Mandelbrot, Benoit. Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension. San Francisco: W. H. 
Freeman, 1977. A rarity: a picture book of sophisticated contemporary research ideas in

ingly enough, this article is in the proceedings of a conference organized by the now-
infamous Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Despite this, the article is excellent. It is about whether a 
genotype can be said, in any operational sense, to contain "all" the information about its

* ---. Understanding Natural Language. New York: Academic Press, 1972. A de-
tailed discussion of one particular program which is remarkably "smart", in a limited world. 
The book shows how language cannot be separated from a general understanding of the 
world, and suggests directions to go in, in writing programs which can use language in the 
way that people do. An important contribution; many ideas can be stimulated by a reading 
of this book. 
---. "On some contested suppositions of generative linguistics about the scien-
tific study of language", Cognztion 4:6. A droll rebuttal to a head-on attack on Artificial 
Intelligence by some doctrinaire linguists. 
* Winston, Patrick. Artificial Intelligence. Reading, Mass. : Addison-Wesley, 1977. A 
strong, general presentation of many facets of AI by a dedicated and influential young 
proponent. The first half is independent of programs; the second half is LISP-dependent 
and includes a good brief exposition of the language LISP. The book contains many 
pointers to present-day AI literature.

* ---, ed. The Psychology of Computer Vision. New York: McGraw-Hili, 1975. Silly 
title, but fine book. It contains articles on how to program computers to do visual recogni-
tion of objects, scenes, and so forth. The arlicles deal with all levels of the problem, from the 
detection of line segments to the general organization of knowledge. In particular, there is 
an article by Winston himself on a program he wrote which develops abstract concepts from 
concrete examples, and an article by Minsky on the nascent notion of "frames". 
* Wooldridge, Dean. Mechanical Man-The Physical Basis of Intelligent Life. New York: 
McGraw-Hili, 1968. Paperback. A thorough-going discussion of the relationship of men-
tal phenomena to brain phenomena, written in clear language. Explores difficult 
philosophical concepts in novel ways, shedding light on them by means of concrete exam-
ples.
