Preface
Many students ﬁnd that the obligatory Statistics course comes as a shock. The set textbook is
difﬁcult, the curriculum is vast, and secondary-school maths feels inﬁnitely far away.
“Statistics” offers friendly instruction on the core areas of these subjects. The focus is overview.
And the numerous examples give the reader a “recipe” for solving all the common types of exer-
cise. You can download this book free of charge.

Basic concepts of probability theory

Basic concepts of probability theory
2.1
Probability space, probability function, sample space, event
A probability space is a pair (Ω, P) consisting of a set Ωand a function P which assigns to each
subset A of Ωa real number P(A) in the interval [0, 1]. Moreover, the following two axioms are
required to hold:
1. P(Ω) = 1,
2. P (∞
n=1 An) = ∞
n=1 P(An) if A1, A2, . . . is a sequence of pairwise disjoint subsets of Ω.
The set Ωis called a sample space. The elements ω ∈Ωare called sample points and the subsets
A ⊆Ωare called events. The function P is called a probability function. For an event A, the
real number P(A) is called the probability of A.
From the two axioms the following consequences can be deduced:
3. P(Ø) = 0,
4. P(A\B) = P(A) −P(B) if B ⊆A,
5. P(∁A) = 1 −P(A),
6. P(A) ≧P(B) if B ⊆A,
7. P(A1 ∪· · · ∪An) = P(A1) + · · · + P(An) if A1, . . . , An are pairwise disjoint events,
8. P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B) for arbitrary events A and B.
EXAMPLE. Consider the set Ω= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. For each subset A of Ω, deﬁne
P(A) = #A
6
,
where #A is the number of elements in A. Then the pair (Ω, P) is a probability space. One can
view this probability space as a model for the for the situation “throw of a dice”.
EXAMPLE. Now consider the set Ω= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} × {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. For each subset A of Ω,
deﬁne
P(A) = #A
36
.
Now the probability space (Ω, P) is a model for the situation “throw of two dice”. The subset
A = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)}
is the event “a pair”.
2.2
Conditional probability
For two events A and B the conditional probability of A given B is deﬁned as
P(A | B) := P(A ∩B)
P(B)

Basic concepts of probability theory
We have the following theorem called computation of probability by division into possible causes:
Suppose A1, . . . , An are pairwise disjoint events with A1 ∪· · · ∪An = Ω. For every event B it
then holds that
P(B) = P(A1) · P(B | A1) + · · · + P(An) · P(B | An) .
EXAMPLE. In the French Open ﬁnal, Nadal plays the winner of the semiﬁnal between Federer
and Davydenko. A bookmaker estimates that the probability of Federer winning the semiﬁnal is
75%. The probability that Nadal can beat Federer is estimated to be 51%, whereas the probability
that Nadal can beat Davydenko is estimated to be 80%. The bookmaker therefore computes the
probability that Nadal wins the French Open, using division into possible causes, as follows:
P(Nadal wins the ﬁnal)
=

Independent events
Two events A and B are called independent, if
P(A ∩B) = P(A) · P(B) .
Equivalent to this is the condition P(A | B) = P(A), i.e. that the probability of A is the same as
the conditional probability of A given B.
Remember: Two events are independent if the probability of one of them is not affected by
knowing whether the other has occurred or not.
EXAMPLE. A red and a black dice are thrown. Consider the events
A: red dice shows 6,
B: black dice show 6.
Since
P(A ∩B) = 1
36 = 1
6 · 1
6 = P(A) · P(B) ,
A and B are independent. The probability that the red dice shows 6 is not affected by knowing
anything about the black dice.
EXAMPLE. A red and a black dice are thrown. Consider the events
A: the red and the black dice show the same number,
B: the red and the black dice show a total of 10.
Since
P(A) = 1
6 , but P(A | B) = 1
3 ,
A and B are not independent. The probability of two of a kind increases if one knows that the sum
of the dice is 10.
2.4
The Inclusion-Exclusion Formula
Formula 8 on page 12 has the following generalization to three events A, B, C:
P(A∪B ∪C) = P(A)+P(B)+P(C)−P(A∩B)−P(A∩C)−P(B ∩C)+P(A∩B ∩C) .
This equality is called the Inclusion-Exclusion Formula for three events.
EXAMPLE. What is the probability of having at least one 6 in three throws with a dice? Let A1 be
the event that we get a 6 in the ﬁrst throw, and deﬁne A2 and A3 similarly. Then, our probability
can be computed by inclusion-exclusion:
P
=
P(A1 ∪A2 ∪A3)
=
P(A1) + P(A2) + P(A3) −P(A1 ∩A2) −P(A1 ∩A3) −P(A2 ∩A3)

The following generalization holds for n events A1, A2, . . . , An with union A = A1 ∪· · · ∪An:
P(A) =

i<j
P(Ai ∩Aj) +

i<j<k
P(Ai ∩Aj ∩Ak) −· · · ± P(A1 ∩· · · ∩An) .
This equality is called the Inclusion-Exclusion Formula for n events.
EXAMPLE. Pick ﬁve cards at random from an ordinary pack of cards. We wish to compute the
probability P(B) of the event B that all four suits appear among the 5 chosen cards.
For this purpose, let A1 be the event that none of the chosen cards are spades. Deﬁne A2, A3,
and A4 similarly for hearts, diamonds, and clubs, respectively. Then
∁B = A1 ∪A2 ∪A3 ∪A4 .
The Inclusion-Exclusion Formula now yields
P(∁B) =

i
P(Ai) −

i<j
P(Ai ∩Aj) +

We thus obtain the probability

EXAMPLE. A school class contains n children. The teacher asks all the children to stand up and
then sit down again on a random chair. Let us compute the probability P(B) of the event B that
each pupil ends up on a new chair.
We start by enumerating the pupils from 1 to n. For each i we deﬁne the event
Ai : pupil number i gets his or her old chair
Then
∁B = A1 ∪· · · ∪An .
Now P(∁B) can be computed by the Inclusion-Exclusion Formula for n events:
P(∁B) =

Rancom variables
Normally, one can forget about the probability space and simply think of the following rule of
thumb:
Remember: A random variable is a function taking different values with different probabilities.
The probability that the random variable X takes certain values is written in the following way:
P(X = x): the probability that X takes the value x ∈R,
P(X < x): the probability that X takes a value smaller than x,
P(X > x): the probability that X takes a value greater than x,
etc.
One has the following rules:
P(X ≤x)
=
P(X < x) + P(X = x)
P(X ≥x)
=
P(X > x) + P(X = x)
1
=
P(X < x) + P(X = x) + P(X > x)
3.2
The distribution function
The distribution function of a random variable X is the function F : R →R given by
F(x) = P(X ≤x) .
F(x) is an increasing function with values in the interval [0, 1] and moreover satisﬁes F(x) →1
for x →∞, and F(x) →0 for x →−∞.
By means of F(x), all probabilities of X can be computed:
P(X < x)
=
limε→0 F(x −ε)
P(X = x)
=
F(x) −limε→0 F(x −ε)
P(X ≥x)
=
1 −limε→0 F(x −ε)
P(X > x)
=

Discrete random variables, point probabilities
A random variable X is called discrete if it takes only ﬁnitely many or countably many values.
For all practical purposes, we may deﬁne a discrete random variable as a random variable taking
only values in the set {0, 1, 2, . . . }. The point probabilities
P(X = k)
determine the distribution of X. Indeed,
P(X ∈A) =

k∈A
P(X = k)
for any A ⊆{0, 1, 2, . . . }. In particular we have the rules
P(X ≤k)
=

P(X ≥k)
=

i=k P(X = i)
The point probabilities can be graphically illustrated by means of a pin diagram:

Continuous random variables, density function
A random variable X is called continuous if it has a density function f(x). The density function,
usually referred to simply as the density, satisﬁes
P(X ∈A) =

t∈A
f(t)dt
for all A ⊆R. If A is an interval [a, b] we thus have
P(a ≤X ≤b) =
 b
a
f(t)dt .
One should think of the density as the continuous analogue of the point probability function in the
discrete case.
3.5
Continuous random variables, distribution function
For a continuous random variable X with density f(x) the distribution function F(x) is given by
F(x) =
 x
−∞
f(t)dt .
The distribution function satisﬁes the following rules:
P(X ≤x)
=
F(x)
P(X ≥x)
=
1 −F(x)
P(|X| ≤x)
=
F(x) −F(−x)
P(|X| ≥x)
=
F(−x) + 1 −F(x)
3.6
Independent random variables
Two random variables X and Y are called independent if the events X ∈A and Y ∈B are in-
dependent for any subsets A, B ⊆R. Independence of three or more random variables is deﬁned
similarly.
Remember: X and Y are independent if nothing can be deduced about the value of Y from
knowing the value of X.

Expected value and variance
EXAMPLE. Throw a red dice and a black dice and consider the random variables
X: number of pips of red dice,
Y : number of pips of black dice,
Z: number of pips of red and black dice in total.
X and Y are independent since we can deduce nothing about X by knowing Y . In contrast, X
and Z are not independent since information about Z yields information about X (if, for example,
Z has the value 10, then X necessarily has one of the values 4, 5 and 6).
3.7
Random vector, simultaneous density, and distribution function
If X1, . . . , Xn are random variables deﬁned on the same probability space (Ω, P) we call X =
(X1, . . . , Xn) an (n-dimensional) random vector. It is a map
X : Ω→Rn .
The simultaneous (n-dimensional) distribution function is the function F : Rn →[0, 1] given by
F(x1, . . . , xn) = P(X1 ≤x1 ∧· · · ∧Xn ≤xn) .
Suppose now that the Xi are continuous. Then X has a simultaneous (n-dimensional) density
f : Rn →[0, ∞[ satisfying
P(X ∈A) =

x∈A
f(x) dx
for all A ⊆Rn. The individual densities fi of the Xi are called marginal densities, and we obtain
them from the simultaneous density by the formula
f1(x1) =

Rn−1 f(x1, . . . , xn) dx2 . . . dxn
stated here for the case f1(x1).
Remember: The marginal densities are obtained from the simultaneous density by “integrating
away the superﬂuous variables”.

Variance and standard deviation of random variables
The variance of a random variable X with expected value E(X) = µ is deﬁned as
var(X) = E((X −µ)2) .
If X is discrete, the variance can be computed thus:
var(X) =

P(X = k) · (k −µ)2 .
If X is continuous with density f(x), the variance can be computed thus:

Example (computation of expected value, variance, and standard deviation)
EXAMPLE 1. Deﬁne the discrete random variable X as the number of pips shown by a certain
dice. The point probabilities are P(X = k) = 1/6 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Therefore, the expected
value is
E(X) =

6 · (k −3.5)2 = (1 −3.5)2 + (2 −3.5)2 + · · · + (6 −3.5)2

= 2.917 .
The standard deviation thus becomes
σ(X) =
√
2.917 = 1.708 .
EXAMPLE 2. Deﬁne the continuous random variable X as a random real number in the interval
[0, 1]. X then has the density f(x) = 1 on [0, 1]. The expected value is
E(X) =

x dx = 0.5 .
The variance is
var(X) =

(x −0.5)2 dx = 0.083 .
The standard deviation is
σ =

0.083 = 0.289 .
4.4
Estimation of expected value µ and standard deviation σ by eye
If the density function (or a pin diagram showing the point probabilities) of a random variable is
given, one can estimate µ and σ by eye. The expected value µ is approximately the “centre of
mass” of the distribution, and the standard deviation σ has a size such that more or less two thirds
of the “probability mass” lie in the interval µ ± σ.

Addition and multiplication formulae for expected value and variance
Let X and Y be random variables. Then one has the formulae
E(X + Y )
=
E(X) + E(Y )
E(aX)
=
a · E(X)
var(X)
=
E(X2) −E(X)2
var(aX)
=
a2 · var(X)
var(X + a)
=
var(X)
for every a ∈R. If X and Y are independent, one has moreover
E(X · Y )
=
E(X) · E(Y )
var(X + Y )
=
var(X) + var(Y )
Remember: The expected value is additive. For independent random variables, the expected value
is multiplicative and the variance is additive.
4.6
Covariance and correlation coefﬁcient
The covariance of two random variables X and Y is the number
Cov(X, Y ) = E((X −EX)(Y −EY )) .
One has
Cov(X, X)
=
var(X)
Cov(X, Y )
=
E(X · Y ) −EX · EY
var(X + Y )
=
var(X) + var(Y ) + 2 · Cov(X, Y )
The correlation coefﬁcient ρ (“rho”) of X and Y is the number
ρ = Cov(X, Y )
σ(X) · σ(Y ) ,
where σ(X) =

var(X) and σ(Y ) =

var(Y ) are the standard deviations of X and Y . It is
here assumed that neither standard deviation is zero. The correlation coefﬁcient is a number in the
interval [−1, 1]. If X and Y are independent, both the covariance and ρ equal zero.
Remember: A positive correlation coefﬁcient implies that normally X is large when Y large, and
vice versa. A negative correlation coefﬁcient implies that normally X is small when Y is large,
and vice versa.
EXAMPLE. A red and a black dice are thrown. Consider the random variables
X: number of pips of red dice,
Y : number of pips of red and black dice in total.

Expected value and variance
If X is large, Y will normally be large too, and vice versa. We therefore expect a positive correla-

E(Y )
=

E(X · Y )
=
27.42
σ(X)
=

σ(Y )
=
2.42
The covariance thus becomes
Cov(X, Y ) = E(X · Y ) −E(X) · E(Y ) = 27.42 −3.5 · 7 = 2.92 .
As expected, the correlation coefﬁcient is a positive number:
ρ = Cov(X, Y )
σ(X) · σ(Y ) =
2.92
1.71 · 2.42 = 0.71 .

The Law of Large Numbers

The Law of Large Numbers
5.1
Chebyshev’s Inequality
For a random variable X with expected value µ and variance σ2, we have Chebyshev’s Inequal-
ity:
P(|X −µ| ≥a) ≤σ2
a2
for every a > 0.
5.2
The Law of Large Numbers
Consider a sequence X1, X2, X3, . . . of independent random variables with the same distribution
and let µ be the common expected value. Denote by Sn the sums
Sn = X1 + · · · + Xn .
The Law of Large Numbers then states that
P

Sn

 > ε

→0 for n →∞
for every ε > 0. Expressed in words:
The mean value of a sample from any given distribution converges to the expected value of that
distribution when the size n of the sample approaches ∞.
5.3
The Central Limit Theorem
Consider a sequence X1, X2, X3, . . . of independent random variables with the same distribution.
Let µ be the common expected value and σ2 the common variance. It is assumed that σ2 is positive.
Denote by S′
n the normed sums
S′
n = X1 + · · · + Xn −nµ
σ√n
.
By “normed” we understand that the S′
n have expected value 0 and variance 1. The Central Limit
Theorem now states that
P(S′
n ≤x) →Φ(x) for n →∞
for all x ∈R, where Φ is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution (see section
15.4):
Φ(x) =
 x
−∞
1
√
2π e−1
2 t2dt .
The distribution function of the normed sums S′
n thus converges to Φ when n converges to ∞.
This is a quite amazing result and the absolute climax of probability theory! The surprising
thing is that the limit distribution of the normed sums is independent of the distribution of the Xi.

Median and quartiles
Suppose we have n observations x1, . . . , xn. We then deﬁne the median x(0.5) of the observations
as the “middle observation”. More precisely,
x(0.5) =

x(n+1)/2
if n is odd
(xn/2 + xn/2+1)/2
if n is even
where the observations have been sorted according to size as
x1 ≤x2 ≤· · · ≤xn .
5.4
Example (distribution functions converge to Φ)
Consider a sequence of independent random variables X1, X2, . . . all having the same point prob-
abilities
P(Xi = 0) = P(Xi = 1) = 1
2.
The sums Sn = X1 + · · · + Xn are binomially distributed with expected value µ = n/2 and
variance σ2 = n/4. The normed sums thus become
S′
n = X1 + · · · + Xn −µ/2
√n/2
.
The distribution of the S′
n is given by the distribution function Fn. The Central Limit Theorem
states that Fn converges to Φ for n →∞. The ﬁgure below shows Fn together with Φ for n =
1, 2, 10, 100. It is a moment of extraordinary beauty when one watches the Fn slowly approaching
Φ:

Similarly, the lower quartile x(0.25) is deﬁned such that 25% of the observations lie below
x(0.25), and the upper quartile x(0.75) is deﬁned such that 75% of the observations lie below
x(0.75).
The interquartile range is the distance between x(0.25) and x(0.75), i.e. x(0.75) −x(0.25).

Statistical hypothesis testing
The empirical standard deviation is the square root of the empirical variance:
s =
n
i=1(xi −¯x)2
n −1
.
The greater the empirical standard deviation s is, the more “dispersed” the observations are around
the mean value ¯x.
6.4
Empirical covariance and empirical correlation coefﬁcient
Suppose we have n pairs of observations (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn). We deﬁne the empirical covari-
ance of these pairs as
Covemp =
n
i=1(xi −¯x)(yi −¯y)
n −1
.
Alternatively, Covemp can be computed as
Covemp =
n
i=1 xiyi −n¯x¯y
n −1
.
The empirical correlation coefﬁcient is
r =
empirical covariance
(empirical standard deviation of the x)(empirical standard deviation of the y) = Covemp
sxsy
.
The empirical correlation coefﬁcient r always lies in the interval [−1, 1].
Understanding of the empirical correlation coefﬁcient. If the x-observations are independent of
the y-observations, then r will be equal or close to 0. If the x-observations and the y-observations
are dependent in such a way that large x-values usually correspond to large y-values, and vice
versa, then r will be equal or close to 1. If the x-observations and the y-observations are dependent
in such a way that large x-values usually correspond to small y-values, and vice versa, then r will
be equal or close to –1.

Statistical hypothesis testing
7.1
Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
A statistical test is a procedure that leads to either acceptance or rejection of a null hypothesis
H0 given in advance. Sometimes H0 is tested against an explicit alternative hypothesis H1.
At the base of the test lie one or more observations. The null hypothesis (and the alternative
hypothesis, if any) concern the question which distribution these observations were taken from.
7.2
Signiﬁcance probability and signiﬁcance level
One computes the signiﬁcance probability P, that is the probability – if H0 is true – of obtaining
an observation which is as extreme, or more extreme, than the one given. The smaller P is, the
less plausible H0 is.

The binomial distribution Bin(n,p)
Often, one chooses a signiﬁcance level α in advance, typically α = 5%. One then rejects H0
if P is smaller than α (and one says, “H0 is rejected at signiﬁcance level α”). If P is greater than
α, then H0 is accepted (and one says, “H0 is accepted at signiﬁcance level α” or “H0 cannot be
rejected at signiﬁcance level α”).
7.3
Errors of type I and II
We speak about a type I error if we reject a true null hypothesis. If the signiﬁcance level is α,
then the risk of a type I error is at most α.
We speak about a type II error if we accept a false null hypothesis.
The strength of a test is the probability of rejecting a false H0. The greater the strength, the
smaller the risk of a type II error. Thus, the strength should be as great as possible.
7.4
Example
Suppose we wish to investigate whether a certain dice is fair. By “fair” we here only understand
that the probability p of a six is 1/6. We test the null hypothesis
H0 : p = 1
6 (the dice is fair)
against the alternative hypothesis
H1 : p > 1
6 (the dice is biased)
The observations on which the test is carried out are the following ten throws of the dice:
2, 6, 3, 6, 5, 2, 6, 6, 4, 6 .
Let us in advance agree upon a signiﬁcance level α = 5%. Now the signiﬁcance probability P
can be computed. By “extreme observations” is understood that there are many sixes. Thus, P is
the probability of having at least ﬁve sixes in 10 throws with a fair dice. We compute
P =

(1/6)k(5/6)10−k = 0.015
(see section 8 on the binomial distribution). Since P = 1.5% is smaller than α = 5%, we reject
H0. If the same test was performed with a fair dice, the probability of committing a type I error
would be 1.5%.

The binomial distribution Bin(n,p)
8.2
Description
We carry out n independent tries that each result in either success or failure. In each try the
probability of success is the same, p. Consequently, the total number of successes X is binomially
distributed, and we write X ∼Bin(n, p). X is a discrete random variable and takes values in the
set {0, 1, . . . , n}.

Signiﬁcance probabilities for tests in the binomial distribution

number k of successes. We wish to test the null hypothesis H0 : p = p0 against an alternative
hypothesis H1.

where in the last line we sum over all l for which P(X = l) ≤P(X = k).
EXAMPLE. A company buys a machine that produces microchips. The manufacturer of the ma-
chine claims that at most one sixth of the produced chips will be defective. The ﬁrst day the
machine produces 20 chips of which 6 are defective. Can the company reject the manufacturer’s
claim on this background?
SOLUTION. We test the null hypothesis H0 : p = 1/6 against the alternative hypothesis H1 :
p > 1/6. The signiﬁcance probability can be computed as P(X ≥6) = 10.2% (see e.g. the table
in section 8.3). We conclude that the company cannot reject the manufacturer’s claim at the 5%
level.
8.6
The normal approximation to the binomial distribution
If the parameter n (the number of tries) is large, a binomially distributed random variable X
will be approximately normally distributed with expected value µ = np and standard deviation
σ = √npq. Therefore, the point probabilities are approximately

EXAMPLE (continuation of the example in section 8.5). After 2 weeks the machine has produced
200 chips of which 46 are defective. Can the company now reject the manufacturer’s claim that
the probability of defects is at most one sixth?
SOLUTION. Again we test the null hypothesis H0 : p = 1/6 against the alternative hypothesis
H1 : p > 1/6. Since now np ≈33 and nq ≈167 are both greater than 5, we may use the normal
approximation in order to compute the signiﬁcance probability:

Estimators
Suppose k is an observation from a random variable X ∼Bin(n, p) with known n and unknown
p. The maximum likelihood estimate (ML estimate) of p is
ˆp = k
n .
This estimator is unbiased (i.e. the expected value of the estimator is p) and has variance
var(ˆp) = pq
n .
The expression for the variance is of no great practical value since it depends on the true (un-
known) probability parameter p. If, however, one plugs in the estimated value ˆp in place of p, one
gets the estimated variance
ˆp(1 −ˆp)
n
.
EXAMPLE. We consider again the example with the machine that has produced twenty microchips
of which the six are defective. What is the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability param-
eter? What is the estimated variance?
SOLUTION. The maximum likelihood estimate is
ˆp = 6
20 = 30%
and the variance of ˆp is estimated as
0.3 · (1 −0.3)
20
= 0.0105 .

The binomial distribution Bin(n,p)
The standard deviation is thus estimated to be
√
0.0105 ≈0.10. If we presume that ˆp lies within
two standard deviations from p, we may conclude that p is between 10% and 50%.
8.8
Conﬁdence intervals
Suppose k is an observation from a binomially distributed random variable X ∼Bin(n, p) with
known n and unknown p. The conﬁdence interval with conﬁdence level 1 −α around the point
estimate ˆp = k/n is

ˆp −u1−α/2

ˆp(1 −ˆp)
n
, ˆp + u1−α/2

ˆp(1 −ˆp)

.
Loosely speaking, the true value p lies in the conﬁdence interval with the probability 1 −α.
The number u1−α/2 is determined by Φ(u1−α/2) = 1 −α/2 where Φ is the distribution
function of the standard normal distribution. It appears e.g. from Table B.2 that with conﬁdence
level 95% one has
u1−α/2 = u0.975 = 1.96 .

level 95% around the true percentage of Green Party voters.
SOLUTION. The point estimate is ˆp = 62/100 = 0.62. A conﬁdence level of 95% yields α =
0.05. Looking up in the table (see above) gives u0.975 = 1.96. We get
1.96

0.62 · 0.38

= 0.10 .
The conﬁdence interval thus becomes
[0.52 , 0.72] .
So we can say with a certainty of 95% that between 52% and 72% of the electorate will vote for
the Green Party at the next election.

The Poisson distribution Pois(λ)
9.1
Parameters
λ: Intensity
9.2
Description
Certain events are said to occur spontaneously, i.e. they occur at random times, independently
of each other, but with a certain constant intensity λ. The intensity is the average number of
spontaneous events per time interval. The number of spontaneous events X in any given concrete
time interval is then Poisson distributed, and we write X ∼Pois(λ). X is a discrete random
variable and takes values in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }.
9.3
Point probabilities
For k ∈{0, 1, 2, 3 . . . } the point probabilities in a Pois(λ) distribution are
P(X = k) = λk
k! exp(−λ) .
Recall the convention 0! = 1.
EXAMPLE. In a certain shop an average of three customers per minute enter. The number of
customers X entering during any particular minute is then Poisson distributed with intensity λ =

Suppose that X1, . . . , Xn are independent Poisson distributed random variables. Let λi be the

X = X1 + · · · + Xn

λ = λ1 + · · · + λn ,
i.e. X ∼Pois(λ).
9.6
Signiﬁcance probabilities for tests in the Poisson distribution

to test the null hypothesis H0 : λ = λ0 against an alternative hypothesis H1.

where the summation in the last line is over all l for which P(X = l) ≤P(X = k).
If n independent observations k1, . . . , kn from a Pois(λ) distribution are given, we can treat
the sum k = k1 + · · · + kn as an observation from a Pois(n · λ) distribution.
9.7
Example (signiﬁcant increase in sale of Skodas)
EXERCISE. A Skoda car salesman sells on average 3.5 cars per month. The month after a radio
campaign for Skoda, seven cars are sold. Is this a signiﬁcant increase?
SOLUTION. The sale of cars in the given month may be assumed to be Poisson distributed with a
certain intensity λ. We test the null hypothesis
H0 : λ = 3.5
against the alternative hypothesis
H1 : λ > 3.5 .
The signiﬁcance probability, i.e. the probability of selling at least seven cars given that H0 is true,
is

exp(−3.5) = 0.039 + 0.017 + 0.007 + 0.002 + · · · = 0.065 .

The binomial approximation to the Poisson distribution
The Poisson distribution with intensity λ is the limit distribution of the binomial distribution with
parameters n and p = λ/n when n tends to ∞. In other words, the point probabilities satisfy
P(Xn = k) →P(X = k) for n →∞
for X ∼Pois(λ) and Xn ∼Bin(n, λ/n). In real life, however, one almost always prefers to use
the normal approximation instead (see the next section).

Example (signiﬁcant decrease in number of complaints)
EXERCISE. The ferry Deutschland between Rødby and Puttgarten receives an average of 180
complaints per week. In the week immediately after the ferry’s cafeteria was closed, only 112
complaints are received. Is this a signiﬁcant decrease?
SOLUTION. The number of complaints within the given week may be assumed to be Poisson
distributed with a certain intensity λ. We test the null hypothesis
H0 : λ = 180
against the alternative hypothesis
H1 : λ < 180 .
The signiﬁcance probability, i.e. the probability of having at most 112 complaints given H0, can
be approximated by the normal distribution:
P = Φ

Since P is very small, we can clearly reject H0. The number of complaints has signiﬁcantly

In an urn we have r red balls and s black balls, in total N = r + s balls. We now pick out
n balls from the urn, randomly and without returning the chosen balls to the urn. Necessarily
n ≤N. The number of red balls Y amongst the balls chosen is then hypergeometrically dis-

or not. We can thus approximate the hypergeometrical distribution by the binomial distribution:
P(Y = k) ≈P(X = k)
for Y ∼HG(n, r, N) and X ∼Bin(n, r/N). In practice, this approximation is of little value
since it is as difﬁcult to compute P(X = k) as P(Y = k).
11.6
The normal approximation to the hypergeometrical distribution
If n is small compared to both r and s, the hypergeometrical distribution can be approximated by
the normal distribution with the same expected value and variance.
The point probabilities thus become

The negative binomial distribution NB(n,p)
Si denote the total number of outcomes of type i. The random vector S = (S1, . . . , Sr) is then
multinomially distributed and we write S ∼Mult(n, p1, . . . , pr). S is discrete and takes values in
the set {(k1, . . . kr) ∈Zr | ki ≥0 , k1 + · · · + kr = n}.

The exponential distribution (λ)
13.2
Description
A series of independent experiments are carried out each of which results in either success or
failure. The probability of success p is the same in each experiment. The total number X of failures
before the n’th success is then negatively binomially distributed and we write X ∼NB(n, p). The
random variable X is discrete and takes values in the set {0, 1, 2, . . . }.
The geometrical distribution is the special case n = 1 of the negative binomial distribution.

Estimators
The negative binomial distribution is sometimes used as an alternative to the Poisson distribution
in situations where one wishes to describe a random variable taking values in the set {0, 1, 2, . . . }.
Suppose k1, . . . , km are independent observations from a NB(n, p) distribution with unknown
parameters n and p. We then have the following estimators:
ˆn =
¯k2
s2 −¯k

ˆp =

where ¯k and s2 are the mean value and empirical variance of the observations.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The normal distribution
15.2
Description
The normal distribution is a continuous distribution. If a random variable X is normally distribut-
ed, then X can take any values in R and we write X ∼N(µ, σ2).
The normal distribution is the most important distribution in all of statistics. Countless natu-
rally occurring phenomena can be described (or approximated) by means of a normal distribution.

The density of the normal distribution is the function

It is symmetric, i.e.

is difﬁcult to compute. Instead, one uses the formula

x −µ

where Φ is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution which can be looked up in
Table B.2. From the table the following fact appears:
Fact: In a normal distribution, about 68% of the probability mass lies within one standard devi-
ation from the expected value, and about 95% of the probability mass lies within two standard
deviations from the expected value.
15.4
The standard normal distribution
A normal distribution with expected value µ = 0 and variance σ2 = 1 is called a standard normal
distribution. The standard deviation in a standard normal distribution equals 1 (obviously). The
density ϕ(t) of a standard normal distribution is

Estimation of the expected value µ
Suppose x1, x2, . . . , xn are independent observations of a random variable X ∼N(µ, σ2). The
maximum likelihood estimate (ML estimate) of µ is
ˆµ = x1 + · · · + xn
n
.
This is simply the mean value and is written ¯x. The mean value is an unbiased estimator of µ (i.e.
the estimator’s expected value is µ). The variance of the mean value is
var2(¯x) = σ2
n .
More precisely, ¯x is itself normally distributed:
¯x ∼N(µ, σ2
n ) .
15.7
Estimation of the variance σ2
Suppose x1, . . . , xn are independent observations of a random variable X ∼N(µ, σ2). Normally,
the variance σ2 is estimated by the empirical variance
s2 =
(xi −¯x)2
n −1
.
The empirical variance s2 is an unbiased estimator of the true variance σ2.
Warning: The empirical variance is not the maximum likelihood estimate of σ2. The maximum
likelihood estimate of σ2 is
(xi −¯x)2
n
but this is seldom used since it is biased and usually gives estimates which are too small.

Conﬁdence intervals for the expected value µ
Suppose x1, . . . , xn are independent observations of a normally distributed random variable X ∼

for conﬁdence level 95%.

Conﬁdence intervals for the variance σ2 and the standard deviation σ

A linear function of a normally distributed random variable is itself normally distributed. If, in
other words, X ∼N(µ, σ2) and a, b ∈R (a ̸= 0), then
aX + b ∼N(aµ + b, a2σ2) .
The sum of independent normally distributed random variables is itself normally distributed.
If, in other words, X1, . . . , Xn are independent with Xi ∼N(µi, σ2

EXAMPLE. The headmaster of a school wishes to conﬁrm statistically that his students have per-

The national average for 2008 is 8.27. It is reasonable to assume that the ﬁnal scores are normally
distributed. However, the variance is unknown. Therefore, we apply Student’s t test to test the null
hypothesis
H0 : µ = 8.27
against the alternative hypothesis
H1 : µ < 8.27 .
We compute the mean value of the observations as ¯x = 7.17 and the empirical standard deviation
as s = 1.26. We obtain the statistic
t =
√
10(7.17 −8.27)
1.26
= −2.76 .
Looking up in Table B.4 under df = n−1 = 9 degrees of freedom gives a signiﬁcance probability
1 −FStudent(−t) = 1 −FStudent(2.76)
between 1% and 2.5%. We may therefore reject H0 and conﬁrm the headmaster’s assumption that
his students have performed signiﬁcantly poorer than the rest of the country.

We wish to test the null hypothesis
H0: the standard deviation is at most 5 (i.e. the variance is at most 25)
against the alternative hypothesis
H1: the standard deviation is greater than 5 (i.e. the variance is greater than 25).
The empirical variance is found to be s2 = 45.47 and we thus ﬁnd the statistic
q = (20 −1) · 45.47
52
= 34.56 .
By looking up in Table B.3 under df = 19 degrees of freedom, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcance probability
around 2%. We can thus reject H0.
(Actually, the observations came from a normal distribution with expected value µ = 100 and
standard deviation σ = 6. The test is thus remarkably sensitive.)

samples are independent of each other.

Two samples, unknown variances, H0 : µ1 = µ2 (Fisher-Behrens)
Let the situation be as in section 17.5, but suppose that the variances σ2
1 and σ2
2 are unknown. The
problem of ﬁnding a suitable statistic to test the null hypothesis
H0 : µ1 = µ2
is called the Fisher-Behrens problem and has no satisfactory solution.

Example (comparison of two expected values)
Suppose we are given seven independent observations from a normally distributed random vari-
able X:
x1 = 26 , x2 = 21 , x3 = 15 , x4 = 7 , x5 = 15 , x6 = 28 , x7 = 21
and also four independent observations from a normally distributed random variable Y :
y1 = 29 , y2 = 31 , y3 = 17 , y4 = 22 .
We wish to test the hypothesis
H0 : E(X) = E(Y ) .
In order to be able to test this, we need to test ﬁrst whether X and Y have the same variance.
We therefore test the auxiliary hypothesis
H∗
0 : var(X) = var(Y )
against the alternative
H∗
1 : var(X) ̸= var(Y ) .
For this purpose, we compute the statistic
v = s2

as in section 17.7, as well as

Looking up in Table B.5 with 7 −1 = 6 degrees of freedom in the numerator and 4 −1 = 3
degrees of freedom in the denominator shows that the signiﬁcance probability is clearly greater
than 20%, and we may therefore accept the auxiliary hypothesis H∗
0.
Now we return to the test of H0 against the alternative hypothesis
H1 : E(X) ̸= E(Y ) .
The “pooled” variance is found to be

Therefore, the signiﬁcance probability is found to be

by looking up Student’s t distribution with 7 + 4 −2 = 9 degrees of freedom in Table B.4.
Consequently, we cannot reject H0.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
18.1
Aim and motivation
Analysis of variance, also known as ANOVA, is a clever method of comparing the mean values
from more than two samples. Analysis of variance is a natural extension of the tests in the previous
chapter.
18.2
k samples, unknown common variance, H0 : µ1 = · · · = µk
Let X1, . . . , Xk be k independent, normally distributed random variables, with expected values
µ1, . . . , µk and common variance σ2. From each Xi, let there be given a sample consisting of ni
observations. Let ¯xj and s2
j be mean value and empirical variance of the sample from Xj.
We wish to test the null hypothesis
H0 : µ1 = · · · = µk
against all alternatives. For this purpose, we estimate the common variance σ2 in two different
ways.
The variance estimate within the samples is
s2
I =

The variance estimate between the samples is

s2
I estimates σ2 regardless of whether H0 is true or not. s2

M estimates too high.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
The signiﬁcance probability is
1 −FFisher(v)
where FFisher is the distribution function of Fisher’s F distribution with k −1 degrees of freedom
in the numerator and n −k degrees of freedom in the denominator (Table B.5).
18.3
Two examples (comparison of mean values from three samples)
Let three samples be given:
sample 1: 29, 28, 29, 21, 28, 22, 22, 29, 26, 26
sample 2: 22, 21, 18, 28, 23, 25, 25, 28, 23, 26
sample 3: 24, 23, 26, 20, 33, 23, 26, 24, 27, 22
It is assumed that the samples originate from independent normal distributions with common
variance. Let µi be the expected value of the i’th normal distribution. We wish to test the null
hypothesis
H0 : µ1 = µ2 = µ3 .
(As a matter of fact, all the observations originate from a normal distribution with expected value
25 and variance 10, so the test shouldn’t lead to a rejection of H0.) We thus have k = 3 samples
each consisting of ni = 10 observations, a total of n = 30 observations. A computation gives the
following variance estimate within the samples:
s2
I = 10.91
and the following variance estimate between the samples:
s2
M = 11.10
(Since we know that H0 is true, both s2
I and s2
M should estimate σ2 = 10 well, which they also
indeed do.) Now we compute the statistic:
v = s2
M
s2
I
= 11.10
10.91 = 1.02 .
Looking up in Table B.5 under k −1 = 2 degrees of freedom in the numerator and n −k = 27
degrees of freedom in the denominator shows that the signiﬁcance probability is more than 10%.
The null hypothesis H0 cannot be rejected.
Somewhat more carefully, the computations can be summed up in a table as follows:

Note how the variance within the samples doesn’t change, whereas the variance between the
samples is now far too large. Thus, the statistic v = 8.20 also becomes large and the signiﬁcance
probability is seen in Table B.5 to be less than 1%. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis H0 of
equal expected values (which was also to be expected, since H0 is now manifestly false).
19
The chi-squared test (or χ2 test)
19.1
χ2 test for equality of distribution
The reason why the χ2 distribution is so important is that it can be used to test whether a given
set of observations comes from a certain distribution. In the following sections, we shall see many
examples of this. The test, which is also called Pearson’s χ2 test or χ2 test for goodness of ﬁt, is
carried out as follows:
1. First, divide the observations into categories. Let us denote the number of categories by k and
the number of observations in the i’th category by Oi. The total number of observations is thus
n = O1 + · · · + Ok.
2. Formulate a null hypothesis H0. This null hypothesis must imply what the probability pi is that
an observation belongs to the i’th category.

3. Compute the statistic

.
As mentioned, Oi is the observed number in the i’th category. Further, Ei is the expected number
in the i’th category (expected according to the null hypothesis, that is): Ei = npi. Incidentally,
the statistic χ =

χ2 is sometimes called the discrepancy.
4. Find the signiﬁcance probability
P = 1 −F(χ2)
where F = Fχ2 is the distribution function of the χ2 distribution with df degrees of freedom
(look up in Table B.3). H0 is rejected if P is smaller than 5% (or whatever signiﬁcance level one
chooses). The number of degrees of freedom is normally df = k −1, i.e. one less than the number
of categories. If, however, one uses the observations to estimate the probability parameters pi of
the null hypothesis, df becomes smaller.
Remember: Each estimated parameter costs one degree of freedom.
Note: It is logical to reject H0 if χ2 is large, because this implies that the difference between the

observed and the expected numbers is large.
19.2
The assumption of normal distribution
Since the χ2 test rests upon a normal approximation, it only applies provided there are not too few
observations.
Remember: The χ2 test applies if the expected number Ei is at least ﬁve in each category. If,
however, there are more than ﬁve categories, an expected number of at least three in each category
sufﬁces.
19.3
Standardized residuals
If the null hypothesis regarding equality of distribution is rejected by a χ2 test, this was because
some of the observed numbers deviated widely from the expected numbers. It is then interesting
to investigate exactly which observed numbers are extreme. For this purpose, we compute the
standardized residuals
ri =
Oi −npi

npi(1 −pi)
=
Oi −Ei

Ei(1 −pi)
for each category. If the null hypothesis were true, each ri would be normally distributed with
expected value µ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1. Therefore:
Remember: Standardized residuals numerically greater than 2 are signs of an extreme observed
number.
It can very well happen that standardized residuals numerically greater than 2 occur even though
the χ2 test does not lead to rejection of the null hypothesis. This does not mean that the null hy-
pothesis should be rejected after all. In particular when one has a large number of categories, it
will not be unusual to ﬁnd some large residuals.
Warning: Only compute the standardized residuals if the null hypothesis has been rejected by a
χ2 test.

326.6
+ (162 −163.3)2
163.3
+ (45 −32.7)2
32.7
= 28.6 .
Since the observations are divided into six categories, we compare the statistic with the χ2 distri-
bution with df = 6 −1 = 5 degrees of freedom. Table B.3 shows that the signiﬁcance probability
is well below 0.5%. We can therefore with great conﬁdence reject the hypothesis that the boy-girl
ratio is Bin(5, 1/2) distributed.

By looking up in Table B.3 under the χ2 distribution with df = 8 −1 = 7 degrees of freedom, it
is only seen that the signiﬁcance probability is below 50%. Thus, we have no statistical evidence
to conclude that the popularity of the parties has changed.
Let us ignore the warning in section 19.3 and compute the standardized residuals. For category
A, for example, we ﬁnd
r =

Example (deaths in the Prussian cavalry)
In the period 1875–1894 the number of deaths caused by horse kicks was registered in 10 of the
regiments of the Prussian cavalry. Of the total of 200 “regiment-years”, there were 109 years with
no deaths, 65 years with one death, 22 years with two deaths, three years with three deaths, and
one year with four deaths. We wish to investigate whether these numbers come from a Poisson
distribution Pois(λ).
In order to get expected numbers greater than ﬁve (or at least to come close to that), we group
the years with three and four deaths into a single category and thus obtain the following observed
numbers Oi of years with i deaths:

The intensity λ is estimated as ˆλ = 122/200 = 0.61, since there were a total of 122 deaths during

The reader should let himself be impressed by the striking correspondence between expected and
observed numbers. It is evidently superﬂuous to carry the analysis any further, but let us compute
the statistic anyway:
χ2 = (109 −108.7)2
108.7
+ (65 −66.3)2
66.3
+ (22 −20.2)2
20.2
+ (4 −4.8)2
4.8
= 0.3 .
Since there are four categories and we have estimated one parameter using the data, the statistic
should be compared with the χ2 distribution with df = 4 −1 −1 = 2 degrees of freedom. As
expected, Table B.3 shows a signiﬁcance probability well above 50%.
Incidentally, the example comes from Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz’s 1898 book Das Gesetz der
kleinen Zahlen.

Contingency tables
20.1
Deﬁnition, method
Suppose that a number of observations are given and that the observations are divided into cate-
gories according to two different criteria. The number of observations in each category can then
be displayed in a contingency table. The purpose of the test presented here is to test whether there
is independence between the two criteria used to categorize the observations.
METHOD. Let there be given an r × s table, i.e. a table with r rows and s columns:
a11
a12
. . .
. . .
a1s
a21

ars
It has row sums Ri = s
j=1 aij, column sums Sj = r
i=1 aij, and total sum
N =

i,j
aij .
These are the observed numbers O. The row probabilities are estimated as
ˆpi· = Ri
N ,
and the column probabilities as
ˆp·j = Sj
N .
If there is independence between rows and columns, the cell probabilities can be estimated as
ˆpij = ˆpi·ˆp·j = RiSj
N2 .
We can thus compute the expected numbers E:

since the expected number in the (i, j)’th cell is
E = N ˆpij = RiSj/N .
Now we compute the statistic
χ2 =
 (O −E)2
E
=
 (aij −RiSj/N)2
RiSj/N
where the summation is carried out over each cell of the table. If the independence hypothesis
holds true and the expected number is at least 5 in each cell, then the statistic is χ2 distributed
with
df = (r −1)(s −1)
degrees of freedom.
Important! If the data are given as percentages, they must be expressed as absolute numbers
before insertion into the contingency table.
20.2
Standardized residuals
If the independence hypothesis is rejected by a χ2 test, one might, as in section 19.3, be interest-
ed in determining which cells contain observed numbers deviating extremely from the expected
numbers. The standardized residuals are computed as
rij =
Oij −RiSj/n

RiSj/n

1 −Ri/n

1 −Sj/n
 .
If the independence hypothesis were true, each rij would be normally distributed with expected
value µ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1. Standardized residuals numerically greater than 2 are
therefore signs of an extreme observed number.

χ2 test for 2 × 2 tables
A contingency table with two rows and two columns is called a 2×2 table. Let us write the
observed numbers as follows:
a

The statistic thus becomes

ij’th cell. The statistic χ2 is to be compared with the χ2 distribution with df = (2−1)(2−1) = 1
degree of freedom.
If we wish to perform a one-sided test of the independence hypothesis, the statistic

is used instead. Under the independence hypothesis, u will be standard normally distributed.
20.5
Fisher’s exact test for 2 × 2 tables
Given a 2 × 2 table, nothing stands in the way of using the χ2 test, but there is a better test in this
situation called Fisher’s exact test. Fisher’s exact test does not use any normal approximation,
and may therefore still be applied when the number of expected observations in one or more of
the cells is smaller than ﬁve.
METHOD. Let there be given a 2×2 table:
a
b
c
d
with row sums R1 = a+b and R2 = c+d and column sums S1 = a+c and S2 = b+d and total
sum N = R1 + R2 = S1 + S2 = a + b + c + d. We test the independence hypothesis H0 against

Distribution-free costs
the alternative hypothesis H1 that the “diagonal probabilities” p11 and p22 are greater than what
they would have been had there been independence. (This situation can always be arranged by
switching the rows if necessary.) The conditional probability of obtaining exactly the 2×2 table
above, given that the row sums are R1 and R2, and that the column sums are S1 and S2, is
Pconditional = R1! R2! S1! S2!
N! a! b! c! d!
.
The signiﬁcance probability in Fisher’s exact test is the sum of Pconditional taken on all 2×2 tables
with the same row and column sums as in the given table, and which are at least as extreme as the
given table:
PFisher =
min{b,c}

i=0
R1! R2! S1! S2!
N! (a + i)! (b −i)! (c −i)! (d + i)! .
The independence hypothesis H0 is rejected if PFisher is smaller than 5% (or whatever signiﬁ-
cance level one has chosen).
ADDENDUM: If a two-sided test is performed, i.e. if one does not test against any speciﬁc alter-
native hypothesis, the signiﬁcance probability becomes 2 · PFisher. It is then necessary that the
2×2 table is written in such a way that the observed numbers in the diagonal are greater than the
expected numbers (this can always be obtained by switching the rows if necessary).
20.6
Example (Fisher’s exact test)
In a medical experiment concerning alternative treatments, ten patients are randomly divided into
two groups with ﬁve patients in each. The patients in the ﬁrst group receive acupuncture, while
the patients in the other group receive no treatment. It is then seen which patients are ﬁt or ill at
the end of the experiment. The result can be presented in a 2 × 2 table:
ﬁt
ill
acupuncture
4
1
no treatment
2
3
The signiﬁcance probability in Fisher’s exact test is computed as
PFisher =
1

i=0
5! 5! 6! 4!
10! (4 + i)! (1 −i)! (2 −i)! (3 + i)! = 26% .
With such a large signiﬁcance probability, there is no evidence that acupuncture had any effect.
21
Distribution-free tests
In all tests considered so far, we have known something about the distribution from which the
given samples originated. We knew, for example, that the distribution was a normal distribution
even though we didn’t know the expected value or the standard deviation.
Sometimes, though, one knows nothing at all about the underlying distribution. It then be-
comes necessary to use a distribution-free test (also known as a non-parametric test). The two
examples considered in this chapter are due to Frank Wilcoxon (1892–1965).

Wilcoxon’s test for one set of observations
Let there be given n independent observations d1, . . . , dn from an unknown distribution. We test
the null hypothesis
H0: The unknown distribution is symmetric around 0.
Each observation di is given a rank which is one of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n. The observation
with the smallest numerical value is assigned rank 1, the observation with the second smallest
numerical value is assigned rank 2, etc. Now deﬁne the statistics
t+ = (ranks corresponding to positive di),
t−= (ranks corresponding to negative di).
(One can check at this point whether t+ + t−= n(n + 1)/2; if not, one has added the numbers
incorrectly.) If H0 holds true, then t+ and t−should be more or less equal. When to reject H0
depends on which alternative hypothesis is tested against.
If we test H0 against the alternative hypothesis
H1: The unknown distribution primarily gives positive observations,
then H0 is rejected if t−is extremely small. Choose a signiﬁcance level α and consult Table B.8

under n and α. If t−is smaller than or equal to the table value, H0 is rejected. If t−is greater than
the table value, H0 is accepted.
If we test H0 against the alternative hypothesis
H1: The unknown distribution primarily gives negative observations,
then H0 is rejected if t+ is extremely small. Choose a signiﬁcance level α and consult Table B.8
under n and α. If t+ is smaller than or equal to the table value, H0 is rejected. If t+ is greater than
the table value, H0 is accepted.
If we don’t test H0 against any particular alternative hypothesis, the null hypothesis is rejected
if the minimum t := min{t+, t−} is extremely small. Choose a signiﬁcance level α and consult
Table B.8 under n and α/2 (if, for example, we choose the signiﬁcance level α = 5%, then we
look up in the table under n and 0.025). If t is smaller than or equal to the table value, we reject
H0. If t is greater than the table value, we accept H0.
The above test applies in particular when two sets of observations x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn
are given and di is the difference between the “before values” xi and the “after values” yi, i.e.
di = xi −yi. If there are only random, unsystematic differences between the before and after
values, it follows that the di’s are distributed symmetrically around 0.
21.2
Example
An experiment involving ten patients is carried out to determine whether physical exercise lowers
blood pressure. At the beginning of the experiment, the patients’ blood pressures are measured.
These observations are denoted x1, . . . , x10. After a month of exercise, the blood pressures are
measured again. These observations are denoted y1, . . . , y10. We now test the null hypothesis
H0: Physical exercise has no inﬂuence on blood pressure. The ten differences di = xi −yi are
therefore distributed symmetrically around 0,
against the alternative hypothesis
H1: Physical exercise causes the blood pressure to decrease. The ten differences di are therefore
primarily positive.

We shall reject H0 if t−= 9 is extremely small. Table B.8 with signiﬁcance level α = 5% shows
that “extremely small” means ≦10. Conclusion: The test shows that the null hypothesis H0 must
be rejected against the alternative hypothesis H1 at signiﬁcance level 5%.
21.3
The normal approximation to Wilcoxon’s test for one set of observations
Table B.8 includes values up to n = 50. If the number of observations is greater, a normal dis-
tribution approximation can be applied. Indeed, if the null hypothesis is true, the statistic t+ is
approximately normally distributed with expected value
µ = n(n + 1)
4
and standard deviation
σ =

n(n + 1)(2n + 1)
24
.
The signiﬁcance probability is therefore found by comparison of the statistic
z = t+ −µ
σ
with Table B.2 of the standard normal distribution.
EXAMPLE. Let us use the normal approximation to ﬁnd the signiﬁcance probability in the previous
example (even though n here is smaller than 50 and the approximation therefore is not highly
precise). We get µ = 27.5 and σ = 9.81. The statistic therefore becomes z = 1.89, which gives
a signiﬁcance probability of 2.9%. The conclusion is thus the same, namely that H0 is rejected at
signiﬁcance level 5%.
21.4
Wilcoxon’s test for two sets of observations
Suppose we have two sets x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , ym of independent observations. We test the
null hypothesis
H0: The observations come from the same distribution.
Each of the n + m observations is assigned a rank which is one of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n + m.
The observation with the smallest numerical value is assigned rank 1, the observation with the
second smallest numerical value is assigned rank 2, etc. Deﬁne the statistic
tx = (ranks of the xi’s).
Whether H0 is rejected or not depends on which alternative hypothesis we test against.
If we test H0 against the alternative hypothesis
H1: The xi’s are primarily smaller than the yi’s,
then H0 is rejected if tx is extremely small. Look up in Table B.9 under n and m. If tx is smaller
than or equal to the table value, then H0 is rejected at signiﬁcance level α = 5%. If tx is greater

Distribution-free costs
than the table value, then H0 is accepted at signiﬁcance level α = 5%.
If we test H0 against the alternative hypothesis
H1: The xi’s are primarily greater than the yi’s,
then one has to switch the roles of xi’s and yi’s and continue as described above.
If we don’t test H0 against any particular alternative hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is reject-
ed if the minimum
t := min{tx, n(n + m + 1) −tx}
is extremely small. Look up in Table B.9 under n and m. If t is smaller than or equal to the table
value, then H0 is rejected at signiﬁcance level α = 10%. If t is greater than the table value, then
H0 is accepted at signiﬁcance level 10%.
21.5
The normal approximation to Wilcoxon’s test for two sets of observations
Table B.9 applies for moderate values of n and m. If the number of observations is greater, one
can use a normal distribution approximation. Indeed, if the null hypothesis holds true, the statistic

22.1
The model
Suppose we have a sample consisting of n pairs of observations
(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) .
We propose the model that each yi is an observation from a random variable
Yi = β0 + β1xi + Ei
where the Ei’s are independent normally distributed random variables with expected value 0 and
common variance σ2. Thus we can express each yi as
yi = β0 + β1xi + ei
where ei is an observation from Ei. We call yi the response variable, xi the declaring variable
and ei the remainder term.
22.2
Estimation of the parameters β0 and β1
Let ¯x be the mean value of the xi’s and ¯y the mean value of the yi’s. Deﬁne the sum of products
of errors as
SPExy =
n

i=1
(xi −¯x)(yi −¯y)
and the sum of squares of errors as
SSEx =

22.3
The distribution of the estimators
If the model’s assumptions are met, the estimator ˆβ0 is normally distributed with expected value
β0 (the estimator thus is unbiased) and variance σ2(1/n + ¯x2/SSEx). In other words, it holds
that
ˆβ0 ∼N

β0, σ2

.
Moreover, the estimator ˆβ1 is normally distributed with expected value β1 (this estimator is there-
fore unbiased too) and variance σ2/SSEx. In other words, it holds that

.
22.4
Predicted values ˆyi and residuals ˆei
From the estimates ˆβ0 and ˆβ1, the predicted value of yi can be computed for each i as
ˆyi = ˆβ0 + ˆβ1xi .
The i’th residual ˆei is the difference between the actual value yi and the predicted value ˆyi:
ˆei = yi −ˆyi .
The residual ˆei is an estimate of the remainder term ei.
22.5
Estimation of the variance σ2
We introduce the sum of squares of residuals as
SSR =
n

i=1

i .
The variance σ2 of the remainder terms is now estimated as
s2 = SSR
n −2 .
This estimator is unbiased (but different from the maximum likelihood estimator).
22.6
Conﬁdence intervals for the parameters β0 and β1
After estimating the parameters β0 and β1, we can compute the conﬁdence intervals with conﬁ-
dence level 1 −α around the estimates ˆβ0 and ˆβ1. These are

The determination coefﬁcient R2
In order to investigate how well the model with the estimated parameters describes the actual
observations, we compute the determination coefﬁcient
R2 = SSEy −SSR

.
R2 lies in the interval [0, 1] and measures the part of the variation of the yi’s which the model
describes as a linear function of the xi’s.
Remember: The greater the determination coefﬁcient R2 is, the better the model describes the
observations.

Predictions and prediction intervals

y0 = β0 + β1x0
is then estimated, or predicted, as

Linear regression
The conﬁdence interval, or prediction interval, with conﬁdence level 1 −α around the estimate
ˆy0 is
ˆy0 ± t1−α/2s

1 + 1
n + (x0 −¯x)2
SSEx
.
The number t1−α/2 is determined by F(u1−α/2) = 1 −α/2, where F is the distribution function
of Student’s t distribution with n −2 degrees of freedom (see also section 15.8).

We use a linear regression model
yi = β0 + β1xi + ei
where the remainder terms ei are independent normally distributed with expected value 0 and the
same (unknown) variance σ2.
1) Estimate the parameters β0 and β1.
2) Determine the conﬁdence interval with conﬁdence level 95% for β1.
3) Can the hypothesis H0 : β1 = −0.006 be accepted?
4) To how large degree can the difference of temperature be explained as a linear function of the
altitude?
SOLUTION. First we perform the relevant computations:
Sx = 10
i=1 xi = 27500
Sy = 10
i=1 yi = 21
¯x = Sx/10 = 2750
¯y = Sy/10 = 2.1
SSx = 10
i=1 x2
i = 96250000
SSy = 10
i=1 y2
i = 859
SSEx = SSx −S2
x/10 = 20625000
SSEy = SSy −S2
y/10 = 814.9
SPxy = 10
i=1 xiyi = −68500
SPExy = SPxy −SxSy/10 = −126250
ˆβ1 = SPExy/SSEx = −0.0061
ˆβ0 = ¯y −ˆβ1¯x = 18.9
SSR = SSEy −SPE2
xy/SSEx = 42.1
s2 = SSR/8 = 5.26
R2 = 1 −SSR/SSEy = 0.948
1) It appears directly from the computations that the estimates of β0 and β1 are
ˆβ0 = 18.9 ,
ˆβ1 = −0.0061 .

Linear regression
2) Table B.4, under df = 10 −1 = 9 degrees of freedom, shows that t0.975 = 2.26 (see also
section 15.8). The conﬁdence interval around ˆβ1 thus becomes

−0.0061 −2.26
√
5.26
√
20625000 , −0.0061 + 2.26
√
5.26
√
20625000

= [−0.0072 , −0.0050] .
3) The hypothesis H0 : β1 = −0.006 is accepted, since this value lies within the conﬁdence
interval.
4) The part of the temperature difference describable as a linear function of the altitude is nothing
other than the determination coefﬁcient
R2 = 94.8% .
The fact that R2 is large (close to 100%) shows that the actual temperatures are quite close to those
predicted. This also appears from the ﬁgure below, which shows that the actual temperatures are
very close to the regression line:
