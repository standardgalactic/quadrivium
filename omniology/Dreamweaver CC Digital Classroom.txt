Hosting your websites
While you can work on everything in this book using only your computer, you will 
eventually want to create websites that you share with the world. To do this, you will 
need to put your website on a computer connected to the Internet that is always accessible. 
This is known as a web server. If you don’t want to get involved in hosting a website, 
you can pay a company to provide space on their web servers for you. Subscribers to 
Adobe’s Creative Cloud service can publish and host their sites using Adobe Business
Catalyst and Adobe Dreamweaver. Another good place to look for a hosting provider 
is here: http://www.microsoft.com/web/hosting/home/. If you want to set up your own
/
computer for hosting a web server and you are using any Windows computer, you can
turn it into a web server at no cost by using the Web Platform Installer available at: 
http://www.microsoft.com/web. If you are a Mac OS user, you can get Mac OS X server from 
Apple to use a Mac OS computer as a web server.

If you want to get started and create a page, jump ahead to “Tag structure and attributes” later 
on in this lesson. Otherwise, the next few pages provide you with an overview of key capabilities 
and features of Dreamweaver CC.
See Lesson 1 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the supplied DVD.
What is Dreamweaver?
Dreamweaver is an excellent web design and development tool for new and experienced 
users alike. Over the years it has become the preferred website creation and management 
program, providing a creative environment for both designers and developers. Whether 
you design websites, develop mobile phone content, or script complex server-side
applications, Dreamweaver has something to off er.
Design and layout tools
Dreamweaver’s many icon-driven menus and detailed panels make it easy to insert and 
format text, images, and media (such as HTML5 video fi les and Flash movies). This 
means that you can create attractive and functional web pages without knowing a single 
line of code—Dreamweaver takes care of building the code behind-the-scenes for you. 
Dreamweaver does not create graphics from scratch; instead, it is integrated with Adobe 
Photoshop CC so you can import and adjust graphics from within the application.
The Insert panel features objects in several 
categories that let you easily add images, 
web forms, and media to your page.

What is Dreamweaver?
Site management and File Transfer Protocol
Dreamweaver has everything you need for complete site management, including built-
in File Transfer Protocol (FTP) capabilities between a server and your local machine; 
reusable objects (such as page templates and library items); and site optimization tools (such
as link checkers and site reports) so you can ensure that your site functions properly and 
looks good. If you’re designing your pages with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), then the 
W3C Validation, and the Browser Compatibility Check features will help you locate and
troubleshoot any potential display issues that might occur across diff erent web browsers.
Coding environment and text editor
Dreamweaver lets you work in a code-only view of your document that acts as a powerful 
text editor. Features such as color-coding, indentation, and visual aids make Dreamweaver 
an excellent text editing or coding environment for web designers of any level.
Code view is a full-featured text editor that color-codes, tags, and scripts for editing that’s easier to decipher.
For more experienced developers, Dreamweaver supports popular coding and scripting 
languages, such as JavaScript, in addition to server-side languages like PHP. Specialized insert
menus and code panels help you build pages and applications in the language of your choice.
Scripting languages, such as those used to build interactive web pages or e-commerce sites, fall 
into two categories: client-side and server-side. Client-side languages (such as JavaScript) run in
your browser, while server-side languages (such as PHP) require that special software be installed 
on the server in order to run.

Mobile design and development features
The tools in Dreamweaver have evolved as the Web has evolved. The most recent versions 
of the application have numerous features designed to help make your website look
good and function well in the rapidly growing arena of mobile phones and devices. The 
Fluid Grid Layout and Window Size viewports allow you to design your pages using a
responsive grid with multiple screen sizes for smartphones and tablets.
Additionally, there is support for creating Media Queries, which are a CSS3 feature aimed 
at creating unique page layouts for diff erent-sized screens. For more advanced users there
is support for jQuery Mobile, which creates unique user interfaces for touchscreen devices.
There is also support for creating native applications for iOS and Android operating 
systems with PhoneGap integration.
Multiple Window Size viewports allow you to view your pages in common screen sizes for 
mobile and other devices.

Dreamweaver’s workspace features
Who uses Dreamweaver?
Dreamweaver’s popularity is a result of its fl exibility. Its ability to build a site from
conception to launch—and provide continued maintenance afterward—makes it a preferred
tool among industry professionals, businesses, and educational institutions while remaining 
easy and accessible enough for novice designers to get up-and-running quickly. It’s not 
unusual to see Dreamweaver utilized for personal projects or by small businesses and media 
professionals, such as photographers and painters, to maintain a web presence.
Dreamweaver’s workspace features
This book is dedicated to exploring, learning, and putting to use all that Dreamweaver has 
to off er. This section looks at some of the application’s key features.
Four diff erent points of view: When you work with a document, Dreamweaver lets 
you see your work in one of four views: Code, Split, Design, or Live view. Dreamweaver’s 
default Design view lets you add elements to your page in a visual fashion, either by
dragging objects onto the page selecting them from the Insert panel, or by directly adding 
text, image or multimedia content. More experienced web designers and coders can use
the Code view to edit a document’s HTML code and scripts directly, enhanced with easy-
to-read color-coding and visual aids.
For those who like something in between, the Split view provides a split-pane Design and 
Code view all at once. You can easily change views at any time with a single click in the
Document toolbar. The Live view allows you to view your page as it would appear in a native 
web browser, eliminating the need to leave the program in order to preview your designs.
The Split view lets you edit your page visually while also seeing the code being created behind the scenes.

Built-in FTP: You can easily upload and download fi les to and from your web server 
using the Files panel’s drag-and-drop interface. You can also use the Get/Put button at 
any time to post pages you’re currently working on. In either case, there’s no need for 
separate software. Dreamweaver also provides Check In/Check Out functionality and 
synchronization features; these allow multiple people to work more safely and effi  ciently
on the same site.
Page and code object Insert panels: You can fi nd intuitive icons for most common
web page elements in a categorized Insert panel, from which you can add elements to 
your page with a single click. You can use additional panels to fi ne-tune any page element
to ensure that you see exactly what you want. Included in the default Insert panel are
tools for formatting text, building forms, and creating layouts. You can also customize a 
Favorites tab with your most-used icons.
Customizable workspace layouts: You can save combinations and positions of panels
and toolbars for easy recall at any time. You can also save multiple workspace layouts for 
diff erent users, or create diff erent workspaces for specifi c tasks, such as coding or designing 
page layouts.
You can choose a specifi c workspace layout in order to create an arrangement of panels that 
suits you best.
Powerful visual aids: Take advantage of the precision you’re accustomed to in other 
design programs through Dreamweaver’s guides, rulers, measuring tools, and customizable
positioning grid. Many of these features are found and can be activated within the View 
menu. Dreamweaver’s Design-Time style sheets let you customize the look of your page 

1

exclusively for the editing process, making layout quicker and easier without permanently 
altering the page’s appearance.
Rulers, a document grid, and guides help you size and position page items with precision.
CSS Designer: Take advantage of the vast design and formatting options that CSS 
provides through Dreamweaver’s full-featured CSS Designer panel, which lets you visually 
create, edit, and manage styles on-the-fl y from a single panel.
The CSS Designer Panel provides a visual interface for styling your pages.

Live View and Live Code
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
16
Live View and Live Code
Experience tells you that visual web editors often display diff erently than the browsers 
they’re emulating. As script-driven interactivity gains popularity, the need to accurately
design the diff erent states of your page (including menus, panels, and interface elements), 
has become increasingly important. The static nature of the Design view in Dreamweaver 
often times does not meet users’ advanced needs.
Dreamweaver’s Live View mode uses the WebKit rendering engine (which is also the basis
for the Safari and Google Chrome web browsers), to give you a more accurate preview of 
your page in the same way that a browser would render it.
Live View enables you to preview your page as if it were in a web browser.
When you are in the Live View mode, the Live Code feature is enabled. Live Code allows 
you to see, in real time, how visually changing your page aff ects the code behind the scenes. 
If you have added interactive elements such as drop-down menus or accordion panels, then 
you can visually select an item on the page and see how the HTML code might be aff ected. 
Also useful is the Freeze JavaScript button (or the F6 key). This feature freezes your page in a
particular state (for example, with a menu locked open and a hover eff ect in place). You can
then edit those interactive elements directly in Dreamweaver.
CSS Inspection and the Enable/Disable feature
Another feature that is enabled when in Live View is the Inspect Mode. This mode allows 
users to peek at the visual model and structure of a page by hovering over elements on 
the page. When hovering in Inspect Mode you can see the relationships between the 

1
17
Lesson 1, Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart
Related fi les
HTML elements on your page and the styles assigned to them. This is useful because it
dramatically shortens the time it takes to locate any given style for any given object on the
page. However, when paired with the Enable/Disable feature, the Inspect Mode becomes 
even more powerful.
The Enable/Disable feature allows you to temporarily turn off  an applied style on your 
page. This can be very useful when dealing with unfamiliar or complex designs where half 
the battle is simply understanding what styles are being used. Disabling a style will remove 
its properties so that you can visually observe the results. Keep in mind that disabling is
always temporary, and that it is just as easy to restore the style by clicking Enable.
In the Inspect Mode, mousing over the elements in the Design view reveals the HTML and CSS code.
Related files
Web-based projects are becoming more complex than ever before, and you often fi nd that
even a single page is composed of a variety of assets. These assets can include Cascading 
Style Sheets (CSS), external JavaScript fi les, and more. Dreamweaver CC has a feature 
that will help you become much more eff ective at designing and managing sites and
applications with multiple assets.
The Related Files bar runs across the top of your document window, just below the
document tabs. The bar shows you all the various fi les that, when combined, create your 
fi nished page. You can switch between these fi les using the Related Files bar without
losing the visual preview of their parent page. Design view (or Live View) always shows

Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

the parent fi le, but you can now edit any of the related fi les without losing their important 
visual context.
The Related Files bar shows you the various fi les that are part of your fi nished page.
Code Navigator
The Code Navigator (
) is a feature enabled in the Design view that appears when you hover 
over an element on the page. Clicking the Navigator will let you see a quick summary of any 
CSS styles that have been applied, and if you choose to, you can click the style in order to 
view the code directly. The benefi t is that it is no longer necessary to manually hunt through
your style sheets to fi nd a specifi c rule; it’s just a click away in Dreamweaver.
The Code Navigator allows you to easily view the location and properties of your CSS styles in the Design View.

Lesson 1, Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart
Support for Content Management Systems 
Photoshop smart objects
Dreamweaver off ers support for Photoshop smart objects, meaning you can drag a PSD fi le 
into a web page within Dreamweaver, optimize the image for the Web, and even resize it.
Inserting a native Photoshop fi le into Dreamweaver will trigger an automatic conversion 
into a suitable web graphic, such as JPG, PNG, or GIF.
Also, if you decide to update the original PSD fi le at a later time, a red arrow will appear 
on the image in Dreamweaver to indicate that the source fi le has changed. You can then 
click the Update from Original button in the Property Inspector and a new version of the 
image will be created.
Support for Content Management Systems 
Enjoy authoring and testing support for content management systems like WordPress,
Joomla! and Drupal. A CMS/blog software like WordPress provides users with an easy 
way to publish content online and has features such as automatic archiving and database 
integration. In the past, designers have been frustrated with creating the page designs for 
a CMS using Dreamweaver because these systems generally rely on a relatively complex 
combination of dynamic pages (often PHP) that could not be previewed in Dreamweaver. 
For designers or users who are not code-savvy, the complexity of these fi les can be
daunting. Dreamweaver can now help you discover the related fi les needed to put together 
the pages in your CMS framework.
Access to these features in Dreamweaver CC requires installing the Database, Bindings, 
and Server Behavior extensions using the Adobe Extension Manager. Once installed and
properly confi gured, you will be able to preview the fi les of a CMS framework in the
Design view (as long as you have a testing server defi ned), using the built-in Live View
option. With this feature, Dreamweaver CC also lets you interact directly with a database, 
which means you can test online forms, insert and modify database records, and more.

Subversion
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
20
HTML5, CSS3, and PHP code hinting
For advanced users, there is now built in code-hinting support for HTML5 and CSS3
syntax. This means the “library” of HTML and CSS syntax that is now available within
Dreamweaver is larger than ever, which is a good sign for those designers and developers 
who need to build modern web pages.
Additionally, advanced users who use the scripting language PHP will be happy to learn
that Dreamweaver CC provides support for PHP syntax. This includes code hints, code
completion and syntax checking, as well as full support for all core functions, constants, 
and classes. PHP code hints have also been improved substantially.
Dreamweaver provides support for HTML5, CSS3, and PHP code-hinting.
HTML and CSS Starter Pages
HTML and CSS Starter Pages have been around in Dreamweaver for a few versions now.
These pages allow you to get a jumpstart on building page layouts by choosing from a variety 
of pre-built page layouts that you can subsequently modify. In Dreamweaver CC, the code 
for these starter pages is new and improved for modern web browsers and comes with plenty 
of code commenting behind the scenes to help you start modifying your pages quickly. You 
can view starter pages by choosing File > New. The Layout column features a number of 
page layouts. CSS starter pages can also be found by clicking the Page From Sample button.
Subversion
Dreamweaver features support for Subversion, a version control system similar to CVS and 
GitHub. Subversion is typically used by companies to maintain a team environment on larger 
projects that require changes to be logged and versions to be controlled. Without Subversion,
if you wanted to maintain versions, you would have to do the work yourself by maintaining 
folders and copies of previous versions. With Subversion, all fi les are kept on the Subversion
server. Changes are tracked so that you can restore your project to any previous state. 
Subversion is enabled by choosing Site > New Site ( or Site > Manage Sites), choosing Version 
Control and then clicking the Access menu and choosing Subversion.

How websites work
Business Catalyst integration
Adobe’s Business Catalyst is off ered as part of the Creative Cloud online subscription 
that provides a variety of features such as online store/shopping cart capabilities, e-mail
marketing, web form functionality, analytics extension, and more. With the Business 
Catalyst extension in Dreamweaver, you can log-in to Business Catalyst and synchronize 
multiple sites at once. Dreamweaver can be used to access and edit the style module used 
on your Business Catalyst connected sites. 
How websites work
Before embarking on the task of building web pages (and in turn, a website), it’s a good 
idea to know the basics of how websites work, how your users view them, and what you
need to know to make sure your website functions and looks its best. 
A simple flow chart
What happens when you type in a website address? Most people don’t even think about 
it—they just type in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and the website appears. They
most likely don’t realize how many things are going on behind the scenes to make sure 
that pages gets delivered to their computer so that they can do their shopping, check their 
e-mail, or research a project.
http://www.yoursite.com/
User Machine (client)
Web Host (server)
When you request a web page from your browser, the request is sent to a server that handles the request and sends the necessary fi les
back to your browser to be displayed.
When you type a URL or IP address in the address bar of a web browser, you are 
connecting to a remote computer (called a server), and downloading the documents, images,
and resources necessary to render the pages you will view while on the site. Web pages
aren’t delivered as a fi nished product; your web browser is responsible for reconstructing 
and formatting the pages based on the HTML code included within the pages. HTML
(Hypertext Markup Language) is a simple, tag-based language that instructs your browser 
how and where to insert and format pictures, text, and media fi les. Web pages are written in 
HTML, and Dreamweaver builds the HTML as you construct your page in the Design view.
An Internet Service Provider (ISP) enables you to connect to the Internet. Some well-known 
ISPs include Verizon, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable. You view web pages over an
Internet connection using a browser such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.
A browser can decipher and display web pages and their content, including images, text, and
video.

An introduction to HTML
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

Domain names and IP addresses
When you type in a website address, you usually enter the website’s domain name (such as 
DigitalClassroom.com). The website owner purchased this domain name and uses it to mask 
an IP address, which is a numerical address used to locate and dial up the pages and fi les
associated with a specifi c website. 
So how does the Web know what domains match up with what IP address, and in
turn, with what websites? It uses a Domain Name Service (DNS) server, which makes 
connections between domain names and IP addresses. 
Servers and web hosts
A DNS server is responsible for matching a domain name with its companion IP address.
Think of the DNS server as the operator at a phone company who connects calls through 
a massive switchboard. DNS servers are typically maintained by either the web host or 
the registrar from which the domain was purchased. Once the match is made, the request 
from your user is routed to the appropriate server and folder where your website resides. 
When the request reaches the correct account, the server then directs it to the fi rst page of 
the website, which is typically named index.html, default.html, or whatever the server is 
set up to recognize as a default starting page.
A server is a machine very much like your desktop computer, but it’s capable of handling 
traffi  c from thousands of users (often at the same time!), and it maintains a constant 
connection to the Internet so that your website is available 24 hours a day. Servers are 
typically maintained by a web host. Web hosts are companies that charge a fee to host and 
serve your website to the public. A single server can sometimes host hundreds of websites. 
Web hosting services are available from a variety of providers, including well-known
Internet service companies such as Yahoo!, and other large, dedicated hosting companies. It 
is also common for a large company to maintain its own servers and websites on its premises. 
The role of web browsers
A web browser is an application that downloads and displays HTML pages. Every time 
you request a page by clicking a link or typing in a website address you are requesting an
HTML page and any fi les that it includes. The browser’s job is to reconstruct and display
that page based on the instructions in the HTML code, which guides the layout and 
formatting of the text, images, and other assets used within the page. The HTML code 
works like a set of assembly instructions for the browser to use.
An introduction to HTML
HTML is what makes the Web work; web pages are built using HTML code, which in
turn is read and used by your web browser to lay out and format text, images, and video
on the page. As you design and lay out web pages in Design view, Dreamweaver writes the 
code behind the scenes that is necessary to display and format your page in a web browser.

Lesson 1, Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart
An introduction to HTML
Contrary to what you may think, HTML is not a programming language, but a simple text-
based markup language. HTML is not proprietary to Dreamweaver—you can create and
edit HTML in any text editor, even in simple applications such as Windows Notepad and
Mac OS X’s TextEdit. Dreamweaver’s job is to give you a visual way to create web pages
without having to code by hand. If you like to work with code, however, Dreamweaver’s
Code view is a fully featured text editor with color-coding and formatting tools that make it
easier to write and read HTML and other languages.
Tag structure and attributes
This exercise is for users who are completely new to HTML and Dreamweaver, and it 
will cover basic concepts such as the role of tags in HTML documents. HTML uses tags, 
or bracketed keywords, that you can use to place or format content. Many tags require a
closing tag, which is the keyword preceded by a forward slash (/). 
1 
Launch Dreamweaver. Choose File > Open. When the Open dialog box appears, 
navigate to the dw01lessons folder. Select BasicHTML.html and click Open.
2 
Select the Split button in the Document toolbar to see the layout as well as the code 
that makes up the page.
Take a look at line 10 (indicated at the left edge of the Code panel). The text My Bold 
Title is inside a Strong tag, which is simply the word
e
strong contained within angled
g
brackets. Any words or characters inside these tags are formatted in bold, and appear as 
shown in the Design view.
A look at the code reveals the tags used to format text in your page.
Tags can also accept CSS rules that specify additional information for how the tag 
should display the content. CSS rules might have one or more properties such as size,
color, or alignment. Take a look at the line that reads: This text will appear inside of its own

the selected paragraph using the center class by setting the CSS property text-align to 
center. You will learn how to create your own CSS rules using the CSS Designer later 
in this book.
Select the center class from the Class menu in the Property Inspector to center your paragraph.
5 
The text is now centered. Take a look at the Code view, and notice that the .center 
rule has been added to the opening 
 tag. This is not the only method of centering 
a paragraph using CSS, but it begins to introduce you to the practice of integrating 
HTML and CSS.
Align or format text in the Property Inspector, and then see the appropriate rules and attributes created in your code.
For more information on formatting text with CSS rules, see Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images.”

An introduction to HTML
The structure of an HTML document
In HTML a pair of tags is referred to as an element. For example, in the last exercise you 
created a style for one of the paragraph elements on the page. HTML elements defi ne 
the structure of a page and examples include lists, images, tables, and even the HTML
documents themselves. The HTML element is the most fundamental element you will use.
It is used to specify the beginning and end of HTML in a document:
The HTML element consists of two tags that contain two key sections of your web page:
the head and the body. The head element of your page contains items that are not visible 
to your user, but are important nonetheless. Search engine keywords, page descriptions,
and links to outside scripts or style sheets are all found in the head element. You create the
head of the document inside the HTML tags using the 
tags:
The body of your page is where all the visible elements of your page are contained. This is 
where you insert text, images, and other media. You defi ne the body of the page using the 
 element:
Whenever you create a new HTML document in Dreamweaver, this structure is created
automatically before you add anything to the page. Any visual elements you add to the
page are added using the appropriate HTML code inside the 
 element.
Placing images in HTML
You use some elements in HTML to place items, such as pictures or media fi les, inside a
web page. The
element is the most common example; its job is to place and format 
an image on the page. To place an image and see the resulting code, follow these steps:
1 
Choose File > Open. When the Open dialog box appears, navigate to the dw01lessons 
folder. Select the Images.html fi le and click Open to edit the fi le.

2 
If necessary, click the Split button in the Document toolbar so that you’re viewing 
both the layout and the code for your page. In the Design view portion of the Split
view, place your cursor at the end of the line and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) to insert a new line. This is where you’ll place a new image.
Enter the Split view before you insert the image onto your page.
3 
From the Common category in the Insert panel on the right side of the screen, click
the Image element and choose Image. When the Select Image Source dialog box 
appears, select the fi le named gears.jpg, located in the images folder within the
dw01lessons folder and click OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac OS).
Choose Image from the Common tab in the Insert bar.
4 
The code shows that the HTML 
element has been used to place the image. 
Click once on the image in the document window to select it. The Property Inspector 
at the bottom of the page displays and sets the properties for the image.

27
Lesson 1, Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart
An introduction to HTML
5 
Type the words Gears Image in the Alt Text fi eld in the Property Inspector to add
informative text to the
element .
When adding images, it is a recommended practice to provide additional information for users
with special needs (such as the visually impaired). You should always provide each image with
alternate text, located in the Properties Inspector at the bottom of the screen.
6 
Choose File > Save to save your work, then choose File > Close.
Note that in HTML, images and media are not embedded, but linked. This means
that the elements contain additional information known as attributes and values that 
point to the location of an image fi le and could even contain other information such as
the width and height values.
Colors in HTML
In Dreamweaver’s various panels and in your code, each color is referred to by a six-
character code preceded by a pound sign. This code is called hexadecimal code, and it is 
the system that HTML pages use to identify and use colors. You can reproduce almost any 
color using a unique hexadecimal code. For example, you represent dark red in HTML as 
.
The fi rst, middle, and last two digits of the hexadecimal code correspond to values in the 
RGB spectrum. For instance, white, which is represented in RGB as R:255 G:255 B:255,
is represented in HTML as 
 (255|255|255). Choosing colors is easy thanks to a
handy Swatches panel, which you can fi nd in many places throughout the work area.
The Swatches panel makes it easy
to work with colors.
The color pickers in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator also display and accept hexadecimal codes, 
making it easy to copy and paste colors between these applications and Dreamweaver.

Case sensitivity and whitespace rules
HTML is a fl exible language that has very few rules regarding its own appearance. Based 
on how strictly you want to write it, HTML can be either very specifi c about whether tags
are written in upper- or lowercase (called case sensitivity), or not specifi c at all. To see how 
HTML treats whitespace, follow these steps.
1 
Choose File > Open. When the Open dialog box appears, navigate to the dw01lessons
folder. Select the Whitespace.html fi le, and then click Open.
2 
If your fi le is not in Split view, click the Split button in the Document toolbar at the 
top of the page, so that you can view both the layout and the code. The fi rst three 
paragraphs have diff erent amounts of space between them in the HTML but will be
rendered on the page one after the other.
The browser ignores any white space between the paragraphs.
This tells you that whitespace and line returns are ignored by the browser. You have 
to begin making a distinction between code that is readable by humans versus the way 
a web browser interprets and renders code.

You will see there are a few diff erent ways to format your text. In the Design view, 
click once after the sentence that reads: This is one sentence, and then press Shift+Enter 
(Windows) or Shift+Return (Mac OS) twice. This creates two line returns—you can
see that each line return is created in your code by a 
 (break) tag. When rendered 
in the browser, the
 tag adds blank lines between the sentences; however the 
sentences are technically within the same paragraph. This is sometimes referred to as a
soft return. This method is actually not the ideal way to add new lines on your page,
although it does occasionally come in handy.
To create a line return, press and hold the Shift key while pressing the Enter or Return key.
4 
To create a new paragraph, position your cursor before the phrase: This is another, and 
r
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The text is separated by a line above 
and below, and is wrapped inside a set of 
 (paragraph) tags. This is the preferred 
method of adding paragraphs.
Other than a standard single space (such as the space used between words), several consecutive 
spaces created by the spacebar are ignored and are displayed as only one space in Design view and 
in a browser.

Element hierarchy
HTML elements should have a well-formed hierarchy or nesting structure in order to make 
sure that everything displays as it should. The element at the top of the hierarchy is the 
 element, and every other element you create is contained within it. Elements such
as the
 end up nesting all the other elements on a page, such as the
(paragraph), 
 (image), and 
(bold) elements. In addition, structural elements (such as 
those that create divs, paragraphs, lists, and tables) hold more weight than formatting tags
such as
(bold) and 
 (italic). Take this line of code, for example:
Although code such as this could work in certain browsers, it isn’t structured well because
the 
tag technically holds less weight than the 
tag. The following code
represents a better way to include the bold type:
Dreamweaver generally does a great job of keeping tags properly nested or contained 
within each other. When you choose to manipulate the code by hand, you should always 
keep good coding techniques in mind.
HTML5
The language of HTML has continued to evolve over the years and there are a few 
diff erent page types currently in use. Unless you specifi cally change it, the default page
type that Dreamweaver creates is named HTML5. HTML5 the ‘next’ version of the 
HTML specifi cation and while it is not formally ratifi ed at the time of this writing, it is
widely supported by all major browsers and is the language of choice for creating new web
pages. HTML5 replaces HTML4 and XHTML (which were introduced around the year 
2000). HTML5 is designed to make web pages more compatible with newer platforms, 
such as mobile phones and handheld devices, and to create rich interactive and animated
experiences.
Explorations in code
Although this book occasionally refers to the code for examples, hand-coding is not a
primary goal of these lessons. The best way to learn how code represents the layouts you 
are building visually is to switch to the Code view and explore what’s happening behind
the scenes.
It’s important to remember that every button, panel, and menu in Dreamweaver represents
some type of HTML tag, attribute, or value; very rarely will you learn something that is
unrelated or proprietary to Dreamweaver alone. Think of the Dreamweaver workspace as
a pretty face on the HTML language.

Lesson 1, Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart
A look at the Welcome Screen
A look at the Welcome Screen
A common fi xture in most Creative Cloud applications is the Welcome Screen, which is
a launching pad for new and recent documents. In Dreamweaver, the Welcome Screen 
appears when the application launches or when no documents are open. From the
Welcome Screen, you can create new pages, create a new site, open a recent document, or 
use one of Dreamweaver’s many starter pages or layouts.
The Welcome Screen appears when you launch the application, or when no documents are open.
Here’s what you’ll fi nd on the Welcome Screen:
Open a Recent Item: A list of the last few documents you worked on appears in the
far left column, or you can browse to open a diff erent fi le using the Open button at the
bottom.
Create New: In addition to HTML pages, you can choose from a variety of new
document formats, such as CSS, JavaScript, and XML. Dreamweaver is not just a web 
page-building tool, but also a superior text editor, making it ideal for creating many non-
HTML fi les. You can also defi ne a new Dreamweaver site using the link at the bottom, or 
choose the More folder for even more new fi le options.
Top Features (videos): On the far right side of the Welcome Screen, there is a column 
that contains links to videos of Top Features. These videos explore some of the new 
top features of Dreamweaver CC, including the Visual Styling with the CSS Designer, 
Enhanced Responsive Design, and Building Mobile Apps, among others. The videos are
located on Adobe’s website, adobe.com, and when you click one, Dreamweaver launches the 
site in your web browser to give you access to the video.

Creating, opening, and saving documents
The lessons throughout this book require that you create, save, and open existing fi les. 
You can accomplish most fi le-related tasks from the File menu at the top, or from the 
Welcome Screen that appears when you launch Dreamweaver.
Creating new documents
Dreamweaver creates text fi les most commonly in the form of HTML fi les (or web pages). 
It can also create fi les in a variety of text-based languages, including CSS, XML, and
JavaScript.
You can create blank fi les that you build from the ground up, or you can get started with a 
variety of layout templates and themes. You can create new documents from the File menu 
or from the Welcome Screen. Here, you’ll create a new page using the File menu.
The New Document dialog box gives you a choice of new fi les in a variety of formats and templates.

Lesson 1, Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart
Creating, opening, and saving documents
1 
To create a new document, choose File > New. The New Document dialog box appears. 
2 
Select Blank Page and under the Page Type column, choose HTML. Under Layout, 
choose <none> to start a new blank document. Leave the DocType drop-down menu
at its default. Click Create.
3 
Choose File > Save or File > Save As to start the process of saving your document.
4 
When prompted, choose a location for your fi le and assign it a name. Note that you
must save HTML fi les with an .html extension, or they will not be interpreted properly
in a browser. This rule applies for fi les of any type (such as .xml, .css, and .cfm).
Opening a recently opened document
To open a document you’ve worked on recently, Choose File > Open Recent or, from
the Welcome Screen, select a document under the Open a Recent Item column.
Now that you’ve seen what Dreamweaver can do, it’s time to put what you’ve learned into 
practice. In the next lesson, you will start building your fi rst Dreamweaver site.

Lesson 2, Setting Up a New Site
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Defi ning site settings
• Establishing local and 
remote folders
• Selecting, viewing, and 
organizing fi les with the 
Files panel
• Defi ning Page Properties
Lesson 2
Dreamweaver’s strength lies in its powerful site creation and 
management tools. You can use the software to create everything 
from individual pages to complete websites. The pages you create 
within your site can share similar topics, a cohesive design, or a 
common purpose. And, once your Dreamweaver site is complete, you 
can effi  ciently manage and distribute it from within the program.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace.
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw02lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.

See Lesson 2 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Creating a new site
In Dreamweaver, the term site refers to the local and remote storage locations where the
e
fi les that make up a website are stored. A site can also include a testing server location for 
processing dynamic pages. To take full advantage of Dreamweaver’s features, you should 
always start by creating a site. Dreamweaver CC can also be used to setup and manage a 
Business Catalyst Site. Business Catalyst is a part of the Creative Cloud service that Adobe 
provides (for a fee) that allows you to connect your website with analytic software and
other features. However, we do not cover setup of Business Catalyst sites in this book.
The easiest way to create a standard new site in Dreamweaver is to use the Site Setup dialog 
box. One way to access this dialog box is by choosing Site > New Site from the menu bar.
You can also use the Manage Sites dialog box to create a new site. This and other functions of 
the Manage Sites dialog box are discussed later in this book.
In this lesson, you begin by using the Site Setup dialog box to accomplish the following tasks:
• Defi ne the site
• Name the site
• Defi ne the local root folder
• Set up a remote folder
• Explore advanced settings
• Save the site
By default, the Site Setup dialog box opens with the Site Settings available. The options 
available here will help guide you through the essentials of defi ning your site. The Servers, 
Version Control, and Advanced Settings options allow you to set up local, remote, and 
testing servers directly.

Lesson 2, Setting Up a New Site
Creating a new site
1 
Launch Dreamweaver CC, if it is not already open, then choose Site > New Site.
First, you have to name the site. In the Site Name text fi eld, type Organic Utopia.
Type the Site Name into the text fi eld.
Next, you need to set up a local root folder, which is where Dreamweaver stores the fi les
with which you’re currently working. The Local Site Folder fi eld allows you to enter 
information regarding where you’ll be working with your fi les during development.
To ensure that the links you set up on your computer will work when you upload the site to a web
server, it is essential that you store all the site’s resources in one main folder on your hard drive,
then identify it within Dreamweaver. This is because the links will only work properly if all the 
site’s elements remain in the same relative location on the web server as your hard drive.
2 
Click the Folder icon (
) to the right of the Local Site Folder text fi eld to navigate to 
any pre-existing fi les. In the next step you will locate the lesson fi les we have provided
for this chapter.
If you did not click on the folder icon and just clicked Save, Dreamweaver would 
simply create a new folder on your system where you could begin to create new pages 
in your site. In this case, you will be pointing to a preexisting folder that already has 
fi les within it.
It is important to distinguish between adding a new site (which is what you are doing 
now) and creating a new site from scratch. In both cases, the important part is that
Dreamweaver knows where this folder is on your system. This folder is known as the 
root folder and will always contain the content that will eventually be your website.

3 
Navigate to your desktop and locate the dw02lessons folder you copied to your 
desktop earlier.
4 
Select the dw02lessons folder. On the Windows platform, click Open to open this
folder, then press Select (Windows). On the Mac OS platform, click Choose to choose 
this as your local root folder. The fi eld now shows the path to your newly defi ned local 
root folder. 
At this point, you have done the minimum amount of steps required to begin working 
on a site. Now you will take a look at some of the optional features within the Site 
Setup process.
5  Click the Servers tab. This section allows you to defi ne the remote server where your 
website will end up being hosted. Take a moment to read the heading in the dialog 
box. Note that it says you do not need to fi ll in this information to begin creating a
website. It is only necessary if you are connecting to the Web.
You are not connecting to the Web in this lesson, but you should take a look at the 
screen anyway to understand the information needed.
6 
Click the + button and the Basic site settings window appears. Here there are fi elds
for Server Name, Connect Using, FTP Address, Username and Password, along with
other options. These settings allow you to choose both a destination and a method 
(FTP being the most common) for Dreamweaver to use to transfer fi les.
Set up access to your remote folder.
As noted earlier, this is an optional step, and you do not have to defi ne your remote
folder at this stage. Dreamweaver allows you to defi ne your remote folder at a later 
time, such as when you’re ready to upload.

7 
Click the Advanced tab. Click the Server Model menu in the Testing Server section. 
Here there are choices for diff erent scripting languages such as PHP and ASP pages. 
If you are an advanced user, this is where you would set up the connections to your 
testing server.
Again, you won’t be making any changes here, so click Cancel.
8 
Click the Version Control option on the left to access Subversion settings. Subversion, 
a VCS (or version control system), keeps track of changes made to fi les, enabling 
users to track changes and return to previous versions of any fi le. For this exercise, 
make sure the Access pull-down in this window is set to None, as you won’t be using 
Subversion.
You’ve now completed the site setup process using basic settings. Don’t close the Site
Setup dialog box yet, though, as you’ll now explore the options found under the
Advanced Settings option.
Advanced site-creation options
Chances are if you are new to Dreamweaver or web design you won’t need these advanced
settings. If you are in this category, click Save and skip to the Adding Pages section. Other 
users might be curious as to what these settings are and should proceed.
1 
Click the arrow next to Advanced Settings in the Site Setup dialog box.
2 
From the categories listed below Advanced Settings, choose Local Info.
Choose Local Info from Advanced Settings.

2
Creating a new site
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
40
The information you set in the Local Info window identifi es your Default Images 
folder, what your links are relative to, and a web URL to be used if you don’t have a 
remote server defi ned. One of the more important Local Info settings is case-sensitive
link checking.
The case-sensitive links checking feature ensures that your links will work on a Unix 
server, where links are case-sensitive. If you’re using a Windows or Mac OS server, this
doesn’t matter as much, but it is a good idea to follow the strict naming and linking 
conventions of a Unix system in case you ever move your site to a diff erent server.
If you happen to have already defi ned a CSS3 site-wide Media Query fi le, this is 
where you could redefi ne or modify it.
(We cover the creation of site-wide Media Query fi les in Lesson 15, “Mobile Design 
and Layout”.)
The remaining categories to the left of the Advanced tab of the Site Setup dialog box 
help to defi ne your site’s production, collaboration, and deployment capabilities. They 
include the following:
Cloaking allows you to specify fi le types or specifi c fi les that you do not want 
uploaded to the server.
Design Notes is a collaboration tool that keeps notes regarding the development of 
the page or site. 
File View Columns is an organizational tool. If you want to share the custom 
columns with others, you must enable Design Notes as well. 
Contribute is a separate application that enables users with basic word processing and 
web browser skills and little or no HTML knowledge to create and maintain web pages.
Templates can be automatically updated with rewritten document paths using this
option.
jQuery is a JavaScript library for web designers. It allows designers to build pages that
provide a richer experience for their users.
Web Fonts allows you to defi ne where you are storing the web fonts you would like
to use for this site.
Edge Animate Assets allows you to defi ne where you are storing any assets created
in Edge Animate that you would like to use for this site.
3 
At this point you are fi nished defi ning your settings, so click Save. Dreamweaver 
creates a site with the settings you have defi ned.
You are now ready to work with pages for your defi ned website and take advantage of 
Dreamweaver’s site features.

Lesson 2, Setting Up a New Site
Adding pages
Adding pages
Dreamweaver contains many features to assist you in building pages for your site. For 
example, you can defi ne properties for pages, including titles, background colors or 
images, as well as default text and link colors.
The fi rst step for creating a new page correctly was taken when you defi ned the site in the 
last exercise. By defi ning the root folder, Dreamweaver will always create new pages in
your site automatically. These pages are now visible in the Files panel in the lower right of 
your screen.
The Files panel.
If your Files panel does not look the same as it does here, choose Window > Workspace Layout 
> Reset ‘Compact’.

2
Adding pages
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
42
1 
Choose File > New. The New Document dialog box opens.
Use the New Document dialog box to add a page to your site.
2 
You can create a new page using a predesigned layout, or start with a blank page and 
build a layout of your own. In this exercise, you’ll start with a blank page while in
later lessons you will get a chance to explore some of the other options. Click the 
Blank Page category on the left side of the New Document dialog box.
3 
In the Page Type column, you can select the type of page you want to create (for 
example, HTML, PHP, and so on). Select HTML if it is not currently selected.
In the Layout column, you can choose to base your page on a prebuilt design. These
predesigned layouts fall into one of three categories:
Fixed creates a layout with columns that do not resize based on the user’s browser 
settings. They are measured in pixels.
Liquid creates a layout with columns that resize if the user resizes the browser 
window, but not if the user changes the text settings.
HTML5 creates a fi xed layout that uses the new HTML5 elements such as
,
 and
among others.

2
43
Lesson 2, Setting Up a New Site

4 
Click <none> in the Layout column to build the page without using a prebuilt layout.
5 
Click the DocType menu in the lower-right corner. This DocType drop-down menu 
defi nes the document type for diff erent versions of HTML including XHTML 1.0 
Transitional and HTML5. HTML5 is the default setting and is suitable in most cases,
so be sure to bring it back to this option.
Choose HTML5 as your DocType.
The Layout CSS and Attach CSS settings are irrelevant here, as you didn’t choose a 
 CSS-based layout for this page.

Click Create to create a new, blank HTML page. You will learn more about
Workspaces a bit later, but to make sure you are working as we are, choose Window >
Workspace Layout and choose Reset ‘Compact’. Your screen should now look like 
ours. (Although if you are in Code View, you should switch to the Design view now.)
Your new, blank HTML page.
Saving a page to your site
You should get accustomed to saving pages to your local root folder early and often. It is 
very important that you store all your site’s resources in one main folder on your hard drive 
so that the links you set on your computer will work when your site is uploaded to a server. 
1 
Choose File > Save.
2 
In the Save As dialog box, Dreamweaver should have automatically opened your 
dw02lessons folder which was defi ned earlier in the Site Settings.
If this is not the case, navigate to your desktop and locate the dw02lessons folder.
3 
In the Save As text fi eld, name your fi le about_us.html.
Notice that even though the fi le is for the About Us page, you are naming it about_us.html.
When naming your fi les and directories, avoid using spaces, periods, slashes, or any other 
unnecessary punctuation, as doing so will likely cause the server to misdirect your fi les.

45
Lesson 2, Setting Up a New Site
Defi ning page properties
4 
Click Save to save the page in your local root folder. In the Files panel note that the 
fi le about_us.html has now been added. Again, site settings are very important in
Dreamweaver because fi les are automatically saved and organized based on having a
site defi nition.
Defining page properties
Now that you’ve created a page in Dreamweaver, you’ll use the Page Properties dialog 
box to specify its layout and formatting properties. For example, you can set page titles,
background colors and images, text and link colors, as well as other basic properties of 
every web page. You use this dialog box to defi ne page properties for each new page you
create, and to modify the settings for pages you’ve already created.
1 
To access the Page Properties dialog box, choose Modify > Page Properties, or use the 
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+J (Windows) or Command+J (Mac OS). The Page Properties
dialog box appears with the Appearance (CSS) category selected by default.
The Page Properties dialog box.
Settings found in the Appearance (CSS) category will automatically create a Cascading 
Style Sheet that defi nes the appearance of your page. Using a CSS fi le to defi ne these 
page properties adds fl exibility to your design, as styling can be changed more easily
and more universally than if your defaults are defi ned using HTML code.
2 
The Page Font and Size fi elds defi ne the default appearance of text on your page. For 
now, leave these settings at their defaults. You’ll be styling type with CSS in later 
lessons in this book.

3 
The Text color option allows you to set a default color in which to render type. To
set a text color, click the color swatch next to Text and the Swatches panel appears. 
You can choose your default text color by clicking the appropriate swatch from the
Swatches panel. Try this by clicking any color swatch, then clicking Apply to apply
your desired default text color.
You can also type the hexadecimal notation for your desired color into the text fi eld. 
Type the hex code #666666 in the text fi eld to specify a dark gray as the default text
color.
You’ll see the eff ects of this change later in this lesson, when you add text to your page using the 
Files panel.
4 
Use the Background color option to choose a background color for your page. Click 
the color swatch next to the Background text fi eld and the Swatches panel appears.
You can choose your background color by clicking the appropriate swatch from the

The Background image fi eld allows you to set a background image for your page. 
Dreamweaver mimics a browser’s behavior by repeating, or tiling, the background 
image to fi ll the window. To choose a background image, click the Browse button 
next to the Background image text fi eld. The Select Image Source dialog box appears.

From the Repeat drop-down menu, choose repeat-x. Click Apply to see the change.
Choose a background image for your page ((bg_gradient.gif).

By default, Dreamweaver places your text and images in close proximity to the top
and left edges of the page. To build in some extra room between your page edges and
the content on them, use the Margin settings in the Page Properties dialog box. In the
Left margin text fi eld, type 25 to place your content 25 pixels from the left edge of the
page. In the Top margin text fi eld, type 25 to place your content 25 pixels from the
top edge of the page.
The Appearance (HTML) category in the Page Properties dialog box contains many
of the same settings you just defi ned. Setting default page attributes with HTML code, 
however, is not recommended. Setting appearance with CSS is a better option.
The Links (CSS) category allows you to defi ne the appearance of linked text within
your document. For more information on creating hyperlinks, see Lesson 3, “Adding 
Text and Images.”
9 
Click the Links (CSS) category on the left side and leave the Link font and Size 
settings at their defaults (same as Page font). This ensures that your hyperlinks will
display in the same typeface and size as the rest of the text on your page.

10 Set the colors for your diff erent link types in the following fi elds:
Link Color: Type #fc3 for the default link color applied to linked text on your web page.
Visited links: Type #ccc for the color applied to linked text after a user has clicked on it.
Rollover links: Type #f03 for the color applied to linked text when a user rolls over it.
Active links: Type #ff 6 for the color applied when the user clicks on linked text.
Hexadecimal codes can be written in shorthand using only three alphanumeric characters when 
the two digits that make up each RGB component are the same value. For instance, #fc3 is the 
same as writing #ff cc33.
11 Because you’re using CSS formatting, you can choose whether or not (and/or when) you 
want your links to be underlined. This is not possible with HTML formatting. Choose 
the default setting of Always underline in the Underline style drop-down menu.
Choose default colors for links, visited links, and active links.
The Headings (CSS) category allows you to defi ne the font, style, size, and color of

Unicode (UTF-8) will likely be set as the default option. This specifi es the encoding 
used for characters in your page, letting the browser know which character set to use.
The Unicode Normalization Form is likely set to C (Canonical Decomposition). This

A deeper look into the Files panel
You have already seen how Dreamweaver populates the Files panel when you defi ne a
new site. However, the Files panel is more than just a window into your root folder; it also
allows you to manage fi les locally and transfer them to and from a remote server. The Files
panel maintains a parallel structure between local and remote sites, copying and removing 
fi les when needed to ensure synchronicity between the two.
The default workspace in Dreamweaver displays the Files panel in the panel grouping to 
the right of the document window.
When you chose to use the dw02lessons folder as your local root folder earlier in this
lesson, Dreamweaver set up a connection to those local fi les through the Files panel.

Questions
1 
What characters should you avoid using when naming fi les and folders on your site 
and why?
2 
How is the local root folder essential to the creation of your site?
3 
Where can you view, select, open, and copy fi les to and from your local root folder, 
and to and from remote and/or testing servers?
Answers
1 
Avoid using spaces (use underscores instead), periods, slashes, or any other unnecessary 
punctuation in your site name, as doing so will likely cause the server to misdirect
your fi les.
2 
It’s essential that you store all your site’s resources in your local root folder to ensure
that the links you set on your computer will work when your site is uploaded to a
server. In order for your links to work properly, all the elements of your site must
remain in the same relative location on the web server as on your hard drive.

Dreamweaver provides the Files panel to help you both manage fi les locally and 
transfer them to and from a remote server. You can view, select, open, and copy fi les

Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Previewing pages
• Adding text
• Understanding styles
• Creating hyperlinks
• Creating Lists
• Inserting and editing 
images
Lesson 3
Text and images are the building blocks of most websites. In this 
lesson, you’ll learn how to add text and images to web pages to 
create an immersive and interactive experience for your visitors.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of 
this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw03lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw03lessons folder from
the included DVD that contains resources you need for this lesson. Go to Site > New Site,
and name the site dw03lessons, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2,
“Setting Up a New Site.”

Dreamweaver CC off ers some convenient features for placing images and formatting text. 
In this lesson, you’ll be working with a few pages within a site and adding some photos 
and text to a simple page for a fi ctional store.
Adding text
You should already have created a new site, using the dw03lessons folder as your root. In
this section, you’ll be adding a headline and formatting the text on the events.html page.
1 
If it’s not already open, launch Dreamweaver CC.
2 
Make sure your dw03lessons site is open in the Files panel. If not, open it now.
3 
Double-click the events.html fi le in your Files panel to open it in the Design view.
Without any formatting, the text seems random and lacks purpose. First, you’ll add a 
headline to give the fi rst paragraph some context. 
4 
Click to place your cursor in front of the word There’s in the fi rst paragraph. Type
OrganicUtopia Events and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create a 
line break.
Type the words OrganicUtopia Events and then put them on their own line.

Click and drag to highlight the phrase you just typed. You will now format your 
text using the Property Inspector. Located at the bottom of the screen, the Property
Inspector allows you to format your text using HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext
Markup Language. You will learn much more about the use of HTML in the next
lesson; however, you will need to have a basic understanding of this language in order 
to use the Property Inspector to format your text.
6 
Locate the Property Inspector at the bottom of your screen. When you are in Design 
View and working with text, you will see your HTML formatting options. Choose 
Heading 1 from the Format drop-down menu. The text increases in size and becomes 
bold. By default, the style of any HTML text formatted as Heading 1 is generic: the 
color is black and the font-family is Times New Roman.
Use the Format drop-down menu in the Property Inspector to make the selected text a level-1 heading.
Although you are working in Dreamweaver’s Design view, you have actually changed
the HTML code for this page. Page content such as text is wrapped in opening and 
closing tags, and everything between these two tags is formatted according to the 

3
Adding text

rules of these tags. The text OrganicUtopia Events originally had an opening and 
closing tag defi ning it as a paragraph. The code looked like this:
The fi rst
 is the opening tag for a paragraph, and the second 
is the closing 
tag for a paragraph. A pair of opening and closing tags in HTML is called an element. 
So in the previous step, you changed the formatting of the text from a paragraph 
element to a Heading 1 element, and the HTML code changed to this:
Headings are important structural elements in HTML. The largest heading is H1, and 
the subsequent headings become smaller with H2, H3, and so on. For the next step, 
you will format this text in order to change the font style of this heading to Helvetica;
however, you will not be using HTML to accomplish this, but rather CSS.
7 
Click anywhere inside the heading OrganicUtopia Events; you do not need to have it
selected. You will fi nd the CSS Designer panel on the bottom-right side of your screen. 
You will use this panel to create CSS styles to change the appearance of your h1 heading.
The CSS Designer panel, located in the top-right 
corner of the workspace, is where you will create 
and edit all of your CSS styles.

sans-serif from the list. Your heading is now styled in Helvetica.
The font-family property allows you to choose a font list from the font selection menu.
14 Click OK. Your heading is now styled in Helvetica.
Dreamweaver allows you to format text in a way that is similar to desktop publishing 
and word processing applications, but there are important diff erences to keep in 
mind. When you chose the styling, Gotham, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-
serif, they were listed together as one option in the Font drop-down menu. When
a web page is rendered in a browser, it typically uses the fonts installed on the user’s 
computer. However Dreamweaver CC uses free web fonts made available through 
Creative Cloud and powered by TypeKit.
Using web fonts means that anyone viewing your web page will see the page using 
the fonts you intended. Dreamweaver still provides a font list in the event the user’s 
computer cannot access the web fonts. Assigning multiple fonts allows you to
control which font is used if the person viewing your page doesn’t have a specifi c 
font installed. In this case, if the user doesn’t have Helvetica, Arial displays instead. 
Sans-serif is included as the last option in case the user doesn’t have either Helvetica 
or Arial. A generic font family (either sans-serif or serif) is listed at the end of all the 
options in the Font drop-down menu.
You will now change the text color using the CSS Designer Panel.

An introduction to styles
You have styled the fi rst element on your page by fi rst formatting the text as a Heading 1
in HTML, and then you changed the font and color using CSS. It’s important to realize 
that every change you make in the Design view creates or modifi es the code. In the next 
exercise, you’ll begin to explore the HTML and CSS code behind the Design view. To 
help put this exercise in context, a little background on HTML and CSS is in order.
The HTML language has been around since the dawn of the Web. It’s easiest to think 
of HTML as the structure behind the pages that are rendered in your web browser. An
HTML page at its most basic is a collection of text, images, and sometimes multimedia
such as Flash or video fi les. The diff erent sections of a web page, such as a paragraph, a
heading, or a list, are all elements. 

3
65
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
An introduction to styles
CSS is also a language, but it has not been around as long as HTML. In many ways, CSS
was created in order to allow HTML to do what it does best: create the structure of a
page, but not style. CSS is a simple language that works in combination with HTML to 
apply style to the content in web pages, such as text, images, tables, and form elements.
CSS uses rules, or style instructions, that the HTML elements on your page follow. The 
most important thing to remember is that HTML and CSS are two separate languages, but 
they are very closely aligned and work together very well.
In the last exercise, you were introduced to this interplay between HTML and CSS. There 
was an HTML element for the Heading 1 formatting. In the code it looks like this:
That was the HTML element. The CSS rule that defi nes the appearance of the <h1>
element looks like this:
CSS has a diff erent syntax than HTML. In HTML, tags are defi ned by angled brackets, 
and you have opening tags,
, and closing tags, 
. In CSS code, you are not 
working with tags at all, instead you use selectors. In the CSS code above, the h1 is 
referred to as the selector because it is selecting the HTML element and then declaring 
some rules for its appearance. Because you’ve established that HTML and CSS are two 
separate languages and have diff erent syntax, it’s important that you see where this code
lives in your web page. You will do this by changing Dreamweaver’s workspace.
This exercise is intended to help you understand the relationship between HTML and CSS
code that is created in Dreamweaver, and is not necessarily the way you will always work
in the program. Many people will work in the Design view most of the time, but the Split
view you are about to use is very helpful for learning the languages of HTML and CSS.

Click the Split button in the Document toolbar at the top of your page to open up the 
Split view. The Split view allows you to see your code and the design of your page
simultaneously.

Click quickly three times in the paragraph beneath OrganicUtopia Events in the
Design view. In the Code view the text is highlighted between the opening and 
closing paragraph tags. As noted above, this is referred to as the paragraph element.
A paragraph highlighted in the Split view.
You will now change the font size of your paragraphs.
3 
Click <style> in the Sources menu to alert Dreamweaver that you want to add 
another embedded style. Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors menu to create 
a new CSS style for our p element. 
4 
In this case, Dreamweaver has recognized that you have selected text in a paragraph 
within the body tag of your page so it prefi lls the text box with 
. Select the 
body and delete it leaving the letter p to create a selector for our paragraph. Then press
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

If necessary, clear the Show Set check box on the Navigation Bar in the Properties
pane of the CSS Designer panel to show all the available CSS properties. Click the 
Text button In the Properties menu to limit the choices and only show the text-related 
properties.
In this case, the font size is set to 18 pixels. Now let’s look at the CSS code that is
defi ning this font size.

Locate the font-size property in the Properties pane of the CSS Designer and click
medium to the right of the property label. Select px from the menu and enter the 
number 18 in the text box that appears. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to apply the change. 
7 
Within the Code view of the split screen is all the HTML and CSS code that defi nes 
the appearance of this page. On the right side of the Code view, scroll up by clicking 
the up arrow or by clicking the scroll bar and dragging upward. Toward the top of the
page, you are looking for a few lines of code that look like this:
Between the two 
 tags are all the CSS rules you have created up to this
point. Previously, you learned that CSS has a diff erent syntax than HTML: because 
all the CSS rules are actually contained within an opening 
tag and a closing 
 tag, they are allowed to have a diff erent syntax. Additionally, the style tag 
itself is nested inside an opening and closing 
 tag. In the world of HTML,
nothing contained within head tags is rendered on a web browser’s screen. You will 
explore this further in the next lesson, but this is referred to as an internal style sheet.
You will now see that changes made in Dreamweaver’s Code view apply to the Design
view as well.
8 
In the Code view, locate the line 
in the rule for , and select the 
value 18 by clicking and dragging over it. Type 14 to change the value. Although you 
made a change in the Code view, it has not yet been automatically updated in your 
Design view. You need to refresh your page in order to see the changes occur in the 
Design view.

9 
In the Property Inspector, click the Refresh button to apply the changes; your 
paragraph text becomes smaller. 
Changes made in the Code view are refl ected in the Design view after clicking the Refresh button.
You can also click once inside the Design view for the page to refresh automatically.
On the Web, font sizes are specifi ed diff erently than they are in print. The numerical 
choices in the Size drop-down menu refer to pixels instead of points. Also, the xx-
small through larger options could seem oddly generic if you are accustomed to the 
precision of print layout. Because web pages are displayed on a variety of monitors and
browsers, relative measurements can be a useful way for designers to plan ahead for 
inevitable discrepancies in the rendering of pages.

10 Click inside the fi rst paragraph in the Design view. You will now change the color 
of the paragraph slightly to a dark gray rather than the default pure black. Click the
p selector in the Selectors pane of the CSS Designer panel so that we can modify the
properties for our paragraph element.
11 If necessary, clear the Show Set check box on the Navigation Bar in the Properties 
pane of the CSS Designer panel to show all the available CSS properties. Click the 
Text button in the Properties menu to only show the text-related properties.
12 Locate the color property in the Properties pane of the CSS Designer and click the Set
Color button to the right of the label color. When the Swatches panel appears, locate 
the dark gray swatch in the top-left corner of the palette, which is hexadecimal color 
#666. Click the swatch to apply the color. Notice that not only does the appearance
in the Design view change, but in your Code view a new line of CSS has also been 
created (color: #666666).
Working in the Split view can be a great way to learn about hand-coding without
diving in completely. Even if you’re not quite comfortable editing code, keeping an 
eye on the code that Dreamweaver writes for you can give you a better understanding 
of how things like CSS aff ect your web pages.

14 Choose File > Save. Keep this fi le open for the next part of this lesson.
For more information about Cascading Style Sheets, see the Web Design with HTML and
CSS Digital Classroom book available in electronic and print formats.
Previewing pages in a web browser
Viewing your pages in the Design view is helpful, but visitors to your site will be using a
web browser to access your site. In Lesson 1, “Dreamweaver CC Jumpstart,” you learned
how browsers use HTML code to render a page. Unfortunately, not every browser renders 
HTML code in exactly the same way, so it’s important to test-drive your pages in a
number of diff erent browsers to check for inconsistencies and basic functionality.
Next, you’ll use Dreamweaver’s Preview in Browser feature to see how the OrganicUtopia

Previewing pages in a web browser
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
70
1 
With events.html open in Dreamweaver, choose File > Preview in Browser and
select a browser from the available options. This list varies, depending on the browsers 
you have installed on your hard drive.
Preview in Browser allows you to see how a selected browser would render your page.
The options found under File > Preview in Browser can be customized by choosing File >
Preview in Browser > Edit Browser List.
2 
When events.html opens in the browser of your choice, look for diff erences between 
the Design view preview and the version rendered by your browser. At this stage, 
there shouldn’t be anything too surprising, but there could be subtle diff erences in
spacing and font style. Close your web browser.
There is another method to preview your pages: the Live View feature. Live
View allows you to preview your page without having to leave the Dreamweaver 
workspace. You can think of Live View as a browser within Dreamweaver (in fact, 
it is the same WebKit rendering engine found in browsers such as Apple’s Safari and
Google’s Chrome, among others).

Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Understanding hyperlinks
3 
Click the Live button located in the Document toolbar at the top of your page. You 
will not see a dramatic diff erence, but your text could shift slightly. Select the fi rst 
heading in the window and try to delete it; you will be unable to, because Live View 
is a non-editable workspace. However, Live View does allow you to edit your page 
when you are in Split view. You are allowed to edit in the Code view and changes 
will be refl ected in real time. An additional advantage is that your document does not 
have to be saved in order to see the changes.
When Live View is enabled, Dreamweaver simulates a web browser.
4 
Click the Live button again to deactivate this view. While Live View is a useful addition
to Dreamweaver, it does not replace the need to preview your page in a browser. Web 
pages might be rendered diff erently depending on your visitor’s browser, and so it is a
good habit to check your page occasionally as you make changes to your design. 
Understanding hyperlinks
When people visit a website, they usually expect to see more than one page. Imagine
trying to shop for a new book by your favorite author on a site that consisted of nothing 
more than a single order form with every book off ered by a retailer like Amazon.com. This 
might seem absurd, but without hyperlinks you wouldn’t have much choice.
Hyperlinks make the Web a truly interactive environment. They allow the user to freely 
navigate throughout a website, or jump from one site to another. There are a number of 
ways to create links in Dreamweaver, but before you get started, you should be aware of 
some fundamental facts.
Links rely on directory paths to locate fi les. A directory path is simply a description of a 
fi le’s location that can be understood by a computer. A classic, real-world example is an 
address. If you wanted to send a letter to your friend Sally in Florida, you would have to
specify the state, city, street, and house number where Sally can be found. If Sally lived at
123 Palm Street in Orlando, the path would be:
Florida/Orlando/123 Palm Street/Sally

3
Creating hyperlinks
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
72
This simply means that inside Florida, inside Orlando, in the house numbered 123 on a 
street named Palm Street, you can fi nd a person named Sally. Hyperlinks follow the same
logic:
www.somewebsitesomewhere.com/photos/mydog.jpg
This URL address is a link to a JPEG image named mydog.jpg, which is inside a folder 
named photos on a website named somewebsitesomewhere.com. 
Creating hyperlinks
Later in this lesson, you’ll be creating a gallery page to showcase some of the sample
products mentioned in the main paragraph. Before you work on that page, you’ll link it 
to the home page by creating a hyperlink. If you are not already in Design view, select 
Design view now.
1 
In the Property Inspector, click the HTML button to access the HTML properties.
2 
In the fi rst paragraph, highlight the word products in the second sentence.
3 
In the Property Inspector, type products.html in the Link text fi eld. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The highlighted word automatically becomes
underlined. It is important to note that we have created this page for you and it is
currently inside your site folder, you are simply linking to it.
Type products.html into the Link text fi eld in the Property Inspector.
4 
Choose File > Save and then File > Preview in Browser.

3
73
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Creating hyperlinks
5 
Click the new products link. The products page appears in your browser window.
This is because a previously existing page named products.html was located in this
folder.
Now visitors can easily navigate to the products page, but what happens when they 
want to go back to the events page? It looks like you’ll need another link.
6 
Return to Dreamweaver and double-click products.html in the Files panel. Click to
the right of the word Produce and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
create a new line. Choose Insert > Hyperlink to open the Hyperlink dialog box. 
The Hyperlink dialog box is one of the many ways to create a link in Dreamweaver. It 
off ers all the options found in the Property Inspector, with a few additions.
7 
Type Events in the Text fi eld.
The Hyperlink dialog box is one of the many ways to create links in
Dreamweaver.
8 
Click the Browse button to the right of the Link text fi eld to open the Select File 
dialog box. The dw03lessons folder you defi ned as the root for this site should be 
selected for you by default. If not, click the Site Root button. Select events.html and 
click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
9 
Click inside the Title fi eld and type Organic Utopia events page. Titles are 
strictly optional for hyperlinks, but they improve accessibility for users with assistive
technologies, such as Screen Readers. Additionally, adding titles to your hyperlinks 
can also improve your site’s search engine rankings. Click OK to commit the changes;
notice that a link to events.html has been created for you using the text entered into
the Text fi eld in the Hyperlink dialog box.
10 Choose File > Save and keep this fi le open for the next part of this lesson.

Relative versus absolute hyperlinks 
After reading about the fundamentals of hyperlinks and directory paths a few pages ago, 
you might be surprised by the simplicity of linking events.html and products.html.
Instead of entering a long directory path in the Link text fi elds, you merely typed the 
name of the fi le. This kind of link is called a relative link. Let’s go back to the address
example to see how this works.
Remember Sally from Orlando? Imagine you were already standing on Palm Street, where 
she lives. If you called her for directions to her house, she probably wouldn’t begin by 
telling you how to get to Florida. At this point, all you need is a house number. Relative 
links work the same way. Because events.html and products.html both reside in the
dw03lessons folder, you don’t need to tell the browser where to fi nd this folder.
Now you’ll create an absolute link that will allow visitors to access the Adobe website to 
learn more about Dreamweaver CC.
1 
Click the events.html tab above the Document toolbar to bring the page forward. 
Scroll down to the bottom of the page if necessary. Using the Design view window, 
create a new line at the bottom of the page after the text that reads “Occasionally we 
gather...”, and type This page was created with Adobe Dreamweaver.
2 
Highlight the words Adobe Dreamweaver and in the Common section of the Insert 
panel on the right side of the screen, click the Hyperlink icon to open the Hyperlink
dialog box.
The Hyperlink icon in the Insert panel 
is another convenient way to create links.

75
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Creating hyperlinks
3 
The Hyperlink dialog box opens. Notice that Adobe Dreamweaver has been entered 
into the Text fi eld for you. In the Link text fi eld, type http://www.adobe.com/
products/dreamweaver.html. Make sure to include the colon and the appropriate
number of forward slashes. 
The absolute link http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html instructs the browser 
l
to fi nd a website named adobe.com on the World Wide Web. Then the browser looks
for a fi le named dreamweaver.html located inside a folder named products.
You do not have to type the absolute hyperlinks if you have the website open in your browser. 
In your web browser, select the address in the address bar, copy it, and then paste it into the Link 
fi eld in Dreamweaver.
4 
Choose
from the Target drop-down menu. Choosing the 
 option will 
cause the hyperlink to the Adobe website to open in a new, blank browser window or 
tab (depending on the browser).
Set the target window for the hyperlink to open in a blank browser window 
or tab.
5 
Click OK to close the Hyperlink dialog box. Choose File > Save, then File > Preview 
in Browser, or click the Preview/Debug in Browser button (
) in the Document
toolbar.
6 
Click the Adobe Dreamweaver text. Unlike the Events and Products links you created
earlier, this link causes your browser to open a new tab or window, and it is pointing 
to an external web page on the Internet.
7 
Close your browser and keep this fi le open; you will be adding to it in the next exercise.

Creating lists
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
76
Linking to an e-mail address
Absolute and relative links can be used to access web pages, but it’s also possible to link to
an e-mail address. Instead of opening a new web page, an e-mail link opens up the default 
mail program on a visitor’s computer and populates the address fi eld with the address you 
specify when creating the link. As you can imagine, this kind of link can work diff erently 
depending on how your visitors have confi gured their computers.
In the previous part of this lesson, you gave the visitor a link to some information on 
Dreamweaver. Now you’ll link them to an e-mail address where they can get some 
information on learning Dreamweaver from the folks who wrote this book.
1 
Place your cursor at the end of the last line, then press and hold your Shift key and 
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Instead of creating a new paragraph, 
this creates a line break, or a soft return, and the text begins immediately below
the previous line. Type Contact info@agitraining.com for information on 
Dreamweaver classes.
2 
Highlight the text info@agitraining.com and click the Email Link button in the 
Insert panel.
3 
The Email Link dialog box opens with both fi elds automatically populated. Click OK. 
You can preview this page in your browser. Remember that if you click the link, your 
e-mail client will begin to launch.
The Email Link dialog box allows you to link to an e-mail address.
Creating lists
Bulleted lists might be familiar to you if you have worked with word processing or 
desktop publishing applications. Lists are a helpful way to present information to a reader 
without the formal constraints of a paragraph. They are especially important on the 
Web. Studies indicate that people typically skim web pages instead of reading them from 
beginning to end. Creating lists will make it easier for your visitors to get the most from 
your website without sifting through several paragraphs of text.
1 
On the events.html page, click and drag to highlight the four lines below Spring 
Events.

77
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Creating lists
2 
Make sure you have the HTML button selected in the Property Inspector at the 
bottom of your page, and click the Unordered List button. The highlighted text 
becomes indented, and a bullet point is placed at the beginning of each line.
Use the Unordered List button in the Property Inspector to create a bulleted list.
3 
Click the Ordered List button to the right of the Unordered List button. The bullets
change to sequential numbers.
4 
Choose Format > List > Properties to open the List Properties dialog box. Choose 
Bulleted List from the List type drop-down menu to return to your fi rst style of list.
The Numbered List and Bulleted List options in the List type drop-down menu also
allow you to switch between ordered and unordered lists.
5 
From the Style drop-down menu, choose Square. This changes the default circular 
bullets to square bullets. Click OK to exit the List Properties dialog box.
Change the bullet style to square in the List Properties dialog box.
You might have noticed that the four lines of text in your list have lost their style. 
They are slightly larger than your paragraphs and they are black, not dark gray. This
is because a style has been defi ned for paragraphs, but not an unordered list. You will
now create a new CSS rule for the appearance of all unordered lists in the document. 
After you defi ne the properties, all text formatted as an unordered list will appear the
same.
6 
With all four lines still highlighted, click 
 in the Sources menu of the CSS 
Designer panel.

3
Using the Text Insert panel
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
78
7 
Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors menu to create a new CSS style for the 
ul element.
8 
In this case, Dreamweaver has recognized that you have selected text in an unordered 
list within the body tag of your page so it prefi lls the text box with body ul li; ul is 
the tag for unordered list. Replace this text by typing ul to create a selector for our 
unordered list. Then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
9 
Locate the font-size property in the Properties pane of the CSS Designer panel and
click medium to the right of the property label. Select px from the menu and enter the 
number 14 in the text box that appears. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to apply the change. 
Now you need to change the color of the unordered list to match the color of your 
paragraph.
10 Locate the color property in the Properties pane of the CSS Designer panel and click 
the Set Color button to the right of the label color. When the Swatches panel appears,
locate the same dark gray swatch, hexadecimal color #666. Click the swatch to apply
the color. 
11 Choose File > Save. Leave this fi le open for the next part of this lesson.
Using the Text Insert panel
There are a number of ways to format text in Dreamweaver. One method you haven’t
explored yet is the Text Insert panel. Because most of the options available in the Text
Insert panel are also available in the Property Inspector, you might fi nd it more convenient 
to use the Property Inspector for common tasks. However, you should be aware of the 
Characters menu located in the Text Insert panel. One of the most common items in the 
Characters menu used on the Web is the copyright symbol, ©. You will now insert a 
copyright notifi cation at the bottom of your Events page.
1 
Click to the left of the sentence This page was created with Adobe Dreamweaver and type
r
2013 and then add a space.
2 
Click before the text 2013 to insert your cursor.

79
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Using the Text Insert panel
3 
Click the menu at the top of the Insert panel on the right side of your page and choose
Common. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the resulting list and choose Copyright
from the Character menu to insert the Copyright symbol to the beginning of the line.
The copyright symbol can be inserted from
the Insert menu.
4 
Highlight the last two lines on your page, beginning with the newly inserted 
copyright symbol and ending with Dreamweaver classes. You are going to set these 
two lines apart from the rest of the page by italicizing them. Layout considerations 
such as headers and footers will be discussed throughout the following lessons in this 
book, but for now you can use the Property Inspector to italicize these two lines.
5 
Click the Italic button in the Property Inspector to apply an inline italic style to
your text.
Additionally, you could have selected the text and chosen Insert > HTML > Text Objects to 
accomplish the same thing.
6 
Choose File > Save.

Inserting images
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
80
Inserting images
Images are an essential part of most web pages. Just as lists make content friendlier and 
more accessible, images help to give your visitors the rich, visual experience that they’ve 
come to expect on the Web. However, before you learn to insert images, you will briefl y
learn about web graphics.
Image resolution
While it is possible to resize images with Dreamweaver, it’s generally not a good idea.
Specifying the width and height of an image in the Property Inspector changes the 
display size of the image, but it does not resample the image the way a graphic processing 
application like Photoshop does. For example, a JPEG image that is 150 pixels by 150 
pixels might have a fi le size of 30k. You could resize this image in Dreamweaver by 50% 
and the result would be a thumbnail image displayed at 75 pixels by 75 pixels. However, 
even though the image is visually smaller, the fi le size remains the same. A visitor to your 
website still must download the 30k fi le which translates to slower loading time for the
image (and possibly the page) and a potentially poor user experience, especially if they
have low bandwidth.
Image formats
The three most common image formats on the Web are JPEG, GIF, and PNG. While an
exhaustive description of how each of these formats compresses data is beyond the scope of 
this book, a general overview can help you avoid some common pitfalls.
The JPEG format was created by a committee named the Joint Photographic Experts Group.
Its sole purpose is to compress photographic images. Specifi cally, it uses lossy compression, 
which means that it selectively discards information, to reduce the size of a fi le. When you
save a JPEG, you decide how much information you are willing to sacrifi ce by selecting a 
quality level. A high-quality image preserves more information and results in a larger fi le 
size. A low-quality image discards more information, but produces a smaller fi le size. The
goal is to reduce fi le size as much as possible without creating distortion and artifacts.
Because JPEGs were designed to handle photographic images, they can signifi cantly 
reduce the size of images containing gradients and soft edges, without producing 
noticeable degradation. However, reproducing sharp edges and solid areas of color often 
requires a higher quality setting.
The GIF format was created by CompuServe. GIF is an acronym for Graphics Interchange
Format. Unlike the JPEG format, GIFs do not use lossy compression. Instead, GIFs rely 
on a maximum of 256 colors to reduce the size of images. This means that images with
a limited number of colors can be reproduced without degradation. Logos, illustrations,
and line drawings are well-suited to this format. Unlike JPEGs, GIFs excel at reproducing 
sharp edges and solid areas of color. However, because photographic elements such as 
gradients and soft edges require a large number of colors to appear convincing, GIF images 
containing these elements look choppy and posterized. 

3
81
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Inserting images
The PNG format has become increasingly popular on the Web in recent years because 
it incorporates many of the best features of JPEGs and GIFs. The PNG format is closer 
to GIFs in that it off ers lossless compression and comes in two categories: 8 bit and 24 
bit. This means it can be used quite eff ectively for simple graphics as well as continuous 
tone photographic images. A PNG also off ers better transparency features than a GIF,
most signifi cantly the support of alpha channels. For many years the adoption of PNGs 
(especially the use of the transparency) was held back because Internet Explorer 6 ignored 
the transparency. As the number of people using this browser continues to decline, the
PNG format is being used more frequently. For more information on web graphics see the 
Web Design with HTML and CSS Digital Classroom book, which is available in both print 
and electronic formats.
Creating a simple gallery page
Now that you have a better understanding of the types of images that are appropriate for 
use on your website, it’s time to build the products.html page that you linked to earlier in
this lesson.
1 
Double-click products.html in the Files panel or click the tab, as it’s still open. Place 
your cursor after the word Produce and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to create a new line.
2 
Choose Insert > Image > Image. The Select Image Source dialog box appears. If your 
site folder does not open automatically, click the Site Root button, and then double-
click the images folder. Select beets.jpg and click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
3 
In the Property Inspector, locate the Alt fi eld and type Beets in the text box. Press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
In previous versions of Dreamweaver, the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box would 
open upon inserting an image. Dreamweaver CC instead inserts an empty value for the Alt 
attribute of the 
tag. Including a description of the inserted image recommended by the 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) published by the W3C. For more information 
on the WCAG, visit http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/. It provides information about 
/
the images to visually impaired visitors using screen readers. Also, Alt text is displayed in place of 
images on some handheld devices, and browsers where images are disabled.

Click the Split button in the Document toolbar to view the code that was written
by Dreamweaver when you inserted beets.jpg. An
tag was created, with four 
attributes. The src attribute is a relative link to the .jpg fi le in your images folder. The 
alt attribute is the alternate text string created in the last step. The width and height 
attributes are simply the width and height of the image, which have automatically 
been added by Dreamweaver. Click the Design button to return to this view.
Dreamweaver creates an

Double-click the images folder in the Files panel to reveal its contents. In the 
document window, click to the right of the beets image and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS) to create a new line. Click and drag cucumbers.jpg from your 
Files panel directly below the beets image in the Design view. 
6 
In the Properties panel, locate the Alt fi eld and type Cucumbers in the text box.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
7 
Click to the right of the cucumber image to place your cursor, and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create a new line. To add the last image, you’ll use
the Insert panel on the right side of your page. Click the menu at the top of the Insert 
panel and choose Common from the list. Click the Images:Image option, and the
Select Image Source dialog box appears.
Choose Image from the Images drop-down menu
in the Common section of the Insert panel.

Linking images
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
84
Linking images
Often, gallery pages on the Web contain small thumbnail images that are linked to 
larger, high-resolution images. Like many web conventions, there are practical reasons for 
this format. Because all the images on a gallery page must be downloaded by visitors in 
order to view the page, small images are necessary to keep the page from taking too long 
to load. Additionally, a user’s screen isn’t large enough to accommodate multiple large
pictures at one time. Giving your visitor a way to preview which pictures they would like 
to see on a larger scale makes the page more user friendly and interactive.
1 
In products.html, click the image of the beets to select it. In the Property Inspector, 
type images/beets_large.jpg into the Link text fi eld. Press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS).
Manually typing in the link is one way to link to the image, but can introduce errors. 
Here is a second method using Dreamweaver’s Point to File feature.
2 
Click the image of the cucumbers to select it. In the Property Inspector, locate the
Point to File icon (
) next to the Link text fi eld. Click and drag this icon into the 
Files panel. An arrow with a target at the end follows your cursor. As you hover over 
items in the Files panel, they become highlighted. Release the mouse while hovering 
over the cucumbers_large.jpg fi le.
With the Point to File feature, you can click and drag to create a link.
3 
Select the image of the eggplants and use the Point to File icon to link it to
eggplants_large.jpg.
4 
Choose File > Save, and then File > Preview in Browser. Click the thumbnails to see 
the large versions of each image. You’ll have to use your browser’s back button to get 
back to the products page.

Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Editing images
Editing images
Although it’s best to make adjustments to your images using a professional graphics-
editing program like Adobe Photoshop, sometimes that’s not an option. Dreamweaver 
off ers a number of editing options, including an Edit link that allows you to quickly open 
a selected image in the graphics editor of your choice.
The Edit button can be customized in the File Types/Editors section of the Preferences dialog 
box, found under the Dreamweaver drop-down menu. You can use this section to add or subtract 
programs from the list of available editors, and set programs as the primary choice for handling 
specifi c fi le extensions.
Adjusting brightness and contrast
Now you’ll use Dreamweaver’s Brightness and Contrast button to lighten up the eggplants
image on your products page.
1 
Click the eggplants.jpg image in products.html to select it, then click the Brightness 
and Contrast button in the Property Inspector.
Select the Brightness and Contrast button in the Property Inspector.
A warning dialog box appears, indicating that you are about to make permanent
changes to the selected image. Click OK.
2 
When the Brightness/Contrast dialog box appears, drag the Brightness slider to 20 or 
type 20 in the text fi eld to the right of the slider.
3 
Drag the Contrast slider to 10 or type 10 in the text fi eld to the right of the slider.
4 
Click the Preview check box in the lower-right corner to see the original photo. Click
w
the Preview check box again to see the changes. Click OK.
While changing the brightness and contrast is very convenient in Dreamweaver, you should be 
sure you are not performing the corrections on the original, as these changes are destructive.

Optimizing images
In most cases, if you need to have fi ne control over the appearance of your graphics, you 
should open an image editor designed for that purpose. Both Dreamweaver and Photoshop 
are made by Adobe, and you’ll see some of the integration between the two in this exercise. 
However, sometimes you will just want to make a quick-and-easy change to a graphic. In 
this scenario, you can use the Edit Image Settings option in the Property Inspector.
You’ll use this feature to change the optimization of the belgianchocolate.jpg image, but
before you make any permanent changes, you’ll duplicate this image in the Files panel. It’s 
good practice to save copies of your image fi les before making permanent changes. Later, 
you’ll use this backup copy to undo your changes.
1 
In the Files panel, click the belgianchocolate.jpg fi le to select it. Drag it to your 
document window to place it beneath the other images inside your web page.
2 
Go back to the Files panel and click the belgianchocolate.jpg fi le to select it
again. From the Files panel menu (
), select Edit > Duplicate. A new fi le named
belgianchocolate - Copy.jpg appears in the list of fi les inside the images folder.
3 
Click on the belgianchocolate.jpg image in the document window to make sure it 
is selected, then click the Edit Image Settings button (
) in the Property Inspector 
at the bottom of your page. The Image Optimization window appears. This window 
allows you to either choose from a number of compression presets, or to create your 
own. Currently, the format is set to JPEG because Dreamweaver recognizes the type 
of fi le you have selected. Notice in the bottom-left corner that the fi le size is listed; in
this case, 31k. Pay attention to this number as it plays a role in the rest of this exercise.
The Image Optimization window appears when you click
the Edit Image Settings button.
4 
Click the preset menu and choose GIF for Background Images. The optimization
settings appear. Click the Color menu and choose 4. The image of the chocolate
changes to a preview of these settings, and the image has become fl at with most of the 
detail removed. Notice that the fi le size has changed to 3K.
This tells you that you would achieve a tremendous reduction in fi le size, but it would
occur at the expense of image quality. In fact, the GIF fi le format is not generally
suited for photographic images. You will now try a custom setting.

3
87
Lesson 3, Adding Text and Images
Editing images
5 
Click the Format menu and choose JPEG from the list. You now have a slider for 
quality, the default value is 80 and you can see the fi le size has changed to 9K. Drag 
the slider to the left to a quality of 10 and notice that the image quality changes
instantly. Again, this is too drastic a trade-off . Drag the quality slider to 90. The 
image looks slightly better than it did at a quality of 80, and you have a fi le size of 
around 14K (which is approximately 50% of the original image).
Click OK to commit the change. Note that this method of optimization is risky if you 
do not have a backup. (Recall the backup created in step 1.)
6 
You can also choose to do your optimization in Photoshop. Click the cucumbers
image, and then in the Property Inspector, click the Photoshop icon if available. Note 
that you must have Photoshop installed for this icon to be visible. As noted earlier,
you can always change the photo editor that Dreamweaver uses by opening Edit > 
Preferences > File Types/Editors (PC) or Dreamweaver > Preferences > File Types/
Editors (Mac), and then changing the application associated with images.
Click the Photoshop icon to launch Photoshop.
7 
The image will open in Photoshop, and then you can make any changes you want, as 
well as use the more in-depth controls of the Save for Web feature. We will not walk 
through that process now, so you can close this image and return to Dreamweaver.
Updating images
Assuming you have a backup copy of an image, it is possible to swap one image for 
another. To swap out the image, you’ll simply change the Src attribute using the Property
Inspector. But fi rst, it’s a good idea to rename the duplicate image.

Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• An introduction to 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
• Using the CSS Designer 
panel
• Creating tag and class 
styles
• Styling text and hyperlinks
• Creating external style 
sheets
Lesson 4
Many years ago, creating a beautiful web page required a lot of work, 
using the limited capabilities of HTML tags. The introduction of 
Cascading Style Sheets changes the way pages are created, giving 
designers an extraordinary amount of control over text and page 
formatting, as well as the ability to freely position content anywhere 
on a page. In this lesson, you’ll focus on the fundamentals of 
working with CSS in Dreamweaver. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace.
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw04lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See

What are Cascading Style Sheets?
In the last lesson you had a brief introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS); now you
will dive in a bit deeper. CSS is a simple language that works alongside HTML to apply 
formatting to content in web pages, such as text, images, tables, and form elements. 
Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), CSS creates rules, or style 
instructions, that elements on your page follow. There are three locations for CSS: (1) An
internal style sheet where the styles are located directly within the 
 section of an 
HTML document, (2) inline styles (the CSS is located side by side with your HTML tags), 
or (3) An external style sheet where styles are located in an external fi le that can be linked 
to any number of HTML pages. If you completed Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images,” 
you have had experience with the fi rst option.
A style sheet is a collection of CSS rules; typically, rules that belong to a specifi c project,
theme, or section are grouped together, but you can group rules in any way you want. You
can place styles directly within your page using the 
tag or in an external .css fi le
that is linked to your document with the
tag. A single page or set of pages can use 
several style sheets at once.
You can apply CSS rules selectively to any number of elements on a page, or use them 
to modify the appearance of an existing HTML tag. Each CSS rule is composed of one
or more declarations. A declaration contains both a property and a value. Examples of 
properties include color, width, and font size. Examples of values for these properties are 
green, 450px, and 12px, respectively. Dreamweaver’s CSS Styles panel lets you easily view
and modify any of these properties and values and change the appearance of your page in 
real time.
This sample rule is composed of three declarations that control the color, typeface, and
size of any text to which it’s applied. In the simplest example, the CSS rules defi ne the 
appearance of an H1 or heading element:

Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
Here is the result of the preceding code snippet applied to text:
CSS-styled text shown in the Design view.
CSS rules can aff ect properties as simple as typeface, size, and color, or as complex as 
positioning and visibility. Dreamweaver uses CSS as the primary method of styling page 
text and elements, and its detailed CSS Styles panel makes it possible to create and manage 
styles at any point during a project.
CSS replaces inefficient HTML styling
Before CSS came along, you styled text on a page using the 
 tag in HTML; you 
could wrap this tag around any paragraph, phrase, or tidbit of text to apply color, or to set 
the font size and typeface. Although it was reliable, it was also very ineffi  cient. Imagine a 
page with 10 paragraphs. Using the
tag, you would have to add the 
 tag 
10 times, even if the color, size, and typeface values were exactly the same. Although the 
 tag is not in use as much anymore, you should still understand how it works. You 
will now open an HTML document in which the list is styled using the 
 tag.
1 
In your Files panel located in the lower-right corner of your screen, locate and double-
click the HTML fi le named FontTagList.html to open it in the document window. 
2 
Click the Code view button in the Document toolbar at the top of the document 
window. Notice that the
tag is used to style the items in the bulleted list.
Here, a
 tag is used to format each bullet point. If you add more bullet points, you’ll need to use more 
 tags to keep the style of those bullets consistent with the others.
As you can see, there’s a lot of repetition in this code.

3 
Click the Design view button on the Document toolbar. Position your cursor at the end
of the last bulleted item, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to add a new bullet 
point, and type Peppers. You see that the text reverts to the default typeface, size, and 
color. You would have to add a new 
 tag with the same attributes as the others to 
get it to match. If you wanted to change an attribute such as the color for all the bullet 
points, you would have to adjust each tag separately. In early versions of Dreamweaver, 
there were actually ways to perform global changes using HTML; however, these were
sometimes tricky to control, and CSS off ers a better solution in any case.
You could lose the formatting between bullet points when using 
 tags.

The benefits of CSS styling
CSS introduces a new level of control and fl exibility far beyond the
 tags in 
HTML. A signifi cant benefi t of CSS is the ability to apply consistent formatting of 
elements across one or all pages in a website. In the following exercises you will learn a 
few diff erent ways to create CSS rules that aff ect the style of your text. The fi rst method
you will explore involves creating tag- or element-based style rules. If you completed
Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images,” you saw this method used to format text. This type 
of rule alters the appearance of an existing HTML tag, so the tag and any content that 
appears within it always appears formatted in a specifi c way. Instead of having to add a 
 tag around the contents of each new bullet point in a list, it would be easier for 
you to set a rule that states that items in a list should always be blue, for example. 
1 
Locate and double-click the fi le named CSSList.html from the Files panel to open it.
2 
Click the Design view button in the Document toolbar if necessary. The list that 
appears onscreen, unlike the one you saw in the previous example, is formatted 
without the use of 
tags, and uses only CSS.
3 
Position your cursor after the last bulleted item and press the Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) key to create a new bullet point. Type Peppers. The new text
matches the bullet points above it. 
4 
Press Enter/Return again to add a fi fth bullet point, and type Okra.
No matter how many bullet points you add, the formatting is applied automatically
every time.

5 
Select Split view at the top of the document window so that you can see both code 
and design:
CSS allows you to defi ne a style rule for a list item. All list items on this page will be blue.
What you’ll notice is the absence of any formatting tags like the 
tags you saw 
in the last exercise. In this example, you have several list items; however, all the styling 
information, such as the font-family, size, font style, and color, is being defi ned in one 
place: the CSS rule for the
tag. 
6 
If necessary, scroll to the top of the page and you’ll see the code that makes this possible:
In the code above, a CSS selector (seen here as
) is being used to defi ne the style of 
all list items. It’s almost like a dress code for all
 tags; they know that when they 
are used on the page, they must look a certain way. Best of all, if you need to modify 
their appearance, you make your changes to that single style rule at the top of the 
page. You will get a chance to do this shortly; however, let’s take a step back and look
at how CSS is controlled in Dreamweaver.

How do you create CSS rules in Dreamweaver?
In this exercise, you will take a tour of Dreamweaver’s CSS controls. If you haven’t 
worked with CSS before, this is a chance to learn a bit more about how it works. If you
have worked with CSS previously, this section will help you understand the Dreamweaver 
interface and how it applies to familiar concepts. Regardless of your comfort level with
CSS, you won’t be making any changes, merely getting familiar with features that you
will be using in later exercises.
You work with CSS rules in a few ways in Dreamweaver:
Using the CSS Designer panel
Dreamweaver CC introduces CSS Designer panel, a new interface to create rules and/
or style sheets that you can place directly within one or more pages in your site. You 
can easily modify rules directly from the CSS Designer panel. Furthermore, you can 
selectively apply rules from several places, including the Style or Class menu on the 
Property Inspector, or the tag selector at the bottom of the document window.
You can switch from the new CSS Designer panel to the Classic CSS Styles panel at any point 
by clicking the Panel Menu in the CSS Designer and choosing > Switch to Classic CSS Styles
panel from the drop-down.
The CSS Designer panel contains four panes labeled Sources, Media, Selectors and 
Properties. You’ll get a chance to explore these shortly. In the following fi gure, the panel 
with the Selectors and Properties panes is expanded.

Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
To ensure that you are seeing the same panels we are, you’ll reset your workspace. Choose 
Window > Workspace Layout > Designer. Then choose Workspace Layout > Reset
‘Designer’ to make sure the panels are reset.
After resetting your workspace, the CSS Designer panel should be expanded. Click the File
panel tab at the bottom of the screen to expand it.
1 
Double-click the StylePlaces.html document in your Files panel to open it, and click 
the Design View button, if necessary.
2 
Click in the fi rst line, Hi there! I’m styled with an INLINE style! and then choose 
!
 from the Selectors Pane of the CSS Designer Panel.
3 
Locate and click the Show Set check box in the Properties Navigation bar at the top of 
the Properties pane. Selecting this option enables you to see the CSS properties for the
current selection. Depending on your monitor resolution, you might not have enough 
room to see all the information in this panel. You can adjust the diff erent panel groups
by hand.
4 
Place your cursor at the top of the Properties pane in the CSS Designer panel. A black 
double-arrow cursor will appear. You can now click and drag downward to lengthen 
this pane.
You can expand a panel by clicking and dragging 
the edges.
Take a few moments to read through this panel and absorb the summary. Don’t worry 
too much about each detail; you’ll have plenty of time to familiarize yourself with this 
panel. It hopefully makes sense that the properties of the fi rst paragraph are the color 
blue, the font-family Arial, and the font size of 14 pixels.

5 
Click in the second paragraph and notice that the color property changes to red. 
Click in the third paragraph and notice that the color property changes to green. The
current selection always lists the properties of the selected text.
6 
Click the
 Selector in the Selectors Pane of the CSS Designer Panel, then
click the Show Set check box in the Properties Navigation bar to clear the check box 
Again, this will allow you to see all of the available CSS properties. You will toggle
between these two views often. Checking Show Set allows you to see the specifi c CSS 
properties and values of a selected object while clearing the check box allows you to 
see all of the possible styles you can set in your document.
In the Code view
CSS rules can also be created and modifi ed directly in the Code view. Editing CSS in 
Dreamweaver’s Code view off ers a great degree of control and is often called hand-coding.
Many coders and designers prefer hand-coding because of this control, but it’s not for 
everyone. For example, when you work in the Code view misspellings or an incomplete
knowledge of CSS syntax can easily break a page. 
1 
Click in the second paragraph if you are not currently inside it. Click the Code View 
button to view your page in Code view. If you haven’t worked with code previously, 
see if you can locate the second paragraph of HTML. (It has the class named red.)
2 
On the left side of the screen, notice that the line numbers are running from top to 
bottom; when working with code, each line has its own number, making it easy to 
refer to and locate objects.

On line 10, select the value red in the color property and then delete it. Now type 
d
#CE1A30. As soon as you start typing, Dreamweaver’s code-hinting appears, giving 
you a color picker. Code-hinting is a form of assistance from Dreamweaver that can 
make the task of typing code by hand a little easier. However, you can also ignore it,
and you should for this exercise.

Click the Design view button. The text is still red; however it is using a hexadecimal 
color instead of a keyword. The danger of adding CSS properties manually is that if 
you mistype the value, you might get a diff erent color or no color at all.

Working with the Code Navigator
The Code Navigator allows you to view the CSS properties directly in the Design view 
through a small pop-up window. Additionally, it allows you to click a property and edit it
directly in the Split view.
1 
Press Alt (Windows) or Command+Option (Mac OS) and click the third paragraph.
A small window appears, listing the properties of the CSS rule applying to this
paragraph. The window lists the name of the style sheet, as well as the rule 
.
2 
Place your cursor over the 
class, and the properties appear in a yellow 
pop-up window. This feature allows you to quickly view the properties without
needing to move to the CSS Styles panel or go into Code view.
The Code Navigator displays the CSS rules applied to a paragraph.
Understanding Style Sheets
The term Cascading in Cascading Style Sheets alludes to the fact that styles can live in
three diff erent places, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses. You’ve actually 
been working with all three types of styles in the last exercise. The fi rst paragraph is being 
defi ned with an inline style, the second with an internal style sheet, and the third with an 
external style sheet. 
Inline styles 
An inline style is a set of CSS properties defi ned directly in an HTML tag using the 
style attribute. These are slightly less common because you can’t reuse them easily, and
reusability is one of the major benefi ts of CSS. Nevertheless, inline styles are a part of the 
CSS language, and you should know what they are.
1 
In the fi le StylePlaces.html, click three times rapidly to select the fi rst paragraph.
2 
Click the Split view button, and notice that your selected text is nested inside a 
paragraph or 
 element; however, the CSS style rules for color, font-family, and 
font-size are contained directly inside the opening paragraph tag. This is called an 
inline style because the CSS rules are not separated from the HTML.
Although inline styles are part of CSS, they are used infrequently. They present many 
of the same problems as the older 
tags in HTML. They only apply to one
tag at a time and are not easily reusable. Inline styles are useful when an internal or 
external style sheet might not be available; a good example of this is HTML-based

Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
e-mail. They are also used in certain situations to override other styles, but you will 
learn more about this later.
An inline style places rules within a HTML opening tag.
Internal versus external style sheets
Internal style sheets are CSS rules that are contained directly within a document, using the
tag. The entire style sheet is contained within the opening and closing 
tags. External style sheets are style rules saved in a separate document with the extension 
css. One of the fundamental diff erences between internal and external style sheets is that 
with internal style sheets, the CSS rules apply only to the HTML in a single document.
For example, if you had a ten-page website and could only use internal style sheets, you
would essentially have ten style sheets: one per page. If you made a change on one page
and then needed to make the other pages look the same, you would have to either copy or 
redefi ne internal styles from page to page—not an enjoyable prospect.
External style sheets, by contrast, have CSS rules located in one single document. You 
can attach .css fi les, or external style sheets, to an unlimited number of HTML pages.
This method is extremely fl exible: if a style rule such as the font-color for a paragraph 
is changed in the external style sheet, all paragraphs in the site are instantly modifi ed, 
whether it be two pages, ten pages or 100 pages.
In Dreamweaver, when you create a new style, the default behavior is to use an internal
style sheet. In many ways, a web browser doesn’t care which type of style sheet you use; it 
renders the page exactly the same. There are certain situations when an internal style sheet
makes more sense than an external style sheet and vice-versa. You will explore this in
more detail in later exercises, but fi rst you need to know how to determine whether a style 
is internal or external.
1 
Open StylePlaces.html if you do not already have it open and click the Design 
View button to enter the Design view. In the CSS Designer panel, click the 
Sources panel heading. In this panel you will see a listing for 
and one for 
. The fi rst line is the internal style sheet, and the second is for 
the external style sheet. The internal style sheet also is visible in the Related Files 
portion of the document toobar.
2 
Click the 
 tag in the Sources pane. The rule for properties set in the class .red
will be displayed in the Properties pane below. Next, click 
in the Sources pane to show the properties for the class 
. You might 
have noticed that the listing for the inline style is not here; only rules for internal and 
external style sheets are visible in the Sources pane.

4
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
100
In the last exercise, you used the Code Navigator to view the CSS rules applied to a 
paragraph. You can also use the Code Navigator to quickly determine where the CSS 
rules are located.
3 
Back in Design view, Alt+click (Windows) or Command+Option+click (Mac OS)
inside the second paragraph to open the Code Navigator. The window reads
StylePlaces.html and the class 
is indented below it. If a style is located inside an
HTML document, as it is in this case, it must be an internal style.
The Code Navigator has located the origin of this CSS rule to be in StylePlaces.html.
4 
Place your cursor over the 
class, once again, all the properties appear.
5 
Click the
rule, and Dreamweaver’s Split view opens, sending you directly to the 
internal style. An experienced hand-coder might use this to directly edit the rule as 
you did earlier, although you will not be making any changes at this point. Now you 
will look at the external style sheet again using the Code Navigator.
6 
Alt+click (Windows) or Command+Option+click (Mac OS) in the third paragraph to 
open the Code Navigator.
7 
This time, the Code Navigator window lists StylePlacesCSS.css fi rst. If a style is
located inside a .css document, as it is in this case, it is an external style. Place your 
cursor over the 
 class, and all the properties appear.

4
101
Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
8 
Click the
 class, and in the Split view, the external style sheet
StylePlacesCSS.css appears. Doing this actually opens the external style sheet, which is 
a separate document. 
An External Style Sheet is a separate document with the extension .css and is accessible through the Related Files bar.
To return to the original HTML document, click the Source Code button 
immediately to the left of the button labeled StylePlacesCSS.css.
9 
Choose File > Save All. Close this document for now. Choosing Save All saves not just 
l
the HTML document, but the external stylesheet at the same time.
Understanding why they’re called Cascading
You have learned how CSS integrates with HTML, and that there are three categories 
of styles: inline, internal, and external. Additionally, you have seen that an HTML
document, such as the one from the last exercise, can contain all three types. Now you’ll 
begin to explore when you might use one type over the other. A good way to look at this 
is to ask the question: Which one of the three style types is most dominant?
To help you picture this, consider the following situation: you have a paragraph, or 
more accurately, a 
tag in your document, and you have the three style types (inline, 
internal, and external). Each one targets the 
 tag with the same property (color, for 
example) but they all have diff erent values. So which one wins? The answer is the inline 
style, which is the most dominant because it is closest to the HTML source. The strength
of competing styles is largely related to where the style is in relation to the HTML source. 
For internal and external styles, if they have competing rules, whichever style comes last 
within the HTML is the strongest. So in the following scenario, imagine that there is
a paragraph style in the external style sheet (styles.css) declaring paragraphs to be blue. 
Because it comes after the internal style sheet’s rule for red paragraphs, the external style
r
sheet wins and the paragraph is blue.

4
Creating and modifying styles 
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
102
However it is equally possible that the author of the HTML has arranged the styles in a
diff erent order:
Here, the paragraphs will be red because the internal style sheet comes last in the HTML
code. There is no default order of styles in the documents that Dreamweaver creates, so 
you do need to be aware of this rule.
We have simplifi ed the relationship for now. The strength of internal styles versus external styles 
can actually change depending on where the references to these styles are in the HTML. If the 
reference to the internal style sheet appears last in the HTML, these rules would be strongest. If 
the reference to the external style appears last in the HTML, then these would be the strongest.
Creating and modifying styles 
You will now get a chance to begin working more deeply with CSS. In this exercise,
you’ll be picking up where you left off  in the last lesson with the events page for the 
OrganicUtopia website. In that lesson, you covered the creation of new CSS rules;
however, you essentially worked with just one category of CSS rules, the element or tag-
based rules. In all instances from the last lesson, you defi ned the properties for a tag, such 
as 
,
, and
(unordered lists). You will now explore how to create classes and 
IDs. First, a brief review of the styles you used in the last lesson for tag styles.
A tag style assigns rules directly to a specifi c HTML tag to alter its appearance. You can 
attach tag styles to any tag from the
 tag down; as a matter of fact, when you
modify page properties (Modify > Page Properties) to change default text formatting and
background color, you are using a tag style assigned to the
 tag.

4
103
Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
The most basic tag styles are very straightforward. For instance, when you create a rule
defi nition for the 
(paragraph) tag, all paragraphs appear the same. The limitations
begin when you want to customize one specifi c paragraph to appear diff erent from the
others. You will explore some solutions to this dilemma; for now, keep in mind that tag 
styles are a great way to ensure consistency across multiple elements and pages where 
specifi c tags are used, such as lists, tables, and paragraphs.
1 
Double-click the events.html fi le in the Files panel to open it. This page has already 
had its Heading 1, paragraph, and list styled. You will now style the Heading 2.
2 
In the Design view, click inside the heading Spring Events. This is already formatted as 
a Heading 2 for you.
3 
Click the
 item under Sources pane in the CSS Designer panel. This will 
activate the Selectors pane and allow us to create a new style rule for the Heading.
4 
Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors menu to create a new CSS style for 
our h2 heading element. Notice that Dreamweaver recognized that your cursor was
within an h2 element within the body so it added body h2 to the text box in the 
Selector pane. In this case you will simply use h2 as our selector.
5  Select body h2 and type h2 to create a selector for Heading 2 headers then press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
6 
Make sure the Show set checkbox is unchecked to allow you to view all of the 
available styles.
7 
Click the Text button in the Properties menu to limit the choices to only show the 
text-related properties.
8 
Locate the font-size property and choose pt from the list of items.
9 
Dreamweaver will place your cursor within a text box to the left of pt. Type 18 and 
then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
10 Locate the color property from the selection list. Click the color swatch to choose a
color for your text from the Swatches panel that appears. Select a green color. The
color 
, located in the top row, is used in this example.

4
Creating and modifying styles 
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
104
Your heading now changes to green. You have just styled the font-size and color of 
the 
 tag. At this point, all text formatted as h2 appears this way. You will now
format the last heading in the page in order to see this.
The CSS Designer panel shows the current, or 
computed, values of the actively selected element.
11 Click inside the text, Rent our facility.
12 In the Property Inspector, make sure that you are viewing the HTML mode by
clicking the HTML button and note that the Format for this text is currently set to
None. From the Format drop-down menu, choose Heading 2 to see your text change.
Formatting text as a Heading 2 assumes the properties of 
the CSS rule.

105
Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
What you have seen in this exercise is an example of HTML and CSS working 
together with a tag style. In this case, all text tagged in the HTML as a Heading 2 or 
is defi ned by the CSS rule as green and 18 pixels. At this point, you might want
to create more complex layouts; if you understand the fundamentals of styling tags, it 
will pay off  as you move to the next level of CSS.
13 Choose File > Save but keep this fi le open. You will be working on it in the next exercise.
Creating a class style with the CSS Designer panel
In the last exercise, you created a new CSS rule by defi ning the properties of the 
 tag. 
Now you will create another CSS rule, this time using a class. In CSS, class styles have 
unique names and are not associated with any specifi c HTML tag. A CSS class can have a
specifi c style that can be applied to one or more elements in your website. So you might
create a class called
, for example, and the properties of this class might 
be a single rule defi ning the font-color. Once the class is created, this text could then be 
applied to a table, paragraph, heading, or form element simultaneously. So on Halloween,
if you change the property of the font-color to orange, all text that is defi ned by the 
class is orange, and on Valentine’s Day, if you change the property of the 
font-color to red, it all changes to red.
In this exercise, you will create a class for the copyright text at the bottom of the page in
order to distinguish it from the rest of the page.
1 
Locate the paragraph at the bottom of your page, click immediately before the 
copyright symbol, and then drag across until the two lines are selected.

Look at the Properties pane in the CSS Designer panel and note that this text has a size
of 14 pixels and a dark grey color. This is because these are paragraphs and the CSS 
rules for paragraphs in this document currently have these properties. You will now 
format all this text with a diff erent size and font, and then add a background color.
The CSS Designer panel displays the computed 
or current value of the selected text.
Because CSS is so flexible, you often have many options for styling. You could update
the paragraph rule that already exists or you could create a new rule using a specific 
class or id. For now, we will create our rule using a class which we will only apply to
the copyright paragraph.
3 
Click the
 item under Sources pane in the CSS Designer panel. This will 
activate the Selectors pane and allow us to create a new style rule for our paragraph
within the current document.
4 
Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors pane to create a new CSS style for our 
class. This will create a new text box in the Selectors list where you can add a new 
class name. Because you have selected a paragraph within the body, Dreamweaver has 
pre-fi lled the text box with 
. Select and delete this text so that you can 
create a class selector in the next step.
5 
Class selectors begin with a period (.) and include a descriptive name to describe how
the class will be applied. Type .copyright in the text box in the Selectors list then
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
6 
Click the Text button in the Properties menu to limit the choices to only show the 
text-related properties.

7 
Locate the font-size property and choose px from the list of units. Dreamweaver will 
place your cursor in the text box to the left of the unit to allow you to enter the value.
8 
Type 10 and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
9 
Now that you have created the rule for the
 class, you still have to apply 
it to our text selection. Make sure the text is selected or your cursor is within the 
paragraph and click the drop-down arrow for Class in the Property Inspector.
10 Choose copyright from the menu to apply our new class to this paragraph. You may
want to click once within the paragraph to deselect the text. You should now see
that the last paragraph of text is formatted using the 10pt font size specifi ed in the 
copyright class CSS rule.
The Property Inspector Class fi eld and Tag Selector show that the copyright class has been applied to the selected paragraph.
11 Click once in the fi rst line of the copyright text. Click the CSS button in the Property
Inspector to see the CSS styles and properties. Notice in the Property Inspector, in the
Targeted Rule section, the menu is now set for 
. This is important, as it 
confi rms that you are modifying the class, not creating a new rule or modifying the 
paragraph tag style. In the Property Inspector, choose “Gill Sans”, “Gill Sans MT”, 
“Myriad Pro”, “DejaVu Sans Condensed”, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif from the Font 
menu to add this property to the copyright class. Now you’ll add a new line of text
and apply the copyright class to it.
12 Place your cursor at the end of the last line of the paragraph and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to add a new line. Type the following text:
All images on this website are the copyright of Glenn “The Hodge” 
Hodgkinson. Notice that the text is still using the copyright style. If you wanted to 
remove this class for any reason, you could click the Targeted Rule drop-down menu 
and choose Remove Class.

Creating and modifying styles
To take advantage of the full power of CSS, you will begin to dive further into the new 
CSS Designer panel. In this exercise, you’ll explore some of the powerful options that CSS 
has at its disposal. The fi rst thing you’ll do is change the background color of your page by 
adding a new style to the body tag.
Before you get started, click the Workspace button and select Expanded from the menu. 
This will show the CSS Designer panel in an expanded mode with the Sources, Media and 
Selectors panes on the left side and the Properties pane on the right. This Expanded view 
will make it easier for you to select and modify the style rules in the following exercises.
If you want to go back to the narrower version of the CSS Designer panel, you can choose
Window > Workspace Layout > Compact from the menu.
The expanded mode of the CSS Designer panel makes it easier to select and 
modify style rules.

1 
Place your cursor at the end of the last line of text in your document window.
2 
Click the
 item under Sources pane in the CSS Designer panel. This will 
activate the Selectors pane and allow us to create a new style rule to change the 
background color of the page.
3 
Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors menu to create a new CSS style for 
our body tag. This will create a new text box in the Selectors list. Dreamweaver will
prepopulate this fi eld based on where you clicked in your document.
4 
If Dreamweaver prepopulated this fi eld with text, delete this text and type body in
this fi eld instead. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create the selector for 
our body element.
5 
Click the Background button in the Navigation Bar of the Properties menu to limit
the choices to background-related properties.
6 
Locate the background-color property and click the set color fi eld to the right of the 
color swatch to enter a color for your background,
7 
Type in the following hexadecimal number: #E0F0E4 and press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) to apply the color change. You will now change the background 
color for the copyright class at the bottom of the page.
8 
In the list of Selectors in the CSS Designer panel, click the .copyright class to enable 
editing of these properties. You might have to click
 in the Sources menu to
see the copyright class selector.

The CSS Designer panel displays the background properties for the copyright class rule. 
10 Click the Background Category, click the Background-color swatch, and choose white 
(#FFF) from the list. The two copyright paragraphs at the bottom of the page are styled
with white backgrounds. The gap between the two paragraphs reveals the background 
color because these are separate paragraphs, and are both block elements. The gap is 
somewhat visually unappealing and is something you will be fi xing a bit later in the
lesson.

Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
Advanced text formatting with CSS
Text on the Web is necessarily limited due to the fact that designers cannot assume that 
fonts they choose in Dreamweaver will be available to the user. There is a small set of fonts 
that designers can use that are essentially guaranteed to be on all users’ systems. Given this
limitation, you can use some of the properties in CSS to give your text a distinctive look.
In this exercise, you will work with the line spacing of your paragraphs and lists, and the 
letter spacing of your headings.
The limitations on web fonts are slowly changing, and in Dreamweaver CC, there is now a new 
feature that makes it easier to use web fonts and allows you access to a wider range of font choices. 
For now, it is still important to learn the basics. We cover the new web fonts feature in Lesson 8,
“Using Web Fonts.”
1 
Click p in the Selectors list so you can edit the paragraph properties. You might have
to click the 
item under the Sources pane in the CSS Designer panel fi rst.
You will now override the default line-height for your paragraphs. If you have a 
print background, you might be familiar with leading, which is the amount of space
between the lines in a paragraph. Line-height is the same thing as leading.
2 
Click the Text button in the Navigation Bar of the Properties menu to limit the
choices to only show the text-related properties.
3 
Locate the line-height property and click the text normal in the Set line-height fi eld
l
to bring up the units menu. Select px from the menu for pixels then type 20 and
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) and you will see the space between your 
paragraph lines increase. Extra line-height can often make your text more readable, 
so it is great that you have this option in CSS. However, a problem might arise if you
change the font-size. For example, setting the fi xed value of 20 pixels looks good with 
14-pixel type, but what if you were to later change the font-size of your paragraph? 
The 20-pixel line-height would look strange. A more fl exible way to assign line-
height is to use a percentage.

4
Creating and modifying styles 
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
112
4 
Click the px value to the right of line-height and choose percent (%). Change the value
from 20 to 120, and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). You won’t actually 
see a dramatic diff erence because the end result is similar, but by assigning the line-
height to 120 percent, your initial font-size isn’t as important. There will always be the 
height of the line plus 20 percent extra, no matter what the font-size is. Click OK.
Changing the line-height value of a paragraph to a percentage is more fl exible 
than using pixels.
Notice that the list under Spring Events did not change. This is because the line-height
property applies solely to paragraphs, not lists. If you want to make this list appear the
same, you could always apply the same value of line-height. However, you will be 
adding extra space between the lines to make the list stand out from the rest of the page.
5 
Click the ul selector in the Selectors pane. You might have to click 
in the
Sources pane to show all the selectors.

4
113
Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
6 
You will notice the ul element’s line-height is set to 120%. In the fi eld for line-height,
click the value 120% and change it by typing 150, then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS). You now have extra space between your list items. Next, you’ll
style your Heading 2 element.
7 
Click the h2 selector in the Selectors list and locate text-transform in the list of text
properties. You might have to click the Text button on the Properties menu. Click the
Uppercase icon to set the text for your h2 headings to display in Uppercase and you 
will see your two headings Spring Events and Rent Our Facility! transform to uppercase.
!
This helps your headings stand out and is faster than retyping these headings by hand. 
Now you’ll add some space between all the letters.
Transforming your text to uppercase is just a style; in the HTML, your original text still has
the standard formatting. One of the few times this might be an issue is if your web page is being 
viewed without a style sheet; older cell phones and PDAs with web browsers do not fully support 
style sheets (or use them at all), and so your text would appear lowercase as it is in the HTML.
8 
Locate the letter-spacing property just below the text-transform property. In the text 
fi eld to the right of letter-spacing, click the word normal and choose px from the drop-
l
down menu. In the text box to the left type 5, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac 
OS), and the two headings are extended. Each letter pair now has 5 pixels of space 
between them. When used correctly, letter-spacing can make your headings more 
readable and unique.
Adding letter-spacing and uppercasing to your headings can make them stand out.

Fine-tuning page appearance with contextual and pseudo-class selectors
CSS allows you to create styles that are targeted at specifi c HTML elements on your page.
Understanding these techniques is crucial if you want to gain control over the appearance 
of your page. Look at the Spring Events list on your page: lines 1 and 4 both begin with 
the word Free. Let’s say you wanted to emphasize this word to attract your user’s attention. 
You could simply bold the word, but what if you not only wanted to bold it, but change
the color as well? It would be possible to create a class to do this, but there is another 
option that has some useful benefi ts called contextual selectors. 
Dreamweaver actually refers to contextual selectors, which is the offi  cial CSS term for 
them, as compound selectors. Despite the terminology, they are very powerful and important
to understand.
Contextual selectors apply formatting to tags and classes when they appear in a specifi c 
combination. For instance, you often have separate rules for the
 (paragraph) and
(bold) tag, but what if you want a rule for 
 tags that are used inside 
 tags? Contextual selectors can handle this; for instance, you can designate that any
text inside a
 tag must be red, unless it is used within a
 tag, in which case 
it should be blue. This breathes new life into your tag styles by multiplying the number of 
times you can use them in conjunction with each other.
1 
In the fi rst line of the Spring Events list, select the word Free. Click the HTML 
button in the Property Inspector, then click the Bold button. (This actually creates 
a 
 tag in the HTML.) Using the example from above, let’s say that simply 
bolding this wasn’t enough and you wanted to add some color.
2 
Click
in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel and then click the Add 
Selector button in the Selectors menu to create a new CSS style for our selection. 
Dreamweaver will recognize that you have selected a list item within an unordered 
list in the body of your page and will pre-fi ll the selector fi eld with 
. Select and delete the word body from the fi eld leaving 
and 
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
3 
Click the Text button in the Properties Navigation Bar to show the text-related
properties.
This might look strange at fi rst, but it’s logical if you read it from left to right. The 
body tag is the ancestor, or parent, of the 
 tag, which is the parent of the 
 tag, 
which is the parent of the strong tag. In other words, your style will only apply to
strong tags, which are nested in a list item (which is nested in the unordered list, and 
so on).
The CSS Designer panel can be 
used to create contextual selectors, 
such as ul li strong.
4 
Click the color swatch to the right of the color property and choose the dark green
swatch in the top row, #003300. The text will immediately change color.
5 
Select the word Free in the fourth line and click the Bold button in the Property
e
Inspector. The word takes on the same appearance. Bolding anything in the list causes 
it to have the same appearance, while bolding anything outside of a list has the default 
eff ect.
Styling hyperlinks
You’re slowly beginning to pull together a page with a color theme to it, even if there is no
layout per se. A frequently asked question when people are learning to create web pages is
how to style the hyperlinks on a page. This can be accomplished with CSS, although there
are some precautions. Since the early days of CSS, the default style for unvisited hyperlinks
has been a bright blue with an underline and a purple color with an underline for visited 
hyperlinks. An argument can be made that users might be confused by hyperlinks that 
do not fi t this mold. On the other hand, many designers like being able to color their 
hyperlinks to match the rest of their page. Regardless of the debate, it’s important to
understand how to do this. 
Technically speaking, hyperlinks live in a category called a pseudo-class. A pseudo-class 
selector aff ects a part or state of a selected tag or class. A state often refers to an item’s 
appearance in response to something happening, such as the mouse pointer rolling over it. 
One of the most common pseudo-class selectors is applied to the
tag, which is used 
to create hyperlinks. You’ll now create a pseudo-class selector to aff ect the appearance of 
hyperlinks on the events.html page in diff erent states.

1 
Click the products link in the fi rst paragraph, and then click the Add Selector button 
in the Selectors pane to create a new CSS style for our selection. You might have 
to click
 in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel to enable the Add 
Selector button. 
Again, Dreamweaver will recognize that you have selected a hyperlink or anchor in 
the body of your page and pre-fi ll the text box in the Selectors list with body p a but
you will change this. 
2 
Type a: in the text box and notice that Dreamweaver presents you with a list of 
pseudo-class selectors including link, visited, hover, active and more. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to select the fi rst option, 
. The 
psuedo-class selector will aff ect the appearance of a hyperlink that hasn’t been visited.
3 
Click the Text button in the Properties Navigation Bar to show the text-related
properties.
Using a psuedo-class selector can 
alter the appearance of an element 
in a given state.
4 
Click the color swatch to the right of the color label and choose the green shade you 
used in the previous exercise. The product link in the fi rst paragraph, as well as the
two links at the bottom of the page are now green instead of blue. Now you’ll set the
style for hover links, or 
.
5 
Make sure that the products link in the fi rst paragraph is selected and choose
from the Sources pane in the CSS Designer panel. Click the Add Selector button in 
the Selectors pane and Dreamweaver will create a new text box in this pane. You
will add the next pseudo-class selector for the a:hover state of the products link. The
 state defi nes the color of a hyperlink when a user places their cursor over it.
6 
Once again remove any text Dreamweaver added, then type a: in the text box and 
notice that Dreamweaver presents you with the list of pseudo-class selectors. This time 
select
 and then click the Text button of the Properties Menu Bar to display 
the text-related properties.

Locate the text-decoration property and click the icon for none (an empty box with a 
line through it). This removes the underline from the hyperlink for the hover state only.
Set properties for a:hover, or the appearance of hyperlinks when the mouse 
pointer rolls over them.
You can preview the appearance of the hyperlinks by clicking the Live View button in 
the Application bar or opening your page in a browser.
9 
Choose File > Save; then choose File > Preview in Browser and choose a browser from 
the list to launch it. Place your cursor over the products link, but don’t click it. This
is the hover link. Click the products link to bring you to the products page, and then 
click back to the events page by clicking the Events link at the bottom of the page. The
products link is now purple because the browser understands you have visited it.
You will leave off  styling the
link for now. Setting the
property 
defi nes the way a link appears when it is being clicked on by a user. 
10 Close the web browser. Return to Dreamweaver and select Window > Workspace 
Layout > Compact to collapse the CSS Designer panel.
Div tags and CSS IDs
Your page is coming along nicely on the style front, as you have used quite a bit of CSS, 
but looking at your page, it’s fair to say that it is still lacking a cohesive style. All your 
various headings and paragraphs, as well as your list, are fl oating about on the page, and
with the exception of the copyright text at the bottom of the page, it’s diffi  cult at a single 
glance to get a sense of where one section ends and another begins. It’s time to add more 
structure to your page through the use of the 
tag and more control of your CSS 
with ID selectors.

4
Div tags and CSS IDs
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
118
Let’s look at the structure fi rst. It would be nice to gather the text on the bottom of your 
page, starting with the line, Occasionally we gather…, and then the two paragraphs below,
and put it all into a single section. You could then take this new section and style it
separately from the rest of the page. This is possible with the
 tag. In this exercise,
you will begin by creating a footer ID.
1 
Click and drag to select all the text from the line, Occasionally we gather…, down to the 
bottom of the page. You will be grouping these three paragraphs together.
2 
Just above the CSS Designer Panel, alongside the Files Panel, is the Insert tab. Click
this once to open the Insert panel. If the drop-down menu is not set to Common, 
select Common from the menu now. In the Common section, click Div and the Insert 
Div dialog box opens. In the Insert section, the default choice is Wrap around selection;
this is exactly what you want to do, so leave this option as is.
The Insert Div window allows you to create a section within your page.
A
tag by itself doesn’t do anything until some CSS properties are attached to 
it. In other words, unlike other HTML tags, which often have a default visual eff ect
in the browser (think of headings), the 
 tag has no eff ect on your rendered page 
unless you specifi cally instruct it to. You will now get to do this.
3 
In the fi eld labeled ID, type footer. Just like classes, IDs should have good, descriptive 
names to help identify them. You’ll now apply a background color of white to the 
entire block of text you selected. Notice that there is a fi eld for class as well. Classes
and IDs are very similar. The diff erence between them is that classes can be used
multiple times on diff erent elements on a page, whereas an ID can only be used once. 
In this case, an ID is appropriate because there is only one footer on this page.
4 
Click OK and Dreamweaver will insert 
tags around your selection which 
will be represented in the design view as a box surrounded by a dotted border. This 
representation will not be displayed in the browser or Live View and is only used to 
assist you in identifying divs within your page.
5 
Click the CSS Designer tab to the left of the Insert tab to bring the CSS Designer 
panel to the front then select 
in the Sources pane to tell Dreamweaver you
want to create a new embedded style.

4
119
Lesson 4, Styling Your Pages with CSS
Div tags and CSS IDs
6 
Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors pane to create a new CSS style for our 
selection. This will create a new text box in the Selectors list which will be populated 
with the value 
. 
You don’t need to change anything here; just confi rm that you are creating an ID with 
the name footer. The footer name is preceded by the pound sign (#). This is the main 
diff erence between ID names and class names. If this were a class named footer, it 
would be named 
. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create the
new selector.
7 
Select the Background icon from the Navigation Bar in the Properties pane, then click 
the swatch next to background-color and choose the pure white swatch (#FFFFFF). 
In Dreamweaver’s Design view, the box around the text now has a white background
unifying the footer text.
Set the Background-color to #FFFFFF in the 
Properties pane of the CSS Designer panel.
If you haven’t guessed by now, these are the fi rst steps toward page layout with CSS. A 
footer is a common element on most pages, and there are a few other obvious ones as
well: headers, sidebars, and navigation bars to name a few. You’ll begin working with 
these page structures more deeply in upcoming lessons, but fi rst you’ll need to have
some more control of the CSS rules that you’ve been working with this lesson.
Internal versus external style sheets
Now that you’ve seen how to modify a few items in a single page at once, you can imagine 
how powerful a style sheet shared by every page in your website can be. As noted earlier, 
when you create new CSS rules, you have the opportunity to defi ne them in the current 
document or in a new CSS fi le. A collection of rules stored in a separate .css fi le is referred
to as an external style sheet. You can attach external style sheets to any number of pages in a 
site so that they all share the same style rules.

4
Div tags and CSS IDs
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
120
So far, you’ve created internal, or embedded, styles. This means you wrote the style rules
directly into the page using the
 tag. Although you can format a page with an 
internal style sheet, this method is not very portable. To apply the same rules in another 
page, you have to copy and paste the internal style sheet from one page to another. This can
create inconsistency among pages if the same rule is updated in one page and not the other.
To utilize the true power of style sheets, you need to create an external style sheet that any
or all pages on your site can share. When you change an external style, pages linked to
that style sheet are updated. This is especially handy when working with sites containing 
many pages and sections.
You can create external style sheets in the following ways:
• Move rules from an internal style sheet into a new CSS fi le.
• Defi ne styles in a page in a new document using the Sources pane of the CSS Designer 
panel.
• Create a new CSS document from the Start page or File menu.
Now you will export internal styles from your events.html page into a separate CSS fi le
so that other pages can share them.
1 
First, you need to create a new CSS fi le. Click the plus icon in the Sources pane and 
choose Create a New CSS File.
2 
The Create a New CSS File dialog box appears. Click the Browse button and navigate 
to your dw04lessons folder. Type mystyles.css in the File/URL fi eld and click Save.
You can leave the Add as value set to Link to link your new CSS fi le to the current 
document and click OK.
3 
The new CSS fi le is now listed beneath the 
source for the internal style sheet 
in the Sources pane. You are now ready to move your rules.
4 
With the events.html document open, expand the Selectors pane shown in the CSS 
Designer panel so that you can see all the rules you have created. If you have limited
screenspace, double-click the Insert panel to collapse it. Also remember you can 
expand a pane by clicking the bottom edge and dragging down.

5 
Choose
 from the Sources pane in the CSS Designer panel, then click the
fi rst rule at the top of the panel and scroll down if necessary to locate the last rule. 
Shift+click the last rule in the panel so that all the rules in the list are selected. Click
and drag the selected rules to mystyles.css in the Sources pane. Release your mouse 
button as your cursor hovers over the fi le name.
Select all rules in your style sheet and then click and 
drag them to mystyles.css in the Sources pane.
6 
Look inside your Selectors pane and note that the styles you had selected are no longer 
listed. Click mystyles.css in the Sources pane and you will see that the new style sheet 
now includes all of your rules. The internal style sheet (shown as
) is still in
your docum, but it contains no rules.
Attaching an external style sheet to your page
Dreamweaver automatically made the new external style sheet available to the current
page by attaching it. However, you will have to link this style sheet to other pages in your 
site to use it. You can accomplish this with the Attach Existing CSS File command in the 
Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel.
1 
Double-click the products.html fi le from the Files panel. This page is a version of 
the products page you created in Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images.” You will now 
link your new style sheet to this page.
2 
Click the Add CSS Source in the Sources pane and choose Attach Existing CSS File 
from the menu. The Attach Existing CSS File dialog box appears.

Next to File/URL, click the Browse button to locate a style sheet to attach. In the 
dw04lessons folder, select the mystyles.css fi le from the Select Style Sheet dialog box 
and click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS). Click OK to close the Attach Existing 
CSS File dialog box.
Adding an external style sheet.
The page refreshes with the styles defi ned in the external style sheet. You can also see
that the CSS Design panel shows that mystyles.css and all its rules are now available for 
use and editing.
Modifying attached style sheets
Because an attached style sheet appears in your CSS Designer panel, you can modify any
of its rules and the changes will apply across other pages that share that style sheet. You’ll
be another step closer to layout now by modifying the body property in order to add some 
margins to your page.
1 
Click mystyles.css in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel to display the 
selectors and properties set in the external fi le.
2 
Click the body selector in the Selectors pane to display the properties for the body tag. 
You might need to click the Show Set check box in the Properties Navigation bar to 
clear the checkmark and show all of the available properties.

Click the Layout icon in the Properties Navigation Bar and scroll down to the margin

properties. The link button in the center of the margin control is used to set the four 
margin settings to the same values. You can set the individual margins by clicking the
areas representing the top, bottom, left and right margins. 
The margin control allows you to set margins 
using a visual interface.
Because CSS is based on a box model, it treats every element as a container. Because 
the 
tag is the largest container, if you modify its margins, it aff ects all the
content on the page. You’ll specifi cally be changing the left and right margins to
create a more centered layout.

Click the unit px in right side of the margin control to set the right margin. Select %
from the units menu, then type 15 in the value text box and press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) to set the margin.

Click the unit px in the left side of the margin control to set the left margin. Select % 
from the units menu, then type 15 in the value text box and press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) to set the margin.
Change the left and right margin for body to 
15 percent.
After both margins are set, your content should now sit in the middle of the page.

Choose File > Save All, and then preview your page in the browser. You are able to
navigate between the products page and the events page using the hyperlinks in each 
document. Shorten the width of your browser, and notice that the content adjusts
accordingly. There will always be 15 percent space to the left of content in the browser 
window and 15 percent to the right, thereby centering your content. Open the 
events.html fi le in your web browser to see how this page’s appearance is now being 
controlled by the external style sheet. When done, close the browser.
Creating a new .css file (external style sheet)
Although it’s easy to move styles to a new .css fi le, you can also create styles in a new .css
fi le from the beginning. The CSS Designer panel gives you this option by clicking the 
Add CSS Source button in the Sources pane. By creating styles in an external .css fi le, you
can avoid the extra step of exporting them later and make the style sheet available to other 
pages immediately. 
1 
In the Files panel, double-click the event1.html fi le. 
2 
From the CSS Designer panel menu, choose Create a New CSS File and the Create a 
New CSS File dialog box appears. Browse to your dw04lessons folder and name the 
new fi le morestyles.css. Keep the Add as: option set to Link and click OK to create
the fi le.

More details on CSS
Inheritance
When you nest one rule inside another, the nested rule inherits properties from the rule 
in which it’s contained. For instance, if you define a font-size and font-family for all 
tags, then it carries over to a class style used within the paragraph. This paragraph might not
specify values for either property. It automatically inherits the font-size and font-family from 
the
tag selector.
CSS rule weight
What happens if two classes of the same name exist in the same page? It is possible to have 
two identically named styles, either in the same style sheet or between internal and external 
style sheets used by the same page. Along the same lines, it is possible to have two rules that 
both apply to the same tag. If either of these cases exists, how do you know which rule is
followed?
You know which rule is followed based on two factors: weight and placement. If two 
selectors are the same weight (for instance, two tag selectors for the body tag), then the last
defined rule takes precedence. 
If a rule of the same name is defined in both an internal and external style sheet in your 
document, the rule from the last defined style sheet takes precedence. For instance, if an 
external style sheet is attached to the page anywhere after the internal style sheet, the rule in
the attached style sheet wins.

Self study
Create a new document and add some unique content to it, such as text or images. 
Afterwards, use the Designer panel to defi ne at least one tag style, two class styles, and one 
contextual selector (advanced) in a new, external .css fi le. Create a second document and 
attach your new external style sheet to it, using the Attach Existing CSS File command 
from the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel. Add content to this page, and style
it using the style rules already available from your external style sheet. If desired, make
changes to the rules from either document, and watch how both documents are aff ected
by any modifi cations made to the external style sheet.

Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Understanding the CSS 
Box model
• Creating Divs and AP Divs
• Stacking and 
overlapping elements
• Styling box contents
• Using visual aids to fi ne-
tune positioning
Lesson 5
Now that you’ve used Cascading Style Sheets, you’ve seen how 
powerful they can be for styling a page. CSS is equally powerful as 
a layout tool, allowing you to freely position page content in ways 
not possible with HTML alone.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace.
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw05lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw05lessons folder. Go to
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
The CSS Box model
CSS positions elements within a page using the Box model, which refers to the fact that all
HTML elements have default boxes that you can choose to style. You can think of a box
as a container for text, images, media, tables, and other content. In most cases, the width
and height of a box is determined by the amount of content; however, you can also assign 
an explicit width and height to any box. Additionally, each box can have its own optional
padding, margin, and border settings (described in detail shortly). 
Toward the end of Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” you began to explore page 
structure through the use of the HTML
 element. The Box model in CSS applies
to all elements in HTML but is often paired with
 tags. The 
element, in
conjunction with CSS rules, can be freely positioned, formatted, and even told how to 
interact with other boxes adjacent to it. You can also stack and overlap
 containers, 
opening the door to fl exible and creative layouts that are not possible with HTML alone.
This lesson dives deeper into the many uses of the 
element. If you have jumped
directly to this lesson, it is highly recommended that you understand the basic concepts in 
Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” before starting this one.
If you’ve worked with layout applications such as InDesign, the idea of creating and positioning 
containers for page content should be very familiar to you. Boxes created with the 
 tag can 
be thought of as analogous to the text and image frames you create in InDesign.
The basics of CSS margins, padding, and borders
The Box model allows each element on a page to have unique margin, padding, and
border settings.

Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
The CSS Box model
Margins refer to the transparent area surrounding the box, which you set using the
margin group of CSS properties. Margins can play an essential role in creating distance
between a box and the content surrounding it (such as other boxes), or the boundaries of 
the page itself. You can set margins for all sides at once or uniquely for each side. 
Padding is the distance between the inside edge of the box and its contents. By setting 
padding, you create space between the box and any text, images, or other content that it
contains. You set padding using the padding group of CSS properties, and, like margins,
you can set padding for all four sides of a box at once or for each side individually.
The border of a box is transparent by default, but you can add width, color, and a border 
style for decoration or defi nition around boxes. Borders sit directly between margins and 
padding, and defi ne the actual boundaries of the box. You set borders using the border 
group of CSS properties and, like margins and padding, you can defi ne borders for all four 
sides at once or for each side individually.
You can incorporate each property into any style rule and attach it to a box, similar to the 
way you’ve attached classes to paragraphs and tables in previous lessons.
Reviewing the 
element
As mentioned earlier, when exploring and creating page layouts with CSS, you will
frequently encounter and use the 
element. The
 element creates areas or 
divisions within an HTML document; you can place page content such as text and images
directly within sets of 
tags. Dreamweaver enables you to create CSS-driven page 
layouts using the Insert > Div menu item and Insert Div button in the Insert panel; both 
of these features use 
tags to create areas of layout in similar ways.
Reviewing the ID selector
In Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” you learned about the diff erent selector 
types in CSS: classes, tags, pseudo-class selectors, and IDs. In this lesson, IDs take center 
stage and become an essential part of working with CSS boxes and positioning. An ID is a 
special selector type created for a unique element using the same name within a page, and 
it’s meant for one-time use only. ID rules appear within a style sheet and are preceded by a 
pound sign ( ), in contrast to classes, which are preceded by a period character ( ).
Because IDs can be used only once per page, they are ideal for setting properties that need 
to be specifi c to a single element, such as positioning information. In other words, page 
elements such as headers or columns occupy a specifi c position on the page, such as top, 
right, left, and so on. When creating layouts using the 
element, you need to create 
or assign an ID for each box created.

5
The CSS Box model

Because the 
 element has no display attributes, it is given its properties by either an
ID or a class, or both. Think of an ID as a set of instructions that give a
its unique 
appearance and behavior (as DNA does to a human being). An ID rule is matched to a 
using the tag’s ID attribute.
The Code view shows the style sheet and 
tag that create the container.

Creating a centered container for your page
Creating a centered container for your page
The goal of this lesson is to create the home page for the Organic Utopia site. This page 
will look like the thumbnail below.
The completed layout you will be creating in this lesson.
The home page will be a diff erent design and layout than the rest of the site (this layout 
is covered in more detail in Lesson 6, “Advanced Page Layout.”), and you will start by 
creating a container that will end up nesting the other sections of your page such as the
header, sidebar and other elements. This container will have a fi xed width of 840 pixels 
and also be centered within the browser window. 
This container will use a combination of relative positioning and automatic margins to
achieve the centering eff ect. Relative positioning allows you to position this box relative
to the body of the page, and the automatic margins will force the fi xed-width container to 
stay centered regardless of the browser window’s width.

In the Files panel, navigate to the dw05lessons folder and double-click the
layout.html fi le to open it. This document has been partially prepared for you, with 
a background color and a page title added. Additionally, the default font, font color, 
and font size have been defi ned as Lucida Sans, grey, and small, respectively. Your fi rst 
step will be to add a box, which will become your main column of text.

You’ll explore using margins in more depth, but by setting a margin value of auto 
to the left and right side of the container, you are instructing the browser to put
equal amounts of space on the right and left sides. The end result will be a box that is 
centered within the browser window.

11 Choose File > Save, then choose File > Preview in Browser. Your container 
will be centered in the middle of your browser window and Dreamweaver’s
default placeholder text is aligned in the top left of your container. (Occasionally, 
Dreamweaver does not add this placeholder text; if this is the case for you, return 
to Dreamweaver, click within the container, and then type Content for id 
“container” Goes Here.)
With position set to relative and auto margins, the container element will always be centered.
Resize the browser width; the container stays centered until the window is narrower 
than 840 pixels, at which point the box is cropped. Close your browser.

Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Creating a centered container for your page
Absolute versus relative positioning
Absolute positioning: An element that is set to absolute strictly follows the positioning 
values given to it, relative only to its containing element. The containing element can be 
another div or the page itself. Absolutely positioned elements are pulled out of the normal
fl ow of HTML content, and regardless of what surrounds them (for example, text content 
or neighboring divs), they always appear at the exact coordinates assigned to them.
Here is an example of a div absolutely positioned within another div. The larger div
(Box #1) is the containing element, and so any positioning values assigned to Box #2 are 
relative to the element boundaries of Box #1.
Box #2 is contained, or nested, within Box #1.
Adding additional content to the containing box (#1) has no eff ect on the nested div. It 
remains positioned outside the fl ow of HTML.
Box #2 remains in position even with added 
content in Box #1.

5
Creating a centered container for your page
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
136
Relative positioning: A relatively positioned element accepts values for position 
properties such as top and left, but it also takes the normal fl ow of neighboring HTML
content into account. Here are boxes and values shown in the preceding two fi gures; the 
only diff erence here is that the position property for Box #2 has been set to relative instead
of absolute.
Box #2 is still off set, just as before, but 
it’s being displaced by the content before it.
Although it appears that the top and left values have changed, they haven’t. Unlike 
absolutely positioned elements, relatively positioned elements stay within the normal fl ow of 
HTML content, which means that they can be displaced by the elements (in this case, the 
text) surrounding them. In this example, Box #2 is still 50 pixels from the top and 50 pixels
from the left, but its point of reference is the end of the preceding text content, not Box #1.
Positioning items relatively is useful when you want an item to fl ow with the items surrounding 
it. The following image shows fi ve divs nested inside a larger div to create a menu.
All menu items are positioned relative 
to one another, and so they fall into 
place based on each other’s position.

5
137
Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Creating a header using a relative positioned div
The same example is shown in the fi gure below, with the position set to absolute for all 
menu items. The result is a collapse of the menu—all the menu items are trying to occupy
the same place at the same time, without regard for their neighbors.
When set to absolute, the menu items stack
on top of one another, because they all 
must be at the same place, regardless of the 
elements that surround them.
The fi les used for these examples are located in the dw05lessons folder, and are named 
absolute_relative.html and relative_menu.html. Open them in Dreamweaver and 
explore the code to further your knowledge.
Any element, or, in this case, any box, can have the position property applied, and one 
of fi ve possible values can be set: absolute, fi xed, relative, static, or inherit. The two
most commonly used are absolute and relative, and although both can accept positioning 
properties such as top and left; they are rendered diff erently, even with identical 
positioning values.
Creating a header using a relative positioned div
We now have a container that is centered within your page. Next we’ll add the other 
layout elements, starting with the header. We will use the Insert panel to insert a div as
you previously did with the container div. Once a div is added, you can set the location 
and style it with CSS (change the width and height, add background color and more). You 
can also add content such as text or images.

Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Positioning content with absolute-positioned divs
You now have a header section within your page that is positioned relative to the container 
created earlier. The header will always appear at the top and aligned to the left side of the 
container because of the position values specifi ed in your CSS rules.
Positioning content with absolute-positioned divs
Now that you have a header at the top of the page, you’ll need to add boxes to hold 
content within the container. To accomplish this you will use absolute-positioned divs. An 
absolute-positioned div is placed exactly where you want it using the top, left, bottom and 
right properties.
For this exercise, you’ll want your divs to be positioned using the container as their point
of reference. 
Adding an introduction section to your page
Now you can add additional sections to your page. The fi rst section you’ll add is a box 
below the header where you’ll format an introductory paragraph to state the mission of the 
site, and grab the user’s attention.
1 
In the Insert panel, click the Div button. When the Insert Div dialog box appears, 
choose After tag in the Insert menu and select 
. Click in the ID 
text fi eld and type intro, then click OK.
2 
Choose 
in the Sources panel. Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors
menu to create a new selector for the introduction. Dreamweaver will populate the 
selector fi eld with
; change this so the selector name is #intro and 
then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
3 
Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation Bar to show the layout
properties and scroll down to the
 property.
4 
Click 
to the right of the property text label, then choose absolute from the 
menu. Set the 
 value in the position control to 100px to move the div down below
x
the header div. Notice that the div now has a box around it with a handle in the top left 
corner.
The newly created absolute positioned div has a handle in its top-left corner.

Click the selection handle in the top-left corner of the new div and click and drag the 
box around the screen to see how you can position the box manually. Notice in the 
Property Inspector that the properties for your box are displaying and dynamically 
changing as you move it; currently just the Left and Top position (L and T) will 
change. Your settings will likely be diff erent than those in the fi gure.
6 
Click the resize handle in the bottom-right corner of the intro div and resize it so that
it is roughly half the width of the header div and twice the height. Don’t worry about 
the exact size of the box for now.
7 
Click inside the intro box and type the following text: Organic Utopia is a 
community owned and operated supermarket and marketplace. Anyone 
may shop in our stores but members enjoy special discounts and other 
benefi ts. 
The 
 div with added text.
Now you’ll format the text in this box using techniques from the last lesson.
8 
In the Property Inspector, click the HTML button if necessary. Select and highlight 
the text you entered and choose Paragraph from the Format drop-down menu.
9 
Select 
in the Sources panel of the CSS Designer panel. Click the Add 
Selector button in the Selectors menu to create a new selector for the intro div 
paragraph. Dreamweaver will populate the selector fi eld with 
; change this text so the selector name is simply #intro p and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS).
10 Click the Text button ( ) in the Properties Navigation Bar and then click default font to

Positioning content with absolute-positioned divs
11 Locate the 
property, click medium to the right of the label and choose large.
Set the paragraph text inside the intro box to Cambria and large.
Depending on how large you made your intro box, you will likely need to adjust the 
width and height of the box.
12 Click the edge of the intro box to activate it and then click any of the anchor points 
on the box to adjust the width and height. We used a width of 720px and a height of 
130px. Click anywhere on the background of the page to deselect the intro div. 
Another way to set the height and width values is by using the Layout properties in the 
Properties pane of the CSS Designer panel.
Adding images to your layout
Before you add the remaining sections of your page, you’ll add images to both the header 
and container sections of the page. First, you’ll add a background image of vegetables to 
the right side of your header.
1 
In the CSS Designer panel choose
in the Sources pane and click the 
selector in the Selectors pane. Click the Background button in the Properties Navigation
pane to bring up background-related properties. In addition to the background color, you
can also add CSS background images.
2 
In the
 section, click the label Enter fi le path to the right of url,
then click the Browse button ( ). In the select Image Source dialog box, navigate to 
the images folder within the dw05lessons folder and select veggies.jpg. Click OK 
(Windows) or Open (Mac OS) and you will see the image tiled across the header. (If 
you see a Missing Profi le message click OK.)
By default, background images in CSS have this tiled eff ect, so you will need to add 
additional properties in order to remove the tiling and position the image to the right.

From the 
 property click the no-repeat button ( ). From 
the 
property click the fi rst percent symbol % in the set
background position control and choose right from the menu. The image is now 
aligned to the right side of the header.
Background images can be added and positioned within a
 element.
A background image is controlled by CSS, and you can only have one background 
image per element. In order to have two images inside the header, we’ll add the
Organic Utopia logo as an inline element. This means the logo is being added to the 
HTML code, not the CSS. 
4 
Select the Organic Utopia placeholder text in the 
div and delete it. Then
choose Insert > Image > Image. In the Select Image Source dialog box, navigate
to the images folder in the dw05lessons folder and select ou_logo.gif. Click OK 
f
(Windows) or Open (Mac OS). 
5 
Type OrganicUtopia Logo into the alt text fi eld in the Property Inspector and press
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The image appears in the top-left corner of 
the header. 
You will position this image away from the sides of the header box later in the lesson. 
(If you receive a Missing Profi le message, click OK.)
When working with images, follow this rule of thumb: HTML inline images should be used for 
content; CSS background images should be used for decoration. One way to test this rule is to 
imagine the impact on the page if the image were not displayed. In the example above, the image 
of the vegetables is not essential, so the website would not be adversely aff ected if the image is not 
displayed; however, the logo is important, so it should be considered content, not decoration.

Positioning content with absolute-positioned divs
Photoshop integration
Often the images used in your web page need to be modifi ed in Photoshop before they 
integrate well with your design. Photoshop and Dreamweaver are integrated in a few 
ways. In this exercise, you will see how Dreamweaver can optimize .psd fi les when you
insert them into your page.
1 
In the CSS Designer panel, then click the 
 selector in the Selectors
pane. Click the background button in the Properties Navigation Menu and click to 
the right of the URL label for the 
 property. Click the Browse
button and navigate your dw05lessons folder, open the artwork folder. Choose the
veggie_background.psd fi le and click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS) The
Image Optimization dialog box appears.
This dialog box appears because you have chosen a .psd fi le to import and this is not 
a valid fi le format for the Web. Dreamweaver triggers the Image Optimization dialog 
box, which allows you to optimize the graphic and save it in a more appropriate format.
Importing a .psd fi le into Dreamweaver will trigger the 
Image Preview, allowing you to save as a web graphic.
2 
Click the Preset menu and choose JPEG high for Maximum Compatibility if it is not 
already selected. Slide the Quality slider to 1 and notice that the preview of the image
on your page becomes pixelated. Reducing the quality results in a smaller fi le size, but
going too low results in unacceptable loss of detail.
3 
Drag the Quality slider to 70, and notice that the quality improves dramatically. As 
with most compression, the goal is to fi nd a good balance between small fi le size and 
image quality.
4 
Click OK, and when the Save Web Image dialog box opens navigate to the images 
folder in the dw05lessons folder and double-click it. In the URL section, notice the 
path images/veggie_background.jpg. It’s important to understand that you are
saving a copy of the original PSD fi le as a JPEG in this step. Click Save and you now 
have a link to the new background image.
5 
Scroll down to the background-repeat property and click the no-repeat button (
 ).

Adding Main and Sidebar content areas
Now you’ll add two more sections to your page: a main column, which will feature the 
latest news from our fi ctional company Organic Utopia and a sidebar column, which
features incentives for visitors to become members.
1 
In the Insert panel, click the Div button. When the Insert Div dialog box appears,
click in the ID text fi eld and type main. Choose After tag from the Insert drop-down 
menu, then select <div id=“intro”> and click OK.
2 
Click the CSS Designer tab to bring up the CSS Designer panel and in the Sources 
pane click
. Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors menu to create a
new selector for our main content section. Dreamweaver will populate the selector 
fi eld with
; change this so the name is simply #name and press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
3 
Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation Bar to show the layout 
properties and scroll down to the Position property.
4 
Click static to the right of the property text label, then choose absolute from the menu.
c
The box appears with a blue border around it and a handle in the top left corner.
The width and height of an absolute position div can be change by clicking and dragging the resize handles.
Click the border and drag the div just below the intro div. Next, click and drag the 
handles to make the div roughly 450px wide by 200px high. Don’t try to get the exact 
dimensions, as it is very diffi  cult to be precise when resizing. You can always fi ne-tune 
the width and height in the Property Inspector.

Properties Navigation Bar. Click the 
 swatch and choose white 
from the color palette.
6 
We can also insert a div using the menu: Select Insert > Div to bring up the Insert Div 
dialog box. Choose After Tag and <div id=“main”> from the drop-down menus then 
type sidebar in the ID fi eld and click OK. 
7 
Click <style> in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, then click the Add 
Selector button in the Selectors menu. Dreamweaver will populate the selector fi eld
with 
; change this to #sidebar and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS).
8 
Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation bar and set the 
 to 240px
and the
 to 200px. Scroll down to
 and choose absolute from the
menu. Set the
 value to 515px and the 
to 260px.
9 
Click the Background button in the Properties Navigation Bar and choose white for 
the 
of this div as well.
You’ll now make sure the top edges of the two boxes are lined up.
10 Click the handle on the top-left of the main div and reposition it to the following left
and top values: L (Left) should be 35 and T (Top) should be 260.
Setting the Left and Top values of an absolute positioned div.
With the top values the same for both boxes, the top edges line up. Once the boxes are
lined up, you can always move them as a unit by selecting and dragging or nudging 
them.
11 Click the edge of the main div to select it and then Shift+click the sidebar. With both 
boxes selected, press your up arrow keys to move both boxes upward. There is no
right value here, use your judgment and push the two boxes closer to the intro text.

Adding additional content and styles
Up to this point, you’ve been working with the base structure of your layout. Now it’s 
time to add additional content in the form of text so that you can see how your layout 
works with real content, and make any necessary changes. 
1 
Select and delete the placeholder text Content for id “main” Goes here. Double-click the 
main_content.html fi le in the Files panel to open it. This is text that has already
been formatted; all that is necessary is to copy and paste it into your layout.
2 
Choose Edit > Select All and then choose Edit > Copy. Close the
main_content.html document. In the layout.html document, click inside the main
div and choose Edit > Paste. The content appears styled as Lucida Grande because 
there is a rule in the body defi ning the font-family; however, there are no CSS rules
yet for headings or paragraphs.
The results of copying and pasting the main_content.html page into your main div element.
You pasted more content than can fi t inside this box, which is why the text is fl owing 
outside the boundaries of the container. In fact, what you are seeing is one of the
disadvantages of using AP Divs. Defi ning the width and height of a box in pixels creates 
an infl exible container. One solution to this is simply to expand the size of the box.
3 
Click the bottom of the blue border for the div and then click the resize handle in
the middle of the border. While still pressing and holding the mouse button, drag the 
handle down slightly. The box will automatically expand to fi t the existing content.
Now you’ll add the content to the member benefi t section.

5
147
Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS

4 
Select and delete the placeholder text Content for id “sidebar” goes here. Double-click 
the memberbenefi ts_content.html fi le in the Files panel. Choose Edit > Select All
and then choose Edit > Copy. Close the memberbenefi ts_content.html document. In
the layout.html document, click inside the sidebar and choose Edit > Paste.
5 
Click the bottom of the
div and then click the resize handle in the middle
of the border. While still pressing and holding the mouse button, drag the handle
down slightly to expand the box to fi t the content.
Setting margins and borders
As you learned earlier, CSS uses the Box model for elements, and as such, each element can 
be given unique margins, padding, and borders, either for decorative or practical purposes.
Now that you have content inside your columns, it is clear that you need to do some fi ne-
tuning. Your text and logo are crowded against their respective div elements and you 
should make them more pleasing and readable. Technically, you can start anywhere, but in
this exercise, you’ll start at the top of your page and work down.
1 
Select the Organic Utopia logo in the header. In the CSS Designer panel, click 
 in the Sources pane then click the Add Selector button (+). Dreamweaver 
will add a new selector with the name
. Since the
rule gets more specifi c from left to right, ultimately you are targeting the 
tag located inside the header div, which is inside the container div; change this to
#header img and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
2 
Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation Menu and scroll down to the
margin control. In the Top text fi eld, type 20 and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). The logo is pushed down 20 pixels from the top of the header div, because 
there is now a 20-pixel margin applied to the top of the image.
3 
In the Left margin text fi eld, type 15 and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
Adding a 15-pixel left margin pushes the logo to the right. Now you’ll add similar 
margins in the main column.
4 
Click anywhere inside the heading Celebrating Vegetables in the main div. In the CSS 
Designer panel click
 in the Sources pane and click the Add Selector button
in the Selectors menu. Make sure the selector name reads
. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

In the Properties Navigation Bar click the Layout button and scroll down to the margin 
control. In the Left text fi eld, type 15 and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Applying a left margin of 15 to the main heading.
6 
Click inside the paragraph below the Celebrating Vegetables heading. In the CSS 
Designer panel click 
 in the Sources pane and click the Add Selector. Make
sure that
 is the selector name. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
7 
In the Properties Navigation bar, click the Layout button and scroll down to the 
margin control. In the 
 fi eld, type 15 and press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS). In the
 fi eld, type 15 and press Enter(Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS). You need to add both left and right padding because the text fi lls 
the main container from left to right.
Overriding default margins in CSS
If you are new to Dreamweaver and/or CSS, an important concept is that of default 
margins. Web browsers will apply default margins to most block elements unless there is a 
value overriding them. So paragraphs and headings, for example, will have space between 
them even if you haven’t set a value. You can see this space by using Dreamweaver’s 
Inspect feature.
1 
In your document window, click the Live button to cause the Live Code and Inspect 
buttons to appear. Click the Inspect button and then click Split to display a split 
window with Code view on the left and Design view on the right. Now you can 
hover over elements on your page and see the normally invisible margins.

5
149
Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Setting margins and borders
2 
Place your cursor over the Celebrating Vegetables heading. The yellow highlight 
shows the margins being applied to this element.
The Inspect feature in Dreamweaver CC highlights the margins of an element in yellow.
Hover over the paragraph below the heading and note there are margins being applied
here as well. In order to reduce the space, you will need to reduce the bottom margin
of the heading and the top margin of the paragraph.
3 
In the CSS Designer panel, click
 in the Sources pane, and then locate and 
click the 
style. Select the Layout button in the Properties pane and scroll
down to the margin control. Set the bottom margin value to 0px and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
4 
Place your cursor over the heading. Note that the bottom margin is gone (in other 
words, there is no yellow border). You now need to set the top margin of the
paragraph to 0 as well.
5 
In the CSS Designer panel, click the
style and select the Layout button from 
the Properties pane. Scroll down to the margin control and set the top margin value to 
0px and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Now all the paragraphs in the 
main column shift upward.

6 
Click the Live button to de-activate this mode, and then click the Design button to 
return to your default mode.
Because margins and padding are invisible, many designers resort to applying either background 
colors or borders to elements at the beginning of the layout process. This helps to understand the 
relationship between various sections on the page. The Inspect button in Dreamweaver partially
removes the need to do this, but you could still fi nd the original technique useful.
Adding borders to elements
The ability to add borders to elements is a great feature in CSS. Because of the CSS Box 
model, almost anything can be styled with borders: div elements, headings, lists and more. 
Additionally, the style, width and color of these borders can be set globally or for any
given side.
1 
In the CSS Designer panel, click
 in the Sources pane and click the 
selector in the Selectors pane. Next, click the Border button in the Properties 
Navigation Bar to begin setting these properties.
2 
Scroll down to 
, select none in the Set top border style control 
and choose solid from the menu. Scroll down to the
property, click none in the Set
 control and choose solid from 
the menu.
In the Style menu, note the other options available. Styles such as dotted and dashed 
are the most reliable styles. For various reasons the other options such as groove, ridge, 
etc. are not particularly well-supported in older browsers and you should use them 
sparingly.
3 
Locate the 
 property, click the Set top border width control 
and choose px from the menu. Note that you can also choose keywords here 
for thin, medium or thick. Select the 0 in the width value fi eld and type 2. 
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to apply the changes. Locate the 
 property and set it to 2px in the same manner.
4 
In the
 fi eld, click undefi ned and type
d
#063. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to apply the dark green border color. Repeat this step
to set the border-bottom-color to the same color.
The borders will be hard to see since the div is still selected.
5 
Choose File > Save All and preview the results by choosing File > Preview in Browser.
Take a moment to admire your layout. You’re almost done; however the last step is to 
future proof your page layout.
6  Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.

Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Setting margins and borders
Future proofing your layout
Absolutely positioning the elements of your page layout is very stable and reliable, but it 
also has some fundamental limitations. You have already seen what happens when there is
more content than can fi t inside a box: the box overfl ows resulting in unattractive content. 
You have also seen one solution, which is simply to expand the size of the box. Even this is
not an ideal solution. Content on the Web changes constantly; text is added and removed,
images are inserted and so on. The designer of the page might have little or no control
over this, especially if they are handing a website off  to a client who will eventually be 
updating and modifying the site.
To help strengthen your layout for future modifi cation, you can use a CSS property called
overfl ow. This will help you prevent the worst-case scenario of text that breaks your 
layout as it overfl ows its container. For this exercise, you’ll apply overfl ow to the Members
Benefi ts sidebar.
1 
Click the bottom edge of the sidebar and then drag the bottom of the box upward 
until half of the list items are overfl owing out of the box.
Text that is overfl owing over the sidebar.
2 
Click 
in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel and then click the 
 selector in the Selectors pane. Click the Add CSS Property button in the
Properties menu and type overfl ow in the text fi eld that opens in the Properties pane.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create the overfl ow property.

The pros and cons of Absolutely Positioned CSS layouts
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
152
3 
Dreamweaver will place your cursor in the text box to the right of the newly created
overfl ow property. Type auto and press Enter (Window) or Return (Mac OS) to set 
the 
value to
. This automatically adds scrollbars to any
 element 
that has more text than can fi t inside. You will see in Dreamweaver’s design view that 
the box has snapped to fi t the original height.
4 
Choose File > Save, then File > Preview in Browser. Your 
 div now has a
scrollbar. While it might not be an ideal solution if you do not like scrollbars, at least it
doesn’t break the layout. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
The pros and cons of Absolutely Positioned CSS layouts
You will now take a look at the limitations and weaknesses of the layout you have just 
created. Absolutely positioned layouts in Dreamweaver are the quickest and easiest way to
get a web page up and working, however, as noted earlier they are not the most fl exible.
In this exercise, we hope to point out some of the limitations of Absolutely Positioned 
layouts so that you can judge for yourself whether they fi t all your needs or whether 
you need to be looking at the next step of creating pages using more advanced layout 
techniques, which are covered in Lesson 6, “Advanced Page Layout.”
To illustrate this, you will take a look at your existing layout with the premise that
someone has asked you to make the entire container larger and also switch the position of 
the two columns on your page.
1 
In the CSS Designer panel, click
 in the Sources pane and choose the 
 selector from the Selectors pane. Click the Show Set check box in the
Properties Navigation bar to set the check box and show only those properties which 
have been set. Change the 
from 840 to 960. The container width expands but 
when adding this extra 120 pixels of space, your header and the other sections are no 
longer well-aligned.
Your background image is now also too narrow. This cannot be easily resolved in 
Dreamweaver. You would have to go back to Photoshop, resize the image, and export 
it again. For now, you’ll simply turn it off  temporarily.

5
153
Lesson 5, Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
The pros and cons of Absolutely Positioned CSS layouts
2 
In the CSS Designer panel, click the
selector, and click the Show 
Set button if necessary. Now scroll to the 
property. Click the 
Disable/Enable CSS Property button (  ) to the right of the panel to turn off  this image
for now.
Clicking the Disable/Enable CSS Property
button removes the style for the background image.
With the background image temporarily removed, it is easier to see the structure of 
your layout.
3 
Click the 
selector in the Selectors pane. If necessary, click 
 in the 
Sources pane to show all selectors. Set the width in the Properties pane to 1024px and
notice it is easy to break your layout. This is because absolutely positioned elements 
don’t interact with the other elements on the page; you need to manually adjust them.
4 
Change the 
of the header to 960px so that it matches the width of the 
container exactly. You’ll also notice that the background image of the vegetables 
remains fl ush right.
5 
Click the edge of the intro box and using your arrow keys, nudge it to the right until 
it is centered within the page.
Now you need to switch the position of the main and sidebar divs.
6 
Click the edge of the
 div and use your arrow keys to nudge it to the right.
Notice that it overlaps your sidebar. This is due to the behavior of absolutely
positioned elements allowing them to occupy the same space on the page.
The property that controls which element is highest in the stacking order is called the z-index.
Dreamweaver sets this property automatically when you create AP Divs. Elements with the 
higher z-index value will always win and be visible over elements with a lower z-index. You can
also modify z-index values if you choose to adjust this.

7 
Click the edge of the
div and using your arrow keys nudge to the left until it 
reaches the original position of the 
div. 
You might need to nudge the position of the two boxes until you are satisfi ed with 
their position. Additionally, feel free to adjust the width of the boxes if needed.
Switching the position of the two boxes requires you to move them manually.
Adjusting the width of the layout and the columns is not signifi cantly diffi  cult but it’s 
also not very effi  cient. Wouldn’t it be nice if expanding the width of the container 
automatically readjusted the columns within the new space? In fact, there are
techniques you can use to accomplish this. They are called fl oat-based layouts and you
will learn these techniques in the next lesson. For now, save and close the fi les.

Get some practice with layout by creating a new div named footer in layout.html. Bring in 
the content from the footer.html fi le provided in your assets folder. Style the footer using 
the techniques learned in this lesson.
Open the style for the sidebar and apply similar margins and borders to those that you 
applied for the main div.
Experiment with your layout by expanding the width of the container div, changing the 
background color and adding borders. You will be surprised at how small changes to these

Questions
1 
In what two ways can
 elements be automatically positioned for the purpose of 
layout in Dreamweaver?
2 
Why is it benefi cial to name each div on your page? What two ways can you use to
name your divs?
3 
What is the
property and why would you use it?
Answers
1 
Divs can be positioned relative to the rest of the content on the page or in an absolute 
location. Relative positioned divs maintain their fl ow within the document and are 
positioned with respect to the surrounding content. Absolute divs are removed from 
the fl ow of the document and remain where positioned regardless of the surrounding 
content.
2 
It is benefi cial to name your divs so that you can create style rules to apply to each 
named div. You can name your divs using IDs or classes. A div named using an ID 
can only appear once in the document while divs named using classes can occur in a 
document more than once.
3 
The
 property allows you to change the way a box appears if there is too 
much content. For example, an
 set to auto creates a scroll bar if there is 
more content than can fi t in the box.

The best web layouts account for variable content on a page. As text 
and images are added and/or removed, your layout can adapt. In 
this lesson, you will create from scratch a two-column CSS layout 
using the fl oat and clear properties in order to create an adaptable 
page layout.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this

See Lesson 6 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Layout with absolute-position divs versus layout with floats
In this lesson, you’ll learn an advanced method of layout in Dreamweaver using CSS boxes 
that are fl oated as columns. Unlike the infl exible nature of absolute-position divs, fl oated 
layouts can accommodate additional content more easily, and once you learn how to use 
them, they will allow you to use more creative layout options.
There are two methods of layout in Dreamweaver, and you will learn about both of them.
To understand this, it helps to keep in mind that historically Dreamweaver has been 
designed for use in the Design view (in other words, not working in code). As you will 
soon see, the CSS
 property that you will be using to create columns was not truly
designed to be a tool for layout, and requires a good understanding of CSS to be useful.
Floated layouts are trickier to control and understand than absolute-position divs.
Additionally, older web browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 have well-documented bugs 
and quirks that can prevent fl oated layouts from rendering correctly. To address these 
problems, coding techniques known as browser hacks have been developed over the years. 
The browser hacks involve adding additional code targeted toward one browser in order to 
make the pages look the same.
As users of Dreamweaver seek to duplicate some of the sophisticated sites they see online, 
they really have no choice but to work with fl oats. As you walk through this lesson, it is 
important to keep in mind that you do not necessarily have to choose between absolutely
positioned layouts and fl oated layouts. Layouts that combine both absolute-position divs 
and fl oated layouts are commonplace and combine the strengths of both.
In addition to the two layouts described above, Dreamweaver CC also has a third category 
of layouts: fl uid layouts. The fl uid layout feature represents the latest development in web 
design and development: creating web pages designed to adapt to screens of diff erent 
sizes. You will have the opportunity to work with this feature at the end of the lesson;
however, you should note that this form of layout is not for everyone, so understanding the
fundamentals of fl oat-based layouts is still the recommended path for most Dreamweaver 
users.
To start creating more sophisticated and fl exible layouts, you will fi rst need to have a good
understanding of the
 property.

Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Layout with absolute-position divs versus layout with fl oats
Creating a floated image
One of the reasons the 
 property in CSS was created was to allow for the appearance 
of text to wrap around an image. This concept was borrowed from print design, where 
the eff ect is standard practice and often called text wrap or runaround. In CSS, this eff ect 
is achieved by allowing elements following a fl oated element in the HTML markup to
surround the element, eff ectively changing position. This behavior also makes it possible to
create columns on a page, although this might not have been the original intent of the rule.
In this exercise, you will learn the basics of using the 
 property by applying it to an 
image in order to wrap text.
1 
From the dw06lessons site, open the fl oatimage.html page. You will see a page with
a large paragraph block of text. Click in the middle of the paragraph, immediately
before the sentence, We also have added recyclable shopping bags.
2 
Now choose Insert > Image > Image and in the Select Image Source dialog box, 
choose the image recycle_bag.gif from the images folder, and choose OK. While the
f
image is still selected, locate the Alt fi eld in the Properties panel and type shopping 
bag in the text box, then click anywhere in the Design view to apply the change. The 
image has width and height dimensions of 81 × 101 pixels and is inserted as a block
inside the paragraph.
An image with default styling placed inside a paragraph.
The amount of space between the two sentences is determined by the height of the
graphic. This is the default fl ow of HTML when an inline image is inserted into a 
paragraph.
You’ll now wrap the text around the image by applying the
 property to the 
shopping bag graphic.

4 
Click the Add Selector button (
) in the Selectors menu to create a new CSS selector 
and type .fl oatimage in the selector name text box, replacing any text Dreamweaver 
might have added. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create the selector.

Make sure the shopping bag graphic is still selected; if it is not, do so now. Look at the 
Property Inspector, there is a Class drop-down menu, which by default is set to None.
The default Class is set to None.
From the Class drop-down menu, choose fl oatimage. With the class applied, the
image will now be removed from the fl ow of the text and pushed far right, to the edge 
of the container.
Change the Class to fl oatimage.
7 
Choose
 from the Sources pane and then click the 
selector in
the Selectors pane.

Click the Layout button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar of the Properties pane
and change the 
property to left by clicking the Left button (
) from the fl oat 
options.
The image now fl oats to the left and the text wraps around it. This wrapping behavior 
is extremely important to keep in mind as you work with fl oated elements. You can 
fl oat elements to the left or right only.

Locate the margin control. Click the
 value and type 10, then click the 
value for 
 and again, type 10. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac 
OS). The image now is set off  from the text, adding needed space.
Set the Margin for the image.
10 Choose File > Save, and then File > Preview in Browser and choose a browser the
your list to see the results in your browser. This technique is a simple and useful 
application of the 
property. The next step is to apply this same concept to 
other elements, not just images. In the next exercise, you will fl oat elements to create 
columns. Close your browser and then close the fl oatimage.html document.

Creating columns with HTML and CSS
One of the most important aspects of working with fl oated elements is understanding 
how they interact with their surrounding elements. This relationship is easy to understand
when you have an object with a fi xed width and height such as the shopping bag graphic
from the last exercise. When fl oated elements are objects that are not fi xed in size, such as 
a column which is defi ned by the amount of text inside, things can get interesting.
Using HTML5 Semantic elements
HTML5 introduces new semantic elements allowing you to add more detail and information 
to the structure of your documents. These semantic elements replace the multitude of divs
that were previously used to divide your page into sections. Like divs, there is no set style
or presentation defined and how they are displayed is determined by the CSS style rules you 
create.
The new semantic elements used in this lesson include:
: The header element is used to indicate an area of your page as a heading, usually a
page or section header
: The nav element is used to indicate an area of your page that will serve as navigation or 
a menu area
: The section element is used to indicate an area of your page that contains content
: The aside element is used to indicate content that is related to but not included in the 
main content flow, typically used for sidebars and callouts
: The footer element is used to indicate a section of content as a footer, usually a page 
or section footer.
Creating the structure with divs and HTML5 semantic elements
To begin, you’ll start with a page similar to the Organic Utopia layout from Lesson 5, 
“Creating Page Layouts with CSS.” Specifi cally, the container div is 960 pixels wide and
styled to be centered within the browser. The header element has one inline image (the
Organic Utopia logo). You will fi rst defi ne the structure of the page by adding elements 
for the various sections.
1 
In the Files panel, double-click the layout.html page. Your fi rst step will be to add 
the navigation section. You will do so using the HTML5 nav semantic element.
2 
In the Insert panel, choose the Structure category, then click the Navigation
button (
) from the list of elements. The Insert Navigation dialog box opens. Here 
you can choose where you would like the new nav element to be inserted. You need 
the navigation element to follow the header element.

3 
In the Insert Navigation dialog box, click the Insert drop-down menu. Select
the After tag option, then in the drop-down menu to the right, choose 
Type navigation in the ID text fi eld, and then click OK.
Set the properties in the Insert Navigation dialog box.
4 
Click the CSS Designer tab to bring the CSS Designer panel to the front then select 
from the Sources pane. Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors pane 
and Dreamweaver will add a new selector to the list as
.
Select and delete the text
 so that the selector is simply #
, 
place your cursor after 
 and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
5 
Click the Background button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar. Locate the
 property and type #88b036 into the Set 
 text
fi eld and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to add a green background color. 
6 
Click the Layout button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar and locate the
property, then click the Set Width fi eld to display the units popup menu. Choose
% from the menu and type 100 in the Set width text fi eld. Click in the Set height 
text fi eld and choose px from the menu, then type 36 and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS). Your navigation section now spans across the width of the
container.
You’ll now add three elements for the main and sidebar columns, as well as the footer. 
These next three steps are essentially variations on step 3: you are adding structural 
elements to your page and giving the elements good names to begin styling them. 
7 
In the Insert Panel, scroll down and click the Section button (
). Click the Insert 
drop-down menu and choose the After Tag option, and then in the drop-down menu
to the right choose 
. Type main in the ID text fi eld and 
then click OK.
8 
Click the Aside button ( ) in the Insert panel. Click the Insert drop-down menu 
and choose the After Tag option, then in the drop-down menu to the right, choose
. Type sidebar in the ID text fi eld and then click OK. 
The last section you will add will be for the footer at the bottom of the page.

Click the Footer button ( ) in the Insert panel. Click the Insert drop-down menu.
Select the After Tag option, then in the drop-down menu to the right choose
. Type footer in the ID text fi eld and then click OK. 
10 You will now style these new elements using the CSS Designer panel. Select
from the Sources pane, then click the Add Selector button in the Selectors pane and
Dreamweaver will add a new selector to the list as
. Select and 
delete the text
 so that the selector is simply 
, place your cursor 
after 
 and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
You will be adding a 
 style now so you can more easily see how 
the footer interacts with the two columns.
11 Click the Add CSS Property button in the Properties pane, and then click the
Background properties button in the Properties Navigation bar. Locate the
property and type #CCC into the Set
text
fi eld and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to add a light gray background 
color. 
You now have the main sections of your page, and you will have to start setting the 
widths of the columns.
The main sections of your web page are now created.

6
165
Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating columns with HTML and CSS
Setting the width and floating the columns
With the basic structure of your page set up in HTML, you will now set the width of the
main and sidebar columns and fl oat them using CSS. You will return to the navigation bar 
in a later exercise.
1 
Click to place your cursor within the main section of your document window then
click
 in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel. Click the Add Selector 
button in the Selectors pane and type #main in the new selector fi eld, then press
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
2 
Choose the Layout button from the Properties Navigation menu. Double-click to
the right of the 
property, type 600px inside the Set-width text fi eld and press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Scroll down to the
 property; choose
right and you will see the main column move to the right and the sidebar column 
move up to fi ll in the remaining space. Now you’ll add some content to see how it fi ts 
into the column.
3 
In the Files panel, double-click the main_content.html page. Select all the text 
on this page, then press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac OS) to copy
it. Close the fi le, then select the placeholder text in the main element and press
Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste. The column expands to 
accommodate all the content. Notice that the footer appears to be behind the main 
column. This is a result of the fl oated properties you just added. You’ll take a look at 
this shortly, but fi rst you will style the sidebar.
4 
Click inside the sidebar, then in the CSS Designer panel, click
in the Sources 
pane and click the Add Selector button in the Selectors pane. Change the text so that
the selector name reads
and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
Choose the Layout button (
). Double-click the Set width text fi eld, type 360px and 
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Scroll down to the 
 property and
choose Left. Visually, very little will change, but the two columns now have explicit 
widths and both are fl oating.

6
Creating columns with HTML and CSS

5 
In the Files panel, double-click the sidebar_content.html page. Select all the text
on this page and copy it. Close the fi le, and then click inside the sidebar and paste,
replacing the placeholder text. The sidebar expands to fi t this content, which is a 
defi nition list.
The sidebar section is fl oated to the left and has a width of 360. The main section is fl oated to the right 
and has a width of 600.
We have cheated a bit in this exercise and created pre-existing styles for the sidebar content. 
Many of the techniques for modifying the margins of elements have been covered in earlier 
lessons. You can look at the styles for the 
and 
 elements within the styles panel or 
the code view to see the details.
The behavior and appearance of the footer element could be somewhat confusing. As 
noted earlier, it appears to be behind your two columns. The reason for this has to do 
with the nature of fl oated elements. Floated elements are removed from the default fl ow of 
HTML and since both columns are fl oated, the footer ignores them and moves up directly
below the navigation section. This is also why the height of the footer has expanded. From 
the perspective of the footer, there are no columns to interact with so it assumes its default 
behavior.
In order to push the footer below the columns, you need to add another CSS property to
the footer called
.

6
167
Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating columns with HTML and CSS
Using the 
 property
When you apply the
property to an object, you are essentially adding a rule that 
says No fl oated elements are allowed on either side of me. In fact, you can specify whether the 
left, right or both sides can have fl oated elements. You’ll try two diff erent options in order 
to understand the
 property better.
1 
Choose
 from the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel. In the Selector 
pane, click the 
selector, then click the Layout button (
) in the Properties
Navigation bar. Scroll down to the
 property and click the Right button (
).
This puts the footer element on the bottom of the page. You might need to scroll
down to see it.
Although this seems to do the trick, there is a potential pitfall. You set the clear value
to Right, but what would happen if the content in the main column were shorter than 
the content in the sidebar? Understanding the answer to this question will go a long 
way toward your understanding of fl oats and clears, so you’ll do a short experiment.
2 
In the main
 select the last three paragraphs and headings and then delete them.
With less content in this column now, the footer still behaves the same and stops at the 
bottom of the main column, but the sidebar is longer now so the footer overlaps it.
Select and delete the last three paragraphs and headings in the Main div.
Of course, you could fi x this by switching the value of the
property from
Right to Left. This would prevent the footer from being next to the sidebar, but the 
problem is that you might never know which column will have the most content, so 
the safest solution is to apply the
property to both sides.
3 
Choose Edit > Undo Delete to bring the content back into the main 
.

6
Creating a list-based CSS navigation bar
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
168
4 
Choose
 in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel. Click the footer 
element and click the 
 selector in the Selectors pane, then click Show set 
check box (
) in the Properties Navigation bar. Locate the 
 property
and click the Both button (
). The footer element will now always be at the bottom
because no fl oated elements are allowed to the left or the right.
Creating a list-based CSS navigation bar
Floats can not only be used for simple image wrapping and creating columns, but also to
create navigation. Here you’ll start creating a list-based navigation that uses CSS. This is
a great way to create easily editable navigation bars that are also search engine-friendly 
because they use text instead of images. Additionally, you can think of navigation as 
simply a list of links to other pages, so it makes sense to use the list element. The fi rst step 
is to add the content and then style the list items and the navigation element. 
1 
Select the placeholder text in the navigation element and if necessary click the HTML
button in the Property Inspector. Click the Unordered List button (
) and the text 
will become the fi rst bullet in an unordered list.
2 
Replace the placeholder text by typing Home, and then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (MacOS).
This adds a new list item. Add the following navigation sections pressing Enter/Return 
after each one: About Us, Products, Services, Contact. Your layout will appear to 
break as the list items are added. Don’t worry; you will be using fl oat properties to turn
this list into a horizontal navigation bar.
Add the list items that will serve as your navigation.

6
169
Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating a list-based CSS navigation bar
You will now link the 5 items. The pages in this case have not been created so you
will use a placeholder link for each item.
3 
Select the Home list item, click inside the Link text fi eld in the Property Inspector and
type # and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This symbol creates a 
placeholder hyperlink. Repeat this step for each list item until all fi ve are hyperlinked.
Now you’ll apply the 
property and turn this vertical list into a horizontal one.
4 
Click the
 element in the tag selector.
Select the 
element in the tag selector.
Click 
in the Sources pane. Click the Add Selector button in the Selectors 
Pane and change the text supplied by Dreamweaver so the compound selector reads 
. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
5 
Uncheck the Show Set button and then click Layout button from the Properties 
Navigation bar. Scroll down to the
 property and choose Left. You will see that 
your list items are now stacked horizontally rather than vertically. By applying the 
 property, you have overridden the list items’ default behavior. However, there is 
still more work that you need to do.
6 
Click the Other button ( ) in the Properties Navigation bar then choose none from the 
Set list-style-type drop-down menu. This removes the bullet points from each list item. 
You still need to do more work; specifi cally, you need to create styles for the
element that is for hyperlinks. You’ll style the appearance and position of these links now.

6

7 
Click inside any link in the navigation and click
 in the Sources pane. Next, 
click the Add Selector button from the Selectors pane. The selector type is compound, 
but unnecessarily complex; edit the text so the selector name is set to 
, place your cursor at the end of the line, and then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS).
Create a new CSS rule for the navigation hyperlinks.
8 
Click the Text button (
) from the Properties Navigation menu. Locate the
property and click the button labeled none. This will remove the default 
underline below your hyperlinks. Locate the
 property, click the color swatch,
and choose white. Finally, locate the white-space property and chose nowrap from the 
menu of options. This will make sure your navigation links do no wrap to a second 
line and disrupt the content below.
9 
Click the Layout button (
) from the CSS Navigation menu and scroll down to the
padding control. Type 8 px for the top value and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). Repeat the steps setting the bottom to 8px the left and right values to 15 px.
Apply padding to the hyperlink styles to create 
more space between your navigation.
10 Scroll down to the
 property and choose block from the pop-up menu. This
property and value changes the appearance of the list item: it expands and also allows
the entire block to be clickable, not just the text.
You’re almost fi nished; however, your navigation links are currently overlapping the
boundaries of the green navigation bar. This is because of some default margins—a 
topic you have run into before. In this case, the default margins of the unordered list 
are the culprit.

6
171
Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating a list-based CSS navigation bar
11 Click anywhere inside the navigation, if necessary, and then click the 
tag in the
Tag Selector. Click 
in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel and click 
the Add Selector button. Edit the text making sure the selector reads 
, and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
12 Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation bar. Scroll down to the margin
control and click the link button in the middle of the control. This will link all of 
the margins together using the same value. Click the
 property and
type 0, then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Repeat these steps using the 
padding control and the hyperlinks will be centered within the navigation element.
Set the margins for the navigation to give it a
more defi ned look.
The last piece to add is a little interactivity. Say that when the user mouses over any 
one of the navigation links, you would like it to change color. This improves usability
by letting the user know the links are active. You can do this with the 
property 
for hyperlinks.

13 Click within any link and then click
 in the Sources pane of the CSS 
Designer panel. Click the Add Selector button and type #navigation a:hover in the
selector name fi eld.
Create a selector for #navigation
.
Adding 
 in front of the 
property creates a compound selector 
ensuring the styles only apply to links within the navigation menu. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
14 Click the Background button in the Properties Navigation bar. Click the Set 
background-color text fi eld and type #9fcc41 and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). This is the same green as the header.
15 Save your document and choose File > Preview in Browser to see your list-based
CSS menu. Be sure to mouse over the links to see the hover eff ect. Close the browser 
window and return to Dreamweaver.
Creating a style for the 
 property produces a color rollover eff ect when the user’s cursor is on a link.

Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Changing column layout and size
Changing column layout and size
Another benefi t of using fl oated containers for layout is that they are very easy to modify. 
For example, perhaps you would like to experiment with your sidebar being on the right
rather than the left, or perhaps you would like to experiment with changing the width of 
the entire layout. This can all be accomplished with a few easy modifi cations of the styles.
1 
In the CSS Designer panel, choose
 from the Sources pane and click the 
style in the Selectors pane. Click the Show set check box to limit the list to only 
the properties that have been set and change the fl oat property from right to left. This 
pushes the main box over to the left of the container and the sidebar slips to the right.
2 
In the Selector pane, click the
 selector; change the
 property from left 
to right. There will be no visual change in this case, but it does ensure that the sidebar 
is fl ush against the container. That’s it! Two simple style changes create a completely
diff erent layout.
Change the Float value of the 
 style from left to right.
If you’d like to change the overall width of your page layout, you can do this by
modifying the
div.
3 
Click 
 in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, then click the 
 selector in the Selectors pane and change the width from 960 to 1100
and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This expands your container, and 
because your columns are fl oating, they will both remain aligned to their respective
sides. For the purpose of this exercise, the original value of 960 is better, so type this 
value back again. For now, the important part is to understand the concept.
4 
While you are here, select the 
property and delete it, removing it from the
list. Having a fi xed height is useful at the beginning of the layout progress, but it
should be removed at some point in order to accommodate more content.
Fine-tune your page: currently, the main column is aligned fl ush left against the 
container and the text is too close to the edge of the container. This is a common

6
Changing column layout and size
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
174
layout problem; you will now look at some techniques designed to help you create 
your own custom layouts and to better understand the behavior of fl oated elements.
5 
Click the
selector in the Selectors pane of the CSS Designer panel, and then
clear the Show set check box in the Properties Navigation bar. Click the Layout 
button and scroll down to the margin control. Type 20 inside the Set left margin text
fi eld, and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Adding 20 pixels of left margin to the 
column pushes it below 
.
Notice that this change had the desired eff ect of adding space between the main
column and the surrounding container. However, there is another eff ect: the
column has now slipped down below. This eff ect is to be expected because you are 
trying to squeeze two boxes into a fi xed width space. Remember that the container 
is 960 pixels wide. The main column is 600 pixels wide, and you just added 20 pixels 
to it, thus making the true width 620 pixels. The sidebar is 360 pixels wide; adding 
the combined widths results in 980 pixels.The
column slips below 
because we added
 before 
so it appears fi rst in the HTML code.
This is a common dilemma with fi xed width layouts, but as long as you understand 
the relationships, it is easy to fi x. In this case, you’ll try reducing the width of the 
main column.
6 
Click the Show set check box to show the current properties and change the 
from 600 to 580, then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The width is
reduced and the sidebar slips back up.
However, you can take this a bit further: the columns are actually very close to each 
other. You can add more space by reducing the width of the main section even further.

6
175
Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating the appearance of equal height columns
7 
Type 550 as the width, and then click OK. You now have an additional gap of space
between the main section and the sidebar.
Keep in mind that you could have decreased the width of the 
 style if you preferred to
keep the width of the 
column intact. There are no set rules for how to do this correctly.
Layout in CSS becomes interplay between width, margins, padding, and content; every page 
has slightly diff erent requirements. Just be sure to keep track of all these relationships in your own 
designs, since it can get confusing as you add more elements. 
Creating the appearance of equal height columns
There is now another part of your layout that you need to pay attention to: the column
height. Currently, the main column is longer than the sidebar; visually this isn’t really a 
problem because neither column has a background color, so the whole page appears white.
But what happens if your design requires that explicit columns be defi ned by color? In this
exercise, you’ll look at one solution for this issue.
1 
Choose 
 from the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, then click the 
#
 selector in the Selectors pane. You might have to click 
 to enable 
all of the selectors to display. Make sure the Show set check box is unchecked, and then
click the Background button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar. Finally, in the Set
background-color text fi eld, type #C8D9BC and press Enter (Windows) or Return
(Mac OS).
2 
Click the Border button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar and locate the 
property. Choose solid in the Set left column style drop-down menu. 
Locate the 
 property, double-click the Set left border width
fi eld, and type 2px. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Finally, scroll to the 
 property and type #060 in the Set left border color text fi eld.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Set the border for the 
 element.

6
Creating the appearance of equal height columns
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
176
The problem with the column is an aesthetic one. A column sometimes looks better 
when it spans to the bottom of the page rather than cutting off  abruptly. Additionally, 
if you are using this layout throughout your site, every page will likely have diff erent
amounts of content. As a user moves from page to page, this would create irregular 
page appearance, as the column height jumps up and down based on the amount of 
content. To solve this, you’ll add a background image to the container div, which 
simulates the appearance of the column from top to bottom.
3 
In the Selectors pane of the CSS Designer panel, click the #
selector. You
might have to click 
in the Sources pane to display all of the selectors. Click 
the Background button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar, and click the Enter fi le 
text box for the
 property. Click the Browse button (
) and 
locate the container_bg.gif fi le in the images folder. Click OK (Windows) or Open
f
(Mac OS).
This graphic is 960 pixels wide (which matches the width of your container), but it is 
only 2 pixels high. Essentially, it is a thin horizontal slice of the page and includes the
sidebar color and green border.
4 
From the 
 property, click the button for repeat-y ( ). This ensures the graphic
will only be tiled from top to bottom and you will now see your columns fi lled in.
A fake column background image creates the eff ect of a column extending the height of the page.

6
177
Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating the appearance of equal height columns
Now, the length of the column is irrelevant. The image background will always reach 
the bottom of the page and maintain a consistent appearance. 
Although this technique is useful, it relies on your layout being fi nalized. If the width of your 
container or the position of any of your columns changes, you must then change the background 
image. Additionally, other changes, such as the color of a column or any padding adjustments,
could require you to modify your background image. For this reason, you should wait until the 
small changes and adjustments to your layout are complete before making a column background.
How to create a fake column background in Photoshop
The easiest way to make the fake column background is if you happen to have a mockup of 
your website as an image file or as a Photoshop file with layers. However, if you don’t have a
mockup, you need to be more creative. Here’s how we created our page background.
1 
Preview your web page in the browser. Look to make sure you have a clear cross-section 
of your columns from left to right. If there are any text or images in the column, you 
might need to go back to Dreamweaver and remove them temporarily.
2 
Use your system’s screen capture program capture your screen. In the Mac OS, this can 
be done with the keyboard shortcut, Command+Shift+3. In Windows, use the Print 
Screen button to capture.
In the case of the Mac OS, this will create a png fi le that will be saved to your desktop. 
In the case of Windows, this will copy the screen image to your clipboard.
3 
In Photoshop, either open the screen capture image directly (Mac OS) or if in Windows, 
choose File > New, then click OK and press Ctrl+V.
4 
Click the Rectangular Marquee tool, then in the Options panel, change the style from 
Normal to Fixed Size. Type in a width of 960 px and a height of 2 px. If your original 
layout has a diff erent width, you will need to change this width value to match.
5 
Click anywhere in the image with the Marquee tool to add a fl oating selection. Using 
your arrow keys, you must line up the selection exactly with the edges of the container.
If the selection is even 1 pixel off , it will result in a mismatch between the image and the
real HTML columns.
6 
Choose Image > Crop, then choose Save for Web and Devices to save it as a gif, jpg or 
png. Try to optimize the image in order to make it as small as possible. For example, in
our case, we saved it as a gif using only 4 colors.

Applying finishing touches
You’ll now tidy up some loose ends with your layout. Specifi cally, you’ll add a background 
image to your header, and then move the rules in your current style sheet to an external 
style sheet so you can use these styles for other pages in your site.
1 
Choose
 in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, then click the
 selector in the Selectors pane. Click the Background button (
) in the 
Properties Navigation bar and locate the
property in the background-image 
section. Click the Enter the fi le path fi eld, and then click the Browse button. Navigate 
to your images folder, choose veggies.jpg, and then click OK.
2 
Click the no-repeat button (
) from the
property. Click the 
fi rst percent sign in the
 property and choose Right. Notice 
that the veggies image has been applied to the right side of your header.
Adding a background image to the header.
Now you will move all the style rules to an external style sheet so you can use these 
styles on new pages.
3 
Click the Add CSS Source button (
) in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer 
panel and choose Create A New CSS File. The Create a New CSS File dialog box
will appear. Click the Browse button and navigate to your site root directory. Type 
styles.css in the File name fi eld, and then click Save. When you return to the Create
New CSS File dialog box, click OK. You now have an external style sheet that we can 
use to save your rules.
4 
Choose
 from the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, then click the

Lesson 6, Advanced Page Layout
Creating more sophisticated layouts
Creating more sophisticated layouts
The two-column layout you created represents a good foundation for a website. You
would refer to this as a Two-column fi xed-width layout with a header and footer. 
However, you might be looking for more options. For example, what about a three-
column layout, or a liquid layout in which the content adjusts to the width of the browser 
(also referred to as a fl exible or fl uid layout)? It is beyond the scope of this book to walk
through all these options. However, Dreamweaver does off er a way to create diff erent 
layouts on the fl y. You can choose from a gallery of new layouts whenever you create a 
new page.
1 
Choose File > New and make sure HTML is selected as the Page Type. In the Layout 
column, the None option is the default, but you can also choose from a number of 
pre-made options.
2 
Choose the 2 column fi xed, right sidebar, header and footer option. Notice that a 
small thumbnail with a description of the layout appears. Click Create.
The thumbnail preview of the two column layout.
3 
Choose File > Preview in Browser and when prompted, save this fi le as 2col_fi xed.html.
Adjust the width of the browser and you will see that the width of the container page 
remains fi xed, as well as the content within. 
Take a moment to read the text in this page. It mentions that the code for this page has
been commented. You’ll take a look at this code now, in order to better understand 
the pros and cons of using these pre-generated pages.
Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.

Click the Code View button and scroll to the top if necessary. The code in light gray 
represents comments that describe virtually every line of the CSS. So why is there a 
need to comment this fi le so heavily? To make a long story short, the code in this fi le
is very robust and is optimized for cross-browser display. This means there are styles 
that address various bugs across diff erent browsers, as well as other relatively advanced 
CSS code.
This presents a dilemma: You will benefi t most from these templates only as long as 
you know how to modify them. In order to modify them eff ectively, however, you 
need to understand the rules of HTML and CSS relatively well. There is a limit to
how far a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) application can take you in 
learning these rules.
This should not stop you in exploring these page layouts. They are extremely useful, 
and can be incredible time-savers. Just be aware that reverse-engineering how a page 
works can also be time-consuming, and that the answers might lie in the rules of 
HTML and CSS, and not in the Dreamweaver application.

Dreamweaver Fluid Grid Layout
A feature introduced in Dreamweaver CS6 was the addition of Fluid Grid Layouts. This 
is a system for creating websites that are alternatively known as adaptive or responsive, 
meaning that the layout of your pages changes depending on the size of the user’s screen. 
The model for this form of layout is in many ways radically diff erent than the techniques
presented in this lesson. Fluid Grid Layout uses a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and
JavaScript to create layouts that are optimized for mobile devices and monitor screens of 
diff erent sizes.
The techniques covered in this lesson are very well-tested and reliable in the current crop
of web browsers; the techniques used for Fluid Grid layout introduce new complexities 
that are best covered in a separate lesson. This is why we cover them in Lesson 16, 
“Responsive Design and Layout for Mobile Devices.”

Questions
1 
The
 property allows you to fl oat an element to the left, right and center. 
True or False?
2 
What are the three possible values for the 
 property? Name a situation where 
you might use this property.
3 
How would you apply padding to a fl oated column?
Answers
1 
False. The 
property only has three values:
, 
 and 
. You cannot 
fl oat an element to center.
2 
You can apply the
property to an element with one of the following values: 
left, right or both. Elements with a
 property do not allow a fl oated element to 
the side specifi ed. A common situation where you might use this would be when you 
need the footer element on your page to appear below any fl oated columns.
3 
Select the selector for the column in the Selectors pane of the CSS Designer panel that
you want to apply padding to by clicking it. Click the Layout button in the Properties
Navigation bar. Then set a value for padding using the padding control.

Lesson 7, CSS3 Transitions and Styles 
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• The role of CSS3 in 
Dreamweaver CC
• Creating a CSS Transition
• Creating a CSS Gradient
• Creating rounded borders 
Lesson 7
Dreamweaver CC supports a number of CSS3 styles including 
CSS3 Transitions, Gradients and rounded borders for upgrading the 
style and appearance of your site. CSS3 Transitions add a way to 
create basic animations using CSS properties such as background-
color and size to add interactivity to your website. 
Starting up
more information, see “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section 
of this book.
In this lesson, you will work with several fi les from the dw07lessons folder. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard-drive from the supplied DVD. For 
more information, see “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you can proceed with the exercises in this section, you need to create site settings 
that point to the dw07lessons folder. Go to Site > New Site, or for details on creating a
site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Understanding the role of CSS3
Cascading Style Sheets is a separate language from HTML; however, both languages are
constantly evolving. The original CSS1 specifi cation was released in 1996 and included
many of the basic CSS properties used today, such as background-color, font-family and 
so on. Over the years, new versions of CSS have emerged with revisions and additions to
the original specifi cation. CSS3 is the latest version of the language and off ers a number of 
new CSS properties that give designers new tools for adding style to their pages.
The details of the evolution of CSS are not as important as understanding the key issue:
browser support. Although CSS3 off ers a number of exciting and useful features, designers
and developers need to know which features the diff erent web browsers can reliably
support. There are a tremendous number of new features in CSS3, and these features have
diff erent levels of browser support. Most features you can use today very reliably, others 
might not yet be fully supported in all browsers. The architects of CSS3 have broken up 
the language into categories called modules; examples include Backgrounds, Borders and 
Animation, among others. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use CSS Transitions from the 
Animation module, Gradients from the Backgrounds module and Border radius from the
Borders module. 
Adding a CSS Transition
CSS Transitions in Dreamweaver CC off er a way to create simple animations on your page 
using only CSS. This is in contrast to the traditional method of creating eff ects, such as 
image rollovers, using JavaScript or Flash. 
The basic concept of CSS Transitions is this: an object is animated by changing a property
(or properties) over time. For example, in the following exercise you will start with a box
that has its height property set to 350 pixels. You will then animate the height property 
down to 50 pixels over a period of two seconds. The result will be a slow collapsing eff ect 
when the user places their cursor over the box.
You’ll start with a simple example fi le, and then in a later exercise, you will apply CSS 
transitions to the Organic Utopia layout.

Open the 07_csstransitions.html document. Currently, this page has a single style 
rule for the ID

which confi rms that it is selected. In the CSS Designer panel, choose <style> from 
the Sources pane if necessary, and then click the
selector. This will expose the 
properties currently used. (If your Properties panel does not look like our screenshot,

300 pixels. You will now create a single transition that will animate the height of the 
box from the original 300 pixels to a more narrow height.

10 Click inside the fi eld labeled End Value, type 50, and make sure the menu to the 
right remains on pixels (px). The starting height of the box is 300 pixels; using this 
transition, you will change it to 50 pixels over a period of two seconds when the user 
hovers over the box.
Click the Create Transition button to add it.
11 Choose File > Save As, type 07_csstransitions_work in the File name and click Save 
to save this fi le in the dw07lessons folder. Choose File > Preview in Browser.
Place your cursor inside the top of the box; you will see the box animate from the 
original height of 300 down to 50 pixels. As you move your cursor off  the box, it 
begins to animate back to its original height.
When the user hovers over the box, it animates from a starting height of 300 pixels to an ending height of 50.
This is a very basic example of a single CSS transition. In the next exercise, you will
add more transitions and learn how to edit your existing one.
12 Close both the browser window and the original 07_csstransitions.html page. 
Return to Dreamweaver. Keep the 07_csstransitions_work.html fi le open, since 
you’ll be working with it in the next exercise.
What if you can’t see the transition?
You might not be able to see the transition effect in the last exercise if your web browser 
does not support the transition property. The support for CSS3 Transitions is relatively new 
and not all properties are equally supported across all browsers, specifically the most popular 
versions of Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, and 9.
At the time of this writing, Microsoft has released Internet Explorer 10 with support for CSS 
Transitions. The following online resource provides a useful table to help you see the level of 
support for CSS Transitions for past, present, and future (planned) browsers.

Modifying a CSS Transition
Now that you have seen how a CSS Transition works, you’ll now see how to modify
the existing transition speed, add a delay, and adjust the timing of the animation using a 
feature called Easing.
Before you get started with the modifi cations, you’ll take a quick look at the CSS code
that Dreamweaver creates in the background.
1 
Click the Code View in your document and locate the 
section at the top;
specifi cally, the 
 rule. Notice that there are fi ve lines of code that were created 
by adding the transition, starting with 
; and ending 
with
;
The generated transition CSS that was created by Dreamweaver.
Five lines of code might seem like a lot; however, each line is exactly the same 
code, and each targets a specifi c web browser. The code
; begins with a vendor-specifi c prefi x to target Webkit browsers such as 
Apple Safari and Google Chrome. The code 
; targets 
Mozilla browsers (Firefox). The next two lines, 
; and
; target Microsoft and Opera browsers.
The last line, 
; is the “offi  cial” CSS3 property name for 
transitions. The reason for having fi ve lines of almost-identical code is that each
browser has its own timeline for supporting a new CSS3 property. For example,
Google Chrome might have required the prefi x 
 in version 8.0. When it 
becomes evident that transitions are working reliably and are well-liked by designers, 
Google Chrome might choose to drop the requirement for the prefi x in version 10.0. 
The goal is for all browsers to eventually support the “offi  cial” property transition; 
the only reason to use the vendor-specifi c ones would be to provide support for older 
browsers.

Look below the code for the 
 style; you will see the style
. This code 
represents the trigger you set for the transition in the last exercise.
3 
Click the Design view to toggle back to your page. Most likely, you will not need to
modify the CSS transition code by hand, but you should understand where you can
fi nd it within the CSS, and understand some of the underlying concepts.
4 
In your CSS Transitions window, click hover and then click the Pencil icon to edit the
transition. 
Select hover and then click the Pencil icon 
to edit a transition.
The Edit Transition window opens, allowing you to modify the values you created in
the last exercise.
You can also double-click 
 or 
to open this window.
5 
Select the value 2 inside the Duration fi eld and type 0.5. This will change the
duration from two seconds to half a second.
6 
Click inside the Delay fi eld, type 1, and make sure the menu to the right is set to s (for 
second). Delaying a transition simply means the transition will not begin until one 
second after the user hovers over the box.

7  Notice that there is a value in the Timing Function fi eld set to ease. This is the default 
setting, so while you didn’t set this in the last exercise, Dreamweaver fi lls it in as 
though you had.
What is easing?
Easing is a term well known in computer animation that you might have seen before,
particularly if you have used Adobe Flash. Easing allows you to vary the speed of a transition 
over time. For example, you might want an animation to start off slow and then speed up, or 
perhaps the reverse: start off quickly and then slow down.
Dreamweaver CC has six options for easing:
Linear
Maintains a constant speed for the duration of the transition.
Ease 
The animation starts slowly, accelerates, and then slows down when approaching the end of 
the transition.
Ease-in
The animation begins slowly, and then progressively accelerates until the end of the
transition.
Ease-out
The animation starts quickly, and then progressively slows down until the end of the 
transition.
Ease-in-out
The animation starts slowly at the beginning, maintains a steady rate in the middle, and then 
slows down toward the end of the transition.
Cubic-bezier(x1,y1,x2,y2)
Allows you to create a custom animation using the cubic bezier model. A sample value 
might be 
. This particular example would result in an 
animation that starts off slowly and speeds up toward the end of the transition.

Click the Timing Function menu and choose 
. The ease-out timing will
cause the animation to start off  quickly and then slow down. (Note that this eff ect will 
be diffi  cult to see with the new half second duration.)
Choose ease-out from the menu of Timing Functions.

Click the + sign at the bottom of the Property section. You will now animate a 
second property to go with the height transition.

Choose a dark pink color for the 
 property.
Notice that the values for Duration, Delay, and Timing Function are the same. If you
want to create separate values for the background-color animation, you would need 
to click the menu at the top of the Edit Transition window and change it to Use a 
diff erent transition for each property.

11 Click Save Transition, and then choose File > Save. Preview the page in your browser 
and place your cursor at the top of the box. Remember that there is a one-second 
delay that you added in Step 5; after this delay, the box will change height rapidly and
simultaneously fade from gray to pink.
CSS3 Transitions are supported in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer. The current 
release of Internet Explorer is version 10 (as of this writing), however most users are using 
version 9 or earlier without support for CSS3 Transitions. For a detailed look at browser support 
visit: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions.
After a delay of one second, the box quickly reduces its height and animates its background color.

196
Adding CSS Transitions to a navigation menu
User interface elements such as navigation bars, menus, or buttons are great to use with 
CSS Transitions. Subtle animation can add an extra bit of sophistication and style to your 
pages.
1 
Open the 07_nav_transition.html document by double-clicking it in the Files panel.
2 
Choose File > Preview in Browser to view this page in a browser. Hover over the 
navigation to see the default styles. The eff ect you are seeing is a traditional CSS2 
hover eff ect; the background color of a list item changes to a lighter green when the 
cursor hovers over it. However, the change is instant in CSS2 syntax; you have no 
control over how long it takes for the background color to go from the darker green
to the lighter green. In CSS3 syntax you have control using transitions. We will add a 
transition to make the hover eff ect more interesting.
The current hover eff ect is either on or off .
Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.

If your CSS Transitions window is not currently open, do so now by choosing 
Window > CSS Transitions.

and for the End Value, type #9FCC41. (This color matches the one currently used.)
You’ll now combine another eff ect by changing the foreground color of the text inside 
the navigation.
7 
Click the + sign in the Property section and choose

this second property is inheriting all the values added for the fi rst value. You want 
more control, so you’ll have to defi ne separate rules for this 
 property.

10 Choose File > Save All, and then preview your page in the browser. Hover over 
the navigation and you will see the navigation background color fade up and down 
slightly. The text also fades, but because you added the 100ms delay in the last step, it
creates a subtle fading eff ect every time the user moves to another navigation.
Adding two separate transitions for the navigation: one for the background color, the other 
for the color of the text.

Adding a CSS Gradient
CSS Gradients in Dreamweaver CC off er a way to apply gradient backgrounds to your 
layout using only CSS. This is in contrast to the traditional method of creating tiled or 
repeating gradient background images. Using CSS instead of background images will
make your sites quicker and more effi  cient by eliminating the need for extra images, and
saving both bandwidth and download time for users; both of which are at a premium on 
mobile devices. An additional benefi t of CSS Gradients is that they allow you to more 
easily change colors and apply diff erent gradient eff ects without having to modify image 
fi les.
In this exercise, you will apply a CSS3 gradient to the sample document. Later, you will
apply the same eff ect to the Organic Utopia layout.
1 
Open the 07_cssgradients.html document. The box background has been added
using a traditional CSS2 single-pixel width gradient image set to repeat horizontally 
using repeat-y. A background color matching the bottom of the gradient has been 
added to allow the box to be resized vertically to maintain the gradient eff ect.

Remove CSS Property icon to the right of the value
. This will remove 
the background color. Repeat this step to remove the 
and
properties.
4 
Clear the Show set check box to display all of the available properties. Next, click 
the Background button in the Properties Navigation pane to display the background
properties. Locate the 
 property in the 
 category. This 
will bring up the Gradient control. Choose Hex from the tabs at the bottom of the
control to add a color using the hexadecimal color code.
The Gradient control allows you to set the color stops to create gradients using 
RGB, Hex or HSLa values.
5 
Click the top color stop in the left pane of the Gradient control and type #993399
in the text box to set the top color stop value. Click the bottom color stop and type 
#000000 to set the bottom value. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
apply the gradient color. This will recreate the same eff ect of the gradient image used 
previously.
CSS3 Gradients are supported in all major browsers though each implementation may need 
browser-specifi c prefi xes to enable the eff ect. Dreamweaver CC will insert these vendor-specific 
syntaxes. You can choose the vendors in Preferences > CSS Styles > Use Vendor Prefi x For.

Creating rounded borders
Dreamweaver CC adds support for the CSS3
 property to add rounded 
corners to HTML elements. Previously, creating rounded corners required visual trickery 
including using images of rounded corners to create the desired eff ect. The advent of the 
CSS3 border-radius property renders these techniques obsolete and simplifi es the process.
1 
Open the 07_rounded_borders.html document by double-clicking it in the Files 
panel.
2 
Choose File > Preview in Browser to view this page in the browser. There are 
two boxes on the page identifi ed as
 and
. Currently, there is a border 
visible on the box on the left and a background-color applied to the box on the right. 
You will modify the styles of these two elements by applying the 
property to round off  the corners of the boxes. Close the browser window and return 
to Dreamweaver.
Before CSS3, there was no easy way to create softer, rounder edges for page elements.

Using your new knowledge of creating CSS3 Transitions and Styles in Dreamweaver, try
some of the following tasks to build your experience.
To practice CSS transitions, build a web button labeled Subscribe Now! and give it
!
transition eff ects such as background color and border eff ects. You can make a copy of the 
07_csstransitions.html document and base your button upon the original
 style.
You will have to set the starting width and height to a number more appropriate for a 
button, such as 25 pixels high and 100 pixels wide.
The transition eff ects that you created for the 07_nav_transition.html exercise were 
designed for educational purposes to show you how the eff ects work; however, they 
might be too slow for real-world use. Try experimenting with the Duration and Delay 
values; specifi cally, try lowering the values. Also try experimenting with diff erent Timing 
Functions, such as Ease, Linear, Ease-in, and Ease-out.
To practice CSS Gradients, open 07_page_gradient_work.html and apply a background

Lesson 8, Using Web Fonts 
What you’ll learn in this 
lesson:
• Web fonts in Dreamweaver CC
• Using Adobe Edge Web Fonts
• Creating custom font stacks
• Using local web fonts
Lesson 8 
Dreamweaver CC off ers improved support for web fonts, including 
the addition of the free Adobe Edge Web Fonts service. Web fonts 
off er a way to enhance your page by embedding custom fonts, even if 
visitors to your site do not have the font on their system.
Starting up
Before you begin, reset your workspace to ensure your tools and panels are consistent. For 
more information, see “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section 
of this book.
In this lesson, you will work with several fi les from the dw08lessons folder. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard-drive from the supplied DVD. For 
more information, see “Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you can proceed with the exercises in this section, you need to create site settings 
that point to the dw08lessons folder. Go to Site > New Site, or for details on creating a 
site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
The basics of web fonts
The limited choice of fonts for the Web has been a problem for many years. (The way
fonts work on the Web was outlined in Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images.”) The core 
issue is that if you defi ne a specifi c font in your CSS and a visitor to your site does not have
that font, a substitute font is used. Unfortunately, the list of fonts that are guaranteed to
be installed on all users’ computers is very small. Over the years designers have looked for 
alternatives and workarounds to this limitation. These workarounds ranged from using 
decorative fonts saved in images to font-replacement technologies such as Cufon, sIFR, 
FLIR and 
.
Of these technologies, web fonts have emerged as the accepted technique using the 
property in CSS3. The use of web fonts has gained industry support from 
designers and developers, and more importantly, from companies that make and license 
fonts. Simply put, web fonts allow you to embed any font within a page by declaring the 
font you want to display and placing this font on your web server. When a user visits your 
site, their browser renders the page using this font wherever specifi ed. Adding web fonts is 
a straight-forward process in Dreamweaver; however, there are some details (technical and 
legal) that you need to be aware of.
Web Fonts in Dreamweaver CC
Previously, Dreamweaver only supported 
 allowing you to embed local web 
fonts in your web pages. This method had a few drawbacks for web designers. First, you 
had to make sure the fonts you used were properly licensed for web use (see the Font
Licensing sidebar in the
exercise later in this lesson). Second, the varied 
support for 
 across browsers meant that web designers needed to provide 
multiple fi les for font formats, font weights and styles (see the Browser Font Support
sidebar in the
exercise later in this lesson). Finally, the fonts were downloaded 
from the site, increasing bandwidth use and potentially download speeds.
Dreamweaver CC improves upon web font support by including the free Adobe Edge 
Web Font service giving you access to a vast web font library through the Creative Cloud
(http://html.adobe.com/edge/webfonts/). Powered by TypeKit, this free service is made possible 
by contributions from Adobe, Google and designers around the world. It provides web
fonts functionality as an integrated workfl ow directly within Dreamweaver. You will 
explore both methods of using web fonts throughout the following exercises.

Open the 08_edgefonts.html fi le by double-clicking it in the Files panel. This fi le 
includes several paragraphs that are styled with a diff erent set of fonts, called a font 
stack.
Each paragraph is styled with a diff erent font stack.
2 
In the Design view, click anywhere in the fi rst line of text. If you look at the tag 
selector you will notice this paragraph is styled using a class called .baskerville. Click 
the CSS Designer tab to access the CSS Designer panel and choose <style> from the 
Sources pane.
3 
Click .baskerville in the Selectors pane and view the font-face property in the 
Properties pane. It might be helpful to check Show set in the Properties Navigation
bar to limit the list to properties that are set for the current selector. The only property
set is font-family: Baskerville, Palatino Linotype, Palatino, Century Schoolbook L,
Times New Roman, serif.

You will now add a web font from the Adobe Edge Web Font collection and use it to 
style the last paragraph in the document. Choose Modify > Manage Fonts to bring up 
the new Manage Fonts dialog box. This window is comprised of three tabs to manage
Adobe Edge Web Fonts, Local Web Fonts and Custom Font Stacks.
The Manage Fonts dialog box provides a new interface to simplify using web fonts.
The Adobe Edge Web Fonts tab of the font manager allows you to search for and view 
the many web fonts available from the service. You can search for fonts by name or 
use the buttons to the left to fi lter fonts appropriate for headings, paragraphs, typeface
properties or a combination of settings.
5 
Choose the Acme font from the list; Dreamweaver will display a checkmark on the 
font indicating it is selected, then click Done. The font will now be available for use 
on any website you create through Dreamweaver.
6 
Select the last line of text in the document, click <style> in the Sources pane 
of the CSS Designer, and then click the Add Selector button in the Selectors 
pane. Dreamweaver will add a new selector in the Selectors pane. Select the text 
Dreamweaver added and type .custom in the selector name text box. Press Enter

Make sure the last paragraph of the document is still selected. Using the Property 
Inspector, select .custom from the Class drop-down menu to apply this class to the 
last paragraph. You will not notice the change immediately because some web fonts
do not display in Design view. Click Live from the document toolbar to go into Live 
view to see the new web font applied.
When Dreamweaver adds a web font to your page it also adds a script tag to instruct 
the browser to download the font from another location. We will now take a look 
at the added script to better understand it. We will not need to make any changes as
Dreamweaver handles inserting and managing this code for you.

part of Cascading Style Sheets, and you are seeing that eff ect here. The font Lucida 
Sans Unicode is defi ned in the body, and because there are no other styles for h1, the 
cascade is in eff ect, so it inherits the color and font-family styles.
Lucida Sans Unicode is a font that is extremely common on most users’ computer 
systems; you’ll now add a web font that is not so common.

Choose DroidSans-Bold-webfont.eot and click Open; the EOT font is selected as 
well as the other three options: WOFF, TTF, and SVG. All four of these fonts should 
be used to ensure maximum compatibility across all web browsers.
Browser font support
The use of web fonts has been complicated because you cannot use a single font format and
have it supported across all browsers. The following table lists the level of browser support 
for the different font types. Essentially, it comes down to the need to include them all if you 
want your font styles to be consistent.
The following table lists the various levels of support for the different font-types:
• OpenType (OTF): A widespread font format that is heavily supported by the industry. 
Initially developed as a collaboration between Adobe and Microsoft, one of the primary 
advantages of OpenType is cross-platform support. However, there are additional
typesetting features, including glyph support, that make OpenType fonts the primary font
of choice for professional font foundries.
• TrueType (TTF): Originally developed by Apple and later adopted by Microsoft, 
TrueType fonts are still widely in use today as they are largely cross-platform compatible 
and also offer sophisticated typesetting controls, such as hinting, which is a technique that 
improves the quality of the font in low resolution screens.
• SVG: A vector-based format that is notable because it is currently the only font type
supported by Apple’s iOS for iPod and iPad devices. SVG fonts are text documents that 
define the font outlines as vector objects within the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) 
language.
• Web Open Font Format (WOFF): The latest addition to the world of web fonts, WOFF 
has the potential to become a standard for web fonts, since it is in the final stages of being 
recommended as a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). One of the key 
benefits of WOFF is the ability to heavily compress the font files and optimize them for 
distribution over an Internet connection.
• Embedded OpenType (EOT): A variation on OpenType created by Microsoft and
largely supported only by Internet Explorer. EOT has a variety of copy-protection features 
built-in, designed to prevent copying of fonts.

Click the check box labeled, I have properly licensed the above font(s) for website use.

Fonts.

Click the Done button in the Manage Fonts dialog box.
The Manage Web Fonts dialog lists the available fonts for your current site.
At this point, your new web font, Droid Sans Bold, has been made available to all 
existing pages and any new pages in the current site. Additionally, this web font will 
be available to any document in Dreamweaver, even if it is part of another site.
Font licensing
Understanding the rules of font licensing is an important part of using web fonts. You can
technically add a font to a page, but this does not mean you are always allowed to. The fonts 
d
on your system could have specific licenses that only let you use them in print or for other 
specific uses. Even if you have paid for a font, this still does not necessarily mean you have 
paid for the web license of this font. You will need to ensure that you are allowed to use the 
fonts you add with the Web Font Manager.

the Adobe Type Team:

Lesson 8, Using Web Fonts 
Styling your heading with a local web font
Styling your heading with a local web font
In addition to the legal licensing limitations involved with web fonts, there is also an 
aesthetic consideration. Not all fonts are designed to be rendered on the screen. The
creators of a typical font are often more concerned with how the font renders in print or 
how the font looks at small sizes versus large sizes (or vice-versa). The web font you are 
using, Droid Sans Bold, was specifi cally designed to render well on small and large screens
alike. Many designers felt the majority of web fonts worked best as headings rather than as
large blocks of body text in paragraphs. This opinion has changed as many more fonts have 
been released for web use.
In this exercise, you will style your main heading with your new web font option. 
1 
Make sure you have clicked inside the Heading 1 labeled, Welcome to organic utopia. In
the tag selector, make sure you click the 
 tag.
This highlights your Heading 1 and makes it easier for Dreamweaver to understand 
that you want to target this style.
Click the 
 tag in the Tag Selector to select the top heading.

Click 
in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, then click the Add
Selector button in the Selectors pane. Type h1 in the Selector Name text box and press
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

font in the Set font family text box to display the font list and choose Droid Sans Bold.
t
Although you have applied the web font style, it might not be refl ected in the Design view.
You have just applied the font style to your heading, but you might not see this change
in your Design view. This is a limitation for some web fonts; you will only see an
accurate view in the browser or in Dreamweaver’s Live View.
5 
Click Dreamweaver’s Live View; you will see your heading set in Droid Sans Bold. 
You might not notice the diff erence immediately because Droid Sans and Lucida Sans 
are fairly similar; however, if you compare the letter “g” in the word organic to the
letter “g” in the heading further down the page (One stop shopping), you will see the
diff erence.
You can still use certain CSS formatting to make the web font-styled heading more
distinctive. You’ll now add a style to make the heading uppercase.
6 
In the CSS Designer panel, choose stylesheet.css from the Sources pane, and
then click 
 in the Selectors pane. Click the Show set check box in the 
Properties Navigation bar to see the properties that have been set to enable the Droid

pointing out that Dreamweaver created this fi le and the 
 style when you 
applied the web font to your 
heading.

2 
What is the easiest way to avoid the drawbacks of using web fonts in Dreamweaver CC?
3 
What is the purpose of creating a font-stack when formatting text on your web page?
Answers
1 
Some benefi ts of web fonts in Dreamweaver include the variety of choices available 
for use in your designs, the ease of adding multiple fonts using the Web Manager,
and the fact that web fonts will work in virtually all modern browsers. Drawbacks to 
web fonts include the need to use fonts with a specifi c web license (which means your 
favorite font might not be available for web use), the fact that Dreamweaver does not 
display them reliably in the Design view, and the fact that even if a font is licensed for 
web use, it might not be optimized for the computer screen.
2 
These drawbacks of using web fonts are eliminated when using the free Adobe Edge 
Web Fonts service on Creative Cloud, powered by TypeKit. An added benefi t of using 
this font service is that you no longer have to manage your own web fonts or have 
them downloaded from your server.
3 
A font-stack ensures that the text on your page will display appropriately. The browser 
will try to apply the fonts in successive order from left to right, from the closest match 
you specifi ed in the stack to the least specifi c default font at the end of the stack.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Creating and modifying 
tables
• Styling tables in CSS vs. 
HTML
• Importing table data
• Sorting table data
Lesson 9
Tables have a long and storied history in web design. In this lesson, 
you will learn how to structure and style tabular data using tables. 
Additionally you will understand the basics of using tables for layout 
and be able to compare and contrast them with Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS) for layout.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. 
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw09lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw09lessons folder from
the included DVD that contains resources you need for these lessons. Go to Site > New
Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”

shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Using tables in web design
Tables are ideally suited for displaying tabular data. As discussed in Lesson 5, “Creating 
Page Layouts with CSS,” in the beginning days of the Web, tables were the best tools 
available for designers when it came to layout. Over the years, Dreamweaver has 
steadily introduced a number of tools and visual aids to help people work with tables.
Dreamweaver has mirrored the Web in that it has begun to shift its focus to CSS layout
rather than table layout. Slowly, the table is reclaiming its original purpose: displaying 
tabular data.
In this lesson, you will learn how to automatically import and format existing data into a
table. You will also explore how to modify rows and columns, style tables with CSS, and 
create new tables from scratch. 
Importing table data
You’ll get a chance right away to see tabular data in action by importing a .csv fi le into 
Dreamweaver. A majority of tabular data is exported from spreadsheet programs in the 
.csv (comma-separated values) and .txt (text) fi le formats. These are called comma, tab, or 
other delimited fi les. Essentially this means that a spreadsheet application converts the data
within its rows and columns to an intermediate format that Dreamweaver can read.
Although Dreamweaver can open these fi les, it does not format them directly. With a 
comma-delimited fi le, for example, each column value is separated by a comma and each
line break starts a new row. For example, here is how Dreamweaver displays the raw .csv
fi le that you are going to be working with:
The text editor’s view of a comma-delimited fi le.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Importing table data
When imported into Dreamweaver, this fi le will be translated accordingly into the rows
and columns of a new table.
1 
In the Files panel, double-click the tips.html fi le to open it. This is a styled page for 
the tips section of the OrganicUtopia site. You will be inserting a .csv fi le with data on
the vegetable-growing zones of North America.
2 
Click after the last sentence in the main paragraph and press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) to make sure your cursor is below the text. Choose File > Import >
Tabular Data. The Import Tabular Data dialog box opens.
3 
In the Import Tabular Data dialog box, click the Browse button and locate the 
temperate_zones.csv fi le in your dw09lessons folder. Click Open.
4 
Click the Delimiter menu to see the various options that are available. In your case,
you will be choosing Comma. In the Table width section, leave the Fit to data option 
selected.
The settings in the Import Tabular Data dialog box aff ect the way a table is created.
You can either set a specifi c width for the generated table or let Dreamweaver construct the table 
automatically, based on the line-length of the incoming data.

5 
Click OK and your table is imported into your document below the text. Your table is
imported with 3 columns and 12 rows. A quick way to confi rm this is to look in the 
Property Inspector, where there is a fi eld for columns and rows as well as other useful 
ways to work with tables.
A three-column and 12-row table generated by Dreamweaver from a comma-delimited fi le.
6 
Click Dreamweaver’s Code view button to see the code that makes up this table. It’s 
safe to say that this is something you would not want to code by hand.
The table is now ready to be formatted according to your specifi cations. As you can 
see, you can save yourself a lot of time if your source data is properly formatted. 
Dreamweaver creates a table for you with all the data properly placed, eliminating the 
need for you to build a table, and type, or copy and paste, content into each cell.
Selecting table elements
It’s worth taking a few moments to learn how to select the various elements of your table. 
Selecting a specifi c part of a table can be little tricky until you learn how. In this exercise, 
you’ll look at ways to select a table’s rows and columns both by hand and using controls 
in the Property Inspector. The components of a table include rows, columns, and cells, 
and other elements such as table headers and footers. The table you created needs some
modifi cation. It’s rare that a table is created exactly right, and making small tweaks to the
column widths and the row heights is the norm.

9
233
Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Selecting table elements
1 
Click the Design view button in the Document toolbar and click anywhere on the
background of the page. In this case you do not want the table to be selected. Without
clicking, place your cursor over the edges of the table; you see the diff erent sections of 
the table light up with a red border. Also notice that your cursor switches to a black
arrow. The red border is Dreamweaver’s visual cue for which part of the table you will 
be selecting, and the black arrow points in the direction of the row or column to be 
selected.
2 
Place your cursor high in the upper-left corner until the entire table is outlined in red.
Click once, and the table is selected.
A red border designates which section of the table you are selecting—in this case, the entire table.
3 
Place your cursor to the left of the word Zone until you see the top row outlined; 
click once to select the row.
4 
Move your cursor to the top of the word Zone until you see the numbered column 
outlined in red; click once to select the column.
Selecting a single cell is a little trickier, as the red outlines only appear when your 
cursor is on the edge of a table, not inside of one.
5 
Click inside the cell with the word Zone. In order to select the cell, use the tag 
selector at the bottom left of your document window. These tags are an alternative
way to select parts of the table.

6 
Click the
tag fi rst; this selects the table just as you did in step 2. Click the
tag next; this selects the table row. The
tag appropriately stands for table
row. Lastly, click the 
 tag, and the cell itself is selected;
is defi ned as a table
cell in HTML. Note that in each of these cases the selected element is outlined in 
black.
Clicking the appropriate table tag in the tag selector selects that part of the table.
Some people prefer this method of selecting elements of their tables because it removes 
the chance that clicking the table will move or modify it.
7 
Click inside any cell in the table again, and choose Modify > Table > Select Table.
This is yet another way to select tables. The Modify > Table command is one
you’ll be returning to. You can also select the table by right-clicking (Windows) or 
Ctrl+clicking (Mac OS) the table and choosing Table > Select Table from the context 
menu.
Modifying table size
Although importing tabular data from a text fi le is quick and easy, the data is seldom 
formatted perfectly. When you fi rst imported the data, there was a choice to Fit Table 
Width To Data. The width of the table, when you choose this option, isn’t always
predictable due to the way Dreamweaver does its calculations. Although it is possible 
to set the width of the table during the import stage, this isn’t always convenient if you
don’t know what the data looks like. Luckily, it’s easy to change the size of tables in 
Dreamweaver. The fi rst thing you’ll do is set a fi xed width for the table.

9
235
Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Modifying table size
1 
If your table is not currently selected, select it now by clicking the 
tag in
the tag inspector. In the Property Inspector, type 550 in the W text fi eld and make 
sure the drop-down menu to the right is set to pixels, then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS). This expands the table to a width of 550 pixels. 
If necessary, re-select the table and look closely at the top of it; there is a visual guide 
outlined in green that displays the width of your table as well as the width of each
column. This guide will come in handy when you are trying to create precisely 
measured tables, although it can also be turned off .
You can turn off  this guide by choosing View > Visual Aids > Table Widths.
2 
Choose File > Save, then File > Preview in Browser and open this page in your 
browser. Resize the browser window a few times. Because the table has a fi xed width 
of 550 pixels, its width stays constant. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
3 
In the Property Inspector, your table should still be selected. In the W (Width) text 
fi eld, type 75 and choose % from the drop-down menu to the right; notice a change
in your table width in the Design view.
You can set the table width to a percentage of the browser window by using the Property Inspector.
Choose File > Save, then preview the page in your browser again and resize the
browser window. The table width now resizes because you set it to be a percentage 
rather than a fi xed width. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.

9
Modifying table size
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
236
4 
Reset your table to the original width by typing 550 in the W text fi eld and choosing 
pixels from the drop-down menu.
You also have the ability to resize the columns and rows in the Design view. You can 
do this manually using the Property Inspector.
5 
Place your cursor inside the table and then over the dividing line between the fi rst
column and the second column. Your cursor changes to a double-arrow. Click and
drag slowly to the right to expand the width of the fi rst column. This has the eff ect of 
reducing the second column’s width, although it leaves the third column’s width alone. 
After changing the column widths, notice at the top of the two columns there are blue
numbers that update showing the column widths. If these numbers do not appear,
move your cursor over the top of the columns to display. 
6 
Expand the fi rst column to at least 45 pixels; the content in the second column breaks 
to the next line. Place your cursor on the dividing line between the second and third 
column, and click and drag slowly to narrow the width of the third column (thereby
expanding the width of the second column). This example uses values of 395 pixels for 
the third column and 88 pixels for the second. 
If you are mathematically inclined, you may have noticed that the three column values don’t 
add up to 550. This is because there are additional factors of cell padding, cell spacing, and 
borders to consider.
Oftentimes, approximate column widths are not suffi  cient; Dreamweaver allows you 
to apply exact column widths in the Property Inspector.
7 
Place your cursor above the fi rst column until the red outline appears and click once 
to select the column. The bottom half of the Property Inspector now allows you to 
adjust the properties of only this column. Type 40 into the W text fi eld. The width
does not appear to change dramatically, but it is now 40 pixels.
Selecting a column and entering a specifi c width in the Property Inspector sets the column to that width.
8 
Click above the second column to select it. Type 100 into the W text fi eld. Click
above the third column and type 400 in the W text fi eld. (This will have little eff ect 
on the appearance of the table.) 
You also have the ability to create a fi xed height for rows.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Modifying table structure
9 
Click the left edge of the top row to select the whole row. In the Property Inspector,
type 35 in the H text fi eld, and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to apply 
the change.
Modifying table structure
In addition to modifying the width of columns and rows, the structure of a table often 
needs to be modifi ed (for example, adding and deleting rows and columns, as well as 
merging cells in the column). First, you’ll add a new row to the top of your table and 
then convert it to a header row. There are a few ways to add rows and columns in
Dreamweaver, you’ll begin with the Modify > Table command.
1 
Click inside any of the cells within the fi rst row. Dreamweaver needs to have some 
frame of reference when adding a row.
2 
Choose Modify > Table > Insert Rows or Columns. The Insert Rows or Columns 
dialog box opens.
3 
The Insert Rows radio button should be selected. For Number of rows, leave the 
default value of 1. In the Where section, select Above the Selection. Click OK to add the
new row to the top of the table.
Use the Insert Rows and Columns dialog box to add 
new rows or columns to an existing table.
4 
Place your cursor on the left side of the new row until the red outline appears. Click 
once to select it. In the Property Inspector, locate the Header check box and check
it to designate this row as a Header row. Behind the scenes, Dreamweaver uses the 
HTML
tag to defi ne this as a table header and the text will appear bold and
centered. This will help you style your table later on.
Now you’ll merge the three cells in this top row in order to add the header text that 
will span across your columns.
5 
With the top row still selected, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) to open 
a context menu. Choose Table > Merge Cells, and the three cells merge into one.
This is referred to as columnspan.

Click inside this merged cell and type US temperate zones with average min. 
temperatures.
Merging cells creates a columnspan, allowing you to add header text.
7 
Choose File > Save to save your work.
Creating a table
In addition to creating a table from tabular data, you can also create a table from the
ground up using Dreamweaver’s Insert Table command.
1 
Click to the right of your existing table, and then press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) two times. You will be placing a second table two lines below the fi rst.
2 
Choose Insert > Table, and the Table dialog box opens. Type 12 in the Rows text
fi eld, and 2 in the Columns text fi eld. Type 550 in the Table width text fi eld to match
the width of your fi rst table and make sure the drop-down menu is set to pixels. Set 
the Border thickness value to 1 if it is not already.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Creating a table
The Cell padding and Cell spacing values should have no value; you’ll return to these
properties shortly.
The Insert > Table command creates a new table.
3 
In the Header section, select the third option, Top, in order to designate the top row 
as the header. 
4 
In the Caption fi eld, type Best months to plant vegetables (Zones 4–7). Table 
captions are a bit more specifi c than table headers. A table caption is a short description
of the table contents and has its own
element; by default, they are 
displayed centered and at the top of the table. 
Table captions are not required, but they are useful, especially from an accessibility 
perspective, as they supply useful information to screen readers and other devices.
Click OK to insert the table.
5 
Below the caption, in the fi rst cell of the fi rst column, type Month. In the fi rst cell 
of the second column, type Vegetables to Plant. Your columns could shift; in order 
to adjust them, click the divider between the two columns, and click and drag it as
necessary to visually divide the two columns evenly.
6 
In the second row of the Month column, type April, then fi ve rows below, type May.

Broccoli. Press the down arrow on your 
keyboard to move to the next row. Using this technique, fi rst type Cabbage and
then type each vegetable name in its own row—fi rst Carrots and then Spinach. Skip 
one row and, making sure you are beginning in the same row as May, type Corn, 
Tomatoes, Peppers, Cucumbers.
Press keyboard arrows to quickly move from one cell to another when typing text.
8 
To delete the two extra rows at the bottom of the table, click in the fi rst cell of row 11, 
and then drag down and to the right. The four cells are selected. Press Delete to 
remove the rows.

Choose File > Save, and keep this fi le open for the next exercise.
Formatting and styling tables in HTML
There are two diff erent paths to take when it comes to styling a table. The fi rst method
is to use HTML tag properties to modify attributes such as the cell padding, border, and
background color in a table. However, these same attributes can also be controlled with 
the second method, CSS. It’s fair to say that there are more options for styling a table with
CSS; however, styling a table with HTML tags is faster for most people. Which method 
you choose often depends on the project specifi cations. You’ll be learning both methods 
here so that you have the option to choose. You’ll also get a chance to consider the pros 
and cons of both methods. First, you’ll start off  with the traditional method of styling tables
l
with HTML tags and properties. 

9
241
Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Formatting and styling tables in HTML
1 
In the second table you created (Best months to plant vegetables), click the edge of 
the header row to select it. In the Property Inspector, click the HTML category, if 
necessary, and then click the Bg (Background) color swatch. In the left column of 
swatches, choose the light gray (#CCCCCC). The background color of the header 
row changes to gray.
Select a row and click the Bg color swatch to apply a background color.
2 
Click inside the April cell, then drag down and to the right until you reach the cell
containing the text Spinach; this selects all the cells in these four rows and two columns.
3 
Click the Bg swatch and choose #FFFCCC, a light yellow swatch in the lower-right
corner. All four rows now have the same background color.
4 
Select the empty row between April and 
l
May. Click the Bg color swatch and choose
white for this background color. Then click in the May cell and drag down and to 
the right to the last cell containing the text Cucumbers. Click the Bg color swatch and
choose the light pink color swatch, #FFCCFF, in the bottom-right corner.
Now, you will center the text in your columns.
5 
Click at the top of the fi rst column to select it. In the Property Inspector, from Horz 
(Horizontal) drop-down menu, select Center. Select the second column and repeat
this step to center this text.
Select a column and click the Center option in the Horizontal menu of the Property Inspector.

6 
Choose File > Save, then File > Preview in Browser. Your text is visually categorized
by background color now, but it would be a stretch to say that this is a visually 
pleasing table. There are a few other properties that you can adjust to make this table
look a bit better. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver. 
You’ll now examine the properties of cell padding.
7 
Click in one of the corners of the table until the entire table is outlined in red. Then
click the table to select it. In the Property Inspector, locate the text fi eld for CellPad
and type 10. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to apply the change. There 
are now 10 pixels of space added to the inside of all cells. This has the eff ect of giving 
your text a bit more breathing room from the borders around it.
Cellpadding is a property that determines the amount of space, measured in pixels,
between the sides of a cell and its contents.
8 
With your table still selected, locate the text fi eld for CellSpace in the Property
Inspector. Type 10 in the CellSpace text fi eld, then press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) to commit the change. The table changes appearance again. This time, the
width between the cells is increased.
Cellspacing is the property that determines the amount of space between your cells.
A table with cellpadding of 10 pixels and cellspacing of 10 pixels.
The space between the cells (the cellspacing) is taking on the properties of the 
background color. Unfortunately, you cannot control the color of the cellspacing, and
so you will actually remove it completely.

9
243
Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Formatting and styling tables in HTML
9 
In the Property Inspector, type 0 in the CellSpace text fi eld and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This removes cellspacing completely. At this point, 
you only have properties for cellpadding. 
10 With the table still selected, locate the text fi eld for Border; it is currently set for 1 pixel,
which is the default setting used when a table is created. Replace this value with 0 and 
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This removes the border completely. 
This trick of removing borders completely is used quite a bit with pure HTML tables. 
This is because there are no good ways to control the appearance of borders using pure
HTML. Increasing the border size creates a thick, beveled look that can detract from
the rest of your page. Better control for borders exists in CSS.
11 Place your cursor on the small black square on the lower-right of the table until you
see the double-arrow. Click and drag the table to the left to reduce its width. You can 
use the value at the top of the table if you choose, or just change the width until you’re 
satisfi ed. This example uses a new width of 350 pixels.
Click and drag the edge of a table to reduce the width.

Formatting and styling tables in HTML
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

12 With the table still selected, click the Split view button in order to see the code
generated for this table. In the fi rst line of the table, you see the settings for the width,
height, border, and cell padding. In all the
or cells, you see the properties for 
alignment and background color repeated for every row. This extra code is part of 
the tradeoff  for the easy application of the color and alignment. Part of the dilemma 
with this table now is that the alignment and background color settings, as well as the 
cellspacing, cellpadding, and border settings, are not linked to your CSS in any way.
The visual styling of the table elements is combined with the structure.
One problem of creating pure HTML tables is the inability to quickly copy the style 
of one table and apply it to another. Because the content of the table and the style are 
intertwined, it’s hard to separate one from the other. The larger problem is that pure 
HTML tables have none of the benefi ts associated with CSS. If your tables are not linked 
to any CSS, what happens when you redesign your website? As you saw in the last lesson,
a simple change in CSS code can change the background color of your entire site. If the 
design of your tables clashes with your page, you have a lot of work to do as you locate 
each table and tweak it to fi t.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Formatting and styling tables with CSS
Formatting and styling tables with CSS
In this exercise, you’ll style your initial table using many of the same concepts covered in 
the previous exercise, such as padding and borders, but this time you’ll do it with CSS. 
There is a little bit more work involved initially, but the result will be a table that not only 
is more visually appealing than an HTML-based table but also has a reusable style that can
be applied to new tables. It’s possible to create tag-based styles for all your tables—in other 
words, to create CSS rules for the various HTML table elements (
, 
, and so on).
In fact, this is not a bad idea when creating a default style for tables in a website. In this
t
example, however, you will be creating a class style that can readily be applied to diff erent 
tables. It’s not unusual to have three or four diff erent styles of tables in a large website, each
with their own CSS class defi nitions.
First you’ll start by creating general rules for the background color, border, and font 
appearance of the table; then you’ll create more specifi c rules as you drill down into the table.
1 
Click the Design View button to return to this view. Select the fi rst table you created 
(US Temperate Zones…) by clicking one of the corners when you see the red outline. 
If necessary, choose Window > CSS Designer to open the CSS Designer panel.
2 
In the CSS Designer panel, select the mystyles.css external style sheet in the Sources
pane. This is an important step because you would like to add these styles to your 
external style sheet rather than writing them to the tips.html page only.
3 
Click the Add Selector button (
) in the bar at the top of the Selectors pane to create 
a new rule for the table. Dreamweaver will populate the selector fi eld with body table.
Click this name and change it to .styledtable. Press Enter (Windows) or Return
(Mac OS).
4 
Select the Background button ( 
) in the Properties Navigation bar to show the
background properties. Then click the background-color swatch, and choose the color 
white (#FFFFF).
Creating a new class for the style of the table 
and defi ning it in the external style sheet.
You see no changes onscreen because you need to apply the 
 class to
the table. You’ll do that now, and then return to adding more styles.

Your table should still be selected; if it isn’t, then select it now. In the Property 
Inspector, the table properties should be active. (If you are seeing the HTML and 
CSS properties, you have not selected the table.) On the right side of the Property
Inspector, choose styledtable from the Class drop-down menu to apply the class. The
background of your table changes to white.
Apply a class to a table by choosing the class name in the Property Inspector.
6 
Now you’ll return to the styledtable class style and add additional properties. You
could have created all your rules fi rst and then applied the styledtable class; however, 
doing it this way allows you to preview your styling in real-time. Now you’ll add
some borders and change the font-styling for the entire table.
7 
Click once on 
 in the Selectors pane of the CSS Designer panel to 
reselect the class.
Then select the Text button ( ) in the Properties Navigation bar to show the text 
properties.
8 
In the text properties, click to the right of the font-family property to activate the 
drop-down menu, and choose the Gotham, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-
serif font set.
9 
If necessary, scroll down to the font-size text fi eld, choose px for the units, and type 
10 for the value. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
10 Scroll back up to the color property, and click in the text fi eld to the right of the color 
swatch. Type #006 (a dark blue), and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to
see your changes to the table. Now you’ll add a thin border around the entire table.

11 Select the Border button (  ) in the Properties Navigation bar, and scroll down to the 
border-style property. Click to activate the drop-down menu and choose solid. From
the border-width drop-down, choose px, and type 1 in the text fi eld to its left. In the
border-color text fi eld, type #006, which is the same dark blue you used for the font-
color. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to see the results.
Your styled table with background-color, font styling, and a border.
The last property you’ll add to the .styledtable class is one that is not as common 
as the previous ones you’ve set. It’s important to realize that the language of CSS is 
quite large to begin with, and will continue to expand in the future. There are CSS
properties that might not be used every day but nonetheless can be very useful. You’ll 
add one such property now called border-collapse. This property removes the space
between table cells.

Advanced CSS styling of tables
You have created a basic style for this table. You will now sharpen up the appearance of 
this table by adding a background image to the header, setting the text alignment and 
padding, and fi nally, creating subtle borders between each of the data cells.
1 
Click anywhere inside the header, and in the lower-left corner of your document
window, click the 
 tag to select the header. You defi ned this top row as a table
header earlier in the lesson. 
2 
In the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, click mystyles.css to select your 
external style sheet fi le. This is an important step because you would like to add these 
styles to your external style sheet rather than writing them to the tips.html page only.
3 
Click the Add Selector button (
) in the bar at the top of the Selectors pane to
create a new rule for the header. The Selector Name text fi eld has been automatically
populated as
. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
accept this value. 
This compound rule is what you want because you are creating a specifi c rule for 
 tags, but only those found inside the 
 class. Remember that 
compound rules are read from left to right. So, within the .
 class, you
are targeting table rows
and specifi cally, table headers 
 within table rows.
Create a compound rule to style all header rows
within the .
 class.
4 
With the compound rule selected, select the Background button (
) in the Properties 
Navigation bar, and scroll down to the background-image property. Click in the url 
text fi eld, and press the Browse button to the right. In the Select Image Source dialog 
box, locate the bg_header.jpg image and press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).

right. The source image is a gradient that is designed to tile horizontally, and you’ll see a 
preview of this eff ect on your table. You’ll add a few other touches to this header row.
Choose a background image and tile it horizontally 
in the header row with repeat-x.
6 
Select the Border button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar, and scroll down to the 
border-bottom-width property. Click to choose px from the pull-down menu to the 
right, and type 2 in the text fi eld to its left. Then scroll up to the border-bottom-color 
property. Type #006 in the text fi eld to the right of the color swatch; this is the
same dark blue color that you’ve been using for other styling in this table. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS)to see the results.

font-size property. Click to choose px from the drop-down menu to the right, and 
type 14 into the text fi eld to its left to make the text slightly larger. Scroll down to 
the text-transform property, and click the Capitalize button (
). This property adds a
capital letter to the beginning of each word.
Your header row is now styled.

Choose File > Save All. Keep this fi le open as you will continue working on it in the 
next exercise.
Controlling cell alignment, padding, and borders with CSS
You’ll now make the content within your table a bit more readable by aligning your text
and padding your cells, as well as creating borders around each cell. Controlling borders 
and padding is much more fl exible in CSS than in HTML; for example, the cellpadding 
values in HTML are uniform—there is no control over left, right, top, and bottom, as there
is in CSS. The same applies to borders. However, before you begin styling padding with 
CSS, it’s a good idea to remove these values from the HTML so that there are no surprises.
1 
Click any corner of the table in order to select it. In the Property Inspector, notice the
values for CellPad and CellSpace; they are empty, but this stands for default, not zero.
You must specifi cally instruct Dreamweaver to use a value of zero.
2 
For all three properties of CellPad, CellSpace, and Border, type 0. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) when you have added the last value.
Type 0 for CellPad, CellSpace, and Border to make sure they are removed.

3 
Click inside any cell of your table, and in the bottom-left corner of your document
window, click the
 tag to select a cell. You could also Ctrl+click (Windows) or 
Command+click (Mac OS) a cell to select it.
4 
In the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, click mystyles.css. Then click the
Add Selector button (
) in the bar at the top of the Selectors tab to create a new rule. 
As in the last exercise, you are creating a Compound rule that applies only to cells 
within the 
class. Your selector name reads
.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to confi rm this setting.
5 
Select the Text button in the Properties Navigation bar, and scroll down to the text-
align property. Click the center button to the right to see all text in the table center.
Applying a text-align of center to the 
element 
centers all text in your cells.
6 
Select the Layout button in the Properties Navigation bar, and scroll down to the
padding property. Click the top value and type 5 in the text fi eld. Do the same for the
bottom value. Then click the left value and type 2 in the text fi eld.
One of the main diff erences between HTML cellpadding and CSS cellpadding is the 
ability in CSS to control all four sides of a cell’s padding individually.
7 
Select the Border button in the Properties Navigation bar, and scroll down to the
border-top-style. Click in the fi eld to the right to choose dashed from the drop-down 
menu.
8 
Scroll up in the Border properties, and in the border-color text fi eld, type #9AA8BD, 
the hexadecimal number for a light blue-gray. Press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) to apply the style.

The table as rendered in a web browser.
You’re nearly fi nished. Now you’ll add some fi nal touches to your table to give it a 
little extra polish and readability. Close your web browser.
Creating alternate row styling with CSS
A common feature found in many tables is to alternate colors for every other row. When 
done correctly, this increases the contrast between the rows and allows the user to visually 
separate the content of the table. This is easily done in CSS by creating a new class solely 
for background color.
Unlike the last few exercises, you will not be using a compound selection. Instead, you 
will be creating a new class. The reason for this is that you only want to style every other 
row. There is no automatic way to do this in CSS; after you create the class, it will have to 
be applied manually.

9
253
Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Creating alternate row styling with CSS
1 
Click the edge of the row labeled 1 to select it. In the Sources pane of the CSS
Designer panel, click mystyles.css. Then click the Add Selector button (+) in the bar 
at the top of the Selectors tab to create a new rule. Dreamweaver will populate the
selector name fi eld. Click the suggested name and change it to .oddrow.
2 
Select the Background button (
) in the Properties Navigation Bar to show the 
background properties. Then click in the fi eld to the right of the background-color 
swatch, and type #EAF1F4, the hexadecimal color for a light blue. Press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to set the color. 
Create a new class named 
to style 
individual rows.
Now you will apply the oddrow class to every other row.
3 
The row labeled 1 should still be selected; if not, do so now. In the Property Inspector, 
click the HTML button. From the Class drop-down menu, choose oddrow. The
light-blue background color is applied.
4 
Starting with the row labeled 3, apply the 
class to all the odd-numbered rows.
Styling alternating rows with a background color can improve readability.

Reusing CSS for other tables
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
254
Reusing CSS for other tables
As you have seen, CSS styling for tables is very powerful and capable of spicing up the 
appearance of tables without sacrifi cing their structure. Like CSS for text and layout, the
real power is obvious when you apply and link the style to another table.
1 
In the Files panel, double-click the fi le veggie_names.html. This page is currently
linked to the same external style sheet as the tips.html page, and includes an unstyled 
table. All that needs to be done is to apply the styledtable class you created to this 
table.
2 
Click anywhere in the table, and then click the 
 tag in the lower-left corner 
of the document window to select the table.
3 
In the Property Inspector, choose styledtable from the Class drop-down menu on the 
far right. The style is applied, and the appearance of this table matches the other. The 
style is fl exible enough that, even though the top row has three cells, it has the header 
style applied.
Applying the 
 class to a previously unstyled table.
That’s it! The hard work of creating the original style pays off  when it comes time
to creating new tables with identical style. Better yet, if you need to make a global
change such as changing the background-color or font color, changing a property in 
the external sheet will ripple through to all tables.
4 
To add the alternating rows of color, click the third row. In the Property Inspector,
click the HTML button, and from the Class drop-down menu, choose oddrow. 
Repeat this step with every other row to add the style.
The added benefi t of having this class handy is that some tables benefi t from this style
more than others, and so it is your decision whether or not to use it.

Choose File > Save All. Keep this fi le open for the next exercise.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Data sorting tables
Data sorting tables
There are a few other features related to managing tables that you might fi nd useful. The 
structure of tables can be both a blessing and a curse. For example, take a look at the
table from the previous exercise. What if you wanted to swap the order of the fi rst two 
columns? There is no easy way to do this with a static HTML table. Another limitation of 
tables, especially tables created from tabular data where you might not have control over 
the order, is the diffi  culty of sorting the data. Dreamweaver has a feature that allows you to
sort your data alphabetically by the column of your choice.
In the fi rst part of the exercise, you will do some copy-and-pasting in order to switch the
fi rst two columns.
1 
Click a corner of the table to select it. Choose Edit > Copy to copy the table.
2 
Click to the right of the table, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) twice, and 
choose Edit > Paste. You can copy and paste tables in Dreamweaver within a page, or 
from one page to another.
3 
In the fi rst table, click at the top of the second column (Common Name) to select the 
entire column. Choose Edit > Copy to copy the contents of the column. Now click
at the top of the fi rst column (Latin Name) to select it. Choose Edit > Paste to replace
the content of the fi rst column. You now have duplicate columns momentarily, but 
the next step is to copy content from the second table.
4 
In the second table, click the top of the fi rst column (Latin Name) to select it. Choose 
Edit > Copy to copy this column’s contents. Return to the fi rst table and click the top 
of the second column; then choose Edit > Paste.
5 
Select the second table and delete it now, as you no longer need it. 
Now you’ll sort the fi rst column alphabetically using Dreamweaver’s little-known Sort 
Table feature.

Select the fi rst table and choose Commands > Sort Table to open the Sort Table dialog 
box. You do not have to make any changes here because the default settings are fi ne, 
but take a quick look at the options. The Sort By menu allows you to choose which 
menu Dreamweaver will use to sort. The Order menu allows you to choose how the 
table should be sorted, either alphabetically or numerically. Alphabetically is correct
for now.
Choose Commands > Sort Table to sort a table alphabetically.

Lesson 9, Working with Tables
Review 
Self study
Using your new knowledge of creating tables to display data in Dreamweaver, try some of 
the following tasks to build on your experience:
Use the Import Tabular Data command to import a tab-delimited .txt fi le, setting the 
table’s fi xed width on import. Select the table using the Tag Selector, and change its width 
to 50 percent of the page size using the Property Inspector. Preview the table in a browser, 
noting the way the table changes as the browser window is resized.
Build another table using the Insert Table command, and add a caption to it. Type text 
into the cells, center the text, and drag the row and column dividers to make them 
consistent in size. Add a background color and a border to the table using the Property 
Inspector, and switch to Code View to note the changes to your HTML code. 
Create and use an internal CSS rule to change the font used, add padding to the cells,
and alternate the colors of your fi rst table’s rows. Experiment with applying the class rule
to your second table, and note how its appearance changes. Finally, use the Sort Table 
command to organize both your tables’ data alphabetically.
Review 
Questions
1 
What’s the diff erence between a percentage-based table and a fi xed-width table?
2 
What is tabular data and how does it relate to tables in Dreamweaver?
3 
Name an advantage and a disadvantage of using CSS to style your tables.
Answers
1 
A percentage-based table stretches to fi t the size of the browser window. A fi xed-
width table does not resize because it is pixel-based.
2 
Tabular data is text often exported from a database or spreadsheet in a delimited 
format. Dreamweaver creates tables from these fi les through the Import Tabular Data 
command found in the File menu. Rows and columns are automatically created in 
Dreamweaver based on the structure of the text fi le.
3 
One advantage of using CSS to style tables is the ability to link a single style to 
multiple tables using an external style sheet. A disadvantage might be that the process 
requires more time in the beginning, and a good understanding of HTML table tags
and CSS selectors.

Customizing panels and panel groups
Panels can be moved, grouped, and docked to help keep everything you regularly use at
your fi ngertips. In the next part of this lesson, you’ll create a custom workspace for CSS
layouts. You’ll start by removing certain panels and repositioning the remaining panels.
1 
Make sure your dw10lessons folder has been defi ned as a site as described in the
Starting Up section. This fi rst exercise does not require any of the lesson fi les as you
will be focusing on the workspace.
To ensure you are starting from the same workspace as we are, choose 
Window > Workspace Layout > Compact. Then choose ‘Reset Compact’. 
You will now customize your panels.
2 
Locate the CSS Designer tab, click the panel menu in the top right, and then choose 
Close Tab Group.
3 
Double-click the Insert tab to close that panel. Click once on the Insert tab to show it
again.
4 
From the Window menu, choose CSS Designer to reopen that tab group. 
5 
Click once on the Files tab to expand that panel.
Click the Files tab to show the Files panel.
There are two panels within the CSS Designer panel group: CSS Designer and CSS 
Transitions. The CSS Transitions panel is currently hidden. In order to see both panels
simultaneously, you’ll drag the CSS Transitions panel out of the tab group.

Customizing panels and panel groups
6 
Click and hold the CSS Transitions tab. Drag this tab into your workspace to remove
it from the CSS panel group. This now becomes a fl oating window, which you can
keep fl oating if you want. Many users prefer to have all their panels within a single
column, so you’ll add it back in now.
Dragging the CSS Transitions panel out of the CSS Designer panel group turns it into 
a fl oating window.
7 
To keep the CSS Transitions panel from interfering with your workspace, you can 
dock it with the other panels. Place your cursor over the CSS Transitions tab at the top
of the panel, and click and hold.
8 
Drag the CSS Transitions panel immediately above the title bar of the CSS Designer 
panel group. Be careful here: if the entire CSS Designer panel is highlighted blue, 
you will be adding to the group. You are looking for a thin blue line above the CSS
g
Designer tab; this indicates that you are creating a new group. When a solid line
appears above the CSS Designer panel group, release the CSS Transitions panel to snap
it into place.

If necessary, adjust the width and height of the panels by placing your cursor on the 
edges of any panel group. When the black double-arrow appears, you can click and
drag to adjust as needed. When you’re fi nished, the panels should look similar to the 
example shown here. This confi guration gives you quick access to the panels you’ll use 
the most when creating a CSS-based layout.

they will collapse to the icon view.
11 Click the Files icon; that group will expand so you can work with it. This group will 
temporarily stay open until you start working on the document or click another icon.
You can decide whether you prefer to work in the expanded panel view or the icon 
view. For now, you’ll return to the panel view.

Using the Favorites tab on the Insert bar
To help organize the many options available in the Insert bar, Dreamweaver groups similar 
items into categories. You might already be using some items more often than others. The 
Favorites category is a great way to group commonly used items into one place for quick 
access. 
1 
Double-click the index.html fi le in the Files panel. In this exercise, you’ll be inserting 
a number of images and AP Divs to create two pages in the Sounds of Nature website.
These options are currently hidden within the insert panel, so you’ll need to expand it.
2 
Expand the Insert panel by clicking the Insert tab at the top of the panel. If necessary, 
adjust the heights of your available panels by dragging the borders between them.
The Insert panel has a large number of options available within numerous categories. 
If you fi nd yourself inserting the same objects over and over, you might want to group 
them. You can do this with the Favorites category of the Insert panel.
3 
Select the Favorites category from the Insert panel’s drop-down menu. Right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) in the empty gray area beneath the Favorite
category, and choose Customize Favorites from the resulting context menu. The
Customize Favorite Objects dialog box appears.

Select Image and click the Add button.
5 
Locate Div from the list of available objects; then click the Add button. Click OK.
The Favorites category now features the Image and Div elements.
Resizing the document window
If you’re familiar with any page layout or graphics programs, adjusting the size of the
window in which you’re working is probably something that you do regularly. However, 
when you’re working on web pages in Dreamweaver, it’s a good idea to think carefully
about the size of your document. Because a number of diff erent hardware and software
confi gurations might be used to view your content, it can be tricky to make sure your 
website looks acceptable on every user’s computer. In the next part of this lesson, you’ll 
resize the document window to make sure the Sounds of Nature website is being designed 
with the target audience in mind.
1 
Index.html should still be open in your document window. If not, open it now. 
Also, make sure you’re in the Design view. If necessary, click the Design button in the 
Document toolbar.

A. Mobile Size (480 × 800). B. Tablet Size (768 × 1024). C. Desktop Size (1000 × 620). D. Window Size.
Pay particular attention to the numbers 1000 × 484 in our figure; this is the Window
Size. It is quite likely your numbers will be different. This number represents the full 
width Dreamweaver is capable of displaying given the user’s screen size. Because we 
are using a monitor set to 1024 × 768, this is as wide as Dreamweaver can display the 
page on our screen.
r

Click the Window Size numbers to access a menu. The default setting is actually set to
the Full Size option. Dreamweaver calculates these numbers instantly.
You will also that see there are other monitor size options in this menu. From the 
menu, choose the option that reads 1260×875. What happens on your screen depends 
on the size of your monitor. On our 1024 × 768 monitor, a scroll bar appears that
allows us to scroll over to the right of the document. Generally speaking, you can
leave this setting to Full Size unless you have a specifi c need to preview your page in 
diff erent size screens.
The second value seen in this step, 1280 × 1024 Maximized, refers to the true size of the page 
as if the user were maximizing their browser window to the fullest. The 1260 × 875 number is a
more realistic estimate of the available space a web browser would occupy on the screen (accounting 
for browser features, such as scroll bars).
There are three monitor icons that will allow you to change the window size to three 
diff erent presets.
4 
Click the fi rst icon to the left of the Window Size numbers. This is the Mobile Size 
(480 × 800) preset.
The Mobile Size preset changes the dimensions of the screen to 480 pixels wide by 800 high.

Lesson 10, Fine-Tuning Your Workfl ow
Using guides
This will set the window size to 480 pixels wide by 800 high and have the eff ect of 
cropping your current page. The goal here is to show you the window size as if you
were viewing the site with a mobile device. Although this can be a useful feature, it’s a
bit deceptive. Dreamweaver is not trying to reproduce the behavior of a web browser 
on a smartphone; it’s simply limiting the width and height of your current window.
A more sophisticated method of designing your pages for mobile devices is covered in 
Lesson 16, “Responsive Design and Layout for Mobile Devices.” 
5 
Click the next icon to the right, which is the Tablet size. Note the change in the 
screen. Click the last icon, which is the Desktop view and is set to 1000w, indicating 
the width of the screen is 1000px and the height is unspecifi ed.. All these settings can
be useful if you want to see how your designs appear in these diff erent size screens.
Just remember that there is no substitute for seeing your design in a web browser.

Click the Window Size menu, and then click the Full Size option to set the screen
e
back to the maximum amount of space on your monitor.
Using guides
In Lesson 5, “Creating Page Layouts with CSS,” you learned how absolute-position divs 
can be added to a page for precise layout. Guides can be a useful tool for absolute-position
divs, as well as the other types of layout techniques, because they allow you to line up and
measure diff erent elements on your page. In this exercise, you’ll add an absolute-position 
div to index.html, and then place an image inside the div. First, you’ll draw some guides 
to help you size and position the div.
1 
If your rulers are hidden, choose View > Rulers > Show to turn them on.
Rulers can use inches, centimeters, or pixels in Dreamweaver. Because pixels are the most 
common unit of measurement on the Web, they are the default. If you prefer inches or 
centimeters, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the rulers to access a context menu 
where you can choose your preferred unit. In this lesson, you’ll be using pixels, so it’s a good idea
to stick with them for now.
2 
Click inside the vertical ruler on the left side of your document window, and then
drag a guide into the center of the page. Notice, as you drag, that a yellow box appears 
with the pixel number of your horizontal ruler. When you let go and move your 
cursor off  the ruler, it will disappear.
Dragging a guide manually is useful, but you can also set a guide’s position precisely.
3 
Double-click this guide to open the Move Guide dialog box. From this dialog box, 
you can set an exact location for guides. This feature can be especially helpful when 
building a web page based on sketches or mockups.
4 
Type 38 in the Location text fi eld and click OK. The guide is repositioned 38 pixels 
from the left side of the document.

5 
Create another vertical guide and set its position to 494 pixels, either by dragging it to 
this position or setting its value precisely.
What if you wanted to determine the exact width between these two guides you just
added? Instead of using a calculator, you can allow Dreamweaver to do it for you.
6 
Press and hold the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key and move your 
cursor across the three sections of your page as defi ned by the guides. A blue line with
arrows on either end indicates the distance between each of your guides, as well as 
the distance between guides and the edge of the document window. Between the two
guides, you can now see that the width is exactly 456 pixels.
Press and hold Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) and hover over the vertical areas defi ned 
by guides.
7 
Drag two horizontal guides down from the ruler at the top of the document window.
Double-click each of them, and then use the Move Guide dialog box to position one 
of them 152 pixels from the top of the document, and the other 380 pixels from the 
top of the document.

make sure that Snap to Guides is turned on, by choosing View > Guides > Edit 
Guides. The Guides dialog box appears, with a number of options for customizing 
your guides.
If you happen to be using a color in your web page that makes the guides hard to see,
you can change their color here. Also, the Lock Guides option can be a helpful way to
avoid accidentally repositioning guides. For now, make sure Snap to Guides is checked
and click OK.
The Guides dialog box allows you to change the color of guides and 
turn snapping on and off .
9 
Now that your guides are set up, you’re ready to add some content. With the Favorites
category selected in the Insert panel, click the Div object. 
10 In the Insert Div dialog box that appears, you can leave Insert set to At Insertion Point 
and type photo for the ID. Then click OK to create the div.
Next, you will use the CSS Designer panel to style this div as a absolute positioned
div, which will allow you to resize and reposition it on the page.
11 With the newly created
 div selected, click styles.css in the Sources pane, then 
click the Add Selector button in the Selectors pane. Dreamweaver will suggest the 
Selector name
. Change this to simply read #photo and press
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

Using grids
Using grids
Much like guides, grids are a great way to help keep your layout precise and uniform.
In the next part of this lesson, you’ll be adding absolute-position divs and images to the 
About page of the Sounds of Nature website. Creating a custom grid will help you align 
and evenly distribute these new elements on the page.
1 
Double-click the about.html fi le in your Files panel to open the About page. You 
might notice that this page has a white background and uses a default typeface. Later 
on, you’ll use the tag selector to change this.
2 
Choose View > Grid > Grid Settings to open the Grid Settings dialog box. Much like 
the Guides dialog box, the Grid Settings dialog box can be used to specify the grid
color and turn on snapping. Type #CCCCCC in the Color text fi eld and check Show
Grid and Snap to Grid to turn the grid on and enable snapping.
3 
For this layout, type 38 in the Spacing text fi eld and make sure pixels are selected as 
the unit of measurement. Choosing a spacing of 38 pixels creates a series of squares 
that are 38 pixels high by 38 pixels wide. Click Apply to preview the grid settings, 
then click OK.

With the grid established, add the absolute-position divs that will house your images.
Using the techniques described in steps 9–13 above, create a square, absolute-position 
div that is 3 grid units wide and 3 grid units high. When prompted, name the new div 
ID box_1 and name the new Selector #box_1.
Create a square, absolute-position div.

7 
In the Select Image Source dialog box, select tree.jpg from the images folder inside
the dw10lessons folder, and click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS). The tree image
is positioned inside the div on your page.
8 
Repeat steps 6 and 7 to add forest.jpg to the second div.

9 
Choose File > Save and leave about.html open for the next part of this lesson.
The tag selector
In HTML, the organization of elements takes the form of a family tree. In the previous 
two exercises, you created absolute-position divs and then inserted images into them. In 
HTML terms, all these images are children of the divs within which they reside. The tag 
selector is a feature of Dreamweaver that allows you to select HTML elements based on 
their relationship to one another. The tag selector has been used in previous sections of 
this book, but in this exercise you’ll use it to apply a single style that will aff ect the entire 
about.html page.

With the About page open, click once on the forest image that you inserted at the 
end of the last exercise. At the bottom-left corner of the document window are a
number of HTML tags. This is the tag selector. The 
tag at the end of this line
is highlighted to indicate that the forest.jpg image is selected. In addition, the Property 
Inspector displays information and options related to this image.
With the forest image selected, the 
 tag in the tag selector is highlighted and the Property Inspector displays information 
and options related to this image.
2 
In the tag selector, click the 
 tag to the left of the 
tag. Notice
that the options in the Property Inspector change to refl ect the selected div. In this 
case, you’ve selected the parent of the forest image.
3 
To further illustrate this relationship, choose Edit > Select Child from the main menu.
The
 tag becomes highlighted in the tag selector, and the Property Inspector 
changes to refl ect the selected element.

Tiling documents
4 
Now, select <
> on the far-left side of the tag selector. The Property Inspector 
displays options and information related to the <
> tag. Click the CSS button 
in the Property Inspector if necessary and then, from the Targeted Rule drop-down
menu, choose body_style.
With the 
tag selected in the tag selector, choose body_style from the Targeted Rule drop-down menu.
Because many CSS properties are inherited throughout the document, it is possible 
to write generalized rules that will be applied to all the elements on a page. In this 
case, body_style changes the font and text color for the entire document because every 
element is a descendant of the body.
5 
Choose File > Save and leave about.html open for the next part of this lesson.
Tiling documents
By default, Dreamweaver organizes open documents with a series of tabs in the upper-left 
corner of the document window. If you’d like to compare documents, or you simply prefer 
to use separate windows for each document, the tiling option provides an alternative for 
viewing open fi les. Next, you’ll use this feature to simultaneously view the index page and 
the about page of the Sounds of Nature website.
1 
Both index.html and about.html should still be open. If they are not, open them 
now.
2 
Choose Window > Tile Vertically (Windows) or Window > Tile (Mac OS). This 
will send the two pages into two windows side-by-side. This feature can be useful for 
dragging and dropping objects from one page to another or to work on both pages if 
you have a big enough monitor.
The fastest way to group these two pages back together is diff erent depending which 
platform you are on, Windows or MacOS.

3 
On the Mac, click the index.html tab, drag it to the about.html tab, and then 
release it. They will now be grouped as tabs again. On Windows, the best way to 
group the two document windows again is to click the maximize button in the top 
right corner of one of the documents.
Self study
In this lesson, you followed a predetermined workfl ow that was tailored toward producing 
two pages in the Sounds of Nature website. The key to creating a streamlined workfl ow 
is planning ahead. Imagine you were creating a website for a local bakery. Make some 
sketches of what the pages would look like. In Dreamweaver, spend some time setting 
up a workspace that would make building the bakery website easier. Think about which 
elements you might use the most. Then, use the guides and the grid to help create a layout 
that refl ects the sketches you made earlier.

1 
Is it possible to resize the document window to preview how a web page will appear 
on diff erent users’ monitors?
2 
How can you position guides on the page without dragging them?
3 
Are tabs the only way to organize open documents?
Answers
1 
Yes. The Window Size drop-down menu at the bottom of the document window 
contains a number of preset sizes that correspond to common monitor sizes.

Lesson 11, Adding Video, Audioand Interactivity 
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Inserting HTML5 video
• Inserting Flash video
• Adding QuickTime and 
Windows Media content
• Inserting animations with 
Flash and Edge Animate
• Adding audio content to 
your web pages
Lesson 11
To meet the expectations of users with increased bandwidth, 
designers are increasingly turning to animation, sound, and video 
to help make web content more compelling and visually engaging. 
Dreamweaver CC adds support for HTML5 audio and video and 
integration with Adobe Edge Animate for plug-in free multimedia. 
Starting up 
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this 
book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw11lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create a site defi nition that points to the dw11lessons folder. 
Go to Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site defi nition, refer to Lesson 2, 
“Setting Up a New Site.”

See Lesson 11 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Making web content interesting
Adding video, sound, and animation to a web page is one way to make your pages more
interesting and engaging. Video, for example, plays a key role in supplying interesting and 
varied web content. The barrier to creating original video has been virtually eliminated in
recent years as has the barrier to distributing these videos online. Videos allow individuals 
and companies to post commercials, speeches, and other content that otherwise would be
diffi  cult or cost-prohibitive to reach a large audience.
Sound allows you to enhance web pages by supplementing visual content with music or 
sound eff ects. Sound also inspires user interaction (as you’ll see later in this lesson), thereby
giving the user a more interesting online experience. 
Animation gives web pages a whole new life by adding movement and eff ects to images 
that still pictures just can’t match. Something moving on a web page automatically draws 
a visitor’s eye. Movement is especially eff ective for banner ads, buttons, and whatever else
you’d like your visitors to pay attention to.
Adding video
Adding video to a web page is relatively easy, assuming the video has already been
optimized for the Web. A full discussion about the various fi le formats and how to convert 
digital video to a web-optimized format is beyond the scope of this book. However, the
decision to include web video should be based on an evaluation of your audience. The 
large fi le sizes associated with video can aff ect the experience of users who don’t have 
high-speed Internet connections. In this section, you will learn how to integrate video
into your web pages using four of the most popular formats: HTML5 video, Flash Video, 
QuickTime and Windows Media.
If you have just fi nished Lesson 10, you might still have your grids and rulers turned on. They 
are not necessary for this lesson and you can turn them off  by choosing View > Rulers and 
unchecking Show and choosing View > Grid > and unchecking Show Grid.
HTML5 video
Before the advent of HTML5, you needed third party plug-ins such as Flash Player, 
QuickTime, or Silverlight to show video. HTML5 is quickly replacing this need by
specifying an HTML video element that runs natively in the browser and integrates with 
JavaScript. Additionally, the HTML5 video element allows you to specify alternative

When you insert an HTML5 video fi le you need to manually enter the size of the 
fi le: Dreamweaver will not automatically detect it for you. In the Property Inspector, 
type 400 in the W (width) fi eld and 300 in the H (height) fi eld. Setting the height and 
width of the video element will ensure other content on the page can load and fl ow
around the video element as the page loads. 
Dreamweaver enables the browser’s native player controls by default, by placing a
checkmark in the Controls check box in the Property Inspector. You would clear this
check box if you did not want the player controls to appear.

Flash video
Flash video has been widely used for web video for a number of years and is still widely 
in use for a large number of sites. This is changing somewhat due to the rise of mobile 
devices (and specifi cally the lack of support for Flash video on these devices). Nevertheless,
one of the primary advantages of Flash video is that playback is enabled for any browser 
with the Flash Player plug-in. Because more than 95% of all desktop web browsers have
r
some version of the plug-in installed, this means your video will fi nd the widest possible 
audience. Again, this is not always true on mobile. Additionally, Flash video can be
compressed to a reasonable size while maintaining image quality.
Diff erent programs create Flash video including the Adobe Media Encoder, Premiere 
Pro, and even Photoshop. Creating a video is a separate process, so you’ll want to do 
your homework and learn as much as you can about how it works in order to get the best 
results. There are essentially two fi le formats that are used in Flashvideo: .fl v and .f4v. The
.fl v format is the traditional Flash video format and .f4v is a newer format. In this exercise, 
you’ll add a pre-existing .fl v video fi le into your page and add simple player controls to 
allow users to control the playback of the movie.

In thihis exam lple, Progres isive Dow lnload Vi
Video was hchosen inste d
ad of Streaming Vi
Video because hthe 
former is the more common method among web developers. Progressive Download Video works 
by downloading the video to the user’s hard-drive; however, the video will start to play as soon as
it is able. In other words, the user doesn’t have to wait for the entire video to download in order 
to see it. Streaming Video streams video content and plays it on a web page after a short buff er 
period. The buff er period ensures smooth playback. The catch is that to enable Streaming Video, 
your videos must be accessible through a web streaming service such as Adobe Flash Media
Server. If you want to learn more about the process, click the Help button on the Insert FLV 
dialogg box.
Next, you’ll want to select a skin. A skin is a control panel that shows up on the 
bottom of the video, and allows the user to control video playback. In other words,
this is where users can play, rewind, and fast-forward their videos.

Click the Skin drop-down menu to examine the choices. You see a preview of the 
skin just below the menu. In our case, we used Corona Skin 3.
A number of skins are available in the Skin drop-down menu.
If your video is ten seconds or longer, choose a skin that includes a slider control so that users can 
scroll through the video at their convenience.
When you select a skin, such as Corona Skin 3, Dreamweaver will add several fi les to 
your site that are required to properly display and activate the player controls. In this
case, Corona_Skin_3.swf provides the player controls and FLVPlayer_Progressive.swf 
provides the functionality to control video playback. These fi les should be uploaded to 
your web server along with your HTML and asset fi les in order for the FLV player to 
load properly.
4 
Click the Detect Size button so that Dreamweaver can establish the physical space the 
video will occupy on the page. The size is based on the size of the actual video.
You can manually type in a size, too, although be sure you are aware of the dangers 
here. Entering a size that’s bigger than the original video will either blur or pixelate 
your video. Additionally, the ratio of the width to height of a video is called the aspect 
ratio, and if you enter a width and height that do not match the original aspect ratio,
then your viewers will see distorted video. In general, you should let Dreamweaver 
detect the video size.

return to Dreamweaver when you are fi nished previewing. At this point you can also 
close fl ashvideo.html.
The Flash video and player controls on your page.
QuickTime and Windows Media 
QuickTime and Windows Media are also common video formats used on the Web. In 
many ways they are similar; both off er compressed video with various levels of image and 
sound quality. When adding either fi le format to a page, the key thing to keep in mind is 
that viewers must have the necessary plug-in to view the video. Unlike Flash video, this
is not necessarily a sure thing. QuickTime is traditionally Mac OS-based and Windows
Media Video is traditionally Windows-based.
You can download QuickTime from Apple.com/quicktime/download. To view
Windows Media fi les, you need Windows Media Player, which you can download at 
Microsoft.com/en-us/windows/download-windows-media-player/. (At the time of this writing,
/
there was no plug-in support from either Apple or Microsoft that allowed Windows 
Media Video to play on a Mac. However, there are third-party plug-ins that provide this
functionality.)

11
287
Lesson 11, Adding Video, Audioand Interactivity 
Adding video
The diff erence between the video formats is that users create QuickTime and Windows
Media video using diff erent software applications, for example Adobe Premiere Pro and
Apple Final Cut Pro. 
The process for inserting either QuickTime or Windows Media Video is the same. In this
example, you can choose either format depending on your platform.
1 
In the Files panel, open insertvideo.html. If necessary, click below the heading, 
A look at our vegetables.
2 
Choose Window > Assets to bring up the Assets panel. Select the Movies button (
) 
to show the videos available in your site.
3 
Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the veggies.mov fi le (or the
veggies.wmv if in Windows) and choose Insert from the context menu to insert it into 
the page. You’ll see a plug-in icon on the page, indicating that a plug-in is required to 
see the fi le.
Inserting QuickTime or Windows Media video fi les creates a generic plug-in icon.
4 
When you insert a plug-in fi le, you need to manually enter the size of the fi le;
Dreamweaver will not automatically detect it for you. You will also need to add
20 pixels to the height to make room for built-in player controls. The source video
here is 320 by 240 so in the Property Inspector, type 320 in the W (width) window 
and 260 in the H (height) window. 
Again, you are using 260 for the height to allow space for the controller. QuickTime 
and Windows Media fi les already have a controller built in with the plug-in. You 
need to allow a little extra space for the video controls when you’re entering a size
manually.

To preview the fi le within Dreamweaver, click the Live button to enter Live View. 
If you see a message that Dreamweaver was unable to fi nd the plug-in that handles this 
media type, it does not necessarily mean your system cannot play the video (although
this is still possible). It only means that Dreamweaver can’t fi nd the correct plug-in.
If this should happen, try to preview the video in your browser; you might fi nd it 
works there. Save your fi le if prompted and your video should now appear on your 
web page.
The problem of playing video on your system might also have to do with the lack of a codec. Web
video can get a little tricky because there are fi le formats (such as .mov or .wmv) and there are 
codecs. The codec does the job of actually compressing the frames of your video and there could 
be any number of codecs used for a particular fi le format. Both QuickTime and Windows Media 
Player are generally good at identifying which codec you or your users might be missing and then
providing links to download and install the necessary codec.

Inserting Flash animations
Other web video considerations
In addition to size, consider the following when you’re preparing video for the Web:
Length: Unless you’ll be offering video through a streaming video service, keep the video
length down to keep the file size manageable and the progressive playback smooth.
Audio: Although stereo is nice, using stereo files on the Web is a little iffy, as many home 
users don’t have stereo speakers hooked up to their computers. Stereo creates a larger file size 
and doesn’t add that much to the quality of the sound unless you’re doing some tricks with
the balance between the speakers, which people without speakers won’t hear anyway. Keep 
your video sound set to mono to help manage the file size a bit more effectively.
Movement, animated graphics, and effects: These things make a video look nice, but
adding them can increase the file size and potentially interrupt playback.
Copywritten material: Be careful when choosing material for your video, especially when
it comes to music. Pirating is a big issue today. Unless you have the rights to the music or you 
have permission from the music publisher and are paying royalties, you can’t use music for 
promotional or commercial purposes when it comes to publishing material on the Web.
Inserting Flash animations
Adobe’s Flash Professional CC application is used primarily to create animation and 
interactive projects. In terms of animation, you can use Flash to create animated web 
banners, buttons, splash pages, slide shows, and more. Inserting Flash animations into your 
web page is a great way to bring life to an otherwise static environment.
Web banners are a signifi cant component of online advertising, and if a web banner 
includes moving elements, that movement automatically draws the user to the banner. In 
this exercise, you will add a fl ash banner to place on a website.

As you can see, inserting a Flash .swf into a web page is much like inserting an image. 
The width and height of the .swf are automatically established based on the fi le’s 
physical size, just as they are for images such as .jpeg and .gif fi les.
The .swf fi le appears with a generic Flash icon on a gray image.
You must have Flash Player, which is available free from Adobe, installed to view an .swf fi le. If 
you don’t have the application installed, visit adobe.com/products/fl ashplayer to download 
r
and install it. Note that visitors to your website also must have Flash Player installed to view 
your Flash content. A good rule of thumb when including Flash content on a website is to let 
visitors know as soon as they get to your site that they’ll need to have Flash Player. Be sure 
to include the link to the Flash Player web page (the URL provided at the beginning of this
paragraph) so that visitors can download the Flash Player, if necessary.

After previewing, close the browser and the banner.html fi le. There are other 
options in the Properties Inspector available for Flash fi les. If you have the Flash 
authoring program installed you could click the Edit button, for example, and locate 
the .FLA authoring fi le connected with the .swf fi le. This would allow an easy link if 
you needed to update or modify your sidebar ad.
When designing web pages, be sure to include space in your design for .swf fi les, if you’re going 
to incorporate them into the page. The fi les can vary in size, depending on what you’re using 
them for. To learn more about Flash, visit adobe.com/products/fl ash.
Inserting Edge Animate animations
Dreamweaver CC adds support for inserting assets from Adobe Edge Animate, part of the 
Adobe Edge Suite. Like Flash, Edge Animate is used to create animation and interactive
projects for the Web. However, Edge Animate creates assets that use HTML5 and 
JavaScript and do not require plug-ins to display. In this exercise, you will insert an Edge
Animate banner similar to the Flash banner inserted in the last exercise.

In the Files panel, navigate to the dw11lessons folder, and double-click the 
edgebanner.html page to open it.

Click in the empty div element at the top of the sidebar on the right. Choose 
Insert > Media > Edge Animate Composition; the Select Edge Animate Package 
dialog box opens.

Inserting an Edge Animate object into a web page is much like inserting a Flash
video. The width and height of the .oam are automatically established based on the
information in the package. In Design view, Edge Animate objects appear with a
generic Animate icon on a gray image. Unlike Flash objects, Dreamweaver can render 
the Edge Animate object in Live view without the need for a plug-in.

After previewing, close the browser and the edgebanner.html fi le.
Inserting sound with the HTML5 audio element
Sound is another element you can use to enhance your website. Prior to HTML5, 
adding sound was only accomplished through the use of a plug-in such as QuickTime or 
Windows Media Player. The HTML5 audio element allows you to embed audio in your 
web page and allow it to be played using the browser’s native audio controls.
You can incorporate diff erent types of sound fi les into a web page. Select a format that will 
run on any computer, whether the user is on the Windows or Mac OS platform. Three
formats are common: .aif, .wav, and .mp3.
Files in the .aif or .wav format are similar; the main diff erence is where they originate. 
Windows is generally linked to the .wav format, and Mac OS is associated with the .aif 
format. The Windows and Mac OS platforms can read both formats. In addition, these
fi les sound similar to one another: both are dynamic and depending on the settings can
result in high-quality fi les.

295
Lesson 11, Adding Video, Audioand Interactivity 
Inserting sound with the HTML5 audio element
You can also play .mp3 format fi les on both the Windows and Mac OS platforms. The big 
advantage to using an .mp3 fi le is that it’s typically smaller in size than an .aif or .wav fi le. 
Depending on the compression settings, the .mp3 format might not reproduce full CD-
quality sound, but it downloads faster and takes up less hard drive space. In this exercise,
you’ll add an mp3 fi le to your page.

In the Files panel, double-click the sound.html fi le. Click in the empty paragraph
just below the What fruit is being eaten in this clip? paragraph.

Choose Insert > Media > HTML5 Audio.
Choose the HTML5 Audio option to insert sound.
Dreamweaver will insert the HTML5 audio element using a speaker icon as a 
placeholder. The Property Inspector will display the various settings that can be
applied to the audio element.

Preparing audio for the Web
Audio has the same considerations as any other digital file type. You need to pay attention to 
file size while trying to maintain quality. 
Various programs offer audio-editing and format capabilities. This includes programs such as 
Adobe Audition CC, Apple Logic Pro, and Audacity (which is available as a free download
on the Web).
Once you’ve edited a sound to your liking, you need to set up certain technical specifications
for the final file. This includes the type of file you’ll output (.mp3, .aif, and so on), whether 
the sound is in stereo or mono, and a sample rate. For the Web, a good sample rate is in the 
22kHz–32kHz range; 22kHz is at the low end of acceptable quality, and anything higher 
than 32kHz starts to weigh down the file size. 
Stereo is nice, but unnecessary, unless you’re moving sound from the left speaker to the right 
speaker and vice versa. You can save a significant amount of file space by keeping the sound 
file set to mono.
There are a number of compression choices when it comes to audio. Your best bet is to 
experiment and see what gives you the results you want. Creating audio files is very much
like creating video for the Web: there are no definite answers, and you need to experiment to
find the best balance between file size and quality.
To learn more about digital audio go to http://help.adobe.com/en_US/audition/cs/using/
and select the Digital Audio Fundamentals link.

Lesson 12, Maximizing Site Design
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Using snippets
• Working with library items
• Creating and modifying 
templates
• Creating a repeating region 
in a template
Lesson 12
Dreamweaver site defi nitions allow you to take advantage of 
extensive management and maintenance tools, including the ability 
to reuse, repeat, and maintain common items such as menus, logos, 
code, and even entire page layouts. Dreamweaver’s unique snippets, 
library items, and page templates are indispensable for maintaining a 
consistent appearance and making sitewide updates a snap. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. 
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw12lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create a site defi nition that points to the dw12lessons folder 
from the included DVD that contains resources you need for these lessons. Go to Site > New
Site, or, for details on creating a site defi nition, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”

Creating modular page elements
You might have heard the term modular before; whether referring to a prebuilt house that
r
you can cart away and place on your property, or a well-built, scalable website. Modular 
refers to anything you can break down into standardized, reusable components.
Most websites contain common elements such as headers, footers, and menus that appear 
consistently across each page. The ability to convert these elements into reusable items 
is essential for maintaining a consistent look and feel across your pages. Add the ability 
to make components manageable from a single place and to make sitewide updates, and 
editing becomes a breeze.
Dreamweaver provides three modular features: snippets, library items, and templates. 
Each feature off ers a diff erent level of reusability, from simple code tidbits to entire pages, 
complete with navigation, content, and styling.
Introducing snippets
As you build pages and websites, you’ll fi nd yourself creating many similar items several 
times over. Whether you’re creating a two-column layout table or a contact form, snippets
make it possible to add any piece of code to a common library, where you can reuse it by 
simply dragging and dropping it into the page. You can store virtually any item on a page 
as a snippet. 
The Snippets panel is like a super clipboard, and using a snippet is similar to copying and 
pasting an element onto your page. Changes to a snippet in the Snippets panel do not
update snippets you’ve already used in your pages. For this reason, snippets are a great way 
to store and place any common page elements that you don’t need to manage globally.
Examples of snippets might include common navigation bars, form elements, and even 
JavaScripts. Snippets are stored as part of the Dreamweaver application, and they are
not specifi c to any Dreamweaver site. You can add your own snippets directly within 
Dreamweaver, and they will be available for you to use at any time on any site.

Lesson 12, Maximizing Site Design
Introducing snippets
The Snippets panel
The Snippets panel displays all available Dreamweaver snippets, broken down by category.
You can add and edit snippets and categories directly from the Snippets panel. Using a
snippet from the Snippets panel is as simple as locating it and dragging it from the panel to
the page.
Dreamweaver provides many ready-to-use snippets that serve as great starting points for 
forms, lists, and navigation bars (to name a few); many of these require little more than 
text changes and some basic styling. In the following lesson, you will use some of these 
snippets to quickly build existing pages for the product display component of the Organic 
Utopia site.
1 
Double-click the home.html fi le in the Files panel to open it. Choose 
Window > Snippets to launch the Snippets panel. In the category list, locate the Text 
folder and click the plus sign (+) (Windows) or arrow (Mac OS) to the left to expand
it. You’ll use the Service Mark snippet to add a service mark to this page.
The Snippets panel contains many categories
of pre-built snippets for your use.
2 
Click to the right of the heading, Welcome to organic utopia. Inside the Text folder, 
double-click the service mark snippet, and a superscripted sm appears in the heading.

Creating new snippets
Whenever you have something on a page that you’d like to reuse, creating a new snippet is 
a good option. You can create new snippets directly from the Snippets panel, and from any 
selected element(s) on a page. 
In this section, you’ll convert a pre-existing table to a snippet.
1 
Choose File > Open, and open the gardentips.html page. This page has a pre-styled 
table. Converting this table to a snippet will allow you to place it anywhere you like. 
2 
Click anywhere inside the table, and then choose Modify > Table > Select Table. You 
could also click the edge of the table to select it.
3 
At the bottom of the Snippets panel, click on the New Snippet icon ( ). The Snippet
dialog box opens, and all the code within the table is automatically copied into the
Insert before window.

In the Name fi eld, type Vege_table. In the Description fi eld, type A three column 
styled table listing the Latin and family names of common vegetables. For 
the Snippet type, select the Insert block option. For Preview type, select the Design
option and click OK.
Choosing the Insert Block option ensures that the table is inserted as a stand-alone
element. Setting the Preview type to Design allows you to see a preview of the table in 
the Snippets panel, rather than the code.
Setting options in the Snippet dialog box.
In the Snippets panel, you see the new snippet listed. However, it may not have been 
placed in an ideal location. If the Service Mark snippet in the Text snippet folder was 
still selected, the new snippet may appear in the Text folder. Before you do anything 
else, you’ll organize your Snippets panel.
5 
In the bottom of the Snippets panel, click the New Snippet Folder icon (
). A
new folder appears; rename this folder ou snippets, then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS). Click the Vege_table snippet and drag it on top of this new folder.
Additionally, you can drag and drop the ou_snippets folder below the ~Legacy folder to
move it to the top level of folders. 
Snippets are actually external fi les with the extension .csn and are stored deep within 
your operating system. If someone else has used your current computer to do this
lesson, you might see this snippet already present. You can remove it by clicking the 
snippet and then clicking the Remove icon (
) at the bottom of the Snippets panel.

Click once on the Vege_table snippet, if necessary. In the top half of the panel, there is
e
a design preview of the table. It is most likely cropped. Depending on how much space 
you have, it might not be possible to view the entire table; however, you can expand
this window by clicking the dividing line of the panel, and dragging up or down.
Click and drag the dividing line in the

Choose File > Open, and open the latin_names.html fi le. Click once below the 
heading, Latin and Family names for common vegetables. In the Snippets panel, 
double-click the Vege_table snippet, and it is inserted into the new page.
e
In many ways, a snippet is just a faster way to copy and paste. However, there are a few 
things to be aware of. Snippets only copy the HTML code and none of the associated
CSS. If you look at the preview of the table snippet in the Snippets panel, you will 
see that it is unstyled. However, when you inserted it into the latin_names page, it 
appeared styled. This is because the Snippets panel only previews the raw HTML in 
the design view. The CSS rules for the table are being saved in an external stylesheet 
and all the pages in this site are already linked to this stylesheet. If you inserted this 
table into a blank page, it would appear unstyled until you attached the style sheet to 
the page.

value to 350 and click OK. This has no eff ect on the current table because there is no
link between the code in the Snippets panel and the code on your page. However, all 
future tables will use the new value.

snippet and save it under the same name, you will be prompted to replace it.

Introducing library items
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
306
Introducing library items
While snippets are useful, they are perhaps most useful for items that will never change, 
like a person’s name or a logo. However, a more powerful concept is an item that you
can add to multiple pages and have linked to an original master item. This is where 
Dreamweaver library items come in.
With Dreamweaver library items, you can save any common element and manage it 
from a master copy in your site folder. When you place a library item on a page, the item
remains attached to its master; any changes you make to the master automatically update 
any instances of the item placed throughout your site. Dreamweaver makes sure that any 
instances of a library item are synchronized.
Library items (unlike snippets) are specifi c to each Dreamweaver site, and they are stored as
separate .lbi fi les in your site’s Library folder.
1  Library items are located in the Assets panel. Choose Window > Assets and then click 
the Library icon (
) at the very bottom. The panel is empty because there are no 
library items in your site yet.
The Library Items category of the 
Assets panel.
You can add, edit, and manage all library items in your site directly from this panel.
You will now convert the Global Navigation menu in your header to a library item. 
2 
Click the home.html tab in the top of your document window to open this page. 
Scrolling as needed, click the border of the GlobalNav 
 element in the upper-
right corner to select it. (This is the small box that contains the Site Map | Login text.)

In the Assets panel, click the New Library Item button ( ). You will see a dialog 
box appear, warning you that this style sheet information will not be copied with 
this item. Click OK. The selected menu is added as a new library item; name it
GlobalNav and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). If you’re prompted to 
update links, choose Update. This ensures that any hyperlinks or references to image
fi les are preserved. The GlobalNav div is now linked to the new library item you 
created. Note that your GlobaNav div is now highlighted in yellow; this is the visual 
indicator Dreamweaver uses for library items. Now you’re ready to add this library
item to other pages.
The GlobalNav 
element is highlighted yellow because it is now a library item.
4 
Click the gardentips.html tab at the top of your document window to view this 
page (or open the fi le it if it is closed). Locate the GlobalNav library item in the Assets
panel, and drag it onto the header of the page. An instance of the GlobalNav 
elemement is placed.
5 
Click the latin_names.html tab at the top of your document window to view
this page. If the fi le is closed, open it now. As you did in step 4, drag a copy of the
GlobalNav library item from the Assets panel to the header section. Just as before, an 
instance of the GlobalNav
 element is placed.
The GlobalNav is now set in the exact location across three pages of your site. You
will now modify your library item and all three pages will change.

Modifying and updating library items
The convenience and power of library items are apparent when you need to update a
common item across several pages. Because all instances of a library item remain attached
to a master copy, when the master item is edited from the library item list, every instance 
mirrors these changes.
You can edit library items from the Assets panel or by choosing the Open button from the
Property Inspector when a library item instance is selected on the page. 
1 
From the Library Items list in the Assets panel, double-click the GlobalNav library 
item to open it for editing. A new tab opens because the library item is actually a new 
fi le: GlobalNav.lbi. 
The GlobalNav library item opens as a separate document and has no style associated with it.
It’s important to realize that there is no style information associated with this fi le,
as Dreamweaver warned you when you created the item. However, this is actually a
good thing; it simply takes getting used to the idea that you are modifying the HTML 
content—all the style information resides in the style sheet.
2 
Where it currently reads Login, select the text, then type Your Account. You will
now link the text within the GlobalNav menu to the appropriate HTML pages. Select 
the text Your Account, then in the Property Inspector, click the HTML button, if 
necessary. Next, click the Browse for File folder icon (
) to the right of the Link box. 
In the Select File window, choose login.html. Click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac
OS).

Select the Site Map text. In the Property Inspector, click the HTML tab if necessary, 
and click the Browse for File icon (
) to the right of the Link fi eld. In the Select File 
dialog box, choose sitemap.html, then click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
4 
Choose File > Save. The Update Library Items dialog box appears with a list of the
three fi les. Whenever you modify a library item and save it, a list of all fi les using the 
item appears, and you are given the choice to update or not.
When saving library items, any pages aff ected will appear in the 
Update Library Items dialog box.
5 
Click Update. The fi les update and the Update Pages dialog box appears.
6 
Click the Show Log option in the Update Pages dialog box. A list of the fi les that were
g
updated appears; this is where you can check to see if there were any problems and 
how many fi les were updated. Click Close.
7 
Open home.html, gardentips.html, and latin_names.html if they were not 
already open, and you see that all instances of the menu have been updated in all three 
pages. Library items are tremendously powerful; the larger the site, the more useful
they become. They are tremendously useful with hyperlinked navigation, where they 
can help prevent broken hyperlinks. 
For example, currently you have three documents all using a library item that is linked
to the login.html and sitemap.html pages. But what happens if you move those two 
pages into a new folder? You will do this now so you can see how Dreamweaver keeps 
track of the move and prompts you to update the links.

Ctrl+click (Mac OS) to open a context menu. Choose New Folder. Rename the new 
folder GlobalNav and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Right-clicking the root folder allows you to create 
a new folder.
9 
In the Files panel, click and drag the login.html fi le into this new GlobalNav folder. As 
soon as you do, the Update Files dialog box appears with the list of all the fi les that need 
to be updated. This is a huge time-saver if you need to restructure your site. Traditionally, 
you would have to go to each page and relink everything that pointed to this page. Now 
click Update, and the links on each page are all updated behind the scenes.
10 Click and drag the sitemap.html fi le to the GlobalNav folder; click Update, and all 
the fi les are updated. 
11 Choose File > Save All, update your pages if prompted, and then close all your open fi les.
Introducing templates
If you are creating several pages that need to share the same look and layout, Dreamweaver 
templates are for you. A Dreamweaver template is a master document from which other 
pages can be created; these pages inherit all the elements from the original template, but 
you can modify each page to include unique content and elements. As with library items, 
when you edit a template all pages based on that template update to refl ect your changes.
When you create a template, you specify editable regions, or areas of the page that you can 
modify. By default, all elements of a page created from a template are locked to prevent
editing. You can make changes only from the original master template. You can set 
sections of a page as editable so that you can add or modify content without accidentally
(or intentionally) disturbing the original layout.

12
311
Lesson 12, Maximizing Site Design
Introducing templates
Templates are also a great mechanism for controlling access to pages on a site. If you need 
to provide editing ability to others, you can lock out important page elements and give
users access to only certain sections of the page.
Templates are site-specifi c and are stored in a Templates folder under your site’s root folder.
You open, edit, or create templates from the Templates list in the Assets panel.
Dreamweaver templates work with Contribute, a basic but powerful web content management tool. 
You can design and manage templates that can be modifi ed and published by Contribute users.
Creating a new template
For the Organic Utopia site, imagine that you need to create many diff erent category and 
product detail pages for the products in the store. To do this, you’ll set up templates for 
each page so that new pages can be easily created but will remain visually consistent with 
the master layout.
1 
In the Files panel (Window > Files), locate and double-click the
product_detail.html page to open it for editing. This page has generic text and a 
placeholder image that will serve as your template.
2 
Click your Assets panel, and then click the library category. As you did with the other 
pages, click and drag the GlobalNav item onto the header. This page will shortly serve
as a template, and by including a library item, you are maximizing automation.
3 
Save the product_detail.html page as a template by choosing File > Save as 
Template. The Save As Template dialog box appears.

Choose Save to save the template. If prompted, allow Dreamweaver to update any 
links by choosing Yes from the dialog box.

Working with editable regions
Next, you will need to defi ne editable regions that you can modify on any pages created 
from this template. When new HTML pages are generated from templates, there might be
certain sections you would like to be editable and other areas that should remain uneditable. 
1 
Select the placeholder text in the product_detail template that reads Product Category.
Choose Insert > Template > Editable Region. The New Editable Region dialog box
appears.
2 
Name the new editable region ProductCategory and click OK. The placeholder text 
now appears inside a black box with a blue tab at the top. This portion of the page and
the content within it will now be editable in any pages created from this template.
Each editable region should have a unique name on your template fi les. Also, avoid using spaces
or special characters when naming your editable regions.
3 
Select the placeholder text in the product_detail template that reads Product Name.
Choose Insert > Template > Editable Region. The New Editable Region dialog box
appears. Name this ProductName and click OK.
4 
Select the image placeholder, then choose Insert > Template > Editable Region. The 
New Editable Region window appears. Name this ProductImage and click OK.

5 
Finally, select all the text in the sidebar. Choose Insert > Template > Editable Region. 
The New Editable Region dialog box appears. Name this ProductDescription and 
click OK.
6 
Choose File > Save to save the template. You might see a warning about putting the 
editable region within a block tag; click OK.
At this point, you can create any number of pages and manage them from this
template. The editable regions you created will allow you to add content to any new
pages based on this template, but will protect the main layout and page elements from
unintended changes.

anything. This section is uneditable. Notice, in the upper-right corner, the yellow
highlighted box that reads Template:product_detail. In a similar fashion to library 
items, this yellow highlight indicates that the page is based on a template.
Dividing a page into editable and non-editable regions can be useful for any situation 
where the designer of the site would like some control over how the site is modifi ed.
Someone not familiar with Dreamweaver could easily learn to update the editable 
regions, and at the same time, there would be little risk that they click something by 
accident and modify it.

Repeating regions
A single region might not be the best way to display the content you add to a template-
based page. You might require a template that can handle a number of items, such as a
table that displays products in a category. If you need to build a fl exible template that can
hold any number of uniform items, you can add a repeating region to it.
Repeating regions allow you to defi ne an element on a template as repeatable. When you 
create a page based on that template, you can increase, or repeat, the number of regions
to accommodate the information. You’ll also be able to reorder these repeated regions at
any time without having to move the content. For example, you could set elements such 
as a table row, paragraph, or small display table as a repeating region, and then duplicate as
many as you need to fi t the content at hand.
A repeating region is not automatically editable. You need to set editable regions inside
any repeating element in order to add to or edit its content.

Lesson 12, Maximizing Site Design
Repeating regions
In the following steps, you’ll add a repeating region to your category.html page and 
convert it to a template so that you can use it to display any number of products in a 
specifi c category.
1 
Open the category.html page from the Files panel.
2 
The table in the center contains one row with two columns, each containing a 
placeholder image and product title placeholder. Click anywhere in the table and 
then click the 
 tag in the tag selector at the bottom of the 
document window to select it.
Click Tag Selector to choose 
.
3 
Choose Insert > Template > Repeating Region. Because you haven’t saved this page 
as a template yet, a dialog box appears, letting you know that you need to convert the 
page to a template before you add regions. Click OK.
4 
When the Repeating Region dialog box appears, assign the new region the name
Products, and click OK.
The row is now a repeating region, which you can duplicate 
in any page created from this template.
5 
Choose File > Save As Template, and save the new template as category_display. 
Click Save and Update Links if asked.

10 Choose File > Save to save this template. If you see the block tag warning, click OK.
Templates can’t contain duplicate region names. If you try to set two editable regions with the 
same name, Dreamweaver gives you an error message.
Putting repeating regions into action
You’re now ready to create a page from the new category_display template and see how 
repeating regions work.
1 
Open the Assets panel if necessary, then select the category_display template, and
choose New from Template from the Assets panel menu. You might need to click the
Refresh Site List button in the Assets panel to see your templates.
2 
Save the new document as chocolate.html in your site’s root folder. Notice the new 
repeating region in the middle of the page—its tab features four buttons that allow 
you to add, remove, and shift repeating regions up or down in the stacking order. 
A repeating region has four buttons you can use.

Detach from Template command
If you want to modify a template-based page beyond what the editable regions allow, you 
can use the Modify > Templates > Detach from Template command, which breaks the
current page away from the master template, allowing you to edit it freely. Keep in mind
that a page detached from a template will no longer be updated if you make any changes 
to the original template.

Self study
Create a new template based on home.html and then create new pages based on the 
the template for the following pages: about_us.html, products.html, services.html, 
and contact.html. Then return to the template and create links to these pages from the
navigation bar. Which sections need to be editable and which do not?
Open the eggplants.html page you created, and use Detach from Template to break it 
away from the template. You’ll then be able to freely edit other elements on the page that 
you did not include in the original editable regions. Create some variations on the newly 
detached page by trying a new layout, modifying product and picture positioning, or 
applying a new style to the product title, price, or description. Use the Templates section
of the Assets panel to create a new template from the page.

Questions
1 
What are two key diff erences between snippets and library items?
2 
How do you add a new snippet to a page in Dreamweaver?
3 
Where are library items and page templates stored? Which panel do you use to 
manage them?
4 
What happens to pages based on a template when you modify the original template?
5 
True or False: Repeating regions are automatically editable in pages that use them. 
Answers
1 
Snippets are stored as part of the Dreamweaver application, and are available, 
regardless of which site or document you’re working on; library items are specifi c to 
a site defi nition. Copies of a snippet never update when the original snippet is edited; 
a library item updates all instances of itself throughout a local site when a change is 
applied to it.
2 
You can drag a snippet from the Snippets panel onto the page, or position your cursor 
in the page and double-click the snippet in the Snippets panel.
3 
Library items and page templates are stored in the Library and Templates folders 
(respectively) under your local site. You can manage both, using their specifi c 
categories on the Assets panel.
4 
Dreamweaver updates all pages based on that template to refl ect any changes made to 
the original template.
5 
False. You must fi rst set editable regions within a repeating region to add content.

Lesson 13, Working with Code-editing Features 
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Using the Code and Design 
views
• Working with the Coding 
toolbar
• Validating your code
• Formatting and 
reformatting your code
Lesson 13
Dreamweaver provides exceptional code-editing support to 
complement its powerful visual layout tools and application 
development features. You can adapt the coding environment so that 
it fi ts the way you work. Learn how to change the way you view 
code, reformat your markup, or use your favorite tag library.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace.
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw13lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw13lessons folder. Go to
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Working with code 
Although Dreamweaver’s traditional audience has been for those who prefer to work in the 
Design view and not with code, there are many good reasons to dive into the code editing 
view. In this lesson, you will look at some of the unique functions available in the Code 
view by taking a look at an older web page.
Accessing code with the Quick Tag editor 
In this exercise, you will use a feature called the Quick Tag editor. This feature is 
generally for users who are more familiar with their code. The Quick Tag editor off ers an 
easy way to add CSS class or ID names as well as attributes to your code without having to
leave the Design view. The Quick Tag editor works in conjunction with the tag selector. 
In this exercise, you’ll apply a CSS class to an image to fl oat it to the right.
1 
In the Files panel, navigate to the dw13lessons folder and double-click the 
oldcode.html fi le to open it. Click the image of the beets. In the bottom-left of the 
document window is the tag selector which now has the
 tag selected.
2 
Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the
 tag in the tag selector. A 
context menu appears with all the code for the selected image. Choose Quick Tag 
Editor from the menu. The Quick Tag Editor appears, displaying the code for this tag.

Using HTML5 code-hinting
3 
Click once after the
 code and press the spacebar. A code-hinting 
menu is triggered, allowing you to choose from a list of possible choices. Double-
click the class option; the code will be written for you. Notice that the only option,
, is listed; press the Return (or Enter) key to apply this class. Your image
now has the class applied and is fl oating to the right.
You can also use the Quick Tag Editor to remove unnecessary code. For example, this
page uses the older 
 tag to style text.
4 
Click anywhere inside the main paragraph of your document. In the tag selector, click
the 
 tag and then right+click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) and from the 
context menu choose the Remove Tag option. 
Quickly remove a tag by choosing Remove Tag.
This removes both the opening and closing font tags and the text now reverts to its 
default unstyled appearance.
Using HTML5 code-hinting
The internal library of code that is available to Dreamweaver CC evolves as the
language of the Web evolves. If you are working with the next generation of web pages,
Dreamweaver has access to the latest HTML5 elements.
1 
In the Code view, locate the 
 element on or around line 19. Place your cursor 
immediately before the opening 
tag and press Return (Mac OS) or Enter (PC) 
to move this code to the next line. 
Click once in the empty line you just created above the
element. You will now 
be adding a new HTML5 element.
2 
Type a left bracket (<); Dreamweaver’s code-hinting panel appears. This is a complete 
list of every element that is a part of Dreamweaver’s library of HTML tags.

13

Type the letters fi ; notice that as you type, the list automatically narrows down to the 
available choices. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, select the
 tag and
press Return (Mac OS) or Enter (PC).
Use code-hinting to select the HTML5 fi gure tag.
3 
Type the closing bracket. Dreamweaver will not automatically do it for you.
The HTML5 
element is designed to help structure your web pages by 
giving you a more specifi c way to defi ne images on your pages. For example, you 
could add a common style for all fi gures on your page.
4 
You need to add the closing tag for the fi gure element, so click once at the end of the 
line of the 
code and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
5 
On this new line, type a left bracket and a forward slash: </. Dreamweaver will
/
automatically complete (auto-complete) the rest of the tag.
Dreamweaver will auto-complete your closing tags.
You can choose to turn off  the code-hinting and auto-complete options within your preferences. 
Choose Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver > Preferences (Mac OS). Select the 
Code Hints category. To turn off  code-hinting, click to clear the Enable Code Hints check box. To 
prevent Dreamweaver from auto-completing your tags, select Never from the Close tags section.

Lesson 13, Working with Code-editing Features 
Working in the Code view
Working in the Code view
As you’ve seen, the Code view is a hand-coding environment for writing and editing HTML
and CSS. More experienced users who work in scripting languages such as JavaScript and
PHP can modify their workspace to suit the way they prefer to work with code.
View options
You can set word wrapping, display line numbers for the code, highlight invalid code, set
syntax coloring for code elements, set indenting, and show hidden characters from the View 
> Code View Options menu. The Code view options are not available when you are in the 
Design view, only when in Code or Split view.
Word Wrap: wraps the code so that you can view it without scrolling horizontally. This 
option doesn’t insert line breaks; it just makes the code easier to view.
Line Numbers: displays line numbers along the side of the code. 
Hidden Characters: displays special characters in place of white space. For example, a dot
replaces each space, a double chevron replaces each tab, and a paragraph marker replaces each 
line break. 
Highlight Invalid Code: causes Dreamweaver to highlight all HTML code that isn’t valid
in yellow. When you select an invalid tag, the Property Inspector displays information on
how to correct the error.
Syntax Coloring: enables or disables code coloring.
Auto Indent: makes your code indent automatically when you press Enter or Return while 
writing code. The new line of code indents to the same level as the previous line.
Syntax Error Alerts: in Info Bar conveniently displays mistakes in your code.
Modifying the Code view workspace
You can view the source code for Dreamweaver documents in several ways. You can 
display it in the document window by switching to the Code view, you can split the
document window to display both the visual page and its related code in Split view, or you
can work in the Code Inspector, a separate coding window. The Code Inspector works 
like a detachable version of the Code view for the current page.
1 
Choose View > Code and Design, to view the code and visually edit the page in the 
document window at the same time. By default the Code view is split with the Code 
on the left and Design view on the right.

Choose Window > Code Inspector. Working in the Code Inspector is just like
working in the Code view, except that it is in a separate window. This might be 
useful, depending on how you choose to manage your workspace (for example, users 
who have two monitors could put this window in a separate window). 
You can also view your HTML code in the Code Inspector window.
Click the Close button to close the Code Inspector for now. From the View menu, 
choose Design View on Left to return the split screen to its original orientation.

The Coding toolbar
The Coding toolbar contains buttons that let you perform many standard coding 
operations, such as collapsing and expanding code selections, highlighting invalid code, 
applying and removing comments, indenting code, and inserting recently used code 
snippets. The Coding toolbar is visible only in the Code view and appears vertically on the 
left side of the document window. To see what each button does, position the cursor over 
it until a tooltip appears.

on your page. Use it to navigate to related code sources,
such as internal and external CSS rules, server-side includes, 
external JavaScript files, parent template files, library files, 
and iframe source files. You can access the Code Navigator
from Design, Code, and Split views, as well as from the Code 
Inspector.
Collapse Full Tag
Collapses the content between a set of opening and closing 
tags (for example, the content between
 and
). You must place the insertion point in the opening 
or closing tag and then click to collapse it.
Collapse Selection
Collapses the selected code.
Expand All
Restores all collapsed code.
Select Parent Tag
Selects the content and surrounding opening and closing 
tags of the line in which you’ve placed the insertion point. If 
you repeatedly click this button, and your tags are balanced,
Dreamweaver will eventually select the outermost 
and 
tags.
Balance Braces
Selects the content and surrounding parentheses, braces,
or square brackets of the line in which you’ve placed the 
insertion point. If you repeatedly click this button, and
your surrounding symbols are balanced, Dreamweaver will
eventually select the outermost braces, parentheses, or
brackets in the document.

that alerts you to syntax errors. When Dreamweaver detects 
a syntax error, the Syntax Error Information bar specifies
the line in the code where the error occurs. Additionally, 
Dreamweaver highlights the error’s line number on the left
side of the document in Code view. The info bar is enabled
by default, but only appears when Dreamweaver detects 
syntax errors in the page.

Collapsing and expanding tags and code blocks
Dreamweaver lets you collapse and expand code fragments so that you can hide and show 
various sections of your code. This can help reduce the amount of screen space that is taken 
up and also prevent mistakes since code that is collapsed cannot be edited. When you select
code, Dreamweaver adds a set of collapse buttons next to the selection (minus symbols in
Windows; vertical triangles in Mac OS). You can collapse code only in the Code view.
1 
Make sure you are in the Code view by clicking the Code view button on the
Document toolbar. Scroll to the top of the screen if necessary and click anywhere 
between lines 6 and 14, which is the 
, tag that contains all your CSS.
2 
Click the Collapse Full Tag button in the coding toolbar. You can also choose Edit >
Code Collapse > Collapse Full Tag. The
tag is now collapsed. This feature is
useful for reducing the amount of screen space that your code occupies on the screen.
The Collapse Full Tag button collapses the relevant tag.
Click the plus sign (Windows) or arrow (Mac OS) on the left to expand the code again.
3 
In the Coding toolbar click the Select Parent Tag button. This will select the code that 
is nesting your existing selection. In this case, the parent is the 
tag, which is 
now selected.
The Select Parent Tag button is a great alternative to selecting code by hand. Selecting by hand 
can often introduce mistakes; the Select Parent Tag will always be more reliable and faster.
4 
In the Coding toolbar click the Collapse Selection button to collapse the
tag and all its content. You could have also chosen Edit > Code Collapse > Collapse 
Selection. 
5 
Click anywhere within your document and note that you could begin to work in your 
HTML and the 
tag will always remain collapsed until you need to access it.

Double-click the head tag to expand it again.
Double-clicking collapsed code will expand it.
To expand all code at once, you can also choose Edit > Code Collapse > Expand All. All your 
code fragments are now restored to their original view.
Validating your code
In addition to the many options available for formatting your code, you can also use 
Dreamweaver to fi nd out if your code has tag or syntax errors. Dreamweaver can validate 
documents in many languages, including HTML, XHTML, PHP, ColdFusion Markup 
Language (CFML), Java Server Pages (JSP), Wireless Markup Language (WML), and
XML. You can validate the current document or a selected tag.
Highlighting and correcting invalid code
You can set Dreamweaver to highlight invalid code (in yellow) in the Code view. When
you select a highlighted section, the Property Inspector off ers information on how to
correct the error. Invalid code is not highlighted by default in Code view. In order to view
the invalid code, you must enable this option in the View menu.
1 
Select View > Code View Options and turn on the Highlight Invalid Code option by 
selecting it from the menu.

The Property Inspector identifi es the invalid code and suggests how to correct it.
4 
Correct the error by removing the incorrect markup. Individually select each of the
four highlighted tags and then delete them. You can now style them correctly either in
the Design view or the Code view; for now, you will leave them as is.

Validating your code
Running a report
Site reports allow you to scan your code using a set of criteria. Code which doesn’t fi t the
criteria is identifi ed, allowing you to fi x it. In this exercise, you’ll run all the reports for HTML.
1 
Choose File > Save. Then choose Site > Reports and in the site Report window that 
appears, check all fi ve boxes for HTML reports. Be sure that the Report on menu is 
set to Current Document. You can also run reports sitewide, for certain fi les only or 
an entire folder.
Check the HTML Reports you would like to run.
2 
Click Run; the results of the Report appear in a new Site Reports panel below the 
Properties panel. In this case, there are three warnings; two warnings that the 
attribute is missing from your images and a third warning the fi le has no title tag. The
alt attribute improves accessibility for images on your page for assistive devices, such as 
screenreaders. This is not technically required, but you should add them. The title tag 
is required for properly-formed HTML fi les and provides important information to the
user in the title bar of their browser.

the code and the image will be selected. In the Properties panel, locate the Alt text 
fi eld and type Logo and then click anywhere in the code window to commit the
change.
Clicking a warning in the Site Reports panel sends you to this code.

Choose File > Save to save your fi le. You should also close the entire group of the 
report tabs. You can do this by clicking the context menu at the top-right of the panel 
and choosing Close Tab Group.
Formatting code
Once you’ve validated your code, you can further change its look by specifying formatting 
preferences, such as indentation, line length, and the case of tag and attribute names. Many
developers who code by hand have certain conventions or preferences for the way their 
code appears on the page or for the formatting used. Dreamweaver helps automate certain
code formatting tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and tedious.

When the Preferences dialog box appears, select Code Format from the Category list 
on the left. The Code Format preferences appear on the right.
Choose from the Code Format preferences to further change the look of your code.
The Code Format preferences allow you to change the way code is written in 
Dreamweaver. For example, when you press the Tab key, your cursor indents four 
spaces. Using this preference window, you could increase or decrease the amount of 
the indent.

visitors to your website. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to add 
form elements to make your site more interactive and use the new 
required, validation and placeholder input attributes.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace.
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw14lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create a site defi nition that points to the dw14lessons folder.

See Lesson 14 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
The basics of HTML5 forms
HTML5 forms are commonly used for questionnaires, hotel reservations, order forms, 
data entry, and a variety of other applications. Users provide information by entering text, 
selecting menu items, and so on, and then submit that information to you through a server.
Here’s the simple form you will be creating that includes labels, radio buttons, and push 
buttons (used to reset the form or submit it):
Forms are a great choice when you want to gather information from your audience.
How forms work
An HTML5 form is a section of a document that often contains content such as text or 
images, markup, special elements called controls check boxes, radio buttons, and menus,
14

among others), and labels on those controls. A form is completed when a user modifi es its 
controls (by entering text and selecting menu items), and submits the form to an agent for 
processing.
When you add form controls in Dreamweaver, you are essentially creating the front-end 
of the form. A user can add all the data required on the page, but this data needs to saved 
and processed at a specifi c location when the user clicks the Submit button. It’s important
to understand that Dreamweaver does not provide this location for you. You will need to
work with your hosting provider or another service in order to have a system for accepting 
user data and then processing it in some way. You will learn more about this process a bit 
later in the lesson.
Building a contact form
In this lesson, you’ll build a contact form for OrganicUtopia. This form allows users to be 
added to a mailing list for news of sales and special events, and it provides the site owners
with relevant data, such as name, e-mail, and which information they would like to
receive.
Inserting the <form> tag
The fi rst step in building a form in Dreamweaver is to add a form element, which serves 
as a container for the form fi elds you’ll be adding to it. In hand-coded HTML, you do
this by inserting the 
 tag into your code. In the Design view, you can add a form 
element using the Form button.
1 
Choose File > Open. When the Open dialog box appears, navigate to the dw14lessons
folder. Select the formbase.html fi le and click Open. We have added most of the
form content for you, but you will have to remove the placeholder text and add the 
proper form controls.
2 
In the Design view, place an insertion cursor where you want your form to appear.
Because this is an existing page, click with your mouse in the white area immediately 
to the left of the word Name.
Insert your cursor before the Name text fi eld label.

In the Insert panel on the right side of your screen, choose the Form category from 
the drop-down menu to display options for adding form elements to a page.
4 
From the Form category of the Insert panel, select the Form element (
).
Options for adding form elements to a
page are found in the Form category
of the Insert panel.
5 
You should now see a red outline on your page. This is how a form is displayed in
the Design view. If you don’t see this outline, choose View > Visual Aids > Invisible
Elements to turn on the form element’s visibility.
A dotted red outline on your page indicates a placed form element.
Now you’ll take a look at the code generated by the steps you just completed in the 
Design view. This is for educational purposes to help you understand the foundations
of how forms work.
6 
In the Document toolbar just above your document window, click the Code view 
button to switch to your page’s HTML code view.

14
343
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Building a contact form
7 
In line 214 of your code, you should see the newly added
element. Take note 
of the default attributes and values (
). 
You’ll learn more about these attributes shortly. For now, simply note that these were 
created.
In HTML code, a form element is added using the 
tag.
Since this form element is currently empty, you’ll need to move the existing content 
(Name, Address, and so on) from the current location on the page to the form element 
you just created.
8 
In the Document toolbar just above your document window, click the Design view 
button to switch to your page’s visual layout view.
9 
Starting with the text labeled Name, click and drag downward to select all the text 
below your form element.
10 Choose Edit > Cut to cut the text to your clipboard and remove it from its current 
location on the page.
11 Click inside the red outline that represents your form element to place an insertion
cursor there.
12 Choose Edit > Paste to place the text from the clipboard into your form element.

14
Building a contact form
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
344
All the text for your element label is now located inside the form element.
Cut and paste existing content from your page into the form element.
Setting form properties
As indicated previously, the 
tag includes three diff erent attributes and values 
by default. These attributes are listed as 
,
, and 
, and they represent the 
HTML form element’s properties. The default values for these attributes are not necessarily 
ideal, so you’ll modify them. 
1 
Make sure the form element you added in the previous exercise is selected by clicking 
the edge of its red outline. A form fi eld element must be selected before you modify its 
properties.
2 
In the Property Inspector at the bottom of your document window, you now have
access to some of the properties associated with the
 tag.
The fi elds in the Property Inspector refl ect properties found inside the 
tag in HTML code.
The Form ID makes it possible to identify and control the form with a script, as well 
as to style the form with CSS. It is also very important for form validation, which is 
discussed later in this lesson.
A form ID is the same ID attribute you have been using to style divs. This form, for example, 
would have the ID 
 by default, which is not a useful name.

14
345
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Building a contact form
3 
In the Form ID text fi eld, type the name contact. Press Enter (Windows) or Return
(Mac OS).
The Action fi eld allows you to specify the script, for example, a Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) script or a PHP page, that processes the user’s form data. You can type the 
path to this fi le, or use the Browse button to navigate to the desired fi le. In most cases, 
you’ll need to get this information from your system Administrator or hosting provider.
4 
Because you have not yet defi ned the processing method for this form, leave the
Action text fi eld blank.
5 
For method, make sure the POST method for this exercise is selected, which it likely
is by default.
The Method menu
The Method drop-down menu is where you choose the method used to transmit the data to 
a server. The Method drop-down menu includes the following choices:
Default uses the browser’s default setting to submit the form data to a server. Most browsers 
use the GET method by default.
GET includes the form data as part of the URL of the request to the server. GET has a 
length limitation of 8,192 characters in the URL and is less commonly used to send long 
forms than the POST method.
POST is similar to GET, but it embeds the form data in the header of the server request
instead of in the URL. Although the POST method is the most commonly used, be aware that
pages sent by this method cannot be bookmarked and are not encrypted for security purposes.
6 
Choose application/x-www-form-urlencoded from the Enctype drop-down menu. The 
d
Enctype fi eld defi nes the encoding type of the data being submitted to a server.
Application/x-www-form-urlencoded is used in most situations, unless you’re asking 
the user to upload a fi le, in which case you would choose multipart/form-data.
The optional Target property specifi es the window or frame in which to display the data that is 
returned. The target value is included in the 
tag only when you choose to specify it.
Form properties are set in the Property Inspector.
Now that you’ve defi ned the properties of the form, you’ll use options in the Insert 
panel’s Forms section to add elements to the form.

Adding form elements
A Dreamweaver form is not a working form until you add the elements, or fi elds, that
allow the user to provide information to you. Thankfully, the Form category in the Insert 
panel contains everything you need to insert any kind of form fi eld into your page.
The Form category in the Insert panel contains
everything you need to add interactive fi elds to
your form.
Common form elements
Of the many form elements you can add using the Insert toolbar, these are the most 
commonly used ones:
Text fields accept alphanumeric text entries, in single- or multiple-line formats, or in a
password (bulleted) format.
Check boxes: allow users to make as many choices as they want from a list of options.
Radio buttons allow only mutually exclusive choices in that selecting one radio button
deselects all others in the group.
List menus permit the selection of single or multiple items from a scrolling list, whereas
Jump menus allow you to set each option from a scrolling list to link to a document or file.
Buttons perform actions when clicked. You can assign the default Submit or Reset action to
buttons, or define other processing tasks in a script.
A good way to understand all the options available in Dreamweaver for adding elements to a
form is to add them to the form you created earlier.

Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Adding form elements
Adding text fields
The simplest and most common type of form fi eld is the text fi eld. Users can enter 
anything, from their name, to their credit card number, to their dog’s name, into a text
fi eld. You control the formatting of their responses using the Property Inspector.
1 
Within your form, select the word Name and press Ctrl+X (Windows) or 
Command+X (Mac OS) to cut the text and place it on the clipboard.
2 
Click the Text Field button (
) in the Insert panel. Dreamweaver will insert a text 
input element and a matching label element with the default text Text Field. Select
Text Field and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste the word
Name you cut earlier. The label element in a form provides additional usability for the
user.
The label element provides additional usability for the user.
3 
Select the text fi eld by clicking it and notice the options that are available in the 
Property Inspector.
The Property Inspector displays the new HTML5 properties for the text element.

14
Adding form elements
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
348
4 
In the Name section, type Mailing_list_name and press Enter (Windows) or Return
(Mac OS). Dreamweaver will use the value of this Name fi eld to set both the Name
and ID of the form element. The importance of this distinction will be covered in a 
moment.
5 
Type 55 in the Size text fi eld in the Property Inspector to set the text input area to a 
width of 55 characters.
6 
Type 30 in the Max Length text fi eld to set the maximum number of characters that 
can be entered. For example, if this were a telephone number fi eld, you probably
would have limited it to ten characters.
7 
Choose contact from the Form drop-down menu. Associating the text fi eld with a 
specifi c form will be helpful in the event there are multiple forms on a page.
8 
Repeat steps 1 to 7 to add Address and City/State/Zip text fi elds beneath the Name 
fi eld. When creating the Address text fi eld, give it the ID Mailing_list_address
and give the last text fi eld the ID Mailing_list_city_state_zip. When naming form 
elements, you should stay away from using spaces between words. It is better to use
underscores or hyphens instead.
9 
Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the dw14lessons folder 
and type organicform.html into the Name text fi eld. Click Save.
Now preview the open page in a browser by clicking the Preview/Debug in browser 
button on the Document toolbar. Your form should look like this:
This is what your form should look like in the browser with text fi elds added.
10 Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.

Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Adding form elements
Adding a new HTML5 text field
HTML5 has added new text fi elds to make it easier to handle specifi c types of information
such as e-mail addresses, web addresses and telephone numbers. You will use the e-mail 
text fi eld to request the user’s email address and later validate that a properly-formed 
e-mail address was entered.
1 
Within your form, select the word Email and delete the text.
2 
Click the Email button (
) in the Insert panel. Dreamweaver inserts an Email fi eld 
that will accept a properly-formed email address as input. 
3 
Select the Email fi eld by clicking it and notice the options that are available in the
Property Inspector.
The Property Inspector displays the properties for the new HTML5 email element.
4 
In the Name section, type Mailing_list_email and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS).
5 
Type 55 in the Size text fi eld in the Property Inspector to set the text input area to a 
width of 55 characters.
6 
Type 128 in the Max Length text fi eld to set the maximum number of characters that 
can be entered.
7 
Choose contact from the Form drop-down menu, associating the text fi eld with your 
contact form.
8 
Choose File > Save and preview the open page in a browser by clicking the Preview/
Debug in browser button on the Document toolbar. Your form should look like this:
This is what your form should look like with the email fi eld added.

Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
HTML5 form elements
Dreamweaver CC adds support for the new HTML5 form elements, including new attributes
such as required, validation and pattern. The most common HTML5 form elements are listed
below:
Email fields accept alphanumeric text entries entered as e-mail addresses which can be
validated prior to submitting the form.
URL allows users to enter alphanumeric text representing a fully-qualified domain name and
L
validate the field prior to form submission.
Telephone allows users to enter text representing a telephone number.
Search allows users to enter text to be used to submit a search.
Date elements allow users to submit date/time information using a popup calendar or other 
format without the need for additional JavaScript.
Color inputs allow users to choose a color from a color palette.
For a more in-depth look at all of the HTML5 form elements and how to use them with 
their various attributes, see the HTML5 Digital Classroom book available in electronic and
print formats.
Adding check boxes
Check boxes are another valuable tool in your form control toolkit. They’re valuable when
you want to get specifi c responses from your users and you don’t want to give them the 
opportunity to enter incorrect information into text fi elds. Again, you control the formatting 
of their responses using the Property Inspector. In this exercise, you will take a look at the 
use of form labels as well as the importance of setting the names of your form elements.
1 
Click and drag to select both the word Sales and the (Checkbox) placeholder text and
delete them.
2 
Click the Checkbox element (
) in the Insert panel. Dreamweaver inserts a check box
in your page along with a label element with default text, Checkbox. Select the word 
Checkbox and type Sales. The label tag is an optional element that adds an extra level
of usability to your check boxes. Users will now be able to click the text (in addition 
to the check box) in order to make their selection.

14
351
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Adding form elements
3 
Click the check box to select it, and notice the options that become available in the 
Property Inspector. In the Name fi eld, type Sales, then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS). 
Settings that are specifi c to the check box you’ve just added to your form appear in the Property Inspector.
4 
As mentioned earlier, when you set the Name of the check box, Dreamweaver also 
sets the ID to the same value and associates the label to that fi eld ID. It is important to
understand the distinction between the Name and the ID. An ID is used to style an
element and each ID must be unique, while the Name is what gets passed for scripting 
and validation when the user clicks Submit. In the case of check boxes, you want all 
of them to have the same Name, but they must each have a unique ID. To do this you
will need to override Dreamweaver’s default settings. To make sure Dreamweaver 
only changes the Name, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the check 
box, select Name… from the popup menu, then type Receive_Info and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
5 
With the check box still selected, type Sales in the Value text fi eld in the Property
Inspector to defi ne the data that’s passed to the server when the user checks this check
box.
6 
Choose contact from the Form drop-down menu to associate this fi eld with the 
contact form. 
7 
The Checked fi eld defi nes how the check box should appear when the page is fi rst 
loaded. It should not be selected; if it is, uncheck it now.
8 
Next, select the word Events and the placeholder (Checkbox) text and delete them.
Click the Checkbox element in the Insert panel. Dreamweaver inserts a check box in 
your page along with a label element with default text, Checkbox. Select the word 
Checkbox and type Events.
9 
Click the check box and change the Name to Events in the Property Inspector.
Remember, you will want the name to be same as the fi rst check box, so that users 
will be able to check both and have the values passed. However, because Dreamweaver 
also sets the ID to this value, you need to manually intervene. To set only the Name,
right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the check box and select Name… from 
the popup menu, then type Receive_Info and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). This will leave the ID set to Events while changing the Name so that the 
user can select both check boxes and have both values passed.

14
Adding form elements
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
352
10 With the check box still selected, type Events in the Value text fi eld in the Property
Inspector to defi ne the data that’s passed to the server when the user checks this check 
box. Choose contact from the Form drop-down menu to associate this fi eld with the 
contact form and make sure Checked fi eld is not checked.
11 Repeat steps 8, 9 and 10 with diff erent values for the ID and Label to add a third 
check box for Charity Drive. Again, be sure to rename the check box Receive_Info
by using the right-click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac OS) method to link the
Name and ID values.
Now, preview the open page in a browser. Your form should look like this:
Your form, with check boxes inserted, should look like this.
12 With the page open in the browser, click the text next to the check boxes; notice that
this action selects the box. This is a function of the label tag. Try clicking the text of 
your Name and Address text fi elds. They have the same behavior because they also 
have labels.
Labels improve accessibility for all users, in particular for those who might be using 
screen readers or other devices.
13 Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Adding radio buttons
When you add radio buttons to your form, you encounter the same settings in the 
Property inspector as you do when you add check boxes. The only diff erence between 
check boxes and radio buttons is that from a group of radio buttons, only a single option 
can be selected. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple options.
To make two or more individual radio buttons mutually exclusive, you select two or more
radio buttons and give them the same name in the Property Inspector.
Creating a group of radio buttons by adding buttons one by one is often more time-
consuming than it’s worth. Thankfully, Dreamweaver off ers a more effi  cient method for 
creating a list of mutually exclusive options: the radio group.

14
353
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Adding form elements
Adding radio groups
The Radio Group element in the Insert toolbar provides a quick and easy way to add a list
of radio buttons to your form. The same rules regarding naming and values apply, but the
Radio Group dialog box allows you to include several entries in a group at once.
1 
Click and drag to select the three (Radio Button) placeholders and their labels (Yes, 
No, and Can’t Remember). Press Delete to remove them from your form. You’ll
create your own labels for this group.
2 
Click the Radio Group button in the Insert panel. The Radio Group dialog box 
opens, and off ers several property options.
Set properties for your radio group in the Radio Group dialog box.
3 
In the Name text fi eld of the Radio Group dialog box, type Membership Status to
give the group a name that associates all the radio buttons together.
You will now create a unique label for each button.
4 
Click the fi rst entry in the Label column and type Member.
5 
In the Value column of the Radio buttons section, you assign a value to each button 
to be passed back to the server. Click the fi rst entry in this column and type member. 
This returns a value of member when the user clicks on the Member radio button.
6 
Make sure Line breaks (
 tags) is selected in the Layout using section at the bottom 
g
of the dialog box. This will place a hard return after each radio button.
7 
Repeat steps 4 to 6, but this time create a label called Non-Member and a value of 
nonmember.

14

8 
Click OK. Choose File > Save, and then preview the open page in a browser. Click
each of the two radio buttons and note that only one radio button can ever be
selected. This is a function of a radio button group: for cases where you want more
than one option to be selected and returned, you could use check boxes.
After adding the radio group, your form should look like this.
9 
Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Check boxes can also be added as groups using the Checkbox Group option in the Insert panel.
Adding lists and menus
Lists and menus show choices within a list that permit users to choose single or multiple 
options. The List option displays as a scrolling list, and the Menu option displays as a 
drop-down menu. Both items are inserted using the Select element, but the behavior is
determined by the properties you set in the Property Inspector.
1 
Click and drag to select the placeholder text—(List) Store Events, Planting Season,
Anything—that follows your radio group. Press Delete to remove it from your form.
You’ll create your own labels for this list.
2 
Click the Select button (
) in the Insert panel and a new list or menu appears within
the form outline on your page.
3 
Select the text Select: in the label in front of the newly created form element and press 
Delete.

Adding a Text Area
Sometimes within a Dreamweaver form, you want to have a fi eld that simply provides an
open area into which users can enter text. For this form, you’ll add a Text Area element to 
provide a region for users to type in their comments about the site.
1 
Click and drag to select the placeholder text, (Comments), and delete it.
2 
Click the Text Area button (
) in the Insert panel and Dreamweaver inserts a new 
Text Area element in your page.
3 
Select the words Text Area in the label to the left of the fi eld, and replace them by
typing Comments then press Shift+Enter (Windows) or Shift+Return (Mac OS) to 
move the Text Area down one line.
4 
Click the Text Area, and notice the options that are now available in the Property
Inspector.
5 
Type Comments in the Name text fi eld and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
6 
Choose contact from the Form drop-down menu.
7 
Type 5 in the Rows text fi eld. 
8 
Type 40 in the Cols text fi eld to set the text input area to a width of 40 characters.
9 
Leave the other settings at their defaults and choose File > Save; then preview the 
open page in a browser. The Text Area will allow users to type inside of the box, 
and if the amount of text goes below the bottom of the text area, then a scrollbar will 
automatically appear.

Choose contact from the Form drop-down menu. 
Set the properties for your File fi eld in the Property Inspector.
The Class drop-down menu allows you to apply CSS to style this form fi eld. Using 
CSS to style form fi elds is discussed in more detail later in this lesson.
You are now fi nished with the fi le fi eld section of your form. Users can now either 
enter the desired fi le name or click Browse to navigate to it.
For the fi le fi eld element to actually upload a user’s fi le to your server, you’ll need to ask your 
server Administrator how the server is confi gured to accept fi les.

Styling forms with CSS

Styling forms with CSS
In Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” you explored the many ways you can use
CSS to format text and position content on an HTML page in Dreamweaver. However, 
the usefulness of CSS is not limited to static page content. Dynamic content, such as form 
fi elds, can also be successfully and creatively styled using CSS.
Attaching external styles
This exercise assumes you have already learned some of the basics of working with styles 
covered in previous lessons. You will now focus on applying some existing styles to the 
form elements that you’ve added in this lesson. The styles you apply have been created for 
you, but you must attach them to your form page in order to access them.
1 
If your CSS Designer panel is not currently open, open it now by choosing Window > 
CSS Designer.
2 
In the CSS Styles panel, click the Add CSS Source button (
) in the Sources menu bar 
and choose Attach Existing CSS File. The Attach External CSS File dialog box opens.
Select the CSS fi le you want to attach using the Attach External 
CSS File dialog box.
3 
Next to the File/URL fi eld, click the Browse button and select formstyles.css from
the dw14lessons folder. Press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS) to exit the Select
Style Sheet File dialog box.
4 
In the Attach External CSS File dialog box, click the Link radio button to create a 
link
 tag in the code for this page, and reference the location of the published
style sheet. Most major web browsers support the link method.
5 
In the Conditional Usage section of the Media drop-down menu, you can defi ne the 
target medium for your style sheet. For this exercise, leave this setting at its default, 
which is blank.
For more information on media-dependent style sheets, see the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) website at W3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html.
6 
Click OK to attach the style sheet to this document.

Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Styling forms with CSS
Setting a background color
Once the formstyles.css style sheet is attached, the backgrounds of your form fi elds change 
to a light blue color. This happens because formstyles.css contains a tag selector rule,
which instructs the 
tag you added earlier in the lesson to include a background 
color. The rule redefi nes the
tag, so the color is applied only to the background of 
the form fi elds themselves, and not to the entire body of the page.
The formstyles CSS contains a rule that specifi es a background color.
A major benefi t of using CSS is that once you complete the initial styling, you can revisit
the CSS fi le and change the included style rules. Because the blue background doesn’t fi t
in with the color scheme of your site, you’ll edit the form rule to change the background
to a light gray.
1 
In the CSS Designer panel, click the Sources menu bar to show all styles attached to 
this document. Locate formstyles.css in the list of Sources and click the fi lename. (You 
can expand and collapse the Sources pane by clicking the Sources menu bar.)

Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to preview the change to the background 
color.
You’ve successfully changed the background color of your form fi elds by editing an attached CSS.
You’ve just used a tag selector CSS rule to change the background color of your form.

You might have noticed another CSS rule included in formstyles.css along with the 
 defi nition. It’s a class style called

In the CSS Designer panel, click the .labels selector to select it; in the Properties pane, 
you can see the properties currently set for the class.
The font-family has been changed to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.
The font-weight is set to bolder.
The color has been set to a hexadecimal notation of #9FCC41, or green.
The

Form processing and validation
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

3 
In the Property Inspector, click the HTML button if necessary; click the Class menu 
and choose labels from the list. Because the Name, Address, City/State/Zip, and Email
are all within the same paragraph, the style will be applied, making them all green.
The 
 class applied to your form.
These are just a few of the ways you can use CSS to style form elements. Experiment 
further with diff erent properties to make your form more visually pleasing.
Form processing and validation
As attractive as CSS styling can make your form in Dreamweaver, you can’t collect form
data without using a server-side script or application (for example, CGI, PHP, ASP) to
process the data. 
CGI scripts are perhaps the oldest method of server-side scripting used to process form 
data. Several websites off er free CGI scripts that you can use. The hosting company for 
your website could also provide CGI scripts that perform many common tasks, such as 
collecting e-mail addresses or allowing visitors to send you comments through a web form.
Other methods include the use of other scripting languages, such as PHP, ASP, and others. 
It is beyond the scope of this book to cover all the various ways to process form data.
Prior to HTML5, form validation, a method for ensuring that the user has entered the
correct type of data in the form’s fi elds, also required scripting to work correctly. HTML5 
adds built-in form validation that checks the contents of specifi ed text fi elds directly
within the browser. This functionality is automatically applied to forms in HTML5
and can be overridden using the 
form attribute. However, older browsers
might still require the use of JavaScript so you will need to supply some level of scripting. 
Fortunately, Dreamweaver is capable of adding JavaScript to code that checks the contents 
of specifi ed text fi elds. This code is added through the Validate Form behavior. You will
be shown both methods of validation so that you can build your pages to work across 
various browsers.

14
365
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
HTML5 validation
HTML5 validation
HTML5 validation uses built-in browser support for the new HTML5 input elements 
and attributes. In order to take advantage of this validation you will mark certain fi elds as 
required to make sure the user has entered a value. You will also add new HTML5 input 
elements to collect the user’s e-mail address and check to make sure the user has entered a 
properly formed e-mail address.
1 
Return to organicform.html in Dreamweaver. Before you make any form fi elds
required, it is common practice to provide visual clues to user. Click to place an Insert
cursor after the Name label in your form template and type an asterisk (*). Repeat this
step and add asterisks after the Address, City, State, Zip, and Email labels. 
2 
Next, you will add a message informing users that fi elds marked with an asterisk are 
required. Place your Insert cursor after the colon (:) in the fi rst paragraph of text. 
Type (Required fi elds are marked with an asterisk *) and be sure to include the 
parenthesis.
Visual cues inform users of required fi elds.
3 
You are now ready to add the required attribute to the form fi elds. Click the Name 
text fi eld to select it. The Property Inspector lists the attributes for this input element.
Click the Required check box to place a checkmark in the box, marking this item as 
required. Browsers that support the HTML5 form elements will enforce that the user 
has typed a value in this fi eld when the form is submitted.
The Property Inspector displays the new HTML5 input attributes.
4 
Since the Name fi eld is the fi rst input element in the form, you can use the Auto 
Focus attribute to automatically place the user’s Insert cursor in the text box when the
form loads. Click the Auto Focus check box to instruct the user’s Browser to set this
fi eld to the active fi eld when the page loads.

14
HTML5 validation
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

5 
Another attribute that can improve usability for a user is the Placeholder attribute. The
Placeholder can include a text description or example to assist the user in entering the
requested information. With the Name fi eld still selected, type Please enter your 
full name in the Placeholder fi eld in the Property Inspector.
The attributes Required, Auto Focus and Placeholder set for the Name input fi eld.
6 
Press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Command+S (Mac OS) to save your progress and choose
File > Preview in Browser to test your browser’s support for these HTML5 attributes. 
At the time of this writing, all current browsers, including Internet Explorer 10,
support these attributes.
7 
Click the Submit button without entering any data in the fi rst fi eld. If you are using 
the current version of any modern browser, you should see a popup window pointing 
to the Name fi eld with a message asking the user to enter a value.
Firefox handles the required fi eld by placing the input cursor in the fi eld, showing a 
popup window, and outlining the fi eld in a red border.
Older browsers will require JavaScript to process form validation. You will use 
Dreamweaver’s Validate Form Behavior to ensure backwards compatibility with older 
browsers in the next activity.
Another way to ensure backwards compatibility for HTML5 form elements and attributes is to
use polyfi lls. Polyfi lls use JavaScript to detect browser support of HTML5 and CSS3 features 
and provide scripted workarounds in browsers that do not support the features. Two commonly
used polyfi ll techniques are the WebShims Lib (http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/

and H5F (https://github.com/ryanseddon/H5F

Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
The Validate Form behavior
The Validate Form behavior
The Validate Form behavior provides checks and balances for users when they complete 
forms on your site. You can make certain fi elds required, make sure a user has entered a 
value in a required fi eld, or make sure a user has entered the correct type of information in 
a fi eld. You can run validation on all fi elds in a form, or on individual fi elds contained in 
that form.
The fi rst step, however, is to get to know the Behaviors panel.
A look at the Behaviors panel
Generally speaking, the Behaviors panel provides a means for you to add JavaScript 
code to your page without actually having to type in the code. The code it inserts adds 
interactivity to your site, and is usually triggered by some user action. For example, when
the user clicks on or hovers over a link, the behavior performs a task. Behaviors are hardly
limited to use with forms, as they’re commonly used to add rollovers, open new windows,
check for plug-ins, and add navigation elements, among other functions.
Specifi cally, you use the Behaviors panel to add, modify, and remove behaviors. Because
you can apply multiple behaviors to the same object, you can also reorder them in the 
Behaviors panel.
1 
Access the Behaviors panel by choosing Window > Behaviors. If necessary, expand 
the panel grouping.

Click the Plus button (+) at the top of the Behaviors panel to see the list of available
options for the selected object. In this case, the menu displays options associated with 
a button element. If an option is grayed out, that action is not available for the selected
object.

369
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
The Validate Form behavior
Setting an event or trigger
An event (or trigger) is generally a specifi c user action needed for the Popup Window (or 
other behaviors) to work. In this case, you’ll set the window to appear when the user clicks 
the Validate button.
1 
In the top-left corner of the Behaviors panel, click the Show All Events button ( ).
The Show All Events button provides a complete list of all possible triggers for this 
behavior.
There are a number of choices for the 
event that triggers your specifi c behavior.
In this case, the default option 
 is the correct choice.
2 
Choose File > Save All and preview your page in a browser.
3 
Click the Validate button at the bottom of your form. The popup message you set
earlier appears.
Use this feature to warn your viewers, 
or to guide them in a certain direction.
Depending on the security confi gurations of your browser, you might be prompted to allow blocked 
content. If you’d like to change your preferences to avoid confl icts with scripts created in the Behaviors 
panel, refer to your browser’s documentation for instructions on changing the default settings.

Click OK to close the message, and close your browser window and return to 
Dreamweaver.
To further explore the Behaviors panel and its features, you’ll add a Form Validation 
behavior to the same button.
Validating form fields
The Validate Form action allows you to prevent the submission of a form unless a certain 
fi eld (or fi elds) is fi lled in by the user. You’ll apply this action to the Validate button you
created.
1 
In the document window, select the Validate button at the bottom of your form. The 
Behaviors panel should display the Popup Message action you added in the last exercise.
2 
At the top of the Behaviors panel, click the Plus button (+), and select Validate Form
from the drop-down menu that appears. The Validate Form dialog box opens.
Dreamweaver automatically identifi es the fi elds you have used on the page and lists
them in the fi elds section.
3 
Choose Mailing_list_name the fi rst entry in the Fields list. Click the Required check
e
box to require data entry into this fi eld before the user can submit the form.
4 
Click the Anything radio button so the fi eld accepts any alphanumeric entry. If you 
want to require that only numerical data be entered, you would select the Number radio 
button. If you want to check for an @ symbol within the entered data, you would click
the Email address radio button. Finally, if you want to check for a number within a
specifi c range, you could enter that range in the Number from and to fi elds.
Specify which form elements get validated, and what is accepted.
5 
Click OK to close the Validate Form dialog box.

14
371
Lesson 14, Building HTML5 Web Forms
Validating form fi elds
6 
Choose File > Save, then preview the form page in your browser. Leave the Name
fi eld blank, and click the Validate button at the bottom of your form.
Unfortunately, the Popup Message behavior you added earlier runs before the Validate
Form behavior, requiring you to close the Popup Message window to see the results of 
your validation. After you dismiss the Popup Message you will see the error message 
stating that the Mailing list name is required.
This means you have just a little more work to do; you’ll now adjust the Validate Form
behavior to correct these errors.
Changing a form field’s behavior order
To keep the popup message from appearing before the results of your validation, you’ll 
need to change the Validate Form behavior’s position in the behavior order, delete it, and 
reapply it to the correct button.
1 
In the Dreamweaver document window, click the Validate button to select it.
2 
Click the Show Set Events button in the Behaviors panel to toggle over to this view
(if necessary). You will now see your two actions, Popup Message and Validate Form, 
which share the same event, or trigger.
Use the Behaviors panel to reorder behaviors
and make them behave diff erently for the viewer.
3 
Click the Validate Form behavior to select it, and click the up arrow at the top of the
panel to move it to a position above the Popup Message behavior. Although this makes 
the Validate Form action run fi rst, the popup message still appears after the validation
window is closed. It actually makes more sense not to have the Validate Form 
behavior attached to the Validate button at all. You will now remove this behavior and
attach it to the Submit button instead.

14

Click the Minus button (–) to delete it from the behaviors associated with the Validate
button.
5 
Click the Submit button at the bottom of your form to select it. Repeat steps 2-4 in 
the preceding exercise to add the validation action to the Submit button.
Now it’s time to see the fruits of your labor.
Verifying field contents
Now that you’ve adjusted the Validate Form behavior, you’ll need to make sure the form 
function as you expect it to.
1 
Preview the open page in your browser, and click the Validate button. This should 
now display only the popup message. Close it.
2 
Click the Submit button. Even though the data is not actually submitted (for lack of a 
CGI script), the Validate Form warns you that required fi elds have not been fi lled.
The Validate Form behavior functions as 
you originally intended, thanks to some 
editing in the Behaviors panel.
You’ve successfully added validation to your form.

Review 
Self study
Using your new knowledge of building and editing web forms in Dreamweaver, try some 
of the following tasks using organicform.html to build on your experience:
Add the HTML5 url or telephone input types to ask the user for their website address
or telephone number. Test HTML5 validation of these input fi elds by viewing the page 
in a browser and entering both valid and invalid values for web addresses and telephone 
numbers.
Edit the Validate Form behavior you applied to the Submit button in the last exercise.
Apply validation to the other text fi elds in your form, providing checks for the specifi c 
content to be fi lled out in each fi eld. Preview the page in your browser to ensure that the 
validation works.
Create an internal CSS that redefi nes the 
 tag. Set the background color of each 
form fi eld to light green to match your page’s color scheme. Experiment with the other 
styling options available to you in the CSS Rule Defi nition dialog box to further style
your form elements.
Explore the other form fi eld elements in the Forms category of the Insert panel. Add a 
hidden fi eld to return the creation date of the form when it is submitted, while keeping 
this information hidden from the user. Add an Image fi eld to turn a placed image into a 
button with a behavior attached. Group your form fi elds into labeled sections, using the
Fieldset button.

The form element serves as a container for the fi elds you’ll be adding to the form. If 
you simply add form fi elds to a page in Dreamweaver, the user’s browser won’t know 
what to do with the user’s information when they click the Submit button. To identify 
this information as part of a package, and to specify the route that information should 
take when submitted, you need to create a Dreamweaver form.
2 
The diff erence between adding check boxes and radio buttons in a form is that from 
a group of radio buttons, only a single option can be selected. Check boxes allow the 
selection of multiple options. 
3 
Because CSS allows you to apply several formatting attributes with a single mouse 
click, both static and dynamic content (such as form fi elds) can be successfully and 
creatively styled using CSS. CSS also streamlines your workfl ow by allowing you to 
revisit CSS fi les and change the included style rules once you’ve completed the initial 
styling.
4 
You can’t collect form data without using a server-side script or application such as 
CGI, JSP, or ASP to process the data. CGI scripts are the most popular form of server-
side scripting mechanism to process form data. Several websites off er free CGI scripts 
that you can use. Your site’s ISP could also provide CGI scripts for you.

The Behaviors panel provides a means for you to add JavaScript code to your page 
without actually having to type in the code. The code it inserts adds interactivity to 
your site, and is usually triggered by some user action. For example, when the user 
clicks on or hovers over a link, the behavior performs a task. Behaviors are commonly

6 
The new HTML5 form features, such as the Required attribute, and the new input 
types for e-mail, web address and telephone number, make it possible to process and 
validate forms using functionality built into modern web browsers instead of relying 
on JavaScript.

Introducing the jQuery UI Widgets
Dreamweaver CC introduces jQuery UI Widgets, giving you the ability to create 
powerful, interactive navigation and user interface elements with easy-to-use insert bar 
objects. The jQuery UI Widgets replace the Spry Widgets and include accordion menus, 
interactive controls, and tabbed containers, all of which harness the power of CSS for 
easy customization and styling to match any project. They are a great way to enhance 
navigation, organize content, and add dynamic style to your web pages.
The jQuery UI Library
Developed by the jQuery Foundation, jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface 
interactions, eff ects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. 
Whether you’re building highly interactive web applications or you just need to add a date
picker to a form control, jQuery UI makes the task possible.
The jQuery UI Widgets included in Dreamweaver allow you to easily add the most
frequently used features and functionality of this library.
A look at the project
In this lesson, you’ll be completing the OrganicUtopia home page by using and
customizing diff erent jQuery UI Widgets. Before you get started, take a look at the 
completed version of the page to get an idea of what you’ll be working toward.

The jQuery Tabbed panel
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
378
The jQuery Tabbed panel
The jQuery Tabbed panel widget organizes content into several panels that you can toggle
between by clicking tabs. This is a great way to organize items on a page: it saves space and 
can improve usability when used correctly. 
Editing the content of the tabbed panels is easy; you can type directly within the tabs 
or containers in the document window. Tabbed panels can contain almost any type of 
content, including text, images, video, and animation.
You’ll now add a jQuery Tabbed panel to your page to display three pieces of featured 
content.
1 
From the Files menu, locate and open the index_start.html fi le for editing.
2 
Choose File > Save As and save the page as index_work.html into your site’s root
folder.
3 
Near the top of your page, select the placeholder text that reads {tabbed panels here}, 
and delete it. Leave your cursor at this position.
4 
Click the Insert panel (if necessary) to expand it and choose the jQuery UI category. 
Locate and click the Tabs button (
) and click it to add a new tabs panel set.
Add a new jQuery Tabs Panel at the top of the page, as shown.
5 
Click inside the Tabs widget and then click <div#Tabs1> in the tag selector. Locate
the Panels column in the center of the Property Inspector below. This shows you the
current panels (and tabs) in your panel set, and lets you add new ones.

6 
In the Property Inspector, click Tab 1 to activate it. On the page and within the tab, 
select the text Tab 1 and type What’s New in its place. 
Select the text inside Tab 1 and rename it to What’s New.
7 
Select the text within Tab 2 and type Featured. Select the text within Tab 3 and type 
Customer Testimonials. Be careful as you move from one tab to the next: if the eye
icon appears and you click it, the tab will open up. For now, you just want to rename 
the tab headings.
Next, you will add content into the areas inside each tab.
8 
Below the tabbed panel, you’ll see three paragraphs of content that you’ll move and
organize into the new panel group. Highlight the entire fi rst paragraph, beginning 
with the headline Shop In the Green and be sure to include the recycle bag image. 
Choose Edit > Cut.
9 
Select the placeholder text within the fi rst tab (Content 1), then choose Edit > Paste to
paste the content directly into the What’s New panel. You will now place content into 
w
the Featured panel.

Styling jQuery UI widgets with CSS
15 Choose File > Save All and preview your page in the browser to see your tabs in
action. The copy dependent fi les dialog box will appear. Click OK to accept.
jQuery UI support files
The first time you save a page that includes a jQuery UI Widget, you are prompted to save
new and necessary files to your site. If you look at your Files panel, you will notice that a 
new jQuery Assets folder has been added to your site files. This folder contains essential 
JavaScript, CSS, and image files that style your new widget and make it work. Be sure to copy
this folder to your web server when publishing your site—your widgets will not work without it.
16 Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver. Now we will style this panel to match 
the page theme.
Styling jQuery UI widgets with CSS
One of the many benefi ts of using the jQuery UI widgets is that they share a common set
of style sheets that you can customize to match to the color scheme of your website. In 
this exercise, you will change the color of the panel headings and tabs so that they match 
the OrganicUtopia color scheme. Once applied, these styles will apply to other jQuery UI
widgets that you will add to your page.
1 
In the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel, locate and select the style sheet named 
, which was attached when you added the tabbed panel 
group. This is the primary style sheet on which all of the jQuery UI widget styles are
based. The jQuery UI tabbed panel also has a specifi c style sheet that you can modify 
to change its appearance, as you will see later in this exercise. 
2 
Click the Selector named 
to display its properties. Click the
Show set check box in the Properties Navigation bar to show all of the properties
and then click the Background button to display the background properties. Click
the 
 value, type #88B036 (dark green), and then press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This changes the color of the entire panel.
The jQuery UI Widgets also use an image to create a glossy appearance, which you 
will now disable to allow the green color to show through,

Locate the background-image property and click the Disable CSS Property button 
(
) to disable the background-image. 
Modify the 
 rule to change 
the appearance of the tab background.
4 
Click the Selector beginning with
.
Click the
value, type #CF9 (light green), and then press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Disable the background-image as you did with the 
previous selector. This changes the color of the currently selected tab.
5 
Click the Selector beginning with
. Click 
the background-color value, type #88B036, press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS), and then disable the
. This sets the background color 
of the non-active tabs to the same shade of green as the active tab when you hover 
your mouse over them.
The panel’s height is currently being defi ned by the amount of content. If you wanted
to override this, you could set an explicit height for the panels.
6 
Locate the fi le jquery.ui.tabs.min.css in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel.
This style sheet specifi es the style rules for the tabs control. Scroll to the bottom of the 
Selectors list and click the .
selector.

Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation bar and locate the 
property. Click the drop-down menu to the right and choose
from the pop-up
menu. In the new fi eld that appears, type 250 (make sure px is specifi ed) and then
press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This increases the overall height of the 
content panels.
You can override the height of the panels by modifying 
the 
style.
8 
Choose File > Save All. Then preview your page in the browser to see your tabs in
action. The copy dependent fi les dialog box will appear. Click OK to accept. There 
are a few other styles that you could modify here, but for now, you’ll move on to the 
next jQuery UI Widget: the Accordion Panel.
jQuery Themeroller
Styling your jQuery UI Widgets can be a daunting task for a beginner web designer. 
Fortunately, the jQuery Foundation has provided an easy to use tool for creating custom 
themes that can be applied to your web pages. 
The jQuery Themeroller allows you to change every aspect of the jQuery UI Widget styles 
and then export those changes as a custom theme. For more information on the jQuery
Themeroller, visit http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/

The jQuery UI Accordion panel
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
384
The jQuery UI Accordion panel
At fi rst glance, the jQuery Accordion panel resembles a standard vertical menu bar. As the 
name suggests, however, each item contracts and expands to reveal a content panel where
you can add text and images. The accordion panel allows you to have only one panel open 
at a time.
Accordion panels are great for navigation, tree-style navigation or lists, or organizing 
related content (such as a Frequently Asked Questions list) into a clean, panel-style format.
As with the other jQuery UI Widgets, the jQuery UI Accordion uses its own style sheet, 
which you can easily modify to make it match your current theme. 
1 
In the right column, locate the placeholder text that reads {accordion here}. Select and 
delete the placeholder text, and leave your cursor in place.
2 
From the Insert panel, click and add a new Accordion at the cursor position. Click 
inside the Accordion widget and then click 
in the tag selector.
The jQuery UI Accordion added to the sidebar.
The Property Inspector below now displays the properties for the new widget.
3 
In the Property Inspector, you see a list of the panels currently in your accordion 
(Section 1, Section 2 and Section 3). Click the plus sign (+) above the list to add a new
panel, for a total of four. A label displays above each new panel. 
4 
Click Section 4 in the Panels menu, and then press the down arrow twice to push
Section 4 to the bottom of the list. This step is not mandatory, but it helps to keep 
your label order straight.

On your page, highlight the Section 1 text. Delete it and type Food Products in its 
place. Do not press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) after typing.
t
Type directly within the accordion labels to 
rename them.
6 
Repeat step 5 for the Sections 2, 3, and 4, renaming them Clothing, Home 
Products, and Lifestyle, respectively. Next, you’ll add content to each panel that
corresponds to its label.
7 
In your Files panel, locate the text folder and expand it. Double-click and open the fi le 
named accordiontext.html. This contains the text you’ll add to the accordion panel.
8 
Select the text below the Food Products heading (don’t include the heading itself), and 
choose Edit > Cut. Return back to your index_work.html page.
9 
Click inside the Accordion widget and then click 
in the tag 
selector to ensure it is selected; then, in the Properties panel, click the Food Products 
panel to open it. 
Open the Food Products panel by clicking it in the Properties panel.
Highlight the placeholder text on your page, and then choose Edit > Paste to paste it
in the text from your content fi le.
10 Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the remaining paragraphs in the accordiontext.html fi le,
pasting them into the Clothing, Home Products, and Lifestyle panels, respectively.
e
One of the benefi ts of using the jQuery UI widgets is that they share CSS fi les for 
common features. Since we changed the background, active and default states for these 
styles when inserting the Tabs panel, the Accordion has automatically received the
same styles.

appears, click OK to allow Dreamweaver to copy any necessary fi les for your new 
widget to the site folder.
12 Choose File > Preview in Browser to see your new tabbed panel group in action. 
When you are done, close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Create a single collapsible panel
A collapsible panel displays or reveals its contents when clicked, and is a great way to hide 
information that doesn’t need to be visible at all times. You can create a collapsible panel 
using a jQuery UI Accordion that displays a single panel and label.
You’ll add a jQuery UI Accordion panel to create a collapsible e-mail sign-up form at the 
bottom of your page.
1 
In the bottom half of the right column, locate the placeholder text that reads {Email
signup box here}. Select and delete the placeholder text and leave your cursor 
positioned in its place.
2 
On the Insert panel, locate and click the Accordion button to add a panel at your 
cursor position.
3 
Select the text that reads Section 1 at the top of the panel, and type Contact Us in its 
place. 
4 
Below the panel, select the paragraph that reads Enter your e-mail address to receive
specials, event notifi cations and more! and also select the form elements.
Select all the content immediately below the 
jQuery UI Accordion panel.
5 
Choose Edit > Cut.

6 
Select the text that reads Content 1 shown in the panel area of your accordion panel, 
and paste the content you cut in its place. The text and form fi eld now appear inside 
the panel.
7 
Click the blue tab above the Accordion panel: Accordion 2 to select it. In the Property 
Inspector, click Section 2 in the Panels window to select it, and then click the minus 
sign (-) to delete the panel. Repeat these steps to delete Section 3 as well.
You can also defi ne the default appearance of the accordion panel; in this case, you 
would like it to be able to be fully collapsed.
8 
In the Property Inspector, click the Collapsible check box to set it so that the panel
can be fully collapsed.
Use the Property Inspector to set the new panel’s Collapsible state.
9 
Choose File > Save All to save your page. When the Copy Dependent Files dialog 
box appears, click OK to allow Dreamweaver to copy any necessary fi les to your site
folder.
10 Choose File > Preview in Browser, and select a browser to test your page and see your 
new Collapsible panel in action. When you click the Contact Us label, the sign-up 
text and form appears—click it again to close it.
11 Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.

• Previewing your web page 
using window sizes
• Working with Media 
Queries
• Creating styles for a mobile 
device
• Working with Fluid Grids
Lesson 16
The Web is no longer only about desktop screens. Users of the Web 
are looking for their sites to function on many diff erent size screens 
and devices. Dreamweaver has a few features designed to help you 
make your site compatible for mobile devices.
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this 
book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw16lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard-drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw16essons folder. Go 
to Site > New Site, or for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New 
Site.”

Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
The rise of the mobile web
Creating websites has always presented certain challenges. Among these challenges is the 
fact that the people who visit your site might have diff erent size monitors; therefore, the
page layout that works well on one screen might not work so well on another screen. 
Another challenge is the diff erent versions of web browsers that users might have. A page 
that looks one way in Internet Explorer 10 might not look the same way on Internet
Explorer 6. Despite these challenges, the Web has thrived and grown tremendously 
because the benefi ts it off ers far outweigh the downsides. Instant access to information, 
the ability to easily share information through hyperlinks and e-mail, the convenience of 
online shopping and payment: these are all major benefi ts.
The mobile web has all these benefi ts and more. The Web is now portable. It is no
longer tethered to a desktop and is accessible wherever a user has a connection. In many
cases, external peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse, have dropped in favor of 
touchscreens’ miniature keyboards. Built-in features such as GPS and cameras can also 
come into play, allowing the user to interact with the Web in new and diff erent ways.
However, with all these benefi ts come new challenges. Portable screens also mean
smaller screens. Consequently, your great desktop design suff ers as it scales. Navigation
that works well on the desktop could become diffi  cult to click at ¼ the size. Other 
challenges include the still-limited bandwidth that currently exists when using a cellular 
network, the inability to play certain media such as Flash or web video, and web browser 
incompatibility, which is an issue that has not been resolved.
Dreamweaver tools for mobile layout
Dreamweaver CC has a few diff erent tools for designers and developers who want to 
optimize their content for mobile devices. Before proceeding, you should learn about the 
diff erent categories of the mobile web, which are explained next.
• Native applications
Smartphones, such as those on iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms, 
have achieved a tremendous amount of growth and popularity since 2007 and the
introduction of Apple’s iPhone. Native applications, or apps, live on a user’s device. Apps 
are tightly integrated with the Web and display content from the Web, but they are 
not exclusively dependent on the Web. Dreamweaver CC is capable of creating native 
applications for iOS, Android, and Blackberry; however, it does so with the help of the
Phonegap framework. With PhoneGap and Dreamweaver CC, you start with an HTML
and JavaScript document and are able to then build multiple apps for the diff erent
16

16
391
Lesson 16, Responsive Design and Layout for Mobile Devices
The rise of the mobile web
platforms. We do not cover PhoneGap functionality in this lesson or in this book. For 
more information go to phonegap.com. You can also launch the PhoneGap service in 
Dreamweaver CC by choosing Site > PhoneGap Build Service.
The PhoneGap service integrated with Dreamweaver CC
allows you to build native applications for mobile devices.
• Websites
All websites that can be accessed on a desktop browser can also be accessed on a mobile 
browser; therefore, every web page is part of the mobile web. However, as you will 
soon see, when a mobile web browser visits a website, the appearance of that site might 
be diff erent from the desktop version. There are a few diff erent explanations for this: 
 – The appearance of a web page on a mobile device might be diff erent than the
desktop version due to the scaling eff ect that the device’s web browser applies. 
Apple’s popular mobile Safari browser, for example, scales a web page to fi t the 
screen and also allows for touch gestures such as pinch, zoom, or swiping in order to 
navigate through a page. Websites that were never intended for mobile viewing will
still have these features because they are built-in to the browser itself.
 – The appearance of a web page on a mobile device might be diff erent than the
desktop version because the designer or developer has created a separate version 
designed for mobile. All web browsers, whether they are mobile or desktop, 
advertise themselves with something called a user agent. The creator of a website 
can let in all desktop user agents to their standard site and redirect all mobile users
to a separate mobile site.

Mobile website features in Dreamweaver
This lesson focuses on two methods for creating websites optimized for mobile. The fi rst 
method focuses on using CSS3 Media Queries. In the exercise for this method, you will 
take the existing layout created in Lesson 6 and create a layout optimized for a mobile 
device, such as a smartphone. The second method focuses on the Fluid Grid Layout 
feature in Dreamweaver CC. This method also uses CSS3 Media Queries, but in a slightly 
diff erent and more advanced way than the fi rst exercise.
Dreamweaver does its best to simplify the process used to create mobile optimized sites,
but you should note that this is the most advanced and diffi  cult lesson in this book. You
should also realize that at the time of this writing, there is no application on the market 
that makes designing a website for multiple screens easy. We fi rmly believe that a thorough 
understanding of the fundamentals of HTML, particularly CSS, is important when
working with your sites. Therefore, once you have learned some of these fundamentals, 
you will fi nd the tools in Dreamweaver to be extremely helpful and effi  cient.
Previewing your web page using window sizes
Dreamweaver CC allows you to preview your web page as it would appear on diff erent 
screen sizes. Specifi cally, this preview shows you your design in three diff erent views by
default: one for the desktop, and the other two for the smaller screens found in smartphone 
and tablet devices. Given that mobile device screens come in diff erent sizes, you can also 
customize these views to any resolution you want. Additionally, Dreamweaver takes 
advantage of CSS3 Media Queries to let you build individual style sheets customized for 
each view. If you have not worked with Media Queries before, this exercise is designed to 
introduce you to the concept and also to help you learn how to use them in Dreamweaver.
1 
In the Files panel, double-click the media_queries folder and then double-click 
16_index.html to open it. The basic design here is based on the one you created in
Lesson 6 and uses fl oats and clears to create columns.
2 
Choose File > Preview in Browser and select a browser. This page has a fi xed-width 
size of 960 pixels and works well on most desktop monitor resolutions. 
To preview this page as it would appear on a mobile device such as a Smartphone or 
tablet device, you can use Dreamweaver CC’s Window Size option.

3 
Return to Dreamweaver and locate the three small buttons at the bottom-right corner 
of the document window. 
You can fi nd the Window Sizes buttons just above the Property Inspector.
Each icon represents one of three common window sizes; Mobile (480 × 800), Tablet 
(768 × 1024) and Desktop (1000w). Note that the height of the Desktop view might be 
different on your screen but the width will always default to 1000 pixels wide.
Dreamweaver’s window size previews provide three views by default: Phone, Tablet, 
and Desktop.

16
The rise of the mobile web
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
394
As you can see from the previews, the Mobile view and the Tablet view are not wide
enough to fi t your fi xed-width page. You should note that the window sizes are not an
emulator. (An emulator is software that attempts to imitate a hardware phone or other 
computer device.) Most modern smartphones would actually scale your entire page 
to fi t in the browser window. The window sizes are showing you the page based on a 
strict interpretation of the viewport.
A viewport, as it relates to mobile devices, is best described as a viewing area on the 
screen through which a user views a web page. 
4 
Click the Mobile Size button in the lower-right corner of the document window. 
Select View > Window Size; the default window sizes appear in a pop-up menu. The 
default value for the Mobile viewport is 480 × 800 SmartPhone. Click the Tablet size
button to the right of the Mobile size button. Select View > Window Sizes again; the
default values for the Tablet viewport is 768w by 1024h. 
These numbers are not arbitrary; the Mobile viewport width is 480 and the Tablet
viewport width is 768 because these are typical screen resolutions for devices such as
the iPhone, iPad, and others. 
Screen resolutions actually do vary among devices, but Dreamweaver has chosen these as 
standards.
5 
You can change the viewport sizes by clicking Edit Sizes… to bring up the Window 
Sizes category in the Dreamweaver Preferences panel; however, we recommend you 
use the default sizes until you become more familiar with the reasons for modifying 
the sizes.
These viewport sizes are important because you can create unique style sheets that 
will only apply to viewports of a certain size. For example, for the smallest viewport
you might want a layout that is only a single column, instead of the current three-
column layout design used for the desktop layout. You can do this in Dreamweaver 
using window sizes and a related feature called Media Queries.
Media Queries defined
Media Queries in Dreamweaver take advantage of a feature in CSS3, which is the latest
version of CSS. This feature is part of the CSS3 specifi cation called CSS3 Media Queries. 
Media Queries are a way of delivering diff erent page layouts to users based on the 
capabilities of their screen or screens.
You can think of a CSS3 media query as a combination of HTML and CSS syntax that
examines the capability of a user agent, typically a web browser, and lets you send it styles
based on certain values. The most common capability queried is the width of a screen or 
a mobile device; other capabilities, such as the device orientation (landscape or portrait), 
can also be detected. Since media queries detect the capabilities of a user’s screen and 
serve styles that fi t that screen, they are well-suited for today’s web environment with its 

16

diff erent monitor resolutions. The following diagram shows a simplifi ed version of how
media queries work: each device gets a specifi c style sheet based on the size of its screen.
desktop.css
tablet.css
phone.css
Server
Unique style sheets are delivered to users depending on their screen capabilities.
Here is a diff erent example: suppose a user has a smartphone with a screen resolution of 
480 pixels wide by 800 pixels high, and the phone is in portrait mode (vertical). This user 
visits a website that uses media queries. When the user visits the site, the media queries
built into the page detect the capabilities of the phone and serve it a specifi c style sheet 
with a single column layout. When the user rotates the phone into landscape position, the 
change is detected and the media queries send a style sheet designed for a 800 pixel-wide
screen (the layout might have two columns instead of one).
From the perspective of users, they are simply getting the ideal layout for the screen
size they are using. Users might notice this change in layout momentarily as they rotate

Creating media queries
As noted earlier, media queries are a relatively new advance in web design and are part of 
the CSS3 specifi cation. (Most of the CSS you have been working on throughout this book
has been part of the CSS2.0 specifi cation.) There are many benefi ts to using media queries,
but their use is a tradeoff  because they are not fully supported by all browsers (particularly
older browsers).
Dreamweaver CC adds Media Query support through the new CSS Designer panel. You
create the Media Queries in the @Query pane and the code is added to either an internal
or external style sheet. In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create new Media Queries for a 
Mobile layout and a Tablet layout.
1 
Click the CSS Designer tab to open the CSS Designer panel.
2 
Click the Add CSS Source button in the Sources menu bar (
) and choose Create a 
New CSS File from the pop-up menu. The Create a New CSS File dialog box opens.
3 
Click the Browse button to bring up the Save Style Sheet File As window. Navigate to 
your site root folder then type mobile.css as the File name and click Save to return to 
the Create New CSS File window.
4 
Click OK to create the new CSS File.
5 
Repeat steps 2–4 to create another new style sheet. Save the second sheet as tablet.css.
6 
The two new style sheets now show up in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer 
panel. You will now attach Media Queries to each style sheet so that they are utilized
for specifi c screen resolutions.
7 
Click mobile.css in the Sources pane and then click the Add Media Query button in
the @Media menu bar. The Defi ne Media Query window is displayed.
The Conditions section of this window allows you to specify the parameters that must 
be met for a browser to use this style sheet. The fi rst condition listed will apply the
Media Query if the media fi eld is set to screen when the browser reports its user-agent
information.

Place your cursor over the blank area to the right of the screen drop-down menu and 
Dreamweaver will display the Add condition button (
) and Remove condition 
button (
).
The Conditional Usage section of the Defi ne Media Query dialog box.
9 
Click the Add condition button (
) to add another condition. The next condition
will appear as orientation landscape. Click the down arrow to the right of landscape
and choose portrait. Most mobile devices are used in the portrait mode, facing up and 
down, and when not used facing up and down, referred to as landscape mode, their 
width in pixels is about as wide as a tablet.
10 Hover your cursor to the right of the second condition and click the Add condition 
button again. This time the condition will appear as min-width. Usually a condition 
might have a
but in this case we only care to show the styles in mobile.css 
if the screen width is reported as 480px or less. Click the down arrow to the right of 
min-width and choose max-width from the menu.

11 Type 480 in the width text box and click anywhere outside the fi eld. Notice that the 
code: window lists the Media Query using the 
 keyword and the conditions
that you selected. 
The three conditions for the Media Query for mobile.css have been set.
Click OK. You have now specifi ed the conditions which will be used to apply 
the styles in the mobile.css style sheet. You will now create the Media Query for 
tablet.css to defi ne the conditions for tablet devices.
12 Click tablet.css in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel then click the Add New 
Media Query button in the @Media menu bar.
13 Click the Add condition button (
) to the right of the media screen condition.
14 Click the down arrow to the right of landscape and choose portrait. Most tablet 
devices are also used in the portrait mode and when not used facing up and down, 
they are about as many pixels wide as a desktop or laptop computer screen.
15 Hover your cursor to the right of the second condition and click the Add condition 
button again. This time the condition will appear as
. 
16 Type 481 in the min-width text box and click the Add condition button once again.
The fi nal condition is max-width.

Lesson 16, Responsive Design and Layout for Mobile Devices
The rise of the mobile web
17 Type 768 in the max-width text box and click OK.
The three conditions for Media Query for tablet.css have been set.
Specifying the min and max width creates a Media Query suitable for tablets, which 
typically have widths of over the 480px of a mobile phone and narrower than the 
768px of a desktop or laptop computer. 
The preceding steps might seem long, but you only need to do them the fi rst time you
set up media queries. Once you have them set up, you have a framework for creating 
unique styles for screens of diff erent sizes.
Creating a layout optimized for mobile
Now that you have prepared your site with Media Queries and associated style sheets, you 
can begin using them. The general principle of CSS3 Media Queries is that you use the 
exact same names for the style rules in your mobile and tablet style sheets as the style rules
in your main style sheet. By using the same names, you override the main style wherever 
needed. For example, you will fi rst apply this rule with the ID style called 
.
In your main style sheet, this ID style defi nes the width of the entire page as 960 pixels. In
your mobile style sheet, you will create another rule with the name 
, but you 
will set the width to 100% for this style.

In the following exercise, you will only work with the mobile style sheet; use the tablet
style sheet for practice.
1 
Click the Mobile window size button in the bottom right corner of the document 
window. From all appearances, the preview looks exactly the same as it did at the 
beginning of the lesson, and yet all the work you did in the last few exercises will now
begin to pay off . 
2 
In the Sources pane of the CSS Designer, click the mobile.css fi le and then click the
Media Query in the @Media pane. The Selectors list for this style sheet is blank as 
there are currently no styles in this sheet. Your fi rst task is to change the width of your 
container.
3 
In the CSS Designer panel, click the Add Selector button, and then in the Selector 
pane, type #container. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
4 
Click the Add CSS Property button (
) in the Properties menu bar, then click
the Layout button (
) in the Properties Navigation bar. Locate the width property
and double-click the placeholder in the width box, then type 100% and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to change the width.

When viewing your page in Design view using the Mobile window size, you will see 
your page has dramatically changed in the Mobile viewport. By setting the width of 
the container to 100%, it will only be as wide as the viewport and most of the content
within will have shifted or is overlapping. For example, the background image of 
the vegetables is now under the logo. Scroll down the page and note that your side
columns have shifted.
The Mobile view shows the eff ect of changing the container width to 100%.

16
The rise of the mobile web
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
402
As you can see, creating a page optimized for mobile is not as simple as setting the 
container width to 100%. The page has changed, and you will need to modify it. The
layout elements inside the container need to be addressed as well, since most of them 
have height or width values set as pixels. Also, some of the elements are fl oating. To
fi x the rest of the page, you will add rules that remove fl oats and override any explicit
pixel width or height value. The goal is to create a single column layout.
Tips and strategies for optimizing pages for mobile
The following is a list of tips and strategies to consider when designing pages for mobile. 
Navigating and using websites on smaller screens or screens that are touch-enabled is very 
different from the desktop, and you should take it into consideration.
• Navigation should be at or near the top of the screen to be easily accessible. Repeat 
navigation at the bottom of all your pages so the user does not have to scroll up after 
reading a page.
• For touchscreen devices, use a large target size for navigation links to prevent accidental 
clicking.
• Touchscreen devices do not always have a hover capability as triggered by the mouse cursor 
on desktops. Plan your styles accordingly and avoid rollover styles.
• Avoid image-based navigation; use list-based navigation styled with CSS.
• Single-column layout is much easier to navigate and read on a smaller screen. A general
strategy for accomplishing this with media queries is by removing floated elements and 
most layout containers with fixed width and height pixel values.
6 
You will now add more styles to your mobile.css style sheet and create a single-
column layout.
7 
Click the mobile.css fi le in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel. You’ll now 
add styles for the header section.
8 
In the Selector pane, click the Add Selector button, and then in the Selector text box,
type header. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

Click the Add CSS Property button in the Properties menu bar and then click the 
Background button. Click the text label url under the background-image category
l
and choose none from the drop-down menu. This will remove the image of the
vegetables, which works well in the desktop version, but not in the mobile version.
Setting the background-image to none removes the image of the vegetables from the header.
10 Choose File > Save all. 
Your next step is to address the styles of the navigation bar. Typically, CSS navigation
bars have a few diff erent rules that you need to modify.

Creating styles for navigation and a single-column layout
Creating easy-to-use mobile navigation is very important because you want users to read
your content and not be frustrated by content that’s diffi  cult to access. The hit target for 
mobile navigation should be large enough for touchscreens and easy to read. You’ll add 
these styles now.
1 
Click the mobile.css fi le in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel and then click 
the Media Query in the @Media pane. In the Selectors pane, click the Add Selector 
button, and then in the Selector name box, type nav and press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS).
2 
In the Properties pane, click the Text button and choose the keyword medium in 
the font-size property drop-down menu. This action prevents issues when there are
diff erences between device screen resolutions.
3 
Click the Layout button, and set the height property to auto to override the fi xed 
height of 36 pixels from the original style sheet.
You will need to do more work to make the navigation look better. There are often 
diff erent rules for CSS navigation menus, so you also need to modify these.
4 
In the Selector pane of the CSS Designer panel, click the Add Selector button, and 
then in the Selector name box, type nav ul li. This targets the style of the list items in 
the nav bar.
Create a compound selector to make a style for 
the navigation list items.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
5 
Click the Layout button in the Properties Navigation bar, locate the fl oat property,
and choose none. This overrides the fl oat:left rule set in your original style sheet.

16
405
Lesson 16, Responsive Design and Layout for Mobile Devices
The rise of the mobile web
6 
Notice that by setting the fl oat property of the list items to none, the list reverts to its 
default positioning, which is vertical.
Changing the fl oat value of list items to none creates a vertical 
navigation instead of a horizontal one.
Your page is starting to improve: the navigation is now a single column. Place your 
cursor over the links and notice that the original hover styles are still present. One of 
the benefi ts of CSS3 Media Queries is that the original styles that have no overrides 
are still used.
Scroll down and notice that you still need to improve other areas: the main content 
and the sidebar still appear broken, but this is relatively easy to fi x.
7 
Click the mobile.css fi le in the Sources pane of the CSS Designer panel and then click
the Media Query in the @Query pane.
8 
In the Selectors menu bar click the Add Selector button, and then in the Selector 
name box type #main. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
9 
In the Properties Navigation bar, click the Layout button, scroll down to the fl oat
property, and choose none. This overrides the
property and value set in
your original style sheet.

16

10 Scroll to the width property menu and choose auto.
Set the fl oat value of the main column to none 
and the width to auto.
11 Repeat Steps 8, 9, and 10, but use the Selector name sidebar instead of #main.
12 Click the Background button (
) and set the background-color to white (
).
13 Choose File > Save All Related Files. Scroll down your page and notice that your 
content section and sidebar now fi ll the screen from edge to edge. Also, notice that by 
removing the fl oats, your sidebar is now located below the main content.
14 Click the Design button to switch to this view. Then click the Live view button. Live
view uses the WebKit rendering engine, which is the same as Apple Safari and Google 
Chrome browser.

15 Click the Mobile window size button located on the bottom right of your document
window; your window will automatically adjust to this size and your media query fi le 
will be applied. This will also work in the Design view; however, you should place 
your cursor over the navigation. Note that in Live view the rollovers are active.
You can also preview your page in the browser and reduce the width of the window. 
Note that some browsers will not let you make the window that small. The phone.css 
is designed for phone browsers, not desktop browsers.
Preview in Browser. When the width is less than 480, the layout 
switches to the mobile.css styles.
You can create and add other styles to the mobile style sheet. You now have 
the foundations of how to create diff erent layouts using media queries in
Dreamweaver CC, and apply them to the tablet style sheet. You can close the
currently open fi les; you will not need them.

The basics of Fluid Grid Layout
Dreamweaver’s Fluid Grid Layout expands on the concept of media queries. To understand 
fl uid grids, think about page layout. Remember that the layout you began working with 
at the beginning of this lesson was a fi xed-width layout set to a width of 960 pixels wide.
Fixed-width layouts are very common on the Web because they are reliable to work with
and control. However, one of the downsides of fi xed-width layouts is that they do not 
respond well to diff erent size screens. Many designers feel that fi xed-width layouts do not 
refl ect the nature of the Web and that fl exible or fl uid layouts are better suited for content.
Flexible layouts generally use percentages or em units to defi ne the various sections on the 
page. For example, the width of a sidebar might be defi ned as 33% of the page rather than
450 pixels.
If you would like to see the results of this exercise before you begin, navigate to the done folder 
within the fl uidgrid folder, open the index.html fi le within a browser that supports media 
queries and resize the browser window.
1 
Chose File > New …; the New Document window appears. Click the Fluid Grid 
Layout category on the left side of the window to display the Fluid Grid Layout
settings.
The fi rst major change you will see is that Fluid Grids actually create three layouts at 
a time: Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop. Each of these layouts is defi ned as media queries;
in this way, the settings are very similar to the ones you saw in the last exercise. 
However, notice that fl uid grids use media queries, and they add grid structure to help
you align content on the page.
The Fluid Grid Layout has layout settings for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

16
409
Lesson 16, Responsive Design and Layout for Mobile Devices
The rise of the mobile web
Each of the three layouts has a number of columns that will be created by default. The 
Mobile layout has four columns, the Tablet layout has 8 columns, and the Desktop 
layout has 12 columns. You can type any number of columns you want for each type 
of layout, but for now, you will use the defaults. Notice that the mobile layout has a 
unique setting, 25% of column width. This represents the space between each of the 
columns, otherwise known as the gutter width. Additionally, each of the three layouts 
has a default page width listed at the bottom. For mobile, this is 91%; for tablet, this 
is 93%; and for the desktop, this is 90%. This means all the layouts will have a small
amount of padding on the left and right sides.
If you do not see these values, click the Reset to Default button.
2 
Click Create; you will be prompted to generate a new external style sheet. Navigate 
to your dw16lessons folder, locate the fl uidgrid folder, save this style sheet as base.css, 
and then click OK. A new document opens; you are in the unique fl uid grid mode 
with a fi ve column layout and a default grid layout div element with placeholder text. 
You’ll learn more about both of these features shortly. For now, we’ll discuss the 
structure of this page and the related fi les created for Fluid Grid Layouts.
The default grid layout with a fl uid grid layout div and placeholder content.
3 
Choose File > Save and navigate to the fl uidgrids folder if necessary. Save this 
document as index.html and click OK. You will be prompted to copy two dependent
fi les: boilerplate.css and respond.min.js. You’ll learn more about the role of these fi les
shortly; for now, click OK. The two fi les will be saved into your fl uidgrids folder.
Working with Fluid Grids is diff erent from what you might be used to. This initial 
view of fi ve columns is the Mobile view for your web page. There are two other views
as well: Tablet and Desktop. These views can be accessed by clicking any of the three 
icons.
A

A. Mobile size (480 × 800).

Click the Tablet Size icon; the size of the window changes to 768 by 1024 and displays
8 columns.
5 
Click the Desktop Size icon; the size of the window changes to 1000 wide; the height
is set to the vertical space on your screen.
Regardless of the view you are in, you should note that the columns are visual aids
only and are designed to help you align the Fluid Grid Layout Divs.
6 
In the document toolbar, click the Switch to Fluid Grid View button to turn off  
the guides. The reason for turning off  the guides is to see your page design better; 
however, these guides are key to working with the Fluid Grid feature, click the Switch
to Fluid Grid View button again to turn them back on.
7 
Click the Mobile Size icon to return to the default fi ve-column view. Dreamweaver 
opens this view initially because one of the foundations of Fluid Grid Layout is a 
concept called “mobile fi rst.” The basic idea is that when designing a website from
scratch, you start with the mobile design and layout fi rst, and then move upward to
the larger tablet and desktop sizes.
The foundations of “mobile first” design
Mobile first is a concept in web design that has been gaining popularity among designers in 
recent years. The basic idea is that when you are creating a new website design, you begin 
working with the mobile design first, and then move on to your larger screen designs. The
rationale is that technique forces you to identify your most important or core features first,
thus ensuring that they are folded into the mobile experience for your users.
The traditional technique of starting with your complex desktop layout and removing 
or restyling parts until you arrive at your mobile layout can lead to design compromises 
and inefficient styles. By incorporating mobile first concepts into Fluid Grid Layouts,
Dreamweaver is helping to promote the adoption and importance of designing for different 
size screens.

Creating your mobile layout
In the fi rst half of this lesson, you covered the basics of using media query fi les. Note that
you are still using media queries with Fluid Grid Layouts. However in this case, rather 
than dividing your media queries into separate style sheets, the rules for your three layouts
are gathered in one style sheet (in this case, base.css). Specifi cally, as you begin to create 
the styles for the single column layout in this exercise, keep in mind that all these styles 
will automatically be applied to your larger tablet and desktop layouts.
1 
Click in the default div that was created by Dreamweaver. In the Properties panel,
locate the Div ID fi eld, select the default value, and type header.
Change the name of the default fl uid grid layout div to header.
2 
Select the placeholder text inside the header and delete it. Choose Insert > Image. 
Navigate to the images folder inside the fl uidgrid folder and locate the ou_logo.png 
fi le. Click Open (Mac OS) or OK (Windows). Click OK and then type logo in the
Alt text fi eld in the Property Inspector.
You just added the image to a Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag. Dreamweaver always adds a 
Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag to your page when you start a new Fluid Grid Layout. You
can add new ones to your page as needed.
3 
Click the Insert tab to bring up the Insert Panel and choose Structure from the drop-
down menu. Then, in the Insert panel, click the Div button; the Insert Div dialog box 
appears. Make sure the Insert as Fluid Element check box is checked then click the ID 
radio button and type introcontent in the ID fi eld, then click OK.

This is the foundation of a mobile layout. There is much more you could do in regards 
to styling, but now that you have a basic layout with content, you’ll take a look at the 
way Fluid Grid Layouts work with additional layouts.
Creating a tablet layout
You have seen the three views that are part of Fluid Grid layouts, and you just created a
simple single-column layout for a mobile device. Note that Dreamweaver created styles for 
the mobile view, the tablet view, and the desktop view. In fact, it has placed these styles in 
three separate media queries (one for mobile, one for tablet, one for desktop). You’ll now
modify your mobile layout so that it is better suited for a tablet device.
1 
Click the Tablet Size icon to switch to this view. As you begin adjusting the layout to 
two columns, keep in mind that the new styles will only apply to the tablet layout.

Click the edge of the introcontent div to select it and place your cursor on the anchor 
point located on the right of the div. Click and drag to the left to begin resizing the 
container.
Resize a fl uid grid div by clicking and dragging the right edge.
Note as you drag that the indicator shows you the width and how many columns you 
have. Drag until you reach three columns and approximately 35% width.
3  Click the edge of the secondarycontent div to select it and notice on the top-right
corner there is an arrow. Hover over this for a moment, and the tool tip indicates the
arrow will move the div up a row. Click the arrow; notice that the div doesn’t shift
position. This is because the div is currently too wide, so you will need to resize the
div in order to fi t in the space above.
4 
Place your cursor on the resize anchor point (on the right edge of the div) and drag to
the left. When the div width reaches fi ve columns, click the arrow button in the top-
right corner and it will jump up into the space above. If necessary, resize the div until 
it is four columns wide.

5 
Now place your cursor on the anchor point on the left edge of this div and wait for 
the tooltip. This indicates that it will shift the div. Click and drag to the right until the 
right edge of the div snaps to the furthest column.
Reposition or shift a fl uid grid div by clicking and dragging the left edge.
At this point, you have the basics of a two-column layout, but for the tablet view only.
6 
Click the Mobile Size icon to switch back to this view; note that the mobile layout has
remained in its single column view. Click the Tablet Size icon to see the two-column 
view you just created, and then click the Desktop view. This view is still using the
single column layout; it has not been aff ected by the changes made in the Tablet view.
7 
Choose File > Save All to save your work, but keep this document open. In the next 
exercise, you will build a three-column layout for the desktop.

Click the edge of the introcontent div to select it, and place your cursor on the anchor 
point located on the right of the div. Click and drag to the left to begin resizing the
container. Resize this div until you reach four columns.
3  Click the edge of the secondarycontent div to select it and click the arrow on the top
right. This will attempt to move the div up a row, but as before, the div is too wide
and you have to resize it in order to fi t in the space above.

Click the Live button to see your layout in the Live View. When using Fluid Grid
Layouts, the Live View behaves a bit diff erently. Typically, the Live View acts as a web 
browser and only allows you to view your content, not edit it. However, you can see 
that the Visual Aids are still visible. Additionally, if you click the edge of any of your 
divs, it will become active and you can then adjust their size or shift them as needed.
In the Live view, the Fluid Grid layout is still visible and the layout divs can be adjusted as well.
If you need to see your layout in action, the browser is still the best place.
9 
Choose File > Preview in Browser; your page will load in the three column layout
view (most likely). Slowly reduce the width of your web browser and note how the 
columns of text begin to resize. This is the fl uid part of fl uid layouts: because your 
columns are defi ned by percentages, not pixels, this is the expected behavior. At the 
same time, the amount of space between these columns also remains proportional.
10 Keep reducing the width of the browser; it will eventually switch to the two-column 
layout. Continue reducing the width of the browser until it switches to the single-
column Mobile layout.

11 Continue resizing your browser window back and forth between the three views, and 
pay particular attention to the image in the middle column. This image is also fl uid; in
other words, it will resize according to how much space it has available. This is most 
obvious in the single-column mobile view.
The images added to your layout will be fl uid or responsive by default.
This fl uid image behavior is actually made possible by the inclusion of the boilerplate.
css support fi le that all Fluid Grid Layouts include by default. (You saw these 
dependent fi les created in step 1 of the fi rst exercise.)

12 Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver. You will now take a look at how to 
style your pages.
Looking deeper into the dependent files
When you create a fluid grid layout, the two dependent files that are created are 
boilerplate.css and respond.min.js. For the most part, you will not touch any of these files. If 
you are familiar with what they do and need to modify them, you can.
boilerplate.css: This is a popular framework for modern websites that has been customized
and modified for Dreamweaver’s fluid grid layout documents. Essentially, you can think 
of this as a well-tested and documented CSS reset file that pays special attention to the
formatting of page styles in older browsers and supports some of the newer media query 
features. For detailed information on this page, visit http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/The-style/./
respond.min.js: This external JavaScript file provides support for CSS3 media queries in 
web browsers that do not support them natively. For detailed information on what this code
does, visit https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond.
Styling elements in your fluid grid layout
The layout you created is fairly minimal at the moment. The method of creating and 
applying styles is not new when working with Fluid Grids; however, there is added 
complexity you have to take into account. Remember that every time you create a style,
it is not just created in one place, but three. To see how to manage this, you’ll style the
header of your page.

Starting at the top of the list, scroll down until you fi nd the fi rst
 style. After 
you locate it, keep scrolling down the list to fi nd a second 
 rule. Continue
scrolling down through the list to fi nd the third 
 style.
Although it is not immediately obvious, the fi rst header rule sets the style for the 
mobile styles, the second header sets the style for the tablet, and the third header rule 
sets the style for the desktop.

organic utopia logo.
Applying a background color to the header.
5 
In the Design view, note that your header is now the same color as the background.
Click the Tablet and Desktop views, and note that they have inherited the same 
background color.
Generally, this is not a problem since you don’t want to style the header three diff erent
times. However, there might be times when you do want the style of an element to be
diff erent in your tablet or desktop views.
6 
In your CSS styles panel, double-click the second
 style (the one for the
tablet). Click the background category, then click the Background-color swatch, and 
then choose a dark red (the exact shade is not important). Click OK.
This header style is now specifi c only to the Tablet view. Click the Tablet view to see it.

Choose File > Save All, and then preview your page in the browser. Resize your 
browser window until it switches to the tablet view layout. You will see the
background color of the header change.
The header in your tablet view has a diff erent background color style.
Typically, you wouldn’t change the background color style of a header. This exercise 
was just a demonstration of how to apply styles for specifi c layouts.

Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver. Double-click the second #header 
rule in the CSS Styles panel, click the background color property, and remove the
color you added in Step 5. Click OK.

Self study
Using your new knowledge of media queries and fl uid grid layouts in Dreamweaver,
perform the following tasks to build your experience:
To practice with media queries, return to your exercise fi le within the media queries 
fi le, and start building styles for the tablet.css style sheet. Answer some of the following 
questions: should navigation in a tablet layout refl ect the mobile or desktop model? What
about the number of columns?
The navigation bar used for the mobile.css style sheet is only one option for creating 
layout. Come up with another model, such as separating the navigation into two columns.
You will have to create new and unique styles for the unordered and list elements to do
this.
For the Fluid Grid layout, continue styling your page elements. Think of styles that you 
can add to the mobile styles that will cascade down to the tablet and desktop styles.
Review 
Questions
1 
and
are two examples of media queries. Describe a scenario 
in which you would use the 
 media query and describe a scenario in 
which you would use the
media query.
2 
When you create a new fl uid grid layout, what defaults can you change in the very 
fi rst step of the process?
3 
What is the purpose of the two dependent fi les saved by Dreamweaver when you
create a new Fluid Layout?
Answers
1 
The 
media query can be interpreted as greater than or equal to and the 
 media query can be interpreted as less than or equal to. For example, if 
you have a media query that uses a min-width value of 700 pixels, a style that applies
only to screens 700 pixels wide or higher is set. A media query that uses a max-width 
value of 320 pixels means a style that applies only to screens 320 pixels wide or less
is set.
2 
When creating a new fl uid grid layout, you are prompted to set up the number of 
columns for your mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. Additionally, you can change 
the percentage width of each of these layouts, and within the mobile layout, you can 
change gutter space between columns.
3 
The purpose of boilerplate.css and respond.min.js are to provide the necessary 
functionality to allow pages to be resized and apply the various Media Queries.

Lesson 17, Managing your Website: Reports, Optimization, and Maintenance
What you’ll learn in 
this lesson:
• Uploading and managing 
fi les
• Optimizing pages for 
performance and search 
engines
• Checking site integrity
• Using site reports
Lesson 17
When it’s time to release your website to the world, you’ll want 
to take some fi nal steps to make sure your site works and looks its 
best. Dreamweaver has a powerful set of reports, link checkers, and 
problem-solving tools to locate and fi x any potential issues before fi nal 
upload. When you’re ready, the built-in FTP and synchronization 
features of the Files panel will get you up-and-running. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace.
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several fi les from the dw17lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive from the supplied DVD. See
“Loading lesson fi les” in the Starting up section of this book.
Managing your Website: 
Reports, Optimization, and 
Maintenance

Before you begin, you need to create a site defi nition that points to the dw17lessons folder.
Go to Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site defi nition, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting 
Up a New Site.”
See Lesson 17 in action!
Use the accompanying video to gain a better understanding of how to use some of the features
shown in this lesson. The video tutorial for this lesson can be found on the included DVD.
Working with the Files panel
You’ve already used the Files panel throughout this book to locate and open fi les within 
your site projects. In addition to serving as a useful fi le browser, the Files panel also serves
as a full-featured fi le transfer application and synchronization tool. From the Files panel,
you can upload your site to a web server, synchronize local and remote fi les, and manage
fi les and notes between multiple designers.
Creating a remote connection
The Files panel uploads, retrieves, and synchronizes fi les between your local site and a web
server. Typically, this is done using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which connects to and 
allows interaction between your local machine and a web server (there are other options as
well, including SFTP, WebDav, and more). Before you can transfer fi les, you’ll fi rst need 
to establish a remote connection to the web server that stores your website fi les.
You will not be able to proceed with this portion of the lesson if you do not have FTP 
information available for a web server. If you do not have this information or do not have a 
connection to the Internet, you can choose to read through the steps or skip to the Testing Site
Integrity exercise in this lesson.
To get started, make sure you have the following:
• The FTP address of the web server and specifi c directory. This would be 
provided by your web-hosting provider as part of your account details, or from 
your company or organization’s IT department. A typical FTP address looks like 
ftp.mysite.com.
• A user login and password for access to the server. Most web servers require 
a user login and password for access. This information should be available from your 
web-hosting provider as part of your account details, or from your organization’s IT 
department.

• The specifi c directory to which your fi les should be uploaded. In many cases, 
this is the main directory or folder that appears when you connect to your web server.
However, in certain cases, you’ll need to upload fi les to a specifi c directory other than
the main directory.
• The web address (URL) or IP address where you can view your uploaded fi les 
on the server. Sample addresses would be www.mysite.com/, 
/ www.mysite.com/2013/, or 
/
http://100.0.0.1.

Select the dw17lessons site from the list of Your Sites (you set this up at the beginning 
of the lesson) and click the pencil icon in the lower-left corner (Edit the currently
selected site). If you haven’t created a site defi nition for this lesson, make sure you do 
so now, as discussed in Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
3 
The Site Setup window appears. Click the Servers button to access the server setup 
screen. Click the Plus button in the lower left.
Click the Add new Server button.
This opens up the Basic tab where you will need to add the required information to 
access your server.

Enter your specifi c FTP information in the text fi elds (not our sample information). 
The Server Name should be a common sense label that will help you identify which 
site you are modifying. The FTP Address, Username, and Password are the mandatory
pieces of information.
Sample remote connection information. Your information should include an FTP address, login, and password, 
with a possible folder name.
Connection options
Clicking the Connect Using menu reveals additional options. FTP is still the default choice 
in Dreamweaver CC; however, FTP is an aging protocol. Many people are wary of security 
concerns related to FTP because data sent over FTP is not encrypted.
• SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol and represents a more secure version of FTP.
• FTP over SSL/TLS is another more secure version of FTP that relies on encryption. For 
this option, a server must have previously been specifically set up as trusted.
• Local/Network allows you to define a remote folder on a network drive you might be 
connected to. Depending on the setup, this network could or could not also be connected 
to the internet.
• WebDAV is a technology that allows file access to a remote server. It is often used
collaboratively with multiple users allowed access to the same file system.
• RDS is a security component of ColdFusion Server that permits users to access files and 
databases through a remote HTTP connection.

Viewing files on a remote web server
Once you’ve established a connection to your web server, you can expand the Files panel 
for a split view that displays both your remote and local fi les. You can easily drag and drop 
between both sides to upload or download fi les and update existing fi les.
1 
If necessary, choose Window > Files to open the Files panel. Click the Expand button
(
) at the top of the Files panel to ungroup and expand it to full view.
2 
Locate and click the Connect button (
) above the left column at the top of the
panel. Dreamweaver attempts to connect to your remote server, and, if successful, 
displays all its fi les on the left side of the Files panel.
It’s important to note that web servers can be confi gured in many diff erent ways, 
and you might need to edit your site settings again once you have made a successful 
connection (in particular, the folder information). A discussion of the diff erent ways 
that web servers might be confi gured is outside the scope of this book. If you have 
specifi c questions regarding your site, you should contact an IT professional or your 
web-hosting company.
Click the Connect button to view fi les on your remote server in the left column of the Files panel.

Transferring files to and from a remote server with Get and Put
The built-in FTP and fi le transfer functionality of the Files panel makes it a snap to 
place fi les on your remote server or download fi les onto your local machine. This can be
accomplished using the Get and Put buttons, or by dragging and dropping fi les between 
the Remote and Local fi le listings in the Files panel. Please note again, this exercise 
involves publishing your sample documents to a remote server, and therefore publishing 
them to the Internet. Be very careful not to overwrite any pre-existing fi les that might be 
crucial to your website.
1 
Make sure you’ve connected to the remote server as described in the previous exercise, 
and that you can see your remote fi les in the left column of the Files panel. 
2 
Select the index.html fi le from the local fi le listing on the right side of your Files 
panel, and click the Put button (
) at the top of the panel. Choose No when asked if 
you would like to include dependent fi les.
Select a fi le and click the Put button to upload it to the remote server.
When you transfer a document between a local and remote folder, a window could open, off ering 
you the option of transferring the document’s dependent fi les. Dependent fi les are images,
external style sheets, and other fi les referenced in your document that a browser loads when it 
loads the document. This feature can be very useful: think of it as a way to make sure that any 
fi les which are linked to a particular document come along for the ride. For the purposes of this
exercise, it will not be necessary to transfer dependent fi les.

Alternatively, you can click and drag a fi le from the right (local) column to the left 
(remote) column.
Drag a fi le from the right column to the left to upload it to the remote server.
To get (download) a fi le from the remote server:
1 
Make sure you’ve connected to the remote server as described in the previous exercise, 
and that you can see your remote fi les in the left column of the Files panel.
2 
Select the index.html fi le from the remote fi le listing on the left side of your Files 
panel, and click the Get button (
) at the top of the panel. Note that in your case this 
does not make a lot of sense since you just uploaded your index.html document.
You can update the local or remote fi le listing at any time by clicking the Refresh button (
) at 
the top of the Files panel.

Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
If you’re collaborating with others on a project, you’ll want to set up an environment 
where everyone can edit fi les independently without overlapping or overwriting someone 
else’s work. For these situations, the Check In/Out and Design Notes features can help 
you manage workfl ow and communicate with others on a Dreamweaver site project.
Check In and Check Out
Dreamweaver’s Check In/Check Out feature is a way of letting others know that you are 
working on a fi le and don’t want it disturbed. When Check In/Check Out is enabled, a
document that you’re editing becomes locked on the remote server to prevent others from
modifying the same fi le at the same time. If you attempt to open a fi le that’s been checked 
out by another user, you see a warning that lets you know that the fi le is in use and also 
who is currently working with it. Check In/Check Out doesn’t require any additional 
software to run, and other Dreamweaver users can check out fi les if they also have Check 
In/Check Out enabled in their site defi nition.
The Check In/Check Out system does not work with a testing server. To transfer fi les to and 
from a testing server (if one is set up), use the standard Get and Put commands.
1 
Choose Site > Manage Sites. Select the Dreamweaver site that you want to enable 
Check In/Check Out for and choose the pencil icon to edit the currently selected site.
2 
In the Site Setup window, click the Servers button, then select your site and click the 
pencil icon at the bottom to edit the server settings.

Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

3 
Click the Advanced button and then click the Enable fi le check-out check box.
Type your name and e-mail. This information will appear to other users who attempt
to retrieve a fi le that you have checked out (as long as they are using Dreamweaver).
Click Save and then click Save again to exit.
Enable check in/check out in the Site Defi nition panel to manage workfl ow between several users.
How does Check In/Check Out work?
Dreamweaver creates a lock (LCK) file for every document that is checked out; this basic text
file contains the name and e-mail address of the user who has checked out the file. LCK files 
are written to both the remote server and local folder using the same name as the active file.
When files are checked back in, the LCK files are deleted from both the remote server and
the local folder.
Although LCK files are not visible in the Files panel, they work behind-the-scenes to let
Dreamweaver know what’s checked out and what isn’t. Checked-out files appear on both 
the local and remote file listings with a checkmark next to them. Note that a colleague not
using Dreamweaver can potentially overwrite a file that’s checked out; however, LCK files
are visible in applications other than Dreamweaver, and their appearance alone can help avoid 
any overwriting issues.
A user will be allowed to override your lock and switch checkout status to themselves. Make sure 
you establish rules with others about how to share and manage locked fi les.

17
435
Lesson 17, Managing your Website: Reports, Optimization, and Maintenance
Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
Checking files in and out
When you check a fi le out, you are downloading it from the remote server to your local 
root folder, and placing a lock on the remote copy. Both your local copy and the remote 
copy appear with check marks next to them, which indicate that the fi le is currently
checked out for editing. When you check a fi le back in, you are uploading the modifi ed 
version to the remote server, and removing any locks currently on it.
1 
Launch the Files panel and click the Expand button to expand it so that you can see
both your local and remote fi les listed. 
2 
Select the fi le in your local folder that you want to check out, and use the Check Out
button (
) at the top of the panel. Note that Dreamweaver overwrites your local copy 
of the fi le, as it needs to get the remote fi le from the server. The local and remote 
versions of the fi le appear with check marks next to them in the Files panel. 
Check fi les out before modifying them so other users won’t accidentally overwrite your work.
3 
Open the checked fi le from your Local Files panel for editing. Make any necessary
changes to the fi le, then save and close it.

17
Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
Adobe Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
436
4 
From the Files panel, select the fi le again in the local Files panel and check it back in, 
using the Check In button (
) at the top of the panel. The fi le is uploaded to—and
unlocked on—the remote server.
When you transfer a document between a local and remote folder, a window could open off ering 
you the option of transferring the document’s dependent fi les. Dependent fi les are images, 
external style sheets, and other fi les referenced in your document that a browser loads when it 
loads the document. For this exercise, it won’t be necessary for you to transfer dependent fi les.
Your local copy becomes read-only, and appears with a padlock next to it. Next time 
you open the fi le for editing, Dreamweaver will automatically check out and get the
latest copy from the server.
5 
Collapse the Files panel to return it to the dock.
Using Design Notes
Design Notes store additional information about a fi le or media object in your Dreamweaver 
site. These notes can be for your own use, or they can be shared with others using the same
root folder. Design Notes can be set to appear automatically when the fi le is opened, making 
it easy to display up-to-date information to others working on the same site. All Design
Notes are stored as separate fi les in a _notes folder inside of your site’s root directory.
What can be put in Design Notes?
Design Notes can contain any information that is important to the fi le or project; you
can store design instructions, updates about the project, or contact information for project 
managers and supervisors. You can also store sensitive information that you ideally would 
not want in the fi le itself, such as the name of the last designer to work on the fi le or the 
location of important assets. You can even set the status of the fi le to indicate what stage of 
the revision the fi le is in.
1 
To create a Design Note, under the Files panel, open the store.html fi le from the 
current site. 
2 
Choose File > Design Notes. The Design Notes dialog box appears.
3 
Type a message in the Notes fi eld. If you want to insert the current date stamp, you
can click the Calendar button ( ) above the Notes fi eld on the right side. If you want
the note displayed when the fi le is next opened, check Show when fi le is opened.
The Status menu is used to set the document status; this can be useful in letting other 
collaborators know the revision stage of the current document.

Click OK to create the Design Note.
To view a Design Note, choose File > Design Notes when a fi le is open in the 
document window. As mentioned earlier, you can also choose to have Design Notes 
automatically appear when the fi le is fi rst opened.
Design Notes can also be created or viewed directly from the Files panel. Simply right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) a document in the fi les list and choose Design Notes from the 
context menu.
Sharing Design Notes
By default, Design Notes are stored only in the local site folder, and are not automatically 
copied to the remote server. However, you can share Design Notes with other collaborators
by having Dreamweaver automatically upload and update them on the remote server.
1 
Choose Site > Manage Sites. Select your site and choose Edit (the pencil in the
bottom-left corner of the Sites dialog box). The Site Setup window appears.
2 
Click the Advanced Settings options and choose Design Notes from the left.
3 
Under the Design Notes panel, check Enable Upload Design Notes for sharing. 
Design Notes are now copied and updated on the remote server so that other users can
share them. 
Set up Design Notes for sharing so other Dreamweaver users can see and modify Design Notes on the remote server.

Testing site integrity
Testing site integrity
Catching potential issues on a page before your visitors do is key to ensuring success 
from the start. Broken links, display issues, or unreadable pages can make the diff erence
between a great fi rst impression and a poor one. To help you identify and address problems 
before you publish your site, Dreamweaver provides useful tools that can point out
potential hazards and, in some cases, help you fi nd a solution.
Checking links sitewide
Dreamweaver can check links on a single document, on multiple documents (through the 
Files panel), or on an entire local site.
1 
Choose Site > Check Links Sitewide.
2 
The Link Checker panel appears; by default, all broken links are displayed. All the
broken links here are referencing the same incorrect link to category_books_cds.html.
This could have happened if you or a collaborator on the site changed the name of the 
fi le within the operating system or another web editor.
Choose Site > Check Links Sitewide to check for broken links throughout the current local site. 
The Link Checker panel opens and displays any broken links found.

To view external links, choose External Links from the Show drop-down menu at the
top of the panel. This site will have none, but any links to outside web pages that you 
have on your site would be listed here.
External links are displayed, but aren’t validated by Dreamweaver. The Link Checker can only 
validate links between local documents and fi les.
4 
To view orphaned fi les, choose Orphaned Files from the Show drop-down menu 
at the top of the panel. In this site, a number of fi les will appear. Orphaned fi les
are fi les in your site that are not currently being linked to. This might include stray
multimedia fi les that have not been added to a page yet. You will not be doing 
anything with these fi les at this time.
5 
Choose Broken Links from the Show drop-down menu to return to the broken links

Click Yes. Behind the scenes Dreamweaver will go through all the pages and
automatically update to the correct link. This feature is a great timesaver since you 
don’t need to open the fi les to make changes.
Viewing Link Checker results
If and when the Link Checker returns results, you can jump to any problem document to 
view and fix any issues. The Link Checker panel’s Show menu (located at the top of the 
panel) toggles between three different Link Checker reports: Broken Links, Orphaned Files, 
and External Links.
Broken Links are lists links that point to files not found within the local site. To jump 
to a page that contains a broken link, double-click the filename shown in the left column 
of the Link Checker panel. To correct a link directly from the Link Checker panel, click 
the link shown under the Broken Links column of the panel to edit it. Type in the proper 
page name or use the folder to browse to the proper file. If you edit a broken link this way, 
Dreamweaver can apply the same correction throughout other pages on your site.
Orphaned Files are any pages, images, or media files not linked to, referenced, or used by
any files in your site. This report can be useful in identifying unused files that can be cleaned 
up from the local site, or pages that should be linked to (like a site map) but were overlooked.
External Links list any links to outside websites, pages, or files; and like the Broken Links
panel, allows you to directly edit them or jump to the page that contains them. It’s important 
to note, however, that Dreamweaver does not validate external links—you will still be
responsible for double-checking these links on your own. You’ll also notice that e-mail
(mailto:) links are included in this list.
Generating site reports
Dreamweaver’s site reports feature is an indispensable asset for detecting potential design 
and accessibility issues before publishing your site to the Web. Reports can be generated 
in several categories to give you a virtual picture of health, and the opportunity to locate 
and fi x minor or major issues across an entire Dreamweaver site. These issues can include 
missing alternate text or titles and recommendations for better accessibility practices, based 
on the W3C’s Web Consortium Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 
Reports can be generated for a single page, selected documents, or the entire current local 
site. Any results open and display in the Results panel, where you can see a list of issues
and the pages on which they are located.

To run a site report, choose Site > Reports. The Reports dialog box opens, displaying 
two categories of reports: Workfl ow and HTML. 
It is not necessary to have a document open in order to run sitewide reports.
Workfl ow reports display information about Design Notes, Check In and Check Out 
operations, and recently modifi ed fi les. HTML reports display potential design,
accessibility, and display issues based on best practices and W3C/WCAG accessibility
guidelines.

In the Reports panel, check all the reports under the HTML category. At the top of 
the panel, select Entire Current Local Site from the Report on drop-down menu.
Choose Site > Reports, and select the reports you’d like to run in the Site Reports dialog box.

Leave the Results panel open; you’ll learn how to read and address issues in the next
exercise.
The Results panel displays issues found across your entire current local site.
Understanding report results
At fi rst glance, you might be overwhelmed at the amount of information returned by 
site reports. Keep in mind that many of the listings returned are recommendations or 
possible issues that should be looked into, not necessarily items that will prevent a site from
working. Learning to read these site reports a little more closely will enable you to decide 
which items are crucial to your site’s performance, requiring immediate action. Listings 
are displayed with three distinct icons.
ICON
NAME
USE
Question Mark
These listings suggest possible accessibility issues that should be 
investigated. Many of these issues have a reference to a specific 
W3C/WCAG guideline.
Red X
These listings indicate a failure to meet a certain guideline or 
requirement. Possible listings could include missing header 
information, deprecated HTML markup, or page titles that are not 
defined properly.
Warning Sign
Warnings indicate missing information that could be potentially
detrimental to a site’s performance, such as missing ALT text for 
images.

Addressing a listed item
After you’ve sifted through the report results, you’ll want to use the Results panel to
address items listed in the Site Reports tab.
1 
Go to the Site Reports tab on the Results panel. Click the Description column 
header to sort the results. Scroll to the bottom of the page as needed, and locate the
store.html listing.
Select a listing and click the More Info button to display a detailed description about the issue found.
The Description column shows that an image on this page is missing the ALT 
attribute and alternate text. This attribute can potentially aff ect accessibility of your 
site; you don’t need to fi x it, but we highly recommend you do.
2 
Double-click the store.html listing to open the page for editing. Your document
window will divide into the Code view and Design view; the image appears selected 
in the Design view and highlighted in the Code view.
3 
In the Property Inspector, type MKI Gift Cards are now available! in the Alt fi eld 
and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Select the problem image and enter text in the Alt fi eld to rectify the problem.

Lesson 17, Managing your Website: Reports, Optimization, and Maintenance
Optimizing pages for launch
Whenever you have multiple results as you do here, you might want to save them for 
future reference. Reports can be saved as XML for import into databases, existing 
template fi les, and archival fi les. You can sort report results using the Results panel
before saving them.
4 
Click the Save Report button ( ) on the left edge of the Results panel. When the
Save Report dialog box appears, assign the report a name, and choose a location for 
the fi le.
5 
Save and close the page, and close the Results panel.
A full listing of accessibility guidelines, or WCAG, for web page designers and developers is
available at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) website at W3.org.
Optimizing pages for launch
Although page optimization is discussed at this latter point in the book, it is by no means 
an afterthought. A big part of preparing a site for success involves making it accessible
to users with special needs, such as those who are visually impaired, or preparing it for 
indexing by various search engines. In addition to clean design and well-written content, 
pages can be optimized through the use of keywords, descriptions, and often-overlooked
tag attributes, such as alternate text (alt) for images and a page’s Title area. Combined,
these pieces of information facilitate site usability and visibility in several essential ways.
Search engine visibility and Search Engine Optimization
A big part of a website’s success stems from its visibility. Visibility comes through good 
advertising, networking with other sites, and, above all, proper indexing and listings on
the Web’s major search engines. Search engines can be a key to generating business and
visits to your site, but only if your website can be easily found. Major search engines such 
as Google (which powers AOL, MySpace, and Netscape searches), Yahoo! (which powers
AltaVista and others), and Bing (formerly LiveSearch) use a variety of factors to index and
generate listings for websites. Many of these factors start at home, or more appropriately,
on your home page.
Titling your documents with the <title> tag
Each document’s head area contains a 
 tag, which Dreamweaver automatically 
inserts with any new HTML/XHTML document. At its most basic, the 
 tag sets
a display title for a page that appears at the top of the browser window. You can modify 
the
 tag contents using the Title text fi eld that sits at the top of your document 
window. By default, each new document is issued the default title of Untitled Document.
The
tag and its contents, however, can be a powerful and eff ective way to assist 
search engines in indexing your page.

17

What makes a good title?
A good document title ideally should include keywords that describe your site’s main
service, locale, and category of business or information. In addition to the obvious—your 
company’s name—think about the categories you would want your site to appear under 
on a web directory or as the result of a web search. For instance, the McKnight Institute
would ideally want users looking for science museums or exhibits in the Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, area to fi nd them fi rst. A possible title could be: The McKnight Institute: 
Science Museum, Educational Exhibits and Attractions, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
This title contains several important keywords that describe the Institute’s off erings, and 
features the Institute’s name and location. In addition, reshuffl  ing these phrases and words 
produces several other search terms that could be benefi cial to the Institute, such as:
• Science Exhibits
• Philadelphia Museum
• Pennsylvania Attractions
Avoid the rookie mistake of including only your company name in the document title.
Remember, web searchers who haven’t used your business before will only search by terms that 
apply to the service they are seeking (for example, wedding photographers, Washington, D.C.).
Even the most recognized names on the Web, such as eBay and Amazon, include generic search 
terms in their page titles.
To add a title to your web page:
1 
From the Files panel, select and open the index.html document to open it for editing.
2 
Locate the Title text fi eld at the top of the document window. It currently displays 
the default title of Untitled Document. Select its contents and type The McKnight 
Institute: Science Museum, Educational Exhibits and Attractions, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Add a well-constructed title to the index.html page to make it more search-engine and bookmark friendly.
3 
Choose File > Save to save the document, and then choose File > Preview in 
Browser > [Default browser] to open the document in your system’s primary browser.

17
447
Lesson 17, Managing your Website: Reports, Optimization, and Maintenance
Optimizing pages for launch
4 
Note the title that now appears in the bar at the top of the browser window. Close the 
browser window and return to Dreamweaver.
The most basic purpose of the <title> tag is to display a title at the top of the browser window. If used properly, it can also be 
used as a powerful hook for search engines.
While there is technically no limit to title length, the W3C’s Web Consortium Accessibility
Guide recommends that page titles be a maximum of 64 characters to be considered ‘well-
defi ned.’ Titles exceeding this length could generate warnings in the Site Reports Results panel.
Longer titles could also appear truncated (cut off ) when displayed in some browser windows.
Bookmark-ability: another benefit of the 
 tag
It’s common for users to bookmark a site or specific page they’ve found so that they can easily
return to it. Every browser has a bookmark feature, which allows users to mark and display
favorite sites in an organized list; sometimes, favorite sites are listed in a Bookmarks bar in
the browser window.
The document title determines the text that appears with a bookmark, so it’s important to
consider this when creating a good document title. Using a vague or nondescriptive title
(or even worse, the default Untitled Document text) can make it impossible for a user to 
remember which bookmark is yours. A good title appears as a descriptive bookmark in a 
browser’s Favorites list or Bookmarks bar.

Adding meta keywords and descriptions
While Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a broad topic that’s far beyond the scope of 
this book, good SEO methods begin at the design level. Search engines use a variety of 
factors to rank and list web pages. Keywords and descriptions can help specify the search
terms that are associated with your site and how it’s listed. The HTML 
tag enables
you to associate any page with a specifi c list of search terms, as well as a brief description 
of the page or the website itself. Like the 
tag, 
 tags are placed in the 
 section of a page, and can be added from the Common Insert bar on the right side 
of your workspace.
1 
If it’s not already open, open the index.html document for editing.
2 
From the Common Insert bar, choose the Keywords button from the Head tags group.
3 
When the Keywords window appears, add a comma-separated list of search keywords 
that you’d like associated with this page, or the site in general. While there is no
general consensus on the limit of how many keywords you can use, common sense says 
that you should be able to categorize your site in roughly 20 keywords or fewer. For 
example, type museum, technology exhibits, attractions, family attractions, 
philadelphia, pennsylvania museums. Click OK to add the keywords.
From the Common category of the Insert panel, choose the Keywords object from the Head tags group and enter a 
list of keywords in the resulting dialog box.
4 
Now you’ll add a description that a search engine can use to summarize your page 
when creating a listing for it. Choose the Description button from the Head tags 
group on the Common Insert bar.

When the Description dialog box appears, type in a brief descriptive paragraph (fewer 
than 250 characters, including spaces). For example, type The McKnight Center is 
a family-oriented education center and museum that explores the history of 
technology and scientifi c discovery through hands-on exhibits and events.
Click OK.
Add a short description that search engines can use to display a caption 
for your site listing.
6 
Choose File > Save, then choose File > Close to close the fi le.
Launching your site
Before launching your site for the public—and to ensure that your site looks and works at
its best—take a moment to go over this pre-fl ight checklist.
Site launch checklist
• Enter FTP or upload information and test your FTP connection.
• Check links sitewide and repair missing or broken links and images.
• Run site reports and address crucial issues. Put special emphasis on:
 – Missing document titles
 – Missing alt text
 – Invalid markup that could cause display issues
• Open the homepage (index.html, and so on) and navigate through your site, using 
menus, links in copy, and linked images to check page fl ow. Do this in several browsers, 
and, if possible, on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
• View your home page and major section pages in a web browser in the three most 
common screen resolutions: 640 × 480, 800 × 600, and 1024 × 768.

Uploading your site
From this point forward, the exercise assumes that you have access to a remote FTP server.
1 
If you’re ready to upload your site to the remote web server, make sure that the Files
panel is open (Window > Files).
2 
Click the Expand button (
) at the top of the Files panel to display it in two-column
expanded view.
3 
Click the Connect button (
) above the left (remote view) column to connect to 
your remote web server.
You need to have created a valid connection, as described earlier in the lesson.
Once a successful connection is made, the remote fi les (if any) display in the left column.
4 
In the right column, click and select the Folder icon at the very top of the fi le 
listing. This should be the root folder, and displays the current site defi nition title
(dw17lessons).
5 
Click the Put button at the top of the Files panel to copy the entire current local site 
and all included fi les to the current directory on the remote server. A dialog box 
appears with the message, Are you sure you wish to put the entire site?
Select the root folder of your local site, and click the Put button to upload the entire site to the web server.

Suggested next steps
You have now launched your fi rst Dreamweaver site project. There’s nothing more 
exciting than having your hard work on the Web and available for the world to see. The 
important thing to remember is that your website should not be static; part of maintaining 
a successful website requires continuously evolving it to meet the needs of your viewers, 
and keeping the content fresh and new.
Whether your site is for business, pleasure, or self-promotion, be sure to solicit feedback
from friends, family, and colleagues after you’ve launched. Alert a small and trusted group
about the launch by sending out an e-mail, mailing a postcard, or posting a notice on a 
blog (sometimes this is referred to as the ‘beta’ stage). Feedback and constructive criticism
(a little praise is OK, too) are the best ways to objectively know what needs improvement.
You’ll probably receive more feedback and suggestions than you can handle, so focus on 
points that are common across multiple users, and address any major issues before making 
a more public launch (for instance, to your entire client base).
Focus on focus groups
Focus groups are an excellent way to get nonbiased feedback on a major new site or 
product launch, and they have been a regular practice in product marketing and research 
for years. A focus group is composed of a group of individuals who are brought together to 
analyze, try out, and comment on a specifi c product—in this case, your website—for the
purpose of obtaining feedback and testing the product’s eff ectiveness.
Groups can be guided through certain portions or processes on the site, or can be 
encouraged to navigate it on their own. Afterwards, they are polled with specifi c questions 
about their experience, and the results are put together to form a picture of the site’s 
usability, eff ectiveness, and impact. This can include questions such as the following:
• Did you feel the website was easy to navigate? On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you 
rate the diffi  culty level in locating specifi c pages or topics?
• Did the design, including graphics and color themes, eff ectively help communicate the 
website’s off erings?
• On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the quality of the written content on the site?
Focus groups are often interactive, encouraging participants to talk with each other and
share their opinions. In some cases, a moderator can be used to regulate group discussions 
and hand out questionnaires. Participants can be composed of a focused demographic 
group (for instance, 25- to 35-year-old technology professionals), or they can represent a 
diverse professional and demographic range.
Focus groups are reasonable for any size company to organize—even if it’s just you and 
fi ve friends—and are a highly eff ective way to fi nd out what’s currently working and 
what’s not. Give it a try; you might fi nd the results encouraging, surprising, or even 
slightly discouraging. The trick is to use this feedback wisely toward the main purpose of 
making a better website, and you’ll be glad you did.

What’s new in Dreamweaver CC?
Dreamweaver CC follows the release of Dreamweaver CS6 and off ers a number of 
signifi cant changes and improvements over the previous release. While many of the features 
are new, subscribers to Adobe’s Creative Cloud service have been able to utilize some of 
them as part of Adobe’s ongoing upgrade process. This is due to the fact that web technology
18

New Features

18
What’s new in Dreamweaver CC?
Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom
456
continues to evolve at a rapid pace and a program such as Dreamweaver needs to keep pace 
with these changes. Features such as native HTML5 support, improved Fluid Grid Layouts, 
Adobe Edge Web Fonts integration, Adobe Animate support and improved FTP support 
have made their way into the Cloud Subscription version and are now available. 
Dreamweaver CC boasts many new features on top of those made available to CS6 
Creative Cloud subscribers, specifi cally, a new CSS Designer panel with a visual workfl ow 
and improved support of CSS3 including CSS3 Transitions, Gradients, rounded borders, 
and the addition of jQuery UI Widgets replace Adobe’s proprietary Spry Frameworks. 
Whether the new features were fi rst added in CS6 Creative Cloud or in CC, they have all
been integrated into the exercises in this book for users who might have upgraded from 
the retail version of CS6 to CC without the benefi t of the CS6 Creative Cloud updates. 
Starting in Lesson 4, “Styling your pages with CSS” and throughout the exercises, 
HTML5 semantic elements replace many of the divs for structuring content. Lesson
6, “Advanced Page Layout” covers the semantic elements in-depth. Lesson 7, “CSS3 
Transitions and Styles” introduces CSS3 gradients and transforms while coverage of 
Web Fonts has been expanded into a lesson of its own. Lesson 8, “Using Web Fonts” 
addresses the addition of Adobe Edge Web Fonts. Lesson 11, “Adding Video, Audio, and
Interactivity” covers the addition of HTML5 audio and video, Adobe Edge Animate 
integration and Flash. Lesson 14, “Building HTML5 Web Forms” expands on Web Forms 
with the addition of new HTML5 input elements, attributes and form validation. Finally, 
Lesson 15, “Adding Interactivity with the jQuery UI Library” introduces the new jQuery 
UI Widgets such as the Tab and Accordion.

Lesson 18, Dreamweaver CC New Features 
What’s new in Dreamweaver CC?
CSS Designer panel
Dreamweaver’s new CSS Designer panel expands upon and replaces the New CSS Styles 
dialog box and panel, adding a visual workfl ow and methodology for CSS properties such
as margins, padding, and borders. This new panel makes creating and editing styles as easy 
as pointing and clicking and provides a visual representation of the applied styles.
The margin, padding, and border controls in the Properties panel.
Extensive use of the CSS Designer panel is made throughout nearly every lesson of the
book as it is a vital part of the workfl ow in designing web pages with Dreamweaver. 
CSS3 transitions and styles
Dreamweaver CC has new CSS transitions and styles that provide the ability to add 
gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, and animation eff ects to objects on your page.
CSS gradients replace the need to use a fi xed image to create a gradient background. An
example of a transition is a button that gradually changes color when the user hovers over 
it, known as a rollover eff ect. In previous versions of Dreamweaver, you had to use some
form of JavaScript to create a rollover eff ect, perhaps even one of the Spry eff ects (which 
are JavaScript). CSS gradients and styles in Dreamweaver are built with CSS3 syntax that 

18
What’s new in Dreamweaver CC?
Dreamweaver CC Digital Classroom

allows you to set the duration, delay, and easing of many CSS properties, including color 
stops in gradients, height, width, positioning, and much more.
The CSS Gradient control allows you to create linear or radial gradients with multiple 
color stops.
One of the benefi ts of CSS gradients and transforms is that you can create basic visual 
eff ects within Dreamweaver without JavaScript or Flash. A good use of transitions, for 
example, is to create a smooth resizing eff ect on the user interface, such as drop-down or 
slide-out menus.
jQuery UI widgets
Dreamweaver CC incorporates jQuery UI Widgets, part of the jQuery JavaScript 
Frameworks, to add open-source and industry-standard user interface controls. Use the 
Insert panel to add interactive features to your site and customize them using CSS3 to
match your website theme. Dreamweaver includes jQuery UI Widgets to insert Accordion
menus, Tabs panels, Date Pickers, Progress bars, Buttons and more. 
The jQuery UI Tab widget can make effi  cient use of space.

Additional new features in Dreamweaver CC
The Adobe Edge Web Fonts, improved HTML5 and CSS3 functionality and Adobe Edge 
Animate composition support are perhaps the biggest changes that were made available to
Dreamweaver CS6 Creative Cloud subscribers and are also included in Dreamweaver CC.
These new features are designed to help streamline and support a more effi  cient and visual 
workfl ow within the product.
Adobe Edge Web Fonts
Dreamweaver CC takes major steps toward addressing the lack of choice in fonts to use
on the Web with the new Adobe Edge Web Fonts feature. This feature takes advantage of 
the vast library of free web fonts, provided by companies like Adobe and Google, to give
Dreamweaver users a much easier way to add new fonts to their page. When you choose 
Modify > Manage Fonts, the Manage Fonts dialog box appears, allowing you to link to 
any Adobe Edge Web Font or to add a local copy of any commercially-licensed web font 
you want to embed on your page.
Adding a web font is as simple as choosing the font from the Adobe Edge Web Fonts service.

After you embed a specifi c web font on your page, you can easily apply the style of the font 
using the Property Inspector. The addition of Adobe Edge Web Fonts in Dreamweaver 
means it is quite easy to add unique styles to page elements such as headings and still 
maintain the benefi ts of CSS.
A heading with a Web Font style applied.
Faster HTML5 elements insertion
Dreamweaver CC has a newly reorganized Insert panel and improvements to the Property
Inspector allowing you to work intuitively with the new HTML5 elements. Examples of 
HTML5 elements you can now insert include the semantic elements; 
, 
,
, and 
and all of the new HTML5 Form elements. In
previous versions of Dreamweaver, there was no visual support for these elements. Users 
could add them in code view using Dreamweaver’s code hinting interface, but they could
not add them with the Insert panel or set their properties using the Property Inspector.
You can easily add HTML5 elements in
Dreamweaver with the revised Insert Panel.

Similarly, the Insert panel has added the new HTML5 form elements allowing you to take 
advantage of the built-in support available in today’s modern browsers. The HTML5 form

Add HTML5 Audio and Video to your site for plugin-free multimedia in today’s modern
browsers and mobile devices. The new Insert panel and Property Inspector improvements
extend to HTML5 Audio and Video allowing you to insert multimedia into your site 
without plugins, extending your audience to a wider variety of devices. 
Add plugin-free audio and video with the

multimedia. Use a CSS3 transform to tilt the HTML5 Video element and play your video 
at an angle of 25 degrees or round the corners of the video to mimic a vintage picture tube

Lesson 18, Dreamweaver CC New Features 
Additional new features in Dreamweaver CC
Edge Animate composition support
Dreamweaver CC lets you bring your pages to life by adding standards-based compositions 
right from Adobe Edge Animate. Edge Animate compositions can be used where Flash 
animation and interactive media elements were previously used and work with the built-
in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript support in today’s modern browsers. Use the Media 
category of the Insert panel to insert compositions directly into your page and view them 
directly in Dreamweaver using Live view.
Add standards-based compositions directly from Adobe Edge Animate.
You can create interactive animations, animated web banners, and more with Adobe Edge 
Animate, part of the Adobe Edge suite available with a free Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. 
See http://creative.adobe.com for more information.
Additional features
Dreamweaver CC also added improved FTP performance using a robust multi-threaded 
FTP engine making the transfer of large projects easier and more effi  cient. Live Search on
Mac OS makes it faster to fi nd fi les with real-time search results that update as you type. 
HD video and images are increasingly in demand on today’s high-end mobile devices.
Dreamweaver CC is compatible with HiDPI to support today’s devices with HD capability
such as Apple’s Retina display.
