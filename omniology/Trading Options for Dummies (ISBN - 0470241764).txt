Introduction
W
elcome to Trading Options For Dummies. This book brings you option
strategies for managing risk and navigating a variety of market condi-
tions. I truly believe that by taking care of risk first, profits will follow. With
that in mind, the approaches you find here focus on reducing potential losses
from traditional stock positions and building an option strategy repertoire
that allows you to gain whether the markets are moving up, down, or side-
ways. To incorporate the comprehensive steps required when trading, it also
provides discussions on market and sector analysis, as well as things to look
for when trying out a new strategy. 
An option contract is a unique security that comes with contract rights and
obligations. When used correctly, an option contract provides you with lever-
age while still allowing you to reduce overall trade risk. Of course there’s
another side to that leverage, which is why you want to take the time to read
through this book to understand the risks and characteristics associated
with these contracts. 
When applying for options trading with your broker, your broker will send
you the reference guide Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
This publication written by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) must be
distributed by brokers to their clients prior to allowing them to trade
options. It describes option contract specifications, mechanics, and the risks
associated with the security. That publication, when coupled with Trading
Options For Dummies, will give you the tools you need so you can understand
your risks and use options effectively.
About This Book
There are a ton of trading titles out there, including those focusing on option
strategies. This book focuses primarily on approaches aimed at managing
risk, the consistent theme throughout. By setting it up this way, you can
cover different topics while keeping that key objective in mind. So go ahead,
jump around to areas that interest you most. 
This book can be read from cover to cover or used as a reference guide. Each
strategy provided identifies risks and rewards associated with the position. It
also identifies alternative strategies to consider for risk management, when
applicable. There are a million ways to successfully trade the markets, but
certain challenges are universal to all of them. Tools and techniques focused
on addressing these challenges are also provided throughout.

This book allows you to move from topic to topic in any order or serves as a
start to finish guide for option trading. Use it whatever way best suits your
needs. 
Conventions Used in This Book
To make reading and understanding the world of options trading a bit easier,
I’ve used some conventions to help you along the way:
 Italics: I provide newly defined terms in italics in all parts and chapters. 
 Acronyms: I repeat the full name for acronyms quite a bit so you don’t
have to flip around a bunch to find out what VIS (very important strat-
egy) stands for — I hate when I have to do that, too. 
 Glossary: I include a glossary at the end of the book so you can find the
definitions that you need fast. 
 Monofont: Any time I reference a Web site that may provide additional
information or make a task easier, those addresses appear in mono-
font. And if you ever see a Web site split from one line to the next, rest
assured that I’ve added no extra hyphens, so type the site in your
browser just as it appears.
What You’re Not to Read
Because trading is not a skill that’s typically mastered with a basic checklist,
I’ve included comments along the way to provide additional insight for the
strategy or approach. I’ve enclosed these comments in sidebars (gray-shaded
boxes) as well as with an eye-catching Technical Stuff icon. However, you can
successfully implement the strategies I describe without looking at these not-
to-read pieces. They are there to reinforce ideas or provide technical detail
and interesting information aimed at adding to the core discussion. These
sidebars and Technical Stuff icons allow me to provide a little more detail,
but they are at your disposal or for your disposal. However, I have to say, you
must be a little curious?
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this particular book, I made some assumptions about you that may
explain the level at which this book is written as well as show you how
Trading Options For Dummies can be the resource you’ve been searching for.
Here’s what I’ve assumed about you:
2
Trading Options For Dummies 

 You have experience. If you’ve chosen this book, you have some famil-
iarity with the stock market and the risks and rewards it presents to you.
As a self-directed investor, you seek ways to manage those risks and
rewards. However, if you’re not familiar at all with options or you’ve just
had a little exposure to them, option fundamentals and mechanics are
covered here. Even if you’ve traded these instruments before, you can
consider it a review if you’re looking for one.
 You hold longer term investments. Regardless of whether or not you
choose to actively trade options, I’ve assumed you hold longer term
investments. For that reason, core strategies aimed at managing risk
associated with longer term holdings are included. The small amount of
time needed to implement them may be well worth it.
 You already decided how to allocate your investment and trading dol-
lars. Although I distinguish investment assets from trading assets, I
don’t address how to allocate those dollars because everyone’s financial
situation is different. I do assume this is something you’ve already com-
pleted, because plans should strike a balance between the two (long-
term and short-term) to grow assets. 
 You have computer and Internet access. I can’t imagine trading or
investing without a computer and reliable access to the Internet . . . so I
assume you have both. 
 You use a broker. I assume you contact a broker to further manage your
risk when needed. I assume you also have a comfort level with your
broker’s web platform. It may serve as a resource for some of the ideas
covered in this book. 
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve broken this book into five main parts, any of which provide you with
option-focused trading insights. Whether you want an options primer or
review, basic strategies or those that are more advanced, or insights from the
options market, each one has its place in this book and can be found in the
following parts:
Part I: Getting Started
This part provides you with an introduction to option contracts, including
rights and obligations for option buyers and sellers. It identifies how you
trade these securities on exchanges, along with how your rights and obliga-
tions are satisfied. As with any security, you must understand the risks and
rewards associated with these contracts. Part I provides foundational risk
and reward information for you.

Introduction

Part II: Evaluating Markets, 
Sectors, and Strategies
Trading options don’t begin by running out to buy a call or put. It’s the culmi-
nation of your analysis on the markets, sectors, and the underlying security
for your trade. This part provides market assessment methods using breadth
and sentiment analysis then moves on to technical analysis of sectors. It also
incorporates the options market in this analysis. Because you may be explor-
ing new strategies, you also want to evaluate those strategies in a systematic
way to reinforce your understanding of them while also addressing the
unique characteristics of options, such as trading costs and order placement
methods, which I provide in this part.
Part III: What Every Trader Needs 
to Know About Options
Options provide you with some distinct trading advantages, but as with other
types of securities, they are not without risk. In fact, used the wrong way,
they can be very risky. By understanding option styles and the risks associ-
ated with each you can manage that risk. Even if you choose to use options
on a limited basis, you can consider a few core strategies to limit your overall
market risk. These can be implemented with existing stock positions, single
option positions, or through combination option positions. 
All the strategies provided in this part focus on alternative, reduced risk
approaches to stock positions. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and option
strategies using ETFs are also discussed here to provide some insights on
ways to reduce portfolio volatility as well as single stock risk. 
Part IV: Advanced Strategies 
for Option Traders
Option strategies go beyond stock trading alternatives. When trading options
you can benefit from large moves in a stock, regardless of the direction of the
move when using the right strategy. There are also ways you can create a per-
fectly hedged position that has minimal risk from moves in the underlying.
Through position adjustments you can maintain a completely neutral market
view, but still profit. The key to these strategies is changing volatility — a
topic addressed throughout this part.

Trading Options For Dummies 

Part V: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part include summaries for great option strategies aimed
at reducing your risk. After you reduce your risk, you can look toward
increasing reward . . . . also covered here. I also address key elements all
traders must address to be successful with a bent toward option traders.
Glossary
All types of trading have terms unique to it, along with those that are more

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Whether you’re seeking to improve longer term investing or shorter term
trading results, strategies geared toward both are included in this book. By
using the techniques in the book and viewing yourself as a risk manager, your
losses should decrease allowing you to move forward to increased profits.
You may decide to pick up this reference while evaluating your investments
on a quarterly basis or keep it handy at your desk for weekly trading assess-
ments. During your regular review routine you may also find that current
market conditions that once kept you on the sidelines, are now ideal for
strategies you reviewed here. Consider it a reference.
Ready to go? You have lots of options ahead. (No pun intended.)
If you’ve recently been perplexed with action in the markets, you may want
to start with the sentiment discussions covered in Chapter 5. It identifies dif-
ferent things happening in the options markets that may clarify stock market
activity. 
Those new to trading options or who feel you can benefit from a refresher,
should consider perusing Part I. Because the markets are ever-evolving,
Chapter 3 gets you up to speed on current conditions.
If you have a basic handle on option contracts and want to quickly access
unique ways to capitalize on different stock movement, consider jumping to
Part IV. This part includes a variety of approaches you just can’t match with
stocks. 
Chapter 18 provides my thoughts on what it takes to be a successful option
trader. Because trading options comes with many of the same challenges
encountered when trading any security, you may want to make it the first
thing you read to help you succeed with your current trading.

his part provides you with an introduction to 
option contracts, including rights and obligations for
option buyers and sellers. It identiﬁes how you trade
these securities on exchanges, along with how your rights
and obligations are satisﬁed. As with any security, you
must understand the risks and rewards associated with
these contracts. Part I provides foundational risk and
reward information for you.

hether you’re new to trading or an experienced investor, listed stock
and index options are great vehicles for managing risk and growing
your assets. The wide variety of strategies available using these securities
make them suitable for just about everyone — providing you understand
how they work and apply them properly. I started trading options decades
ago and found that by using different strategies I could implement trades
with reasonable risk-reward profiles throughout all those years. 
Trading and investing are typically distinguished by timeframes. I consider
investing to be something you carry out to meet longer term financial goals.
Regardless of the plan you personally create to satisfy those goals, options
offer a means of protecting longer term assets during periods when the mar-
kets work against them. Parts I and III provide you with insights towards
these goals. It is also a main focus for Chapters 10 and 13.
Although I primarily use the term trading for investing or trading, I consider
the latter an approach to the markets aimed at obtaining superior returns to
help build those longer term investments. Superior returns mean taking addi-
tional risk, but I definitely mean measured risk. If nothing else, the
approaches offered in this book should reinforce the focus you must main-
tain on risk, reward, and effective position management regardless of the
financial asset you decide to use. An option specific risk primer can be found
in Chapter 4.

The timeframes for trading may be shorter, but don’t get the wrong idea . . .
I’m not talking about hyperactive day-trading where you’re glued to your
screen. Stock and index options offer strategies requiring daily management,
as well as those that can be reviewed weekly or longer. It’s up to you to imple-
ment those approaches that are suitable to your risk tolerances and prefer-
ences, along with your schedule. 
Understanding Options
Options are financial instruments that derive their value from another under-
lying asset or financial measure — here I focus on stocks and stock market
indexes. Because options come in two forms, calls and puts, adding them to
your current investing and trading tools allows you to benefit from both bull-
ish and bearish moves in either underlying you select. You can do this to
limit your total assets at risk or to protect an existing position. 
To truly understand stock and index options, you must also have a solid
understanding of the asset in which they’re based. This may mean looking at
stock or index movement differently — for example, volatility is a key compo-
nent in option value. By comparing options to its underlying security or other
securities, your learning curve is geared toward applying them. Chapter 9 dis-
tinguishes this for stocks and index options.
The primary focus for trading any security is to understand its risks includ-
ing all the following: 
 Knowing what conditions to consider when analyzing a trade
 Using proper trade mechanics when creating a position
 Recognizing trading rules and requirements for the security
 Understanding what makes the position gain and lose value
The sections that follow address these key components of options to give
you a good platform to create rewarding positions.
Knowing option essentials
A listed stock option is a contractual agreement between two parties with
standard terms. When creating a new position, buying an option gives you
rights and selling an option leaves you with obligations. These rights and
obligations are guaranteed by the Option Clearing Corporation (OCC) so you
never have to worry about who’s on the other end of the agreement.
10
Part I: Getting Started 

A primary risk you encounter with options is time risk because contracts
have a limited life. A call option gains value when its underlying stock goes
up, but if the move in the stock is too late the call can expire worthless. On
the plus side options have expiration periods as late as 9 months to 21⁄2 years. 
Your rights as a call owner include all the following:
 Buying a specific quantity of the underlying stock
 Buying by a certain date (expiration)
 Buying at a specified price (known as the strike price)
That’s why the call price goes up when the stock price goes up — the price
you have rights to is fixed while the stock itself is increasing in value. 
A put option gains value when its stock moves down, but the timing issue is
the same. The move has to occur before the option contract expires. Your
put contract rights include selling a specific quantity of stock by a certain
date at a specified price. If you have rights to sell a stock at $60, but bad
news about the company pushes its price below $60, those rights become
more valuable.
Gaining skill as an options trader means selecting options with expiration
dates that allow time for the anticipated moves to occur. This may sound too
challenging at the moment, but there are some basic trading rules of thumb
that help. Among those rules is proper trade management which means exit-
ing a position if it moves against you and reaches your pre-determined exit
point. 
Each stock with options available has a variety of expiration dates and strike
prices. When researching options you’ll find the following:
 An option with more time until expiration is more expensive.
 An option with a more advantageous strike price is more expensive.
Information about all available options can be found on the Internet from a
variety of sources, including your broker. Selecting the best ones given cur-
rent conditions and your outlook for the stock takes a little bit of time, but
it’s not rocket science. Your biggest challenges are those associated with any
type of trading: managing your own emotions and using discipline.
11
Chapter 1: Options Trading and Investing

Gaining comfort with option mechanics
Options differ from stocks in terms of what they represent and how they are
created. This results in additional rules for trading and decision-making
beyond the basic buy or sell considerations. You may decide to exercise your
rights under the contract or simply exit the position in the market.
Fortunately market prices will help you with those decisions as will some
thoughts from Chapters 9 and 18.
Are these extra complications worth it? For many people, yes. The differ-
ences in stock and option mechanics are pretty straightforward and manage-
able. A big advantage to these securities is the way they provide you with
leverage. By controlling rights to the stock rather than the stock itself, you
significantly reduce your risk. 
From the very start of this book, I identify factors impacting the value of an
option as well as conditions that are best suited for buying and selling differ-
ent contracts. By understanding the way options provide leverage and
reduce your trading risk, you begin appreciating why I use the term mea-
sured risk at the start.
Recognizing option risks and rewards
The primary risk associated with options is time risk. You have the potential
to lose your entire investment if the move you’re expecting is too small or
occurs too late. It’s not an all or nothing proposition for you though. You can
exit an option position if an adverse move occurs in the underlying stock
before expiration. It comes down to disciplined trading.
Assessing stock risk versus option risk for a call or a put builds a solid foun-
dation for understanding the risk and rewards created by more complex
option positions. Viewing these risks on a chart develops your skill for evalu-
ating an option trade. Risk graphs, which plot the position value against the
price of the underlying stock, is a tool of the trade that will be invaluable to
you throughout your trading career. I use throughout the book, especially in
Chapters 4 and 10 through 17 which are strategy oriented.
Incorporating Options into Your Routine
Understanding options and what drives their prices gives you an alternate
view of the stock market. In addition to sentiment information provided by
option trading, the conditions you more thoroughly understand as an options
12
Part I: Getting Started 

trader can aide your stock market analysis. These market characteristics also
help you analyze and select sectors aimed at achieving your goals. Chapter 5
includes specific discussions on this topic.
As with any new strategy or market approach, adding options to your trading
means the following:
 Understanding the risks and rewards associated with them
 Testing them out in a no risk or low risk manner
Options can be “test driven” by monitoring price changes, using paper trading
strategies, and focusing on a limited number of strategies that are well suited
to current conditions. In addition to these steps, it helps to consider the costs
of trading associated with this security. See Chapter 7 for more on this.
Adding options to your analysis
Option analysis for trading can readily fit into your current market analysis,
even supplementing it with sentiment tools. Market breadth tools and senti-
ment analysis generally focus on extreme conditions to identify periods when
there is a greater potential for market reversals. Basically, when the last
person trading turns bearish it’s a bullish sign for the future. Option mea-
sures that help you recognize such extreme conditions include contract
volume and implied volatility readings for major stock indexes. So by adding
sentiment analysis to breadth analysis, you get nice confirmation of pending
changes. See Chapter 5 for more on this.
Options analysis focuses on two aspects of the market:
 Trending conditions
 Volatility conditions
Although stock traders are also aware of trending conditions, they may be
less in tune with volatility conditions. Or perhaps there is a strong emotional
sense of increased volatility, but not a quantitative one. 
Technical analysis aimed at providing both trend and volatility information
helps you whether you’re concentrating on option or stock trading. Adding
the information to sector analysis enables you to use underlying groups that
behave differently so you can better diversify your holdings and spread your
risk. The combination of sector and option analysis also provides nice low-
risk alternatives for capitalizing on bearish moves through the use of puts. I
cover core technical analysis concepts in Chapter 6.

Chapter 1: Options Trading and Investing

Trying out investing and trading strategies
Option values are not solely based on the price of the underlying stock it
tracks. There are other factors impacting an option’s market price. Reading
about these other factors is a great start, but to a get a better handle on pric-
ing dynamics before you have money on the line, there are additional steps
you can take. Chapter 7 highlights this information.
There are different techniques available to you designed to provide the 
following:
 A better intuitive understanding of the changes in the underlying stock
(and market in general) that affect the price of an option
 Improved working knowledge of strategy mechanics through simulation
So becoming proficient with option strategies requires practice through
paper trading — similar to trading stocks. But before that, you really have to
understand how real market changes impact option values over time. After
you accomplish this, you can get a lot more out of paper trading. You can
focus on other trading costs including slippage and margin requirements, as
well as ways to best execute transactions.
Paper trading is not the only technique you can borrow from stock trading to
check out a new strategy. Backtesting an option approach may take a little
more time than a stock approach, but it certainly could save you a lot of
money. By having a plan that slows down your pace so you address different
option trading nuances in advance, you will be setting disciplined trading
skills in stone. 
Putting Options to Work
Option contracts can be used for financial hedges or tools for speculating.
When purchasing an option contract you have the ability to exercise your
rights or simply trade those rights away. Different needs and conditions will
dictate different actions. You want to be prepared to properly assess the situ-
ation so you do what’s best. Exercising an option to minimize stock risk is
just one way you put options to work for you. 
Reasonably reducing risk is the name of the game in investing, so it’s very
useful to know ways you can protect existing positions and strategies by
adding options to them. Protection can be put in place on a position by posi-
tion basis or by hedging the whole portfolio. If instead of a bearish short-
term outlook that requires hedging, your view becomes so negative that
14
Part I: Getting Started 

you’re seeking bearish trading opportunities, options offer a much safer
approach than short selling a stock or sector. Chapter 10 identifies some
hedging techniques.
Another way options can do some heavy lifting for your investments is
through the use of leverage. By spending less on an initial investment you
satisfy a reduced risk approach, but that doesn’t mean you must realize
reduced returns. Basic strategies can help you accomplish both. And if spec-
ulating is part of your modus operandi, you can risk even less when willing to
cap your profits. 
Understanding option styles 
There is a primary focus on stock options in this book, but it’s hard to ignore
another big segment of the stock market . . . that is the index market. The
glaring difference between a stock and an index is that stock is a security that
can be traded. An index cannot. This means index option exercise takes on a
whole new dimension. Because this is not the only difference between the
two option types, it’s important to grasp how your rights and trading are
affected by the style of the option you decide to use. See Chapter 9 if you
want to know more.
Using options to limit your risk
Comparing stock and option risk profiles is a nice start to appreciating the
value options bring to your investments, but using strategies to capitalize on
these securities is that much better. Evaluating the many options available
for protection is one of the first steps you take in implementing all strategies.
Spending time upfront understanding why some will suit your purposes
better than others switches theory discussions to real applications: 
 Risk for an existing position: Risk for existing positions can be reduced
by varying degrees ranging from moderate protection to full hedges that
are adjusted as market conditions change. (See Chapter 10.)
 Risk for a new position: Risk for new positions can similarly be reduced
to a very small amount using a combination of options or less signifi-
cantly with single long-term options. (See Chapters 1 and 12.)
Account approvals for strategies that use long options combined with stock
or individually are generally available to most traders. As you gain experi-
ence and have more strategies available to you, you can really customize a
position risk profile using option combinations. These include:
15
Chapter 1: Options Trading and Investing

 Vertical debit spreads
 Vertical credit spreads
 Calendar spreads
 Diagonal spreads
Access to multiple strategies means implementing approaches that are best
suited to existing market conditions. 
Applying options to sector approaches
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may be one of the best investment products
created in decades. They offer great diversification such as mutual funds
(MF), but far outshine them in two areas:
 Ability to exit an ETF as needed with a quoted market price during the
day (not end of day value calculation)
 Existence of options using ETFs as the underlying security
Needless to say, I really love that second one. Portfolios can be constructed
using ETFs and ETF options for protection or using ETF options for the entire
portfolio. In keeping with one of the book’s objectives to provide both
investors and traders with option tools, this topic definitely had to be
included and is found in Chapter 13.
Using Options in Challenging Markets
Stocks and ETFs offer a great way to participate in bullish or bearish markets,
but there remains a third potential trend for prices — that’s sideways. By
adding strategies that allow you to capitalize on this third trending alterna-
tive, you’re taking one more step toward letting the market dictate your
approach.
In addition to addressing a third potential market trend, option strategies allow
you to reduce directional risk by profiting from moves upward or downward
rather than in just one direction. You can create a combination position and
adjust it over time as prices change. Such an approach responds to market
movement rather than trying to predict it. See Chapter 14 for more on this.
16
Part I: Getting Started 

Reducing your directional bias
Stock positions, whether long or short, have directional bias because they
rely on movement in one direction for profits. Options allow you to reduce
directional bias by creating combination positions that can profit if the
underlying moves up or down. 
So not only can you better control maximum losses with options, but you can
also reduce directional risk by using strategies that can gain from two of
three possible directional moves. Such approaches are based on delta neu-
tral trading styles which introduce a whole new way of thinking about the
market. Chapter 15 adds to similar strategies introduced in Chapter 14.
Benefiting when the markets go nowhere
A stock can stay in a sideways trending channel for an extended period of
time, providing option traders a way to profit when most stock traders can’t.
Although the sideways pattern may be longer term, the option strategies that
capitalize on them are shorter term in nature. These extended patterns also
tend to result in strong moves away from the channel that retrace and often
test the pattern before continuing on. This sets you up for a strategy change
early on in a new trend. Chapter 15 provides more insight to this.
Considering your obstacles
Whether you’re trading stocks, ETFs, currencies, or options, there are similar
obstacles to success that must be overcome. The main one is your make-up.
Trading evokes certain emotions that can wreak havoc on your results unless
you actively manage them. There are a variety of ways to do this, many of
which are discussed (and reiterated) throughout the book. It seems to me the
topic also warrants its own space so consider periodically reviewing Chapter
18 to keep your plan on track.

Introducing Options
In This Chapter
 Recognizing an option contract

 Gaining some tips on trading options
O
ptions come in many forms and sizes, but in this book I focus on two
specific types of options: listed stock options and listed index options.
Both of these types of options are traded in the options market. They provide
you with flexibility to capitalize on opportunities while limiting losses. To
best appreciate the benefits of options trading, having a good handle on what
exactly an option is and its associated risks and rewards is a must. So in this
chapter, I provide detailed information on the components that identify an
option and how you recognize them in the market as well as compare options
to securities you may already be trading. 
Understanding Option Contracts
To best understand option contracts, you need to understand the basics as
well as how options differ from other derivatives in the market. The sections
that follow give you the basics you need know to best balance the risks and
rewards of option contracts so you can begin trading with confidence.
Getting a grasp on option basics
A financial option is a contractual agreement between two parties. This book
focuses on stock and index options that use standard agreements and trade
on exchanges. Stock and index options are referred to as listed options and
provide the owner with the rights and the option seller with obligations.
Using a stock option, these follow:

 Stock option owner rights: The right to buy a specific amount of stock
at a predetermined price (call option) or the right to sell a specific
amount of stock at a predetermined price (put option).
 Stock option seller obligations: The obligation to sell a specific amount
of stock at a pre-determined price (call option) or the obligation to buy a
specific amount of stock at a predetermined price (put option).
In this chapter, however, I focus on monthly stock options. To ensure you
stay on the same page with me, the following bullets give you the formal defi-
nitions as well as the benefits for the two types of stock options you can
trade — a call option and a put option:
 Call option: Call options give the owner (seller) the right (obligation) to
buy (sell) a specified number of shares for the underlying stock at a
specified price by a predetermined date. A call option allows you to
invest a smaller amount and still benefit from an upward move in stock
value.
 Put option: Put options give the owner (seller) the right (obligation) to
sell (buy) a specified number of shares for the underlying stock at a
specified price by a predetermined date. A put option on a stock you
hold for the long-term gains value during those downturns you find so
painful to watch.
To minimize risk and maximize reward with any financial asset, you must
understand how the asset works. After you begin trading a new security,
always consider the risk involved with the worst-case scenario
Stock options allow you to do the following:
 Benefit from upside moves for less money
 Benefit from downward moves without the risk of short-selling
 Protect a stock position or portfolio during market downturns
However, you have to consider the downside as well:
 Limited life: Each contract comes with an expiration date, so if the
move you anticipate is late, you will lose your entire initial investment.
Proper option selection and position management helps minimize this
negative effect.
 Improper aggressive trading strategies: Such strategies cap rewards
while exposing you to unlimited losses — the same risks you have when
you short a stock. I don’t advocate using options in that manner. 
20
Part I: Getting Started 

Comparing options to other securities
The primary factor determining the market value of an option is the stock
price in which it’s based. So an option derives its value from the underlying
stock. These types of securities are known as derivatives. To best understand
option valuations, you should know more about other derivatives in the
market, including commodities and futures contracts and a quasi-derivative:
the exchange-traded fund (ETF):
 Commodities and futures: As with stock options, commodities and
futures contracts are also agreements between two parties. The main
distinction is that a stock option gives you rights as an owner while a
commodities or futures contract obligates you regardless. That’s an
important distinction if you are already trading these securities.
Commodities are contracts that fix the price for a set amount of a physi-
cal item such as gold or livestock. Each contract is scheduled to be exe-
cuted on a pre-determined date unless you exit the agreement by trading
out of the contract. So as with a stock option, a commodity contract
locks in the price and quantity of an asset. Unlike an option it identifies a
specific delivery date. 
 Indexes: An index is a tool used to measure prices for a group of stocks,
bonds, or commodities. As a result, you derive an index value using the
price of the different components that make it up. I cover indexes and
options on indexes in much greater detail in Chapter 9.
An index isn’t a security though. You can’t buy one. What you can do is
buy a security that tracks the ups and downs of an index, such as a
mutual fund. A mutual fund often imitates changes in the index it tracks
by owning the same mix of stocks, bonds, or commodities. You won’t get
a perfect one-for-one match with the index, but it works pretty well.
 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): In the same way an index derives its
values from its components, so does the index mutual fund. Another
security that behaves similarly is the exchange-traded fund (ETF). It’s
similar to a mutual fund because it represents a partial investment in a
basket of stocks, bonds, or commodities. I refer to it as a quasi-derivative
because not all ETFs actually hold the component assets of the index it
tracks. Some of them do it using more exotic securities. ETFs differ from
mutual funds because they can be traded throughout the day just as
with a stock. You’re probably familiar with two of the original ETFs:
• SPYDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) which tracks the S&P 500 Index
• Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (QQQQ) 
21
Chapter 2: Introducing Options

Both of these ETFs regularly top the most active volume lists on differ-
ent stock exchanges. That means these particular ETFs are easy to sell
after you own them. The best thing though, is that there are options
available on them. I’ll be using these ETFs along with the associated
stock options throughout the book.
 Stocks and bonds: When you buy a stock you partially own the com-
pany’s assets. Purchasing a bond makes you a part holder of the com-
pany’s debt. Each come with different rights, risks, and rewards. Table
2-1 gives you a breakdown of how stocks and bonds compare with
options.

Uncovering an Option’s Value
Knowing your potential risks and rewards means you understand how an
investment is valued, what makes it go up and what makes it go down. You
determine appropriate market values for listed options based on the following:
 The option type (call or put)
 The market value of its underlying security 
 How the underlying security traded in the past — volatile or calm
 The time remaining until it expires
Puts increase in value as the underlying stock declines.
In this section I provide the option contract details you need to know to suc-
cessfully navigate through market information to uncover how each of these
factors impact an option’s value. 
22
Part I: Getting Started 

Understanding options rights 
and obligations
Options come in two types: calls and puts. When you own a call, you have the
right to buy a certain stock at a specific price by a certain date. As a put owner,
you have the right to sell certain stock at a specific price by a specific date. 
The rights you have as an option owner are at your discretion — you don’t
have to exercise them when the option expiration date approaches. Between
the time you purchase an option and the date it expires you can do as follows:
 Sell it for a profit
 Sell it for a loss
 Exercise it
 Let it expire with no value (for a loss)
As an option seller, you’re obligated to complete certain transactions. You
have less choices and the market generally dictates your fate in terms of
meeting those contract obligations. As expiration approaches you can do as
follows:
 Buy it back for a profit
 Buy it back for a loss
 See it expire with no value (for a profit)
To remember your call and put rights, think about calling the stock away
from someone (buying) and putting the stock to someone (selling).
Taking in some terminology
Here is some important option terminology to understand before you move
forward:
 Underlying security: The stock which you buy or sell.
 Strike price: The price you pay if you exercise your rights.
 Expiration date: The date the option goes away, along with your rights.
 Option package: The number of shares and name of the security you
call away or put to someone.
23
Chapter 2: Introducing Options

 Market quote: The most current price offered by buyers to purchase the
option and the being asked by sellers to give up the option.
 Multiplier: The number used to determine how much money you pay
when you call away stock and how much you receive when you put
stock to someone. It also is used to determine the total value of the
option.
 Premium: The total value of the option you buy or sell. It’s based on the
market quote for the option and its multiplier. 
 Exercise value: Your cost when you exercise your call option rights, also
known as the exercise cost. Obtain the exercise value by: multiplying the
strike price by the multiplier. 
Options have expiration dates so the rights you buy don’t last forever. To
determine the time until expiration, just identify the expiration date and
figure out how many days or approximate months you are from that date.
Accessing All Your Options
Many people trade in and out of options without ever considering buying or
selling the underlying stock. Regardless of whether you want to just trade
options or actually exercise them to buy or sell a stock, understanding option
rights is an important part of valuing them. Knowing exactly how a security
works is also critical to managing your risk. 
There are many places to access option market information online. Free sites
usually provide listings of all options available for a particular stock, with a
15 to 20 minute time delay for quote and trading data if the option markets
are open. In addition to the option exchanges, you can access this data from
your broker’s Web site and financial information sites such as Yahoo and
Optionetics.
Identifying options
Not all stocks have options, but those that do offer multiple strike prices and
expiration months for you to check out based on your expectations for the
stock and time horizon. The list of options for each stock is referred to as the
option chain. Reviewing option chains allows you to see all the calls and puts
available for a stock as well as option specific data including the following:
24
Part I: Getting Started 

 How many contracts exist; known as open interest
 A market quote that is current or delayed about 15 minutes
 Recent trading levels for the option, either current or delayed
Options currently have a unique identifier known as its option root which is
one to three letters long, matching stock symbols with one to three letters
(i.e. General Electric’s stock symbol and option root is GE). Four letter stock
symbols currently require a different three letter option root (i.e. Microsoft’s
stock symbol is MSFT and its option root is MSQ). 
Option identification is more complex than stocks because the option type,
strike price, and expiration all need to be specified. Currently, options have a
root symbol plus two additional letters to identify them. A new option identifica-
tion system will be finalized in 2008 and implemented in 2009 that will improve
shortfalls in the current system and make option symbols more intuitive. 
Under the current system, an option symbol includes an option root and two
additional letters to designate the option type and expiration month (first
letter) and the option strike price (second letter). See Table 2-2 for an exam-
ple of this system. As of the writing of this book, the Options Symbology
Initiative is working on updating this system. A new option identification
system is expected to be approved in mid-2008 for implementation in 2009.

Given the option root of MSQ for Microsoft, all October call options will
include the letters MSQJ in the symbol. There are always options available
for the current month (near month) and the following month (next month), as
well as two additional months following one of three cycles as detailed in
Table 2-3. Microsoft follows cycle 1, so even if you’re searching for options in
May, you can review October call and put options for MSFT.

Option strike price designations are more tricky because the range is so
large. Searching an option chain on-line, you find that the strike prices avail-
able for a specific stock cluster around the stock trading price. A stock trad-
ing at 20 will have options with strike prices near this level, while those for a
stock trading at 120 will be in that range. Option strike prices can still be
stated as fractions, but the new initiative will update strike prices to decimal
formats.
Double-check option details when you see a quote that doesn’t seem quite
right. You can accidentally bring up a call chain when you meant to view a
put chain. Also, there are times when corporate actions for the underlying
stock require the option to be adjusted resulting in a non-standard option
package. The Options Symbology Initiative will improve, but not completely
fix this issue.
Option strike prices are available in as little as $1 increments. For the most
part though, the increments start at $2.50 and move up to $10 depending on
the stock price. Table 2-4 provides common strike price identifiers.
 Stock at $30: Strike prices generally available at $2.50 increments
 Stock at $80: Strike prices generally available at $5 increments
 Stock at $140: Strike prices generally available at $10 increments

Chapter 2: Introducing Options

Expiring options gracefully
An approaching expiration means decision time is also approaching for you,
if you’re still holding an option position. By this point you should have a
good handle on whether you expect to do the following:
 Take advantage of your contract rights: When you take advantage of
the rights under the option contract, you are exercising the option. This
can be accomplished by contacting your broker and submitting exercise
instructions to them. I cover this topic in detail in Chapter 9.
 Trade out of the position
Monthly stock option expiration dates are always the Saturday that follows
the third Friday of the month. Because trading doesn’t take place on
Saturdays, you need to submit exercise instructions or exit the position on
the last trading day before expiration — typically a Friday. 
Each month the expiration for stock options occurs on the Saturday following
the third Friday of the month:
 Last trading day: Because the stock market isn’t open on Saturdays, that
means the last trading day for the stock is that third Friday. An option
derives its value from the underlying stock, so they also stop trading on
the same Friday. Occasionally holidays push this last trading day even
further up the week to Thursday. 
 Last day to exercise: The last day to trade is usually the last day for a
retail trader (you and me) to exercise stock option rights. Typically the
cutoff time to submit instructions is one hour after the markets close,
but that time varies by broker. You must contact your broker to obtain
their specific cutoff times and instruction requirements.
Dissecting your rights
Purchasing a stock call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to
buy a certain amount of stock at a set price (strike price) at any point up to
the option’s expiration date. From the time you buy it until (just about) the
day of expiration, you can either exercise your option rights or trade out of
the position.
Purchasing a stock put option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to
sell a certain amount of stock at a set price (strike price) at any point up to
the option’s expiration date. From the time you buy it until (just about) the
day of expiration, you can either exercise your option rights or trade out of
the position.
28
Part I: Getting Started 

You may never actually exercise an option. Establishing an option position
may simply be part of an overall trading strategy for you. Because you have
rights but not obligations under the contract, how you proceed is entirely up
to you.
Advantages to exercising options include the following:
 Call: Benefiting from shareholder rights including receipt of cash and
stock dividends and fully participating in other corporate actions such
as mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs.
 Put: Exiting a stock position when bad news comes out about a com-
pany after the close of regular trading in the stock market.
 Call or put: Minimizing commissions if you hold an option and want to
buy or sell the underlying stock. Selling the option then buying or selling
the stock in the market typically generates an added commission.
The last item may seem confusing – why sell away your rights to buy a stock
if you want to own it? There are times when it’s just more profitable to sell
the option and complete the stock transaction in the market. I lay out the
decision-making process for you in Chapter 9.
Creating Contracts
Stocks have a set number of shares available for trading referred to as its
float. To increase this number, shareholders vote to authorize the issuance of
additional stock. Options are more flexible because new contracts are created
to meet the demand for that particular contract. This flexibility impacts how
you place an option order and makes it easier to sell an option you don’t own.
The total stock issued for a company is referred to as the authorized shares.
Shares available for trading are referred to as the stock’s float. The possible
number of option contracts available to trade is limitless because they are
created by demand. The actual contracts in existence for a specific option is
referred to as its open interest.
Opening and closing positions
When you enter an order to buy an option, there may or may not be an exist-
ing supply available. If there isn’t a new contract is created to meet the new
demand — it’s pretty seamless; you won’t really know whether you’re buying
an existing contract or a newly created one.
29
Chapter 2: Introducing Options

What it does impact is how you create and exit option positions. In order for
the option exchanges to keep everything straight, you need to identify
whether you’re opening a new position or closing an existing one. You pur-
chase a call option by entering the following order:
Buy to Open, 1 ABC Apr 08 30.00 strike call option
Exiting the position at any point down the road you:
Sell to Close, 1 ABC Apr 08 30.00 strike call option
Because you can sell an option you don’t own, you just need to designate
what type of transaction you’re completing by using the same terminology to
enter and exit the position:
 Sell to Open, 1 FGH Jun 08 17.50 strike call option
 Buy to Close, 1 FGH Jun 08 17.50 strike call option
Completing an order to sell an option you don’t own is pretty straightfor-
ward. Understanding the risk associated with it is the really important part. 
By entering and exiting orders this way, the exchanges and clearing company
for all stock options are able to track the actual numbers of contracts that
exist for each option. This contract value is known as open interest. As with
stock, option volume data is also reported to identify the number of total
contracts traded on any given day.
Because open interest is a record-keeping amount generated from that day’s
trading activity, any open interest value you see with quotes reflects a value
up to and including the previous day’s contract level. There is a one day lag
in this number.
Identifying whether an order opens or closes a position is important for con-
tract recordkeeping. If you make a mistake during order entry and the trade
is executed, the error should be readily fixable. Contact your broker as soon
as possible to get the transaction corrected in your account and at the
exchanges.
Selling an option you don’t own
Selling a stock call option as an opening transaction obligates you to sell a
certain amount of stock at a set price (strike price) at any point through the
option’s expiration date. From the time you sell it until expiration weekend,
you are required to satisfy that obligation if a call option holder chooses to
30
Part I: Getting Started 

exercise their rights. If and when this happens it is referred to as being
assigned the option. Typically your broker contacts you informing you of the
assignment.
Assuming you’re assigned on a call option contract, one of two possibilities
exist:
 You owned shares of the underlying stock in the account which are then
sold at the strike price; this results in closing the stock position in your
account 
 You did not own shares of the underlying, but the shares are sold at the
strike price creating a short stock position in your account.
Selling a call option when you own the underlying shares is referred to as a
covered transaction because the stock is said to cover the short call position.
If you don’t own the stock, the option position is referred to as a naked call.
Your risk associated with a naked call option is the same as your risk when
you short stock — unlimited.
When selling a call option as an opening transaction without owning the
stock, your risk is the same as holding a short stock position. Because a
stock can technically keep rising, your risk is unlimited.
Selling a stock put option as an opening transaction obligates you to buy a
certain amount of stock at a set price (strike price) at any point up through
the option’s expiration date. From the time you sell the put until expiration
weekend, you are required to satisfy the obligation if a put option holder
chooses to exercise their rights. 
Typically you’re assigned on a short put when the stock has suffered a
decline. So you’re purchasing stock at a higher level than its current market
value. Short put transactions can also be covered or naked. 
When selling a short put, you’re obligating yourself to buy shares so you
cover the option with a short stock position in the underlying. Buying the
shares closes this short stock position. If the short put is naked, assignment
of the put creates a new long stock position in your account.
Creating a short option position takes a little time to fully grasp for two 
reasons:
 The obligation associated with the position takes you out of an active
decision-making role for transactions in the underlying stock 
 The risks associated with the short option transaction change signifi-
cantly when it represents a covered versus naked position
31
Chapter 2: Introducing Options

I include much greater risk-reward considerations for long and short option
positions in Chapter 4.
Keeping Some Tips in Mind
You not only want to get off on the right foot when you begin trading options,
but you also want to keep both feet firmly grounded throughout the process.
The following tips should help:
 Get approval. When you want to start trading options, you need to get
approval from your broker . . . the Securities & Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires it. They need to make sure that trading these securities is
appropriate for your financial situation and goals. It’s part of the process
and means you typically get approved for basic option strategies if you
haven’t traded them in the past.
 Be disciplined. When you enter a trade for a specific reason, i.e. an earn-
ings announcement, pending economic report or a particular value for
an indicator you use, you must exit the trade when conditions change or
your original reason for purchasing the security no longer exists. Don’t
let a stock or option position you intended to hold for three weeks
become part of your long-term portfolio. Being disciplined and following
your rules is a must for all traders.
 Keep track of the expiration date. Many option chains include the
actual expiration date for each month along with the option quote data.
The expiration date may also be included with your account position
information. Knowing when the option expires is critical to managing the
position.
 Practice. Always remember that you can paper trade a security that is
new to you. Although the emotions you experience trading this way
don’t exactly mimic having real money on the line, it will help you get
familiar with new types of securities.

In This Chapter
 Finding your way around the option markets
 Leveraging your investment while managing risk 
 Valuing options with the Greeks
 Looking at the past to gauge the future
Your trading career probably started with the stock market. Because
there are plenty of similarities between stocks and options, comparing
the two takes advantage of your base knowledge to expand firmly into a new
trading environment, so I do that when possible here.
Covering options from a trader’s standpoint, this chapter provides informa-
tion about the option exchanges you encounter, the different market partici-
pants impacting your transactions and the market conditions that affect your
trades. All these things have some influence on your trading success. The
biggest key to success though, is really getting a handle on the factors that
come into play when valuing options. With that in mind I introduce formal
option pricing components, known as the “Greeks.”
The U.S. Options Exchanges
There are six option exchanges in the U.S., which is pretty amazing for a secu-
rity that just started trading in the 1970s. Two of these were launched since
2000 and all six offer some form of electronic execution:
 American Stock Exchange (AMEX): www.amex.com
 Boston Options Exchange (BOX): www.bostonoptions.com
 Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE): www.cboe.com
 International Stock Exchange (ISE): www.ise.com
 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE/ARCA): www.nyse.com 
 Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX): www.phlx.com

There is common information on the different option exchange Internet sites,
along with information specific to the exchange’s listings. Each also seems to
have a unique strength. Periodically check the sites for new tools and
insights.
Navigating the Markets
In this section, I give you information on how to get around the options
market including executing trades, understanding key players in the options
game, and recognizing some of the more unique characteristics of options
trading.
Trade execution
Entering an order through the Internet on your broker’s system triggers an
extremely fast series of events:
 The order is routed to one of six exchanges where it gets executed if it
satisfies the current market quote or is reflected in the market if it
improves the current quote.
 If your order is routed to an exchange with a less favorable market
quote, that exchange can either improve their price or send it to the
exchange with the best quote because the exchanges are linked 
electronically.
 If and when your order is executed, a report is sent back to your broker
with the trade details. This information appears almost immediately in
your account when received by your broker.
 Orders that improve the best market quote are posted quickly on the
exchange where it was routed. It is reflected across all exchanges as the
best bid when buying or the best offer (ask) when selling. It remains
there until it is executed or a better bid or offer replaces it.
So much of the order process is completed electronically that you can have
an execution report in seconds. If your experiencing regular delays, you need
to consider what role your Internet connection plays in that problem. 
34
Part I: Getting Started 

Option market participants
The option market includes market participants similar to the stock market: 
 Brokers: A broker with a specialized license needs to approve your
account for option trading. Not only does the firm need to protect you,
they also need to protect themselves because unlimited risk option posi-
tions, such as short naked calls, could expose you both to high losses.
Be patient with the approval process and only trade strategies in which
you fully understand the risks associated with a worst-case scenario. If
you want to trade options, you need to complete an additional applica-
tion for each brokerage account you want to include. There are different
approval levels for option trading that reflect an increasing amount of
risk for the strategies approved. Typically you can receive approval for
basic strategies when starting out. 
Brokers must follow minimum rules and regulations, but can also operate
under ones that are stricter. Communicate with your broker to under-
stand key trading items such as margin and maintenance rules, minimum
balances for option trading, cut-off times for submitting exercise instruc-
tions, and similar issues.
 Market makers and specialists: Market makers and specialists are
responsible for providing a market for your orders — meaning they’re
required to take the other side of your trade at the quoted level. You
may not always agree with their quotes, but they are key to the
exchanges by providing liquidity and assuming risk. They also keep the
markets orderly so your orders are handled by price and time priority,
even when chaos erupts during buying frenzies and selling panics.
When trading options you want to lean toward those contracts that are
more actively traded. This allows you to get into and (much more impor-
tantly) out of the position more easily. You can find the most active
options for each exchange on its Web site.
 Options Clearing Corporation: I don’t know about you, but when I enter
into a financial contract I want to know a little something about the
person on the other side agreement. So if you were a little concerned
about who’s protecting your option rights, this part is for you. The
Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) is the clearing firm that guarantees
option sellers will meet their obligations. So when you buy an option
contract on an exchange, you don’t have to seek out the seller when it’s
time to exit the position. When you buy an option that trades on multi-
ple exchanges it has the same terms regardless of whether you bought it
on the CBOE, ISE, or any of the six exchanges listed. All of these
exchanges clear through the OCC (www.optionsclearing.com).
35
Chapter 3: Trading Places: Options for Stocks

 Options Industry Council: The OCC and six option exchanges all partici-
pate in an investor education partnership known as the Options
Industry Council (OIC). The mission for this organization is to educate
the investing public about listed stock options. The OIC Web site is
www.optionscentral.com and should definitely be on your list of
ones to check out. 
Transactions unique to options
Because option contracts are created as needed, there is a unique way to
enter option orders. You identify whether you are creating a new position or
closing an existing position by including the following with your order: 
 Buy to Open
 Sell to Open
 Sell to Close
 Buy to Close
In addition, exercising contract rights create a buy or sell transaction in the
underlying stock that goes through the OCC.
The exercise process
Exercising your option contract is accomplished by submitting exercise
instructions to your brokerage by its cutoff time. Check with your brokerage
for this information. It usually takes one day for the option exercise and asso-
ciated stock transaction to appear in your account. 
When you exercise a put and do not own the underlying stock in your
account, you are creating a short stock position. Be sure you understand all
the risks and rewards associated with submitting exercise instructions.
The assignment process
When you are short a stock option contract, you are at risk of assignment
from the time you create the position through expiration of the contract. The
only way you can alleviate yourself of the obligation is to exit the position by
entering a Buy to Close order for the option. Basically, when assigned you are
on the receiving end of the transactional flow: 
 When holding a short put, the assigned option is removed from your
account and a Buy transaction occurs for the underlying stock. 
 When holding a short call, the assigned option is removed from your
account and a Sell transaction occurs for the underlying stock.
36
Part I: Getting Started 

Contact your broker to find out the method they use to assign short options.
Almost all use a random selection process.
Trading rules you should know
Whenever you begin trading a new market you likely get some butterflies
until the first few trades go off without a hitch. It’s always nice to find every-
thing unfolds as you expected. That actually requires some advance work on
your end and this short list of trading rules hopefully helps your comfort
level with initial executions, as well as considerations down the road:
 Contract pricing: Options in general trade in $0.05 and $0.10 increments
rather than $0.01 increments as with stocks. The exchanges began trad-
ing a pilot group of stocks and ETFs at $0.01 increments in 2007.
Additional securities have been added to the program in a trend that will
likely continue.
 Transaction premium: The premium value you pay for an option is
obtained by multiplying the option price quoted in the market by the
option’s multiplier. This value is usually 100 for stock options. So when
you purchase an option quoted at $2.80, you are actually paying $280 for
the option, plus commissions.
 Market conditions: There are different market conditions that impact
both the stock and options markets. These include:
• Trading halts for a security or entire market: If you hold options
for a halted stock, the options are also halted. You still have the
ability to exercise your contract rights when this occurs before
expiration. Generally, a trading halt will not restrict your right to
exercise at all.
• Fast trading conditions for a security or securities: When this
happens, you can expect to see quotes that are changing quickly
and you’ll likely experience significant delays in order execution
and reporting. Unless you must exit a position for risk reasons, I
strongly advise against using market orders for options in fast 
markets.
• Booked order: A booked order is one that improves the current
market quote and updates it. The market maker isn’t necessarily
willing to take the trade at the quoted level, but another trader is.
You can encounter problems with such orders because the size
can be as small as one contract. If you enter a ten-contract order
that matches the booked order price, you may only be filled on one
contract. The rest of your order may or may not be filled.
37
Chapter 3: Trading Places: Options for Stocks

 Best-execution: Execution quality is a general term used to describe a
broker’s ability to provide trade completions at, or better than, the cur-
rent market for the security. This means when you place an order to buy
an option with an asking quote of $2.00, your order is filled in a timely
manner at $2.00 or better. Execution quality reports use the National
Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) for all exchanges trading the security. Option
exchanges are required to send a daily report to your broker whenever a
trade is executed at a price other than the NBBO, referred to as traded-
through. They must also provide an exception reason for the trade
through. Even with the reporting, you may feel you’re not getting the
best possible executions on your option trades.
38
Part I: Getting Started 
SEC Execution Quality Rules
In 2001, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) adopted rules requiring
market centers, including brokerage firms, to
report on the execution quality and handling of
its retail order flow (order flow from you and
me). SEC Rule 11ac1-5 and Rule 11ac1-6 are the
two primary rules that set the standards for
reporting to the public. Option trades were orig-
inally excluded from this reporting, but
exchanges do need to report any trades not
executed at the National Best bid or Offer
(NBBO).
SEC 11ac1-5 provides a monthly report on a
variety of speed and execution measurements
for all orders (collectively) covered by the rule
which includes covers retail orders for market
and marketable limit orders that are received
during regular trading hours, and specifically
excludes orders with special handling require-
ments. SEC 11ac1-6 is a quarterly reporting
identifying where the brokerage firm sent its
covered order flow, along with any material
relationships the firm has with that market
venue (i.e. any payment it receives from an
exchange for its orders.)
Execution quality reporting focuses on two key
elements: how close to the NBBO was your
order executed and how long did it take. The
NBBO measurement is calculated using the
effective to quoted spread (E/Q%), which is
equal to 1.00 or 100% when your order is exe-
cuted at the midpoint of the NBBO spread. An
E/Q% of 98% indicates a trade that was exe-
cuted at a price better than the NBBO (price
improvement) while an E/Q% of 105% indicates
a trade that was executed at a price that was
worse than the NBBO (price disimprovement).
The time for order completion begins when the
market center receives your order (the trading
department acting as market maker or special-
ist if your brokerage firm completes that portion
of the transaction). The time measurement ends
when the order is executed in the market place,
not when you receive the trade report back via
the web or your broker.
The SEC requirements are specific, but there
are enough vagaries for firms to highlight their
strengths and down play their weaknesses. You
may find firms using best-ex reporting as part of
their marketing campaign. Since order flow
routing information provides summary informa-
tion rather than specific order details, the
results you experience on your order execution
may seem vastly different from what you see
reported from 1-5, 1-6 or marketing literature.

39
Chapter 3: Trading Places: Options for Stocks
If you are not satisfied with the execution you receive on a specific
order, or you have an order that was marketable and is still open,
contact your broker immediately. The broker can check the status
of the order (it may be executed but the trade report is delayed)
and market condition details that are more difficult to track as
time passes. More often than not, your broker really wants to get
you the best execution possible.
Because an option eventually expires you really need to understand
option valuations so you don’t pay too much for the time remaining.
You can manage this time risk by exiting a long option at least 30 days
before it expires. Within 30 days, the option’s time value erodes at an
accelerated pace.
Weighing Option Costs and Benefits
There are benefits to using options, but you don’t get those for free.
The biggest risk associated with an option is its limited life because an
option can expire worthless. You could lose your entire investment.
Clearly this is a risk that needs to be addressed, which I do throughout
the book. Other option cost factors to be considered include:
 Costs associated with the trading process
 Cost of future movement for the stock
By understanding the basic cost structure for an option that I discuss
in the following sections, you can see how options provide leverage at
a reduced risk. The extent to which options do this is very powerful.
Option prices are partially based on probabilities. For stock options,
you want to consider the likelihood a particular option will be in-the-
money at expiration given the type of price movements the underlying
stock has experienced in the past. 
Identifying costs unique to options
Because options are a little different than other securities, it’s impor-
tant to recognize that these securities have certain characteristics that
make them more expensive than trading more commonly held securi-
ties such as stocks. The main costs to consider include:

 Liquidity: The ease you can enter and exit a trade without impacting its
price, varies by option. Low liquidity securities are more expensive. 
 Time: The more time you are purchasing, the greater the cost of the
option.
 Volatility: Stocks with greater price movement in the past are expected
to continue such movement in the future. The more volatile the stock,
the more expensive the option.
The ways each of these items impact your trading costs follow in this section.
Paying for less liquidity
Although many option contracts are actively traded with high open interest,
the sheer number of contracts available to trade means there will also be
those that have limited daily volume and open interest levels. This results in
a wider spread which translates to higher costs for you.
The spread is the difference between the market bid and the ask. When liquid-
ity is low, the spread widens. Slippage is the trading term associated with
money lost due to the spread. The best way to think about this cost is if you
were to buy on the ask then immediately turn around and sell the option on
the bid you would have a loss. This loss is referred to as slippage.
Lean toward higher open interest contracts with higher volumes when trad-
ing options to reduce the impact of slippage costs. These liquid contracts can
be more easily entered and exited without widening the spread and increas-
ing your costs.
Compensating for time
All option contracts have a time value associated with them. The more time
until the contract expires, the more the option costs. The only problem is,
everyday you own the contract, time to expiration is decreasing as is the
option’s value associated with it. Theta is the measure that provides you with
the estimated value lost on a daily basis and is covered in the section,
“Grasping Key Option Pricing Factors,” later in this chapter.
When first reviewing option chains, be sure to compare options that have the
same strike price but different expiration months to note the cost of time.
Paying for time means you need to consider options that reasonably reflect
potential movement for the underlying. Given the wide range of strike prices
and expiration months available to you, this is certainly possible. 
40
Part I: Getting Started 

Shelling out money for high flyers
Some stocks are more volatile and regularly swing a few percentage points
each month, while other more quiet stocks take a few months for those kinds
of moves. Generally, the cost of time for an option increases if the stock has
proven to be more volatile in the past. 
Valuing options benefits
By keeping the rights associated with a particular option type straight, you
can often figure out a quick estimate of an option’s value from the option’s
strike price and the market price of the stock. The three primary factors for
valuing any stock option include the following:
 The type of option, call or put
 The option strike price
 The price of the underlying stock
Understanding these basic structural valuation features allow you to then
appreciate the limited risk and unlimited reward potential options possess.
Although I reiterate the fact that you can lose your entire option investment,
you have to compare that to the losses accumulated when owning the under-
lying stock. By substantially limiting the investment amount through the
options market you also substantially limit risk.
Stock values and option premiums
You need to consider two things when valuing an option:
 The value of the option rights given the current price of the stock
 The potential for stock movement between now and expiration
Option prices are broken into two pieces: 
 Intrinsic value: The value of the contract rights if the contract is exer-
cised and the resulting position is then exited in the market. With a call
option, this value is the profits realized if you were to exercise the call
then immediately sell the stock. When these two transactions result in a
gain, that gain is the option’s intrinsic value. When there’s a loss, intrin-
sic value equals zero. Intrinsic value is calculated differently for calls
and puts:
Intrinsic Value (Call) = Market price of stock – Option strike price
Intrinsic Value (Put) = Option strike price – Market price of stock
41
Chapter 3: Trading Places: Options for Stocks

 Extrinsic value: The remaining value, which is attributable to time —
this is also known as time value because it adds potential value for the
option based on future moves for the stock. The extrinsic value is what
remains after you account for intrinsic value. To determine the time
value for an option contract, subtract the intrinsic value from the option
price:
Extrinsic Value = Option Price – Intrinsic Value 
An option’s intrinsic value cannot be less than zero. Whenever the calcula-
tion used to determine intrinsic value falls below zero, intrinsic value equals
zero.
Option moneyness
Options are said to have a certain moneyness, which describes relative infor-
mation about the intrinsic value of a contract. The calculation for intrinsic
value can lead to three different results in terms of moneyness:
 In-the-money (ITM) when Intrinsic Value > 0
 At-the-money (ATM) when Intrinsic Value = 0
 Out-of-the-money (OTM) when Intrinsic Value < 0
These three terms are used regardless of whether an option is a call or a put.
Whenever an option is OTM, its market price reflects only time value.
Options that are out-of-the-money (OTM) have only extrinsic value. This is
also referred to as time value.
Leverage with reduced risk
The greatest benefit of trading individual options is the type of leverage you
access. First, consider leverage with the stock market — when buying on
margin you borrow from your broker to buy stock which gives you the oppor-
tunity to own more shares. As you probably know, using leverage this way is
a double-edged sword:
 When using leverage to buy stock you reap additional rewards when the
stock moves in your favor, but 
 You also reap additional losses when the stock goes down. 
Just because your broker is helping finance a stock transaction doesn’t mean
he shares in the losses — those are all yours. On top of that, you still have to
pay the broker’s financing fees in the form of margin interest whether you
have a profit or loss. 
42
Part I: Getting Started 

When you access leverage with an option, you gain control of a certain
number of shares of stock through your rights at a cost that is much, much
lower than purchasing (or selling) those shares outright. This significantly
amplifies gains and losses resulting from the position. 
When using margin to leverage a stock position, both your gains and losses
accelerate. Gains must outpace financing costs in the form of margin interest.
An example of leverage with reduced risk
The best way to get a feel for how to leverage with reduced risk is through an
example. Using stock ABC trading at $43, assume you purchased 100 shares
at this price with a 50% margin position and the stock moves up to $47 in one
month. The value of a $40 strike call option was $4. After the move to $47 the
call will be at least $7 because this represents its intrinsic value.
 Option rights (purchase rights) = $40
 Market value (sale price) = $47
 Call intrinsic value: $47 – 40 = $7
Calculating the returns for the stock using a 50% margin purchase:
 Initial investment: $43 × 100 × 0.50 = $2,150
 Gains: ($47 – 43) × 100 = $400
 Gain as percent of initial investment: $400 ÷ 2,150 = 18.6%
Calculating the returns for the option:
 Initial investment: $4 × 100 = $400
 Gains: ($7 – 4) × 100 = $300
 Gain as percent of initial investment: $300 ÷ 400 = 75%
Both the stock and option position provide you with leverage. Assuming the
stock dropped $4 instead of moving upward and the option lost all its value.
Instead of gains there would be losses of 18.6% and 100%, respectively.
The real power for the leveraged option position is its limited loss nature.
Assuming a third scenario, really bad news is released for the stock and it
dropped $13 instead:
Calculating the losses for the stock using a 50% margin purchase:
 Initial investment: $43 × 100 × 0.50 = $2,150
 Losses: ($43 – 30) × 100 = ($1,300)
 Loss as percent of initial investment: ($1,300) ÷ 2,150 = (60%)
43
Chapter 3: Trading Places: Options for Stocks

Calculating the losses for the option:
 Initial investment: $4 × 100 = $400
 Losses: ($4 – 0) × 100 = ($400)
 Loss as percent of initial investment: ($400) ÷ 400 = (100%)
Although the loss percent is higher for the option, it is capped. The losses
can continue with the stock position and can even generate margin calls
requiring you to deposit additional funds to hold the position.
Grasping Key Option Pricing Factors
Option prices are determined by the type of option (call or put), its strike
price, the price of the underlying stock, and the time remaining to expiration.
Prices are also determined by the volatility of that underlying stock. It turns
out this last pricing component plays a pretty big role in options analysis and
strategy selection.
There are option valuation measures available to you that help you deter-
mine whether an option price quoted in the market represents a reasonable
value or not. The measures provide you with a feel for how decreasing time
or changes in the stock’s price or volatility impact the option’s price. These
measures are available for each individual option and are referred to as the
option because most of their names are derived from Greek letters. 
Introducing option Greeks
An option’s Greeks provide you with the value of expected changes in the
option, given changes in the underlying stock. They are derived from one of
several option valuation models and are available to you from various
sources, such as an option calculator. Most option exchange Web sites pro-
vide this tool. 
Using an option calculator, you enter the price of the underlying stock, the
option strike price, time to expiration, and the option quote. The calculator
then provides each of the Greek values listed. The insight you gain from the
Greeks include the following:
 Delta: Represents the expected change in the option value for each $1
change in the price of the underlying stock.
 Gamma: Represents the expected change in Delta for each $1 change in
the price of the underlying stock.
44
Part I: Getting Started 

 Theta: Represents the option’s expected daily decline due to time.
 Vega: Represents the expected change in the option value due to
changes in volatility expectations for the underlying stock. 
 Rho: Estimates changes in the option value due to changes in the risk-
free interest rate (usually T-bills). Option price changes attributable to inter-
est rates are much smaller, so this last measure receives less coverage.
Option valuation models can be used to determine whether a particular
option is relatively expensive or cheap. A model is best applied when you
understand its assumptions and recognize the Greeks provide expected
values that by no means guarantee the future.
Delta
Delta is probably the most important Greek value for you to initially under-
stand because it connects changes in the underlying stock’s value directly to
changes in the option value. Delta values range from:
 Calls: 0 and 1.00 or 0 and 100
 Puts: 0 and –1.00 or 0 and –100
Gamma
Gamma provides you with the expected change in delta for each $1 change in
the price of the underlying stock. By understanding and checking gamma,
there’s less of a chance that delta values will get away from you.
The delta for an ATM option is approximately +/–0.50 regardless of the stock’s
past volatility. Option valuations assume that there’s a 50% chance the stock
will move up and a 50% chance it will move down. 
Assuming ABC is trading at $20 and moves to $21, Table 3-1 provides option
data before and after the move for a 20 strike call and put:

Connecting past movement to the future
Past movement in the underlying stock is used to determine the probability
that a certain minimum or maximum price will be reached. As you know, past
movement doesn’t provide you with a map of what’s going to happen during
the next month, next week, or even next day, but that doesn’t mean you can’t
look at past movement to evaluate the potential for certain price targets to
be reached. This section takes a look at two key measures that relate past
movement in a stock to movement that is expected in the future.
Historical volatility
Historical volatility (HV) is a measure of past movement in a stock and is 
also referred to as statistical volatility (SV). To calculate HV you must do the
following:
1. Calculate the daily price change over a set number of days.
2. Calculate the average value for price change over that period.
3. Determine how each daily price change compares to that average
value by taking the standard deviation for the price changes in the set.
4. Divide the value in step 3 by 0.0630 to approximate an annualized
standard deviation.
It’s next to impossible to avoid statistical lingo when discussing option valua-
tions. Don’t get hung up on the math — HV is calculated in this manner so
you can make an apples-to-apples comparison of a stock’s most recent move-
ment versus its past movement. It also allows you to compare two different
stocks.
Standard deviation measures how dispersed data is from its average value.
When applying this measure to stocks, those with a higher HV are expected
to make bigger daily moves that are less predictable than those with a
smaller HV. Lower HV stocks have daily changes that stay close to the aver-
age daily change. 
Past stock movement is used as a basis for future expectations. Expected
values don’t use just this information though. Each day news is released that
impacts expectations going forward. This is where implied volatility (IV)
enters the picture. 
Implied volatility
Implied volatility (IV) is one component of an option’s price and is related 
to the time remaining until expiration. On a given day, you can identify as 
follows:
46
Part I: Getting Started 

 Current price for a given stock
 Nature of past movement for the stock
 The type and strike price for a particular option
 The number of days until that option expires
What you don’t know of course is what the stock is going to do between now
and expiration. Don’t let anyone kid you, no one does. However, what every-
one in the market knows, including you, are the previous four things listed. 
IV is based on historical volatility, but there is more to it than just that. It also
incorporates supply and demand pricing pressures for the individual option.
IV is part of the extrinsic value and provides you information about what
market participants expect to see happen in the underlying stock.
The biggest distinction between HV and IV is that there is a specific formula
for HV — it uses past data for the stock. IV is based on this calculation, but is
more abstract and reflects new information about the market. There’s also a
psychological component to IV. A large one-day move in a stock has some
impact on its 100-day HV calculation, but the impact on the option’s IV will
likely be much more pronounced because of the uncertainty this one-day
event brings. 
IV is the volatility implied by the current market price for the option.
Modeling option values
An option pricing model uses stock and option data to provide you with a
theoretical value for the option. A few similar models exist, such as the one
available on the OIC’s Web site (www.optionscentral.com), and you can
access them via an options calculator. By comparing an option’s theoretical
value to its market price, you get a feel for whether the option is relatively
expensive or cheap.
The difference between the option’s model value and actual value reflects the
difference between historical and implied volatility.. An option model incor-
porates historical volatility, while the market value reflects IV. You may be
able to identify a good reason for an option to be expensive or cheap —
expensive isn’t always bad and cheap isn’t always good.
Different historical volatility (HV) values are available using a variety of time
frames and typically include 10-day, 20-day, and 100-day. IV is an option spe-
cific value based on its current price. Both HV and IV values are available to
you from a variety of sources, including option analysis software.
47
Chapter 3: Trading Places: Options for Stocks

There are two ways an option calculator can be used (Figure 3-1 displays an
option pricing calculator with sample inputs):
 Using HV to get the option’s theoretical value
 Using the current market price of the option to get IV
The first option pricing model was developed by Fisher Black and Myron
Scholes, earning them a Nobel Prize in Economics.
An option calculator that uses HV in the volatility field will provide you with
the following when you click Calculate:
 The theoretical value for both the call and put at that strike price
 The theoretical Greeks for both the call and put
Nice, eh? This is good information and you can compare the theoretical price
to the actual price in the market. When first starting out, change-up the
inputs to see how they impact option prices. 
Figure 3-2 displays the option pricing calculator results when you click the
Calculate button.
Now you have a sense of appropriate option prices assuming the stock
moves the way it did in the past. At those prices, you can use the Greeks to
estimate option prices changes based on changes in the underlying or
changes in interest rates.

Something that will actually provide you with better information in terms of
the Greeks though, is to calculate the implied volatility using this feature on
the OIC calculate. Now when you click Calculate you obtain the implied
volatility for the call or put which can be used to get the Greeks expected
when you buy or sell the call and put.
Theoretical option values are based on historical volatility versus actual
option market prices which are based on implied volatility. These values are
compared to artfully determine if future expectations reasonably reflect
what’s happened in the past for the stock. Even when actual prices exceed
model prices, the option may still represent a trading opportunity.

Option Risks and Rewards
In This Chapter
 Recognizing your true stock and option risk
 Maximizing stock and option rewards
 Visualizing stock and option risk and reward
 Introducing combination positions
M
ost traders identify an exit price prior to entering an order for a new
position as part of their risk management. The exit is executed
through an advanced order type or manually by the trader as they monitor
the position. A major problem with this approach is that the stock may gap
down below the exit level at the open creating greater losses. Manual execu-
tion is generally worse because then the trader can rationalize not executing
the exit at all.
The fact of the matter is that the maximum risk for stocks is the entire invest-
ment and more when trading on margin. Stocks get halted or can decline rapidly
and traders can create long-term investments from short-term positions. It’s the
nature of the beast. So when trading stocks or options, you need to acknowl-
edge the true risk for these securities. This chapter looks at both risk and
reward for stocks and options by identifying them, then quantifying them.
Understanding Your Trading Risks
Risk is related to reward, but it is possible to be subject to more risk given
the same reward potential. It depends on the risk characteristics of the secu-
rity you trade. Understanding your risk means you know the following:
 The maximum loss possible
 The conditions that create this maximum loss
Knowing your risk comes before knowing your reward potential and manag-
ing your risk comes way, way before thinking about what you can do with
those gains. 

Risk includes both the potential for losses as well as the lack of gains. In the
latter case, investments that don’t keep up with rising costs of living may be
depleted.
Risking money with stocks 
I recently heard a trader mention that as soon as they put money into a stock
trade, they assume their maximum allowed risk for that trade is the entire
investment, acknowledging the fact that the entire position can go to zero
before he can respond. Although you may use stops to reduce your perceived
maximum risk, the truth of the matter is the entire position has the potential
for loss. 
Long stock
There are two ways for you to establish a long stock position:
 Purchasing the stock with 100% cash
 Purchasing the stock on margin with 50% cash
Although you can limit the amount of margin used to some number below
50%, this is the maximum amount allowed for an initial position and a good
place to start.
When buying stock ABC at a 32, it can move up, down, or sideways the next
day. Losses accrue with continued downward moves. Usually stocks vacillate
up and down, but it is possible for you to get in on a really bad day when the
ABC experiences only declines going forward. Or worse yet, it is possible for
ABC to stop trading, preventing you from exiting at any level. 
Although you will likely exit at some point, the fact remains that when pur-
chasing a stock with 100% cash, the stock can move downward to zero result-
ing in a complete loss of your investment. So the maximum risk you have
when buying a stock is:
# of Shares × Price of Stock = Risk
Purchasing a stock on margin provides you with leverage, allowing you to
own more stock for a set initial investment. This magnifies both gains and
losses and is often referred to as a double-edged sword.
Assuming you purchased ABC on margin rather than using 100% cash, your
risk increases by 1 divided by the initial margin percentage or 1 / 0.50 = 2.
Welcome to leverage.
52
Part I: Getting Started 

To calculate your maximum risk when buying stock on margin, you can start
by multiplying the initial investment by 1 divided by the initial margin per-
centage. You need to also add the cost of using margin which is the margin
interest rate for the stock holding period.
The maximum risk you have when buying a stock using 50% margin is:
Risk = (# of Shares × Price of Stock) × (1 ÷ Initial Margin %)
Use of margin to purchase stocks must consider the downside for the strategy.
Short stock
When you short a stock you reverse the order of the typical stock transac-
tion. Rather than buying first and selling later, you sell first and buy the stock
at a later point. You still want to buy low and sell high, but a bearish outlook
for a particular stock means you have to sell first to capitalize on this view.
To sell a stock you don’t own, you need to borrow the shares from your
broker. If the stock is a popular one to short, shares may or may not be avail-
able to you. You need to check your broker’s short sale list or contact them
directly to determine this. Traders using brokers that specialize in active
trading accounts will likely find it to be less of a problem for them.
When completing brokerage account paperwork you may be providing them
with authorization to lend out shares in your account which are then made
available to short sellers.
You can only hold a short stock position in a margin account — short selling
stock is not allowed in retirement accounts such as Individual Retirement
Arrangements (IRAs). Although a credit is received for the sale of stock, a
150% margin is required to establish the position. This basically translates to
a 50% margin after deducting the initial credit you receive for the sale.
Where does that put you in terms of risk? In a position that is very high risk.
There is no limit to how high a stock can move upward; shorting a stock is an
unlimited risk strategy. Granted you can buy back a stock before it goes to
infinity and beyond, but in the same way a stock can gap down, it can gap up.
Consider how many short positions feel pain after an intra-meeting Fed rate
cut occurs.
Long stock represents a limited, but high risk position. It is limited because a
stock can only move down to zero, it can’t trade below that. The risk remains
high because a stock can do just that — move to zero. This risk increases
when margin is used and creates a situation where you can lose more than
your initial investment.
53
Chapter 4: Option Risks and Rewards

Calculating option risks
Both call and put options have risk that is limited to the initial investment.
This initial investment can vary in size, but is less than the investment
required to control the same number of shares of the underlying stock.
Although the risk is relatively smaller in terms of dollars, it’s important to
recognize the likelihood that an option will go to zero is much higher than the
underlying stock going to zero.
The chance that an option will go to zero is 100%. Remember an option is a
limited life security that eventually expires. At expiration, the option value
goes to zero.
Call option
A call option provides the buyer with rights to purchase the underlying stock
at the contract’s strike price by its expiration date. When the strike price for
the call option is below the price for the underlying stock, it will lose time
value as expiration nears. Assuming the stock remains at the same price
level, this time decay can result in losses for the trader. The losses will be
limited because the option retains its intrinsic value.
However, when the stock is trading below the strike price the option’s value
is all time value. Assuming the stock remains at the same price level, time
value diminishes as you get closer to expiration. Continuing in this manner
will result in a total loss of the initial investment.
Most of the time a stock doesn’t stand still, it does that vacillation thing. That
means that although there’s a chance the underlying stock will increase in
value rising above a call strike price, the stock may also decline in value and
fall below the strike price. Once again that puts you in a situation where you
can lose your entire investment as expiration nears.
Put option
A put option provides the buyer with rights to sell the underlying stock at the
contract’s strike price by its expiration date. The option will lose time value
as expiration nears, which can result in losses for the trader when the stock
is trading above the option strike price. When trading below the strike price,
the losses will be limited because the option retains intrinsic value.
However, when the stock is trading above the strike price the option’s value
is all time value. Assuming the stock remains at the same price level, time
value diminishes as you get closer to expiration. Continuing in this manner
will result in a total loss of the initial investment.
Because the stock has the same chance of rising as falling, there’s a chance
the underlying stock will increase in value rising above a put strike price. As
a result, you can lose your entire investment as expiration nears.
54
Part I: Getting Started 

Reaping Your Rewards
So with all this stock and option risk, just why do you do it? Because the
interest you receive on a regular money market account can often be below
the rate of inflation, the only way for your savings to keep up or outpace your
expenses in the future is by assuming this risk. You should expect rewards
that are better than a money market rate. Both stocks and options provide
this potential.
Benefiting from stocks
As a stock holder you can benefit by receiving dividends and/or gains in the
price of the stock. This often results when a company’s sales or profits
increase, when new products or technologies are introduced, and other
countless reasons. There are also approaches that allow you to benefit from
downward moves in the stock.
Long stock
A long stock position by purchasing shares of stock in the market. Because
stock can continue to exist indefinitely, it can continue to rise without limit.
What ultimately happens is a function of the company prospects and general
market conditions. So your potential reward with stock is unlimited.
Not all companies distribute profits in the form of dividends to stock holders.
Many growth stocks retain profits to fuel continued growth.
Short stock
You create a short stock position by reversing the standard stock transac-
tion; you sell first with the expectations that the price of the stock will go
down. In this situation you profit when you buy the shares back. You com-
plete such transactions in a brokerage account that allows margin trading.
The rewards you reap for a short stock position is similar to the risks
assumed for a long stock position — it is high, but limited. A stock can con-
tinue to decline, but only until it reaches zero. This is the downside limit that
caps your rewards. 
Call options increase in value when the underlying stock rises while put
options increase in value when the underlying stock falls.
55
Chapter 4: Option Risks and Rewards

Breaking even with options
A call option provides you with similar profits as long stock while a put
option provides you with similar profits as short stock. This makes sense
given your rights as an option holder it allows you to buy or sell stock at a
set level. There is one slight difference between stock rewards and option
rewards; options require an initial premium payment that you must consider
when identifying potential gains.
Calculating potential option rewards requires you to add option premiums to
call strike prices and subtract option premiums from put strike prices to
come up with a price known as the position’s breakeven level. A stock must:
 Rise above the breakeven for call option profits to kick in
 Fall below the breakeven for put option profits to kick in
In each case, this results in profits that are slightly less than your stock 
profits.
A stock’s breakeven point is your purchase price when buying stock or your
sell price when shorting a stock. As soon as the stock moves away from this
price, you have gains or losses.
Call option
Purchasing a call option gives you rights to buy stock at a certain level. As a
result, the option increases in value when the stock moves upward. After a
stock moves above your call option’s strike price, the option has intrinsic
value which increases as the stock continues to rise. Calls with strike prices
below the price of the stock are referred to as in-the-money (ITM).
For a call position you own to be profitable at expiration, it must remain
above the strike price plus your initial investment. At this level option premi-
ums will minimally equal your cost when you bought the call.
The breakeven for a call option is:
Call Breakeven = Call Strike Price + Call Purchase Premium
After a stock is at the option’s breakeven level, it can continue to rise indefi-
nitely. Your call option can similarly rise indefinitely until expiration. As a
result, call option profits are considered to be unlimited, just like stock.
56
Part I: Getting Started 

An option’s moneyness is determined by the option type and the price of the
underlying stock relative to the option strike price. Call option’s with a strike
price that is below the stock price is out-of-the-money (OTM) and its pre-
mium is all time value. After the stock moves above the strike price, it is
referred to as in-the-money (ITM) and has intrinsic value along with the time
value.
Put option
Purchasing a put option gives you rights to sell stock at a certain level. As a
result, the option increases in value when the stock moves downward. When
a stock moves below your put option’s strike price, the option has intrinsic
value which increases as the stock continues to fall. Puts with strike prices
above the price of the stock are referred to as in-the-money (ITM).
For a put position you own to be profitable at expiration, it must remain
below the strike price minus your initial investment. At this level option pre-
miums will minimally equal your cost when you bought the put.
The breakeven for a put option is:
Put Breakeven = Put Strike Price – Put Purchase Premium
When a stock is at the option’s breakeven level, it can continue to fall until it
reaches zero. Your put option can continue to increase in value until this
level is reached, all the way to its expiration. As a result, put option profits
are considered to be high, but limited, just like a short stock.
Call options have risks and rewards similar to long stock while put options
have rewards that are similar to short stock. Put option risk is limited to the
initial investment. The reason your rewards are similar rather than the same
is because you need to account for the premium amount when you pur-
chased the option.
Profiling Risk and Reward
Profiling risk and reward means you’re using a visual to get a feel for potential
gains and losses for the trade. By doing this you can quickly assess strategies
you already trade as well as new ones. Risk graphs or risk profiles are graphi-
cal views of potential risks and rewards in option trading. You can create a
generic graph that excludes prices to identify the risks and rewards for any
asset type. In addition, you can also create a more specific risk graph that
includes stock price levels, with breakeven levels, profits, and losses for a
particular position. 
57
Chapter 4: Option Risks and Rewards

Profiling stock trades with risk graphs
Although risk graphs are more commonly used in option trading, it’s impor-
tant for you to get a good picture of stock risk graphs. Such basic profiles
simply look at maximum potential risks and maximum potential rewards.
Long stock
The maximum potential risk for long stock is high, but limited to the down-
side. This is because a stock can only decline to zero. The maximum poten-
tial rewards for a stock position is unlimited because a stock can technically
rise without limit.
The long stock risk graph displayed in Figure 4-1 reflects this risk-reward 
profile.
By profiling the risks and rewards this way for long stock, you quickly see
that losses (which are limited to the initial investment amount) accumulate
as the stock price declines while profits continue to rise as the stock price
rises.
Short stock
The maximum potential risk for short stock is unlimited because a stock can
technically rise without limit. The maximum potential reward for a short
stock position is high, but limited to the downside. This is because a stock
can only decline to zero.
The short stock risk graph displayed in Figure 4-2 reflects this risk-reward
profile.
Figure 4-1:
Risk graph
for a long
stock
position.
58
Part I: Getting Started 

The short stock risk graph quickly displays losses that rise without limit as
the stock rises and profits that are high, but limited as the stock declines.
Profiling option trades with risk graphs
Basic call and put option risk graphs incorporate the risk and reward for the
security, along with the breakeven level. Position specific profiles will include
stock prices on the x-axis and profits/losses on the y-axis. The profile also
identifies the following:
 The option strike price
 The position breakeven
Although it’s less obvious when you’re viewing generic risk profiles, the main
benefit of using options to limit losses can be viewed in these risk graphs.
Call option
A basic call option risk graph is similar to a long stock risk graph with two
distinctions:
 You need to account for the call option premium in the breakeven level.
 Your losses are capped to the downside before a stock declines to zero.
The potential risk for a call option is limited while the potential rewards are
unlimited. This is displayed by a generic call option risk graph displayed in
Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-2:
Risk graph
for a short
stock
position.
59
Chapter 4: Option Risks and Rewards

The call option risk graph provides you a visual of losses that are limited to
the initial investment as the stock declines. This amount is much smaller
than those for a long stock position. It allows unlimited profits that are simi-
lar to a long stock position, but must also account for the call option
breakeven level.
Put option
A basic put option risk graph is similar to a short stock risk graph with a
couple of distinctions. The second one is extremely valuable if you’re bearish
on a stock:
 You need to account for the put option premium in the breakeven level.
 Your losses are capped with an upside move and are therefore limited.
The potential risk for a put option is limited while the potential rewards are
limited, but high. This is displayed by a generic put option risk graph dis-
played in Figure 4-4.

Part I: Getting Started 

The put option risk graph provides you a visual of losses that are limited to
the initial investment as the stock rises. As a trader, you have to prefer this
graph to the short stock profile. It also provides profits that are similar to a
short stock position which are high, but limited. The put risk graph also
accounts for the put option breakeven level.
When you buy a put option, the most you can lose is this initial investment.
Although that’s pretty undesirable, you need to remember that this initial
investment is much smaller than a short stock position which is also used
when you have a bearish outlook for the stock.
Combining option positions
Many investors use put options as a form of insurance for existing stock posi-
tions. You can buy puts for stocks you own, as well as for those you don’t own
because holding the underlying asset is not a requirement in the listed option
markets. 
A combined position is one that is made up of one of two things:
 Stock and options for a single underlying stock
 Multiple options for a single underlying stock
In addition to creating a risk graph for a single stock or option position, you
can also create ones for combined positions. This definitely helps you easily
access the reward profile for the position and more importantly, its risk profile.
Trading options with stock
Three basic combination positions for long stock and options include the 
following:
 A married put position
 A covered call position
 A collar position
In each case long stock is paired with a long put, a short call, or both to
improve the risk and/or reward potential. Similar combination positions can
be applied to a short stock position.
61
Chapter 4: Option Risks and Rewards

You can hold a stock position and purchase options on that same stock to
change the risk or reward profile for the stock or you can hold option posi-
tions without holding a position in the underlying.
Trading options with options
There are many combination positions that use multiple options to capitalize
on market conditions or improve the risk and/or reward potential. Different
market conditions include:
 High relative volatility
 Low relative volatility
 Sideways stock movement
 Directional stock movement (up or down)
After a market outlook is identified, different strike prices and options can be
combined to vary risk and reward. 
Profiling a combined position
You can draw risk graphs for combination positions by drawing the risk
graph for each individual position and overlaying them. You then check to
see if the risks or rewards for any one position provide a cap for the unlim-
ited or limited, but high risks or rewards for the other position. 
This is better understood through example. Figure 4-5 displays the risk graph
for a married put position, one that combines long stock and a long put for
the same stock. 
Figure 4-5:
Risk graph

position.

Part I: Getting Started 

In this figure, you create a risk-reward profile that is similar to a long call. By
adding the put, you minimize losses for the stock. At the same time, your
potential rewards remain unlimited after accounting for the new breakeven
point.
Considering the worst-case scenario
Before looking at your potential gains, you must look at the downside if you
want to continue trading for any extended period of time. By managing your
risk, you stay in the game long enough to master different strategies that are
appropriate for changing market conditions. That’s why considering the
worst-case scenario is so important — these worst-case scenarios can and
will happen during your trading career.
All new traders assume they’ll do the right thing when the time comes — exit
a position when their predetermined exit level is reached. But after you’ve
been trading awhile you know how hard this seemingly simple action can be.
Never assume you will completely control the emotions you experience when
trading. The best traders know that all they can do is manage them.
Start with single position risk graphs
Looking at the worst-case scenario means looking at the lower portion of the
risk graph; the one that profiles your losses. After you have a certain stock or
market outlook, you can select the position or strategy (i.e. long stock or long
call option) that has the most desirable risk graph.
Look to trade strategies that do the following:
 Limit losses
 Allow unlimited profits
In Chapter 10 I discuss more specific position risk graphs that will make this
more intuitive for you.
Improve existing risk graphs
There’s a lot more to cover before exploring advanced strategies using com-
bination positions with just options. Throughout the strategy review process,
consider those option additions that improve the risk profile first. This can
be done by:
 Capping losses that are limited but high and even better,
 Capping losses that are unlimited.
By managing your risk first, you get the opportunity to realize gains.

In this part . . .
T
rading options doesn’t begin by running out to buy a
call or put. It’s the culmination of your analysis on the
markets, sectors, and the underlying security for your
trade. This part provides market assessment methods
using breadth and sentiment analysis then moves on to
technical analysis of sectors. It also incorporates the
options market in this analysis. Because you may be
exploring new strategies, you also want to evaluate those
strategies in a systematic way to reinforce your under-
standing of them while also addressing the unique
characteristics of options, such as trading costs and order
placement methods, which I provide in this part.

Tapping Into the Market’s Mood
In This Chapter
 Digging deeper into market results
 Using option activity to determine market mood
 Assessing indicator levels
U
sing breadth tools and sentiment analysis, you gain insight on the
strength of a market move and the level of fear or complacency driving
it. By looking at statistics such as volume and the number of advancing versus
declining stocks, you know whether gains were due to just a handful of stocks
or if a large number of them fueled the advance. The latter suggests continued
strength while the former may be a warning sign of weakness ahead.
The options market can also be used to gauge the health of a stock market
move. Monitoring option activity gives you a sense of the degree of fear or
greed associated with an advance or decline. It helps you decide whether the
trend has more room to go or may be stalled in the near future. 
The name of the game with many sentiment analysis tools is extremes. Using
past data to identify atypical readings, you can identify levels associated with
unsustainable advances or declines. In this chapter, I sort through the differ-
ent ways you can monitor the market to help make better trading decisions.
Assessing the Market’s Bias
The stock market has a mind of its own and it pays to remember that . . .
especially when you think you have the next move figured out. You might
expect a decline when weak economic numbers are released only to be sur-
prised by the rally that follows. Or you expect to see a boring day after a prof-
itable earnings report is released, and then your jaw drops with the ensuing
decline that’s attributed to this news. When following market breadth and
sentiment data, you get a sense of the market’s mood before these seemingly
crazy swings — they alert you to pending changes.

Judging the strength of a move
All market advances and declines are not the same. Advances can occur at a
moderate pace with lots of sectors rising together, in a frenzied manner with
some stocks and sectors strongly outperforming others, or any variation in
between. What you want to do is assess the odds of that advance continuing.
It’s similar for declines — you want to keep the odds in your favor by trading
in the direction of the trend, but it’s hard to create new positions when you
feel you may have already missed the move. Looking at market breadth helps
you decide whether conditions are improving or there’s more room on the
downside.
Keep the odds in your favor by using a variety of tools to confirm your
market assessments, and then use strategies consistent with such 
assessments. 
Defining market breadth
Market breadth focuses on the nature of market rises and declines. By moni-
toring the number of advancing versus declining stocks for a specific index
you can gauge the health of the move for that index. During rising markets,
you want to see a variety of companies participating in the advance. On
declines you look for signs that there’s so much participation the bear
exhausts itself.
Breadth indicators use statistics based on the following:
 Number and volume for advancing and declining issues
 Number of issues reaching new highs or lows
 Up and down volume
 Issues trading above or below moving average lines
An advancing market with declining stocks outpacing advancing stocks in
both number and volume is bearish — it suggests that a select group of
stocks may be doing well, but overall the market is not healthy. On the other
hand, market advances accompanied by stocks in a variety of sectors trading
above their 200-day moving average is more bullish suggesting a healthy rise
that will likely continue.
The advance-decline line breadth indicator
A commonly used breadth indicator is the advance-decline (Adv-Dec) line
using the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite Index. You won’t be
looking for a specific bullish or bearish level for this indicator — you use it
more as a confirming or diverging tool. You construct the line by keeping a
daily cumulative total of:
68
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

Adv-Dec Line = # of Advancing Issues – # of Declining Issues
You may note an index is rising even when the Adv-Dec Line is falling. This
happens when:
 Component stocks with more influence on the index increase even if a
majority of the component stocks decrease
 A smaller number of stocks advance, but the value of gains from advanc-
ing stocks is greater than the value of losses from decliners. 
The number of unchanged issues are excluded from this indicator. When
using the tool, focus on trends rather than absolute values for this tool.
Figure 5-1 displays the daily Adv-Dec Line with the NYSE Composite
Index (NYA).
From June to mid-July in 2007 NYA was rising, but this move was not con-
firmed by a large number of advancing issues. The Adv-Dec Line was diverg-
ing from NYA, which eventually suffered some serious declines.
Figure 5-1:
Daily Adv-
Dec line
with two
EMAs and
NYA
overlay.
69
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

Calculating the advance-decline line as a ratio
The Adv-Dec line may also be calculated as a ratio rather than a cumulative
value (Adv/Dec). This results in an oscillating indicator with the following
characteristics:
 Oscillates around the value one.
 When there are more advancers, the ratio is greater than one (more
common).
 When there are more decliners, the ratio moves between zero and one.
Oscillator crosses of the center line, divergent movement, or movement into
extreme ranges are monitored for potential turns.
When an indicator suggests weakness as a stock or index is moving upward
or strength when either is moving downward, the indicator is diverging from
the price or index level.
Adv-Dec indicators can be calculated on any index that provides daily
advancing and declining statistics. When monitoring the Adv-Dec line, look
for advancers to outpace decliners in rising markets and decliners to outpace
advancers in falling markets to confirm index changes. When the indicator
diverges from index action, the current trend may be in trouble.
Recognize that contrarian strategies are those that are counter to existing
market trends. These represent higher risk trades because they anticipate a
change in momentum and direction.
Adding volume as a key tool
Volume is a key tool used in market analysis — it provides fuel for upside
moves and animates fear as declines pick up steam. Increasing volume con-
firms the current trend. Without it, the move becomes very suspect. 
Splitting volume by movement type allows you to incorporate it into breadth
analysis. During a bullish move you see whether a handful of advancers are
leading the way with strong participation or if interest in even these popular
shares is tapering off. It lets you know if the trend is in good shape or if you
should start looking for other signs of weakness.
When markets are moving downward, the volume for declining issues is like a
panic meter. You can practically see traders scrambling to hit the Enter
button for sell orders. But then a funny thing happens . . . the decline contin-
ues, but there is a shift in these two volume components. Advancing volume
starts to pick up, particularly for the favored stocks of the day. 
70
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

Viewing advancing and declining volume separately provides one picture of
market strength, but they can also be combined as ratios with the number of
advancing and declining issues to display overall market breadth. The result
is in interesting battle between the bulls and the bears. A breadth indicator
using all this information is the Trader’s Short-Term Index described next. 
If you have easy access to index component quote lists, you can create
advance-decline indicators for the index.
Measuring breadth with the Arms Index
The Arms Index, also known as the Trader’s Short-Term Index (TRIN), is a
widely used breadth indicator developed by Richard Arms, Jr. Incorporating
volume provides additional insight about the strength of a market move.
Calculating the Arms Index is pretty straightforward: 
[# of Advancing Issues ÷ # of Declining Issues] ÷ (Advancing Volume ÷
Declining Volume]
Once again the NYSE Composite Index is used; however readings for the
Nasdaq Composite Index and AMEX Composite Index are also available. A
daily close of 1.0 is neutral, although daily readings between 0.70 and 1.30
could be classified as neutral. 
The Arms Index is primarily used for short-term alerts and trend indications,
but it can also be used to assess the market. This is definitely one of those
indicators that you should look at past data to help in understanding its
movement. Be sure to include an overlay chart of the index to get the most
out of the review. 
Checking out an Arms chart
Arms noted that adding moving averages (MAs) to the indicator helped with
market assessments. By also highlighting key levels with horizontal lines
showing neutral areas and extremes, your analysis is more complete. It
makes for a pretty ugly chart at first, but speeds up things in the long run.
For more information on chart scaling and MA techniques used here, see
Chapter 6.
Figure 5-2 provides a daily chart for the Arms Index (light, thin line) with NYA
(dark, thick line) as an overlay. The Arms Index (TRIN) is shown as an
inverted, log chart. Inverting it allows extremely high readings (bearish) to
spike downward as the NYA sells off. A log scale displays relative readings
more clearly. The chart also includes a 21-day EMA (lighter) and 55-day EMA
(darker), as well as the following horizontal lines displaying key levels: 
71
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

 1.0 (dark, solid line) designates a neutral area for the index.
 0.70 designates an extreme daily reading that generally indicates a lower
opening the next day (values less than 0.70 which are above the line).
 1.30 designates an extreme daily reading that generally indicates a
higher opening the next day (values more than 1.30 which are below the
line).
 2.85 designates an extremely bearish day.
 1.10 designates oversold conditions for the EMAs.
The TRIN chart displayed in Figure 5-2 coincided with a strong decline in the
fall of 2007. Note the movement of the MAs. 
Taking a long-term look back
When viewing past conditions to gain insight on the here and now, it also
pays to look further back at periods resembling the current one. As of late
2007 a long-term bull market is in place, so you want to compare the current
situation to two types of mature bull trends:
 One associated with continued bullish conditions (late 1998)
 One signaling a major trend change (early 2000)

Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

Regardless of the different scenarios you consider, focus on managing risk for
existing conditions rather than betting on an anticipated move. Breadth indi-
cators are extremely useful in identifying bottoms because market declines
occur much faster. But there are no guarantees for a reversal.
(Psycho)-analyzing the market
Embracing the idea that the market has a mind of its own is easier when you
consider that human behavior drives it. Some argue the market is efficient
because people respond rationally to all available news about stocks, the
economy, and prospects for both. That sounds great, but all you have to do is
watch the way an index moves after big reports are released and you get the
feeling that something very irrational is going on. 
There are many rules-based approaches allowing you to make money in the
markets, but that doesn’t mean the market moves in a predictable way.
Because buying and selling securities translates to making or losing money,
you have to figure that market participants bring a good amount of irrational-
ity to the game. Multiply one irrational person by many irrational people and
you have a crowd moving prices up or down, quickly or slowly, depending on
the day. 
Crowds can behave in very strange ways when feeding on each other’s greed
or fear. There are ways to monitor market conditions and crowd behavior to
better understand why the market reacts the way it does. One helpful step in
this process is identifying which human emotion is in command at the time:
greed or fear.
Defining sentiment
Sentiment broadly describes the overriding bias for the market, be it bullish
or bearish. Greed (with a touch of fear) generally drives the former while it’s
all about fear when markets decline. Month after month, year after year, and
decade after decade, these greed-fear patterns repeat regardless of economic
changes that occur along the way. 
Sentiment tools use stock and options statistics to provide you with informa-
tion about crowd activity during advances and declines. Most of this data is
available from exchange Web sites or charting packages. It’s a matter of iden-
tifying which tools to monitor along the way. 
When employing sentiment analysis, you try to identify periods when greed
has gotten unsustainable or fear is just about exhausted. It’s sort of like musi-
cal chairs . . . at some point the music stops and everyone is scrambling for a
spot so they can participate in the next round or move. You just want to be
prepared so that you can respond quickly when a change in direction does
take place. Focusing on market sentiment may allow you to do just that.
73
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

Always remind yourself of what is happening in the market versus what you
anticipate happening next.
Measuring investor actions 
Sentiment analysis attempts to measure bullish and bearish actions versus
what’s being said about the market or even it’s current direction. Watch for
things, such as the following:
 Bullish commentary contradicted by unusually high put volume
 A mild economic report that produces a wild swing in the market 
The options market gives you quick indications about trader sentiment:
 Are traders bullish (buying calls/selling puts)?
 Are they bearish (buying puts/selling calls)?
Option data primarily provides insight to fear. Historical volatility and
volume measures give you a feel for how much emotion was involved with
moves in the past. Implied volatility levels let you know what’s anticipated
for the road ahead. 
Watching Call and Put Activity
Investors are generally bullish. Because the markets spend more time going
up rather than down, this is a pretty rational result. Wait a minute . . . does
that mean I think investors are rational? I guess they are at times, but I
digress. The reason it pays to note market bullishness is because typically
call volume exceeds put volume, reflecting the tendency for the market to
advance. It provides you with an option activity baseline.
When people start getting nervous, as they will do, put volume increases.
Monitoring the put-to-call relationship, you can identify extreme levels corre-
sponding with market reversals. Indicators may use call and put volume, or
put volume alone, to measure fear or complacency in the market.
Consider using extreme sentiment readings to reduce positions in the direc-
tion of the trend and slowly establish counter-trend positions. 
74
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

Understanding put-to-call ratios
Martin Zweig is credited with creating put-to-call (P:C) ratios, deriving them
by simply dividing put contract volume by call contract volume. A wide vari-
ety of such ratios are available to you. Alert levels have changed over the
years, but the emotion they signal remains the same: fear.
A P:C ratio focuses on bullish and bearish action taken by various market
participants. Many are also contrarian measures, meaning the implications
for the indicator are opposite of market sentiment. When everyone is exces-
sively bearish, conditions are right for a reversal. And when everyone is exu-
berant about market prospects, signs of a pending decline are overlooked.
You interpret P:C ratio readings the following way:
 Extremely low readings are bearish.
 Extremely high readings are bullish.
Now for the good stuff. A select list of ratios using call and put volume follow,
with information about the indicator construction and readings:
 CBOE equity put/call ratio: Total volume for all stock options trading on
the CBOE. Readings from the former option volume leader are now less
comprehensive given significant gains from the International Securities
Exchange (ISE). In the past readings above 0.90 suggested increased fear
in the market and oversold conditions. More recently readings above
0.80 reflect growing fear.
 CBOE index only put/call ratio: Total volume for all index options trad-
ing on the CBOE. This measure includes SPX and OEX index volume
which remain important market barometers. A distinct aspect of this
indicator is the type of trader it reflects — the index options trader is
considered more sophisticated and on target with market moves. As a
result, high readings reflect pending bearishness for the market.
Readings above 2.4 reflect approximately three standard deviations (SD)
above the mean and have occurred immediately before short-term and
intermediate term tops.
Drops in the market typically happen faster than increases.
 ISE Sentiment Index (ISEE): This tool is actually a call:put ratio with two
other important distinctions noted by the ISE: 
• It focuses on new buys only, versus total volume which reflects
short sellers too. 
• It excludes market maker and other professional trader activities,
leaving customer activity only (money managers and retail).
75
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

Because this index is an inverse of the typical ratios, low readings coincide
with extreme bearishness. Since 2002, readings less than 85 are 2SD below the
average and have coincided with short-term and intermediate term bottoms.
 ISE index and ETF put/call ratio: Total volume for all index and ETF
options trading on the ISE. Consider augmenting the CBOE index-only ratio
with this tool to round out your assessment of broad hedging activity.
Three keys to getting the most from all these sentiment tools are
 Knowing basic indicator construction information 
 Understanding the historical extremes and implications for the tool
 Recognizing significant market changes and impact on indicator data
If you’re zeroing in on the sentiment for individual security, be sure to cap-
ture the data from all exchanges that trade options for that underlying.
Rather than a specific reading, identify atypical readings for the data by cal-
culating the average value and standard deviations, then add lines to identify
extreme levels. 
Certain ETF and index options trade past 4:00 p.m. eastern time — be sure to
track the correct closing time and price.
Figure 5-3 provides a daily chart for the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY)
and its put/call ratio with a five-day moving average and a +1SD line.
Figure 5-3:
Daily SPY
chart with
P:C ratio.
76
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

When the 5-day simple MA for the SPY put:call ratio reached more than +1SD,
a near term bottom was signaled six of eight times.
Indicators may behave differently during bull and bear markets and even
during different stages of bull or bear markets (early, mid, late). When using a
new indicator, check its performance during similar periods in the past. 
You can also use these SD lines when identifying extremes for exchange data,
particularly when market changes impact volume.
Using the put volume indicator 
The put volume indicator (PVI) is a sentiment tool created by John Bollinger
that measures relative put activity levels. It’s similar to a P:C ratio with
extreme readings used to identify periods of excessive fear or complacency.
PVI can also be applied to individual stocks, indexes, or an entire exchange. 
The PVI is calculated using daily put option volume data which is available
from a number of sources, including the OCC and options analysis software.
It’s calculated by dividing daily put volume by the 10-day simple moving aver-
age (SMA) of that volume. A rising ratio indicates the following:
 Put volume is increasing
 Bearish sentiment is increasing
Figure 5-4 displays a daily chart of PVI values for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) with
an overlay of SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the index. Very
high readings identify extreme pessimism which sets the tone for a reversal.
Figure 5-4:
Put volume
indicator.
77
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

The chart includes the following:
 Daily price data for SPY
 PVI line across the bottom
 Central mean line at approximately 1.0
 +2SD line above the mean at 1.80 & -1SD line below it at 0.60
The vertical lines help view bearish extremes. Four of six of these extremes
coincided with, or occurred shortly before, a bottom reversal in the market. 
If you have data to create a put to call ratio, you can also create the PVI.
Using Volatility to Measure Fear
Market participants generally head for the exit much faster than committing
new money to stock positions. The result . . . markets generally fall much
faster than they rise. This can be seen with increased volatility as daily and
weekly swings move in a larger range. Using volatility sentiment measures
helps you recognize declines that are nearing exhaustion.
Measuring volatility
Volatility really just gives you information about the price range for a particu-
lar security. You can use a variety of trading periods to calculate an annual-
ized value allowing you to compare movement for different securities.
Historical volatility (HV) can be plotted on a chart enabling you to view
trends and gain a sense of how current HV stacks up to previous periods.
Implied volatility (IV) is an option pricing component that is referred to as a
plug figure. It’s the volatility level that accounts for the current option price
after all other, more tangible pricing factors (i.e. price, time and interest
rates) are valued. IV incorporates HV because it’s reasonable to expect the
stock to move in a similar manner than it has in the past, but not necessarily
the same. 
IV can also be plotted on a chart allowing you to view trends and relative
levels. Such charts highlight strong seasonal tendencies for certain stocks. 
78
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

Recognizing impact from changing 
volatility
You want to understand IV so you can make the best decisions when buying
and selling options. It can be advantageous to buy options when IV is rela-
tively low and sell them when it’s relatively high, but there are no guarantees
that seemingly low or high conditions won’t persist. 
Clearly there’s always a chance of being wrong about the direction of an
index or stock (two out of three really), but generally:
 When IV is relatively low and increases quickly, it adds value to both
calls and puts.
 When IV is relatively high and decreases quickly, it decreases value for
both calls and puts.
Pending news and reports, along with unexpected events can spike IV. After
the news or event is in the past and an initial reaction occurs in the stock, IV
declines as quickly as it spiked. Changes in IV that are more gradual may also
occur, in either direction.
Spelling fear the Wall Street way: V-I-X
VIX stands for volatility index. It is a blended implied volatility value calcu-
lated using specific S&P 500 Index option contracts and is used as a senti-
ment indicator. You may have heard references to the VIX by market analysts
commenting on conditions.
Because statistical volatility usually climbs when securities decline, you
should expect IV to increase too. By viewing the VIX and SPX on the same
chart, you can see just how often it does. The following holds for VIX readings:
 A climbing VIX reflects bearish conditions in SPX and typically the
market as a whole.
 A declining VIX reflects neutral to bullish conditions in SPX and typically
the market as a whole.
Overly bearish sentiment is reflected by high VIX levels. Eventually the 
bearish fear is exhausted, a reversal in stocks occur, and the VIX declines.
The Volatility Index (VIX) was previously calculated using the S&P 100 (OEX)
Index. This former VIX measure can be accessed using its new symbol: VXO.
Figure 5-5 displays a weekly chart for VIX with an SPX overlay.
79
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

The relationship between the two indexes appears pretty strong when
viewed together. The two are negatively correlated so when SPX goes down,
VIX goes up and vice versa. Look for VIX reversals to confirm market bot-
toms.
Two other stock indexes with implied volatility data to watch include the
Nasdaq Composite Index (COMPQ) and the S&P 100 Index (OEX). The corre-
sponding volatility indexes are VXN and VXO, respectively.
When viewing a chart for the Volatility Index (VIX), readings prior to the
revised S&P 500 (SPX) methodology are constructed using historic data. 
Applying Breadth and Sentiment Tools
Most breadth and sentiment indicators make use of the same logic:
 Weakness in the reading is a bearish sign.
 When the reading is extremely bearish, it becomes bullish.
Figure 5-5:
Weekly VIX
chart with
SPX overlay.

Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

And thus goes the behavior of the crowd. The only notable exception is the
CBOE index only P:C ratio. Because exchanges, trading platforms, and market
products can potentially change over time, the nature of extremes for differ-
ent indicators can also potentially change over time. Rather than using set-in-
stone values for any one of them, you may want to combine a qualitative and
quantitative assessment of them periodically.
When evaluating different breadth and sentiment tools, be sure to consider
which indicators provide you with new information. It makes sense to include
two or three option sentiment tools, but probably not five or six if that’s the
only type of sentiment indicator you’re using. I guess it’s okay if you’re crazy
about sentiment analysis and want to monitor everything under the sun, but
try to use tools that provide different or complementary information.
To calculate the standard deviation for a column of data in Excel, use the cell
formula: ‘=stdev(data)’.
Locating neutral areas for indicators
The Arms Index (TRIN) chart includes a neutral range between 0.70 and 1.30 —
in this region there is no bias for the next day’s open. When TRIN readings
stay in that area you simply have to look to other indicators to confirm
moves or gain insight on potential changes.
Although it might seem that 1.0 would be a neutral reading for a put/call
ratio, it doesn’t work that way. Under normal conditions the ratio will be less
than 1.0 because markets typically move upward, reflecting a bullish bias.
One method used throughout this chapter to identify both neutral areas and
extremes for different indicators is an average +/– standard deviation
approach. Here are some things to keep in mind when applying this:
 The calculations require a data set from some series — the data selected
must be representative of the series.
 When you move forward in time by a significant amount, you run the
risk of applying outdated conditions to current conditions.
 Consider calculating values for clearly defined bullish and bearish peri-
ods to see if the indicator behaves differently in each.
This is where qualitative judgment comes in — you don’t necessarily want to
include all possible data points in your assessment because conditions
change over time. But they don’t change often, so you need to include
enough data so you’re capturing information that is truly representative.
81
Chapter 5: Tapping Into the Market’s Mood

Stock and index price data is not normally distributed so commonly used sta-
tistical rules for this data won’t apply. You need to use returns. 
By calculating an average value (mean) and standard deviation value, you’re
able to create bands around the central value to identify a region where most
of the data is found. Points outside of that area are atypical — when focusing
on these areas you’re pinpointing times when emotions are running high and
decisions are far from cool and calm.
Identifying indicator extremes
When analyzing data sets you can complete different statistical tests directly
on the data including:
 Mean and median calculations for information about central tendencies
 Standard deviation calculations to identify extreme levels
Most often you’ll use mean levels, but if one or two very extreme data points
skew the results, you may opt to use a median value. When outliers are pre-
sent, the mean value and median value will not be very close together.
In addition to applying these calculations directly to the data, you can apply
them to smoothed segments of the data — namely moving averages. When
doing this you want to keep the moving average period pretty short so that
you don’t overly smooth the values. Remember, you want to view extreme
behavior, not smooth it over.
An outlier is a data point that is a good distance away from the other data
points in the set and can’t be dismissed. 
A last look at advancing and declining breadth data is completed here using
the advance-decline ratio, which oscillates around 1.0. This value is reached
when the number of advancers on the NYA equals the number of decliners.
Figure 5-6 displays daily Adv-Dec ratio values along with the NYA. Two hori-
zontal lines appear with the data: a darker average line, a +1SD line and a –1SD
line near the very bottom of the chart. 
Compared to the P:C ratios, the extreme high values for the A/D Ratio lag a
bit. That’s to be expected because put buying reflects pending doom and
gloom while improvement in breadth occurs with a broad market rally. After
that, things settle back to normal. The upward spikes don’t exactly identify
bottoms. Two light vertical lines are drawn to help you view this lag. 
82
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies

When an indicator diverges from the index or stock you’re evaluating, it may
be an early warning of trend trouble.
The darker vertical line toward the beginning of the chart captures strong
fear and coincides with the short-term market low. Although the number of
extreme values is limited in both directions, the low extremes provide more
timely information. The upward spikes confirm the reversal after the fact. 
When applying SD lines, consider using multiples of 1, 2, and 3 to see what
extremes are highlighted. It may be necessary to use one multiple for spikes
on the high end and a different multiple for those on the low end, depending
on how fast the values used in the indicator respond to market changes.

hen the broad averages move strongly up, so do most stocks and sec-
tors, and when they move strongly down, most stocks and sectors
follow. Sectors don’t move in exact tandem with indexes though. Often eco-
nomic conditions favor one group for a period of time, then as conditions
change, so do the sectors displaying strength or weakness. Focusing on
strong or weak sectors allows you to apply strategies that are best suited for
conditions. First, of course, you have to know how to find them. Technical
analysis provides you with tools for analyzing sectors, including those geared
toward identifying relative strength and weakness. In this chapter, I give you
the technical analysis basics you need to accomplish this to build your
sector trading strategies. 
Getting Technical with Charts
Chart analysis is one aspect of technical analysis that uses price and volume
data to provide a view of trends for market evaluation purposes. There are a
variety of chart types and data displays, providing you with an extremely
large list of tools for analysis. By focusing here on a handful of technical tools
and techniques geared toward sector and option trading, traders new to
chart analysis should get up to speed quickly while those more familiar with
it will get a bit of review.

Chart basics
Charts use price data to provide you with a view of trading activity during a
given period. A short list of common chart types include the following: 
 Line chart: Uses price versus time. Single price data point for each
period is connected using a line. It typically uses a closing value, which
is generally considered the most important value for the period (day,
week, etc.) Line charts provide great “big picture” information for price
movement and trends by filtering out noise from more minor moves
during the period.
Disadvantages to line charts is that they provide no information about
the strength of trading during the day or whether gaps occurred from
one period to the next. A gap is created when trading for one period is
completely above or below trading for the previous period. This hap-
pens when significant news impacting the company comes out when the
markets are closed. Doesn’t that seem like good information for you to
have when you’re trading?
 Open-high-low-close (OHLC) bar chart: Uses price versus time. The
period’s trading range (low to high) is displayed as a vertical line with
opening prices displayed as a horizontal tab on the left side of the range
bar and closing prices as a horizontal tab on the right side of the range
bar. A total of four price points are used to construct each bar.
OHLC charts provide information about both trading period strength
and price gaps. Using a daily chart as a point of reference, a relatively
long vertical bar tells you the price range was pretty big for the day.
Another way to look at it is to say the stock was volatile that day —
good information for option traders. It also hints at strength in the stock
when the stock closes near the high of the day and weakness when it
closes near the low for the day.
 Candlestick chart: Uses price versus time. Similar to an OHLC chart
with the price range between the open and the close for the period high-
lighted by a thickened bar. Patterns unique to this chart can enhance
daily analysis. 
Candlestick charts have distinct pattern interpretations describing the
battle between bulls and bears. These are best applied to a daily chart.
Candlesticks also display price ranges and gaps.
View charts using both: 
 Longer term line charts noting price trends
 OHLC or candlestick charts for better understanding price action during
the period, including security strength and volatility
86
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

A wide variety of technical charting packages are available as independent
software programs or web-based applications. The cost ranges from free to
thousands of dollars depending on the package features. When first using
technical analysis, consider starting with a free web-based package then iden-
tify your specific needs and expand from there.
Adjusting your time horizon 
for the best view
Before focusing on one specific chart interval, consider your investment or
trading horizon. What you want to view when evaluating your 401(k) invest-
ment is different than your focus for active trading.
Technical analysis places different emphasis on timeframes. Longer term
trends are considered stronger than shorter term ones. To get the best view
of trends, it’s extremely helpful to change the time interval used for your
charts. The typical chart default is a daily chart, but others exist as well.
When completing a market analysis to locate strong sectors, an ideal progres-
sion includes evaluating the following:
 Long-term, major trends using monthly charts on indexes and sectors
 Intermediate-term, major and minor trends using weekly charts on
broad market indexes and sectors
 Short-term, minor trends using daily charts on sectors
By first recognizing major and intermediate trends, you’re less likely to get
caught up in the emotion associated with shorter term moves.
A horizontal support line can be drawn after price moves down to touch a
price level twice. The line is confirmed when a third touch of that price level
successfully holds and buying demand returns to the security sending the
price up.
Visualizing supply and demand
Charts can be thought of as a display of supply and demand: 
 Buying demand pushes prices upward
 Supply creates selling pressure that drives prices downward
 Volume displays the magnitude of supply or demand
87
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

Markets don’t just move straight up and down — the battle between the bulls
(demand) and the bears (supply) results in different types of price movement.
A horizontal resistance line can be drawn once price moves up to touch a price
level twice. The line is confirmed when a third touch of that price level 
successfully holds and selling supply returns to the security sending the
price down.
Areas of support and resistance
Price support and resistance halt the trend that is in place: 
 Support represents a transition from declining prices driven by supply
to climbing prices when renewed demand kicks in at that price level.
 Resistance represents a transition from climbing prices driven by strong
demand to declining prices when selling pressure comes in at that price.
When trading, notice that these transitions line up over time, sometimes cre-
ating sideways trading channels as price moves between the two. The longer
the price serves as support or resistance, the stronger it’s considered. 
Using support and resistance to identify entry and exit points is one basic
trading system. Consider also using them in price projections to identify
stop-loss and profit-taking exits, as well as calculating risk-reward ratios.
Price areas that previously served as support often serve as resistance areas
in the future and vice versa.
Trend analysis
I use the concept of trend quite a bit before reaching this formal definition.
That’s because I’m pretty sure you have a sense of what an upward trend and
a downward trend is for any asset. Painfully so if you were holding on to that
asset in the latter trend. More formally, trend identifies price direction:
 Upward trend: Prices climb and pullback in such a way that a rising line
can be drawn under the pullbacks which display higher lows. Higher
highs are also characteristic of uptrends.
 Downward trend: Prices fall and retrace in such a way that a declining
line can be drawn above the top of retracement peaks which display
lower highs. Lower lows are also characteristic of downtrends.
Create a trend line by connecting two higher lows (uptrend) or two lower
highs (downtrend). When price successfully tests the line a third time, the
trend is confirmed. Using these lines as entry and exit points is a valid appli-
cation of the tool, similar to support and resistance levels.
88
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Consider drawing two trendlines using a longer term chart such as a monthly
chart, to highlight an area of resistance versus a subjective single trend line.
One may use closing data while the other uses market lows. Follow market
action near each.
Moving averages
Moving averages are lines constructed on a chart using an average value of
closing prices during a certain number of days. These lines are considered
lagging indicators because the historical data follows price action. The two
main types of moving averages include as follows:
 Simple moving averages (SMA) which use a basic average calculation
 Exponential moving averages (EMA) which incorporates all available
price data providing greater weight to more recent data
Simple moving averages equally weigh all closes for the time period selected
while exponential moving averages are calculated in such a way that more
recent data carries greater weight in the line.
Both SMAs and EMAs can be constructed using a variety of settings and chart
intervals. So you can view a five-day SMA on a daily chart or a ten-week EMA
on a weekly chart. Moving average lines are considered unbiased trend indi-
cators because the lines are derived from objective calculations.
The three most common settings for either moving average include the 
following:
 20-day moving average displaying short-term trends
 50-day moving average displaying intermediate-term trends
 200-day moving average displaying long-term trends
You may have heard financial media reporting that price is approaching the
200-day moving average. That’s because a break of this line is considered sig-
nificant and may confirm a trend reversal. 
Exponential moving averages (EMA) incorporate all available price data for
the underlying security, with more recent data having a greater weight on the
EMA value for the period. As a result, they are more responsive to price
changes.
Identifying Relatively Strong Sectors
Strong market moves up or down generally result in gains for most sectors
and securities too. However, during more moderate trending certain sectors
89
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

and securities perform better than the market while others perform worse. A
sector or security can also move in the opposite direction during these peri-
ods. Your objective as a trader is finding those relatively strong and weak
groups so you can apply profitable sector strategies.
Relative ratios
You construct a relative ratio line by dividing one security into another. This
allows you to objectively view the performance of one security relative to the
other because the line rises when the primary security is outperforming the
second one and falls when it is underperforming. Adding an overlay chart to
a relative ratio allows you to view both securities on one chart. Log scales
typically provide a better view for the movement of each.
Trend lines drawn on a log chart will appear differently when you switch to
an arithmetic scale.
Figure 6-1 displays a weekly log chart for XLF (dark solid line), an exchange-
traded fund (ETF) comprised of S&P 500 financial companies. It also displays
an overlay of SPY (light, thinner line), which is the S&P 500 Index ETF. The 
10-week and 40-week EMAs (two dashed lines) are also included for XLF, dis-
playing intermediate and long-term trends respectively. Finally, the bottom
portion shows the relative ratio line for XLF/SPY.

Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Shorter moving averages (i.e. low setting) are considered faster and move
more closely with price. You can distinguish these lines on a chart because
they are somewhat jagged.
When including relative ratios on a chart you have a clearer view of the per-
formance for two securities. In Figure 6-1 it appears that the two indexes
moved pretty similarly until very recently. But a look at the relative ratio line
tells another story. Throughout a good portion of the three-year period SPY
outperformed XLF, very significantly from June 2007 through October 2007. 
Relative ratio lines are also referred to as relative strength comparisons.
Within a month after the deterioration in the relative ratio line, XLF dropped
below its 200-day EMA and shortly after the 50-day EMA followed. Although
not labeled, the shorter EMA is identified by noting which one moves more
closely with the price. When downward trending conditions are ideal, prices
and MAs line up with price data appearing lowest on the chart followed by
the shorter EMA, then the higher EMA — just like this chart is showing.
Some traders use moving average crosses as trading system signals. This
approach has its place in trading, but note where price was when the cross
occurred — almost at its lowest point. Remember, moving averages lag price
data. I like to use crossovers to identify a change in conditions for the stock
and as a strategy filter. Once that cross occurs, I favor bearish strategies.
Before moving away from this particular chart, note that trend lines can be
applied to relative ratios. The same rules apply:
 Draw uptrends using the low points in the trend
 Draw downtrends using the high points in the trend
Also, previous areas of support can become resistant and vice versa.
When using overlay capabilities on a chart, indicators added to the chart are
based on the primary security. 
When using relative ratios, it’s good to identify a group of related indexes or
sectors to monitor. Cash flows from one outperforming market or sector to
another as economic conditions change. Portfolio allocations should favor
outperforming markets and underweight underperforming ones. This results
in reversals for one market leading another market by varying amounts of
time.
The wide range of ETFs that track different assets (i.e. the U.S. dollar or oil)
allows you to employ an asset allocation plan across markets using a single
security type. Add the existence of options for many ETFs and you have
reduced risk access to the commodity and foreign exchange markets.
91
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

Trend lines can be used on relative strength comparison lines to better iden-
tify changing conditions and areas of support and resistance. Similarly, sup-
port that has been broken will often serve as resistance in the future.
Focusing on sectors, selecting one optionable ETF fund family sector group
allows you to quickly evaluate sector trends and relative performance. As an
example, the Select Sector S&P Depository Receipts (SPDR) include ten ETFs
based on the S&P 500 Index:
 SPY tracks the entire S&P 500 Index 
 Nine ETFs track each of the nine major sectors that make up the index
Collectively the nine sector ETFs make up the SPY ETF. By analyzing ten
charts, you can complete a broad market and sector assessment which can
serve as a basis for comprehensive sector investing or trading. Seeking an
ETF fund family that is liquid and optionable is your first objective, then you
follow-up by confirming liquidity in the ETF options.
A relative ratio line only compares performance of two securities — it does
not indicate the trend for either security. A rising line can indicate the pri-
mary security is trending upward at a faster rate than the second security or
that it is trending downward at a slower rate.
Rate of change indicator
Relative ratios provide you with a good visual approach for assessing sec-
tors. A rate of change approach allows you to also quantify and rank perfor-
mance for those sectors. The rate of change (ROC) for a security is the speed
in which it moves — when calculating security returns you are using one type
of ROC. There is also an ROC indicator that can be drawn on charts for ana-
lyzing, trading, or ranking securities. 
To calculate a ten-day ROC, you use the following formula:
(Today’s Price ÷ Price 10 Days Ago) × 100
Using the nine sector ETFs, you can rank the sectors by strength using a 14-
day ROC value for each as follows in Table 6-1.

XLU, XLP, and XLV are considered relatively strong while XLY, XLE, and XLB
relatively weak compared to price 14-days ago. Does this mean XLV is trend-
ing upward or XLB trending downward? Not at all — it’s simply a way you can
compare the performance of a group of securities using a specific criteria. It
turns out each of these ETFs hit a short-term bottom on the day the ROC was
calculated. Round out your analysis by evaluating each sector chart, starting
with the extremes.
As an alternate approach to sector trading you can expand the list to include
industry groups, investment styles (small or large cap, value or growth), or
countries, among others. The main goal is to develop a group of ETFs that
experience related capital inflows and outflows.
When using ROC trends, you really want to capture money flows from one
market or sector to another. Consider checking out different periods such as
weekly or monthly ROCs and see how the rankings change each week.
Relative strength trading approaches seek to establish bullish positions in
relatively strong performers and bearish position in relatively weak perform-
ers. This works best when the periods used result in rankings that persist
more than a week or two, so you remain in a strong position.
When trading, the ROC is used with a simple moving average (SMA) as a
trade alert. Crosses of the ROC up above its SMA is a bullish alert and
crosses of the ROC down below its SMA is a bearish alert. An example of this
is shown in the next section.
93
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

The term normalize refers to the process of expressing data so that it is inde-
pendent of the absolute value of the underlying. This allows comparison to
other securities.
Using Sector Volatility Tools 
Technical analysis displays volatility in a variety of ways including basic
range bars and historical volatility (HV) plots. Objective technical indicators
available in many charting packages and covered in this section include the
following:
 Statistical volatility
 Average true range
 Bollinger bands
 Bollinger %b
These tools provide you with different volatility views and allow you to scan
the markets for securities that may be gearing up for a change. Although
volatility can remain high or low for extended periods of time, these mea-
sures may provide you with the following:
 A buy alert when declining
 A sell alert with jumps higher
 A tool to help identify appropriate strategies
 Detection of seasonal movement
The value used for technical indicators is referred to as the setting.
Commonly used settings are referred to as default values. 
Displaying volatility with indicators
Statistical volatility and the average true range are two different displays of
price movement. Here’s how they differ:
 Statistical volatility (SV): SV, another term for historical volatility, uses
closing values to plot an annualized standard deviation line that repre-
sents the degree of price movement in the security. Because various
time periods can be used on a chart, SV reflects the chart period, not
necessarily a daily calculation as you see on option HV or SV charts.
94
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

 Average true range (ATR): The ATR uses a true range (TR) value to
define price movement and was developed by Welles Wilder. TR incorpo-
rates extreme movement such as gaps, so it better reflects volatility. TR
uses the previous close and current high and low values to calculate
three different ranges. The biggest range for the three is the TR for the
period. 
A rate of return calculation is one measure of rate of change. It allows com-
parisons for securities with different prices by creating a value that is inde-
pendent of price.
Figure 6-2 provides the three TR range calculations and a bar chart example
of each. 
ATR is an exponential moving average that smoothes TR. A strong move in
the ATR incorporates price gaps and provides traders with important infor-
mation about price volatility that can be missed by other smoothed indica-
tors. Because ATR uses historical prices and a smoothing process, it’s a
lagging indicator and does not predict volatility. However, a sharp move
upward in a security’s ATR is often accompanied by an increase in IV for its
options. 
When using rankers to identify stocks with narrowing bandwidth, be sure to
check the chart to see what’s happening with the stock. Price may have flat-
tened due to a pending corporate action such as a stock buyout and is less
likely to move from that point.

Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

In the late July — early August period, the volatility for SPY increased as seen
by range bars increasing in length. In this particular decline, SV peaked
approximately five days before SPY bottomed which was followed by a peak
in the ATR one day later. 
All nine sector ETFs bottomed on the same day with each ATR peaking within
one day of this bottom. The SV profile for the ETFs varied more, but most
also peaked a few days prior to the bottom. When reviewing the charts, you
note the following about XLI:
 Price moved in a very wide range, closing the day at its high with a
slight net gain
 SV was pulling back from a peak two days prior
 ATR was still moving upward
 The SMA for the 14-day ROC was flattening suggesting a possible end to
the decline
Although XLI ranked fifth on a 14-day ROC basis, closing at its high for the
day was extremely bullish given the range of trading for that day. The situa-
tion merited monitoring to confirm a reversal. By following conditions for 
a couple of days, you would have seen the following for XLI displayed as
Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-3:
SPY daily
OHLC bar
chart with
ATR and SV.
96
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Price continued upward while ATR appeared to be pulling back and SV condi-
tions remained elevated. ROC crossed up above its ten-day SMA, which was a
bullish signal. The only strategy briefly discussed so far that suits these con-
ditions (bullish, high volatility) is a long stock, short call position. 
Buying the ETF near the close at $38.55 and selling the Sep 39 strike price call
for $0.80, you’ve created a moderately reduced risk position. Rather than
$3,855 on the line, you’ve reduced your exposure to $3,775 or by 2%. There
are actually better strategies to capitalize on this situation — ones that allow
you to limit your risk much more — but this one is suitable for now.
You can establish a short-term covered call strategy with the goal of being
called out of the position. That’s the case here so you want XLI to be trading
above 39 at September expiration. This is, exactly what happened. On expira-
tion Friday XLI closed at 40.63 and you would have been assigned. This
means you bought the position for $3,775 and sold it for $3,900.
Analyzing volatility with Bollinger bands
Bollinger bands provide you with another nice visual of relative volatility
levels. This technical tool uses a simple moving average (SMA) surrounded by
upper and lower bands, both derived from a standard deviation calculation.
John Bollinger, the tool’s developer, uses the following as default settings:
Figure 6-4:
XLI daily
OHLC bar
chart with
ATR, SV, and
ROC.
97
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

 20-period SMA
 Upper band (SMA + two standard deviations)
 Lower band (SMA – two standard deviations)
The bands contract and expand as price volatility contracts and expands.
Two additional Bollinger band tools include the following:
 Bandwidth (BW) to measure the distance between the two bands using
the calculation: BW = (Upper BB – Lower BB) ÷ Moving Average
According to Bollinger, when BW is at its lowest level in six months, a
squeeze candidate is identified. That’s a security that is consolidating
before a potentially strong breakout higher or lower. It is not uncommon
for a false move to occur so straddle strategies (see Chapter 14) can pro-
vide a way to play this situation. 
 %b to identify where the price is relative to the BW, calculated using a
variation of George Lane’s Stochastic indicator, with values ranging
from:
• 0 to 100 when price is at or between the bands
• Less than 0 when below the lower band (bearish)
• Greater than 100 when above the upper band (bullish)
Review the news when you see a chart with a big price jump or decline along
with narrow bandwidth on the Bollinger bands.
A value of 75 reflects price that is within the bands and one quarter below
the lower band from a total bandwidth standpoint. %b normalizes price rela-
tive to band-width size and allows you to make an apples-to-apples compari-
son of different stocks for ranking purposes. 
Different sectors experience bullish and bearish trends at different times.
Although strong rallies and declines in the broad markets often move all
securities in the same direction, the strength and duration of the moves for
these different securities can vary greatly. In general, the following apply:
 Securities and sectors with very high values for %b are bullish when
confirmed by other technical tools.
 Securities and sectors with very low values for %b are bearish when
confirmed by other technical tools.
Bollinger noted that rather than prices being extended when near a Bollinger
band, the condition actually reflects strength and a breakout that can con-
tinue. Look for pullbacks toward the moving average line to establish new
positions in the direction of the trend after such a breakout.

Projecting Prices for Trading
There are no guarantees in the markets. Options with low implied volatility
levels can remain low, stocks in a downtrend can continue dropping, and
options with a 75% chance of being in the money at expiration according to
the models can expire worthless. That’s why risk management is your first
order of business as a trader. Using support and resistance areas and trend
lines is a straightforward way to manage your risk.
Price projections can include those identifying exits for a loss or a profit.
Both are important. Sometimes we focus so much on managing risk that we
forget to also be on the alert for profit taking. By identifying areas above and
below the current price prior to establishing a position you simplify trade
management. Consider using objective techniques such as price channels,
retracements and extensions for identifying exit levels. The following sec-
tions give you both sides of the coin: methods for projecting price moves
(magnitude and time), as well as risk-management tools. Just what’s needed
for option traders. 
Support and resistance 
Support and resistance provide you with subjective tools that identify:
 Concrete exit levels for a loss
 Potential exit levels for a profit
Although support and resistance lines are subjective, they do represent a rea-
sonable approach to managing your risk because they identify a maximum
loss. As your skills develop applying such tools and exit points will improve.
The reason I use “potential exit” on the profit side is because changing condi-
tions may warrant an early exit for partial profits or they may allow you to
extend gains depending on the change. Suppose you hold a bullish position —
if your indicators become bearish you may receive an alert prompting an ear-
lier than anticipated exit from the position. On the other hand, you may have
already taken a portion of your profits when the stock reaches your original
projection price. If the chart remains bullish, you can revise your price target
for additional profits. 
Extending the exit only applies to profit-taking, exit points for a loss have to
be written in stone. You can exit the position early, but you absolutely cannot
revise the exit level in a way that extends losses. It’s critical for you to iden-
tify a maximum loss price for the position, and execute it if it’s reached.
99
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

Because trend lines are drawn by the analyst, a degree of bias may be intro-
duced. Consider allowing a little bit of leeway when using these price areas
for entries and exits to help minimize the impact of bias.
Using a moving average crossover system, you decide to enter a long posi-
tion in XLF (financials ETF) the day after the 20-day EMA crosses up over the
50-day EMA. One exit signal includes a cross of the 20-day EMA down below
the 50-day EMA. Because this exit doesn’t identify a specific exit for a loss,
you add a support line below the current price to manage your risk.
In the previous uptrend, $36.58 served as support, but this area was broken
when XLF declined a couple months ago. The market has since reversed and
the same $36.58 level served as resistance when XLF started moving upward.
The ETF recently broke above this level making it a reasonable stop-loss sup-
port area going forward. Because the ETF is trading around $37.10, it repre-
sents a 1.4% loss which is well within your risk parameters.
To view a 200-day moving average on a weekly chart, you must use a setting
of 40 because there are five trading days in a week.
Figure 6-5 displays the daily OHLC bar chart for XLF with 20-day and 50-day
EMAs, and a horizontal support line drawn at $36.58. The entire trade period
is shown, including trade entry which was established at $37.12. Both exit
signals that resulted are also identified.

Price moved upward for a little more than a month then dropped, but
remained above the support line. Another weaker advance failed and now
price dropped below support. The trade was exited at the next open for
$36.34. Assuming 100 shares were purchased, the position loss was $78,
which represented 2.1% of the initial position. Unless a physical stop loss
order is in place (see Chapter 8), actual losses will be greater than those cal-
culated using the support price. Regardless, this exit did prevent an addi-
tional $44 (1.2%) loss had you waited for the EMA crossover. 
When viewing the chart, you may notice that price reached an approximate
double top at $38.00, then declined. An approach that took partial profits at
this previous resistance level would have yielded more gains than losses.
Longer moving averages (i.e. high setting) are considered slower and less
responsive to price changes. You can distinguish these lines on a chart
because they are smoother. Calculating a moving average is referred to as a
smoothing process.
Trends
Trend lines are upward and downward moving lines drawn across higher
lows (uptrend) or lower highs (downtrend). These lines can similarly be used
for price projection purposes. The actual price level you use with these lines
is estimated because the lines are trending rather than horizontal.
Many technical analysis packages include a crosshair tool allowing you to
identify the price and date for different areas on the chart. Using the same
EMA crossover entry technique for XLF, a trend line exit can be identified
with the crosshair tool. 
Many trend-following systems have a larger number of small losses and fewer
large profitable trades. These systems rely on using the system exit rather
than physical stop-loss exit levels. To properly manage risk while allowing
the system to perform as it should, incorporates percentage loss exits into
your back-testing to determine if the system is viable when a stop loss is
included. 
Figure 6-6 incorporates a successfully tested trend line on a daily chart for
XLF. The crosshair level one day after the trade entry date is included.
Although this method uses an estimate for the stop, it represents a stop that
is dynamic because it increases over time as the trend remains intact. 
101
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

Using the trend line approach on the example resulted in profits, but don’t
jump to the conclusion that it’s a superior approach — it just worked out
better in this case. The main point is that it’s possible for you to use basic
tools when identifying reasonable price levels for downside protection.
Exiting a bullish trade when an upward trending line is broken makes a lot of
sense.
Options come with an expiration date so the time it takes for a stock to reach
a projected price is as important as the projection itself. 
There are many technical tools that generate entry and exit signals, but not
price projections. When identifying a maximum loss exit point, remember to
consider basic techniques for managing risk.
Channels
Price channels include those drawn using two different trend lines and those
constructed using a regression line — here I display the latter to focus on
objective tools. A regression channel:
Figure 6-6:
XLF daily
line chart
with trend
line and 20-
and 50-day
EMAs.
102
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

 Uses a specific number of past prices to create the channel
 Includes a middle regression line that represents the expected value for
future prices (no guarantees)
 Fixes the data period, then extends the channel lines forward in time
A regression line is fixed, meaning it’s constructed using data that has a start
and end date rather than adding and dropping data the way a moving average
does. Price is expected to revert the mean with these channels. 
A regression line is also referred to as a line of best fit. It’s the line that repre-
sents the shortest distance between the line and each data point. 
When creating a regression channel, you use an existing trend that is
expected to remain intact. Price contained by the channel confirms the trend
and price moving outside of the channel suggests a change in trend may be
developing. 
There are a variety of ways you can construct a channel, here I focus on a
basic linear regression approach. After identifying the trend period, the
regression line is drawn and the boundary lines are created as follows:
 Upper boundary line uses the distance between the regression line and
the point furthest above the line
 Lower boundary line uses the distance between the regression line and
the point furthest below the line
Very wide channels reflect volatile trends, while narrow channels reflect
more quiet trends. Often times price will remain in the upper or lower region
of the channel for periods of time while it is trending. If price breaks out of
the channel then returns to it without moving to the middle regression line, a
change in trend may be developing.
Suppose you constructed the regression channel in Figure 6-7 using a weekly
OHLC bar chart for XLB. The data range for the channel is shown above it
and a long trade entry point is identified by the arrow.
As the trend progresses upward, you can identify a rising exit point using the
lower channel boundaries and regression line. Your exit rules may include
the following:
 Exit the position on the Monday after price closes outside of the lower
channel line on the weekly chart (projected at 25.36).
 Take profits if price moves above the upper channel line, then returns to
the channel.
 Take partial profits at the middle regression line if price fails to move to
the upper channel line.
103
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

Check out the chart package help links to obtain information about indicator
construction and applications.
Using the crosshairs tool allows you to identify realistic price projections
that correspond to future points in time.
Consider creating regression channels on monthly and weekly charts, then
moving down in time to weekly and daily charts, respectively, to apply
stronger trends to the relatively shorter time period.
Although difficult to see in the image, the crosshair tool also identifies March
12 as the corresponding date for movement to the lower boundary line. That
is, assuming price continues to behave as it has in the past.
You may be thinking that’s a pretty big assumption, but it’s the one made any
time you enter a position in the direction of the trend. This approach to a
time projection is subjective, but it does provide you with a nice reality check
when considering potential moves.
Trends are not considered predictive. They exist in the market, but they do
not predict price because they can either continue or fail. Technical tools
provide guidelines for risk management and profit-taking, not guarantees.

Price retracements and extensions
Retracement tools make use of existing trends to identify potential areas of
price support and resistance. As you saw in Chapter 5, market trends and
conditions are largely associated with two primary human emotions: greed
and fear. Technical analysis acknowledges the impact of such crowd-driven
behavior and uses tools that attempt to quantify it when possible. One such
application includes the use of Fibonacci ratios for retracement purposes.
These ratios are derived from a numeric series of the same name, originally
defined by Leonardo Fibonacci. 
Examples of the series and ratios are found throughout nature and are used
by many traders in various applications. Because different market partici-
pants will be taking action when certain Fibonacci price levels are reached,
you should be aware of these levels. A basic understanding will likely help
you assess market action. 
W. D. Gann was a successful commodities trader who also developed a series
of ratios and retracement and extension tools that are widely used. Gann’s
ratios include 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 among others.
Fibonacci series and ratios
The Fibonacci integer series is generated starting with 0 and 1, and adding
the two previous integers in the series to obtain the next integer:
0, 1, 1 (0 + 1), 2 (1 + 1), 3 (1 + 2), 5 (2 + 3), 8 (3 + 5), 13 (5 + 8), . . .
The Fibonacci ratios are values reached when dividing an integer in the series
by specific previous or subsequent integers in the series The primary
Fibonacci ratios used in technical analysis are:
0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 1.00, 1.618 and 2.618
Because prices do not move straight up or down, retracements develop
which are counter-trend moves. A retracement includes:
 A pullback in price during an uptrend
 A rise in price during a downtrend
Fibonacci ratios are often used to define retracement areas. Extensions use
the same ratio process to identify projections beyond the starting point for
the base trend.
105
Chapter 6: Targeting Sectors with Technical Analysis

Fibonacci numbers can be used for indicator settings when making adjust-
ments to the default setting.
Figure 6-8 displays Fibonacci retracements (thinner lines occurring during
the trend) and extensions (thicker lines occurring beyond the trend) for XLI.
Time extensions
A second method uses Fibonacci numbers or ratios to identify future dates
for potential turning points. Projections are determined using
 A ratio based on the time taken to create the original trend.
 A count using Fibonacci integers moving forward.
Another commonly applied approach to time objectives is use of market
cycles. Similar to the economic business cycle, the stock market undergoes
bullish and bearish cycles that are measured from low point to low point. A
cycle low can then be used to estimate the next potential low point for the
market. One of the most well-known cycles for the stock market is the four-
year cycle with a recent low point occurring in 2006. Projecting forward, this
means another significant low should develop in 2010.

Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Projections and probabilities
By lining up different high probability factors, you create a situation where
you put the odds in your favor for a particular strategy or trade. By managing
your risk, you limit losses and realize larger gains. The process involves part
science (supported by rules) and part art (supported by experience).
Weighing possibility versus probability
Even though basic tools can be subjective, a valid trend line helps you more
easily identify intact trends and provides a reasonable exit point when the
line is broken. Such a break is a clear signal that the original reason for enter-
ing the trade is no longer valid. However, you can still encounter problems
when that time comes.
What if the trendline you drew was on a weekly chart and during the week
the trend line was broken? Technically, you don’t have a weekly close below
the trend line, but that doesn’t mean you should continue to simply watch
price erode. Technical methods rely on confirming indicators to help line up
probabilities.
Identifying a stop exit point before entering a position helps reduce your
emotion during the trade.
During an uptrend, if volume increases as price moves down towards the
trend line it’s a bearish alert. A break of the line with increasing volume is
more bearish evidence. Such action on a daily chart supports exiting a posi-
tion established using weekly data.
Going back to Figure 6-4, a covered call position in XLI was created based on
a bullish price reversal and high implied volatility. Table 6-2 presents condi-
tions in place to assess probabilities for the strategy. The indicators narrowly
favor a bullish resolution.

There are no guarantees a trend will remain intact.
Waiting for every tool to turn bullish will typically result in no trades taken at
all. Or those that are signaled will be created toward the end of a move. Try
to assess conditions and use your experience to put the odds in your favor.
Although XLI moved upward and the trade realized gains, the same condi-
tions on a different day could result in continued bearish movement. That’s
why managing risk is key.
Reacting to versus anticipating a move
Anything can happen in the markets the next week or trading day . . . even by
the time the market closes. Trends can continue, reverse, or simply stall. The
further out in time, the more uncertain things become, so it’s always good to
remind yourself that you simply don’t know what will happen tomorrow. The
best you can do is identify rules for managing risk and keep the odds in your
favor. When conditions change take the necessary action and move on.
Practice disciplined trading through these methods to gain the experience
needed to hone your skills over varying market conditions:
 Sector analysis: When completing an analysis, use tools that provide
objective information about current conditions for different timeframes,
including moving averages and Bollinger bands. This keeps you tuned in
to “what is” happening versus what may happen next. Consider broad
market movement and how the sector moves in relation to the market.
After assessing current trending and volatility conditions, incorporate
other tools that provide you with insight about the strength of those con-
ditions and potential changes. Then develop your strategy accordingly.
108
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Only take on new positions if you can effectively manage all your open
trades.
 Trade evaluation: When evaluating potential trades, use tools that pro-
vide reasonable projections to assess reward:risk ratios. Only consider
those positions with risk levels that are within your guidelines. Identify
an absolute exit price for a loss, as well as tools used for taking profits. 
 Trade management: When managing a position be sure to monitor 
conditions — don’t walk away from a trade that requires your attention.
Use order types that automatically execute a stop loss exit when possi-
ble (see Chapter 8). 
Try to put the odds in your favor.

Kicking the Wheels 
of a New Strategy
In This Chapter
 Understanding option price changes
 Practicing by paper trading
 Testing an approach
 Gaining strategy mastery
You may consider new trading strategies exciting, but be careful about
jumping the gun. There’s a good amount of advance preparation needed.
Three steps to take before using a new strategy in the market include: 
 Understanding the security’s risks and rewards
 Practicing strategies
 Analyzing a trade
Although this book covers a lot of “learning” and “analyzing” topics, this
chapter introduces tools and techniques for practicing strategies. First, by
monitoring different option pricing components and paper trading you simu-
late live conditions. This provides a better intuitive feel for price changes and
helps you avoid costly mistakes. Next, by developing your backtest skills you
implement only the best approaches, allowing you to stay in the game long
enough to gain valuable experience. Through practice and experience you
eventually reach strategy mastery. 
Monitoring Option Greek Changes
Understanding basic option strategies is a much quicker learning curve than
recognizing the proper pricing for options used in the strategies. Theoretical

models and conditions impacting option premiums are discussed in Chapters
3, 14, and 15. But one of the best ways to really grasp the value of these secu-
rities is by monitoring price and Greek changes under actual conditions. 
Tracking premium measures
Developing your skills with any option strategy means really understanding
how option premiums are impacted by changes in both of the following:
 The price of the underlying
 Time to expiration
A great way to get a better intuitive feel for the impact from both of these is
by formally tracking changes in all the different components on a day to day
basis. All you need to do this is access to market prices, an option calculator,
and a spreadsheet program. By monitoring a few different options, you
should be able to learn a lot about how changing conditions impact prices in
general. By including Greeks in the process you also understand which fac-
tors play more significant roles at different times. See Chapter 3 for more on
the Greeks.
Ideally you’ll end up reviewing the markets and tracking prices during a
period when prices are moving around a bit. This helps highlight delta,
gamma, and theta impacts on price. Prior to putting your trading dollars on
the line, set up a spreadsheet to track the following:
 Price of the underlying 
 Prices for ITM, ATM, OTM calls and puts with varying days to expiration
 Days to expiration
 Option intrinsic value, delta, gamma, and theta
By tracking these values you can identify which measures have the biggest
impact on option strategies. 
Delta may be displayed based on values from -1 to +1 or -100 to +100.
Figure 7-1 displays a spreadsheet for a Microsoft (MSFT) call, and put.
Although only a portion of the month is displayed, monitoring these values
over an extended period helps you view varying market conditions. Note that
option prices don’t change by the exact amounts projected by the Greeks.
112
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Changing volatility and option prices
The volatility impact on option prices is a little tough to get a handle on at
times because implied volatility (IV) includes pricing factors that vary during
the life of the option. IV incorporates the following:
 Past volatility (historical)
 Volatility expected in the future (implied) and
 Contract demand 
Past volatility
Crowd behavior can drive up option prices when demand for specific con-
tracts increases as news on a company hits the wires. Figure 7-2 displays a
similar spreadsheet for the MSFT call and put options, tracking price, and
volatility changes.
Implied volatility (IV)
Implied volatility (IV) is the volatility implied by the option’s price. Does that
about cover it for you? Because IV is a pretty important option pricing factor,
it’s probably good to expand on that definition a bit.

Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

In terms of trading and IV:
 It’s better to buy options when IV is relatively low.
 It’s better to sell options when IV is relatively high.
The problem with these rules of thumb is that you can’t always follow them.
When holding a long-term stock position you want to protect, should you just
throw caution to the wind because put IV is high? Definitely not, especially
when you consider that increasing IV often translates to increasing fear in the
market. When faced with buying options in a high volatility environment, you
may need to evaluate a broader range of expiration months and strike prices.
When implied volatility (IV) is relatively high, then drops significantly, it’s
referred to as an IV crush.
Remember that IV can vary:
 By time to expiration, which contributes more uncertainty to the
option’s value.
 By strike price: Usually at-the-money (ATM) IV is the lowest, but it 
doesn’t always work out that way. Skew charts (discussed in Chapter 15)
provide IV by strike price and can speed up the option selection process
when you need to purchase contracts while IV is relatively high. An
option price can be broken into two components: intrinsic and extrinsic
value. The intrinsic value is completely determined by the option mon-
eyness, but IV does not play a role in this value. The deeper in-the-
money (ITM) the option is, the less impact IV will have on the total
option premium.
When using short option strategies, time decay works in your favor. Selling
options with 30 to 45 days to expiration accelerates this decay for you.
Paper Trading an Approach 
Continually seeking and implementing new strategies naturally develops your
trading skills. By paper trading, you make risk-free progress on the new strat-
egy learning curve. 
114
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

When paper trading, be sure to incorporate trading costs associated with the
position to get the best value for strategy profitability.
Trading on paper: pluses and minuses
Paper trading is an excellent way to minimize losses when learning strategy
mechanics or changing your trading routine a bit. Watching a long out-of-the-
money (OTM) option deflate in value as implied volatility drops is much less
painful when it’s on paper. However, it doesn’t really prepare you for the
battle of greed and fear from within. What it does do, however, is it forces you
to address the situation prior to having money on the line. Some pluses and
minuses for paper trading appears in Table 7-1.

Implementing electronic paper trades
Paper trading can be done on a spreadsheet, an electronic platform, or . . .
you got it, paper. Do whatever works best for you. If you plan on setting up
your own log, incorporate option Greeks, too.
Many financial Web sites allow you to enter different positions in a portfolio
tracker that updates at the end of the day or intra-day on a delayed basis.
Unfortunately, not all of them accept option symbols. A basic tracker will pro-
vide position information that includes price changes with profits and losses.
A more advanced platform can include risk chart displays and other trade
management tools. Figure 7-3 displays the free Optionetics.com portfolio
tracker with shares of Microsoft (MSFT), as well as the MSFT Jan 30 call and
Jan 30 put.

Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

Using Trading Systems
A trading system is an approach with specific rules for entry and exit. Even if
you currently use a systematic approach to a strategy — i.e. only purchasing
a call when implied volatility is relatively low — a trading system is more
rigidly defined. When using a system you should do the following:
 Establish a position for all buy signals generated by the rules
 Exit each position when the exit signal is generated
Knowing what you’re getting
There is no decision-making when implementing the system — you never
think about whether or not to accept an entry or exit signal. If accruing
losses or something seems amiss, you completely stop the system. The two
best things about a formal system is:
 It minimizes your trade emotions
 It allows for backtesting to get a sense of expected performance
If you start using discretion by deciding which trades to take, both of these
advantages disappear. Emotions creep in and your results can vary signifi-
cantly from test results. As with any trading approach, an important key to
Figure 7-3:
Electronic
platform for
portfolio
tracking.
116
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

system trading is working with systems that are suitable to your trading style
and account size.
Although the rules for a system are rigid, building in flexibility is common by
varying indicator speeds or adding filters. A filter is an extra rule for trade
entry or exit. Indicators and similar system components are defined as
system parameters.
Characteristics of a good trading system include:
 Profitability across a variety of markets, securities and market conditions
 Outperforming a buy and hold approach
 Stability with manageable drawdowns
 Diversifying your trading tools
 Suiting your style and time availability
Be extremely careful about creating a system and putting it on auto-pilot.
Always monitor trades.
Performing a backtest
A backtest uses past data to determine if a system generates stable profits.
You can complete backtesting using data downloads or tracking trades
mechanically, but the most efficient way of doing it is via a software applica-
tion intended for backtesting. You just have to be sure that you’re testing
what you think your testing.
When performing backtesting for a system, include longer periods of time to
capture bullish, bearish, and sideways moving markets. This way you gener-
ate results under worst-case conditions and experience (in a test environ-
ment) realistic drawdowns. Drawdown is the term used to define cumulative
account losses from consecutive losing trades. Evaluating drawdown is just
another way to mange your risk. 
A robust trading system works for a variety of markets (commodities, stocks,
etc.) under a variety of conditions (bull/bear markets).
When reviewing backtest results, you’re looking for both profitability and sta-
bility. Stability refers to the consistency of results — you want to know if just
a few trades are generating all the profits or if they are spread over a variety
of trades. A stable system
117
Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

 Has winning trades with average profits that exceed the average losses
of losing trades
 Has an average system profit that is close to the median system profit
(low standard deviation)
 Sustains manageable drawdowns
 Does not rely on a handful of trades for profitability
Note that a system doesn’t have to have more winning trades than losing
trades. Many trending systems rely on letting profits run for a smaller
number of trades while cutting losses quickly on the losing trades. 
After creating a system that performs reasonably in backtests, you complete
forward testing by running the rules on a shorter period of time. Generally
you start the test at the latest backtest date and run it to some point in time
before implementation. Expect diminishing returns during forward testing.
System trading is not a secret key that unlocks profits. It is a way you can
minimize harmful trading emotions. Consider it an approach that merits your
attention if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and do some exploring. 
Following the right steps
Here are the steps you should take when backtesting a system:
1. Identify basis of strategy (i.e. capture trending conditions).
2. Identify trade entry and exit rules.
3. Identify market traded and period backtest.
4. Identify account assumptions (system and trade allocations).
5. Test system; evaluate results.
6. Identify reasonable filters to minimize losing trades (number and/or
size of such trades)
7. Add filter based on conclusions from step 6; test system; and then
evaluate results.
8. Add risk-management component.
9. Test system; evaluate results.
Although I don’t detail each step with a figure, you will see figures in this
chapter that highlight some of these steps to give you a feel for what you’ll be
doing when you perform your own backtest. 
Check the average value of losing trades, as well as maximum and consecu-
tive losses to determine if a system is suitable.
118
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

A long only, rate of change (ROC) momentum system was tested using a
simple moving average (SMA) crossover to signal trade entry[ROC: 34, SMA:
13] and exit [ROC: 21, SMA: 8]. Because a faster signal was used for trade exit,
a second parameter had to be added to trade entry requiring the 21-day ROC
to be higher than its 13-day SMA. Otherwise the appropriate trade exit may
never be signaled. This is a trending system that seeks to capitalize on a
longer- term momentum push upward. To limit losses and profit erosion a
faster momentum signal is used to exit the position.
The backtest was performed over a six year period that included bullish and
bearish periods (1999 to 2005)on a group of six semiconductor stocks includ-
ing SMH, an ETF for the sector. $20,000 was used for the system with 50% of
the cash available used for each trade. A $10 per trade commission was
added to the costs. No stops were part of the initial system test.
Figure 7-4 displays side-by-side charts for a trade generated by the system. 
The image provides two charts for Intel Corporation (INTC) showing trade
entry and trade exit conditions. The position was entered on 12/29/1999 and
exited six calendar days later for a gain of 3%.
A system does not have to be robust to be effective. Because volatility and
trending characteristics vary for different securities, some are better suited
to certain types of systems.

Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

Reviewing system results
Because managing risk is a main theme throughout this book, evaluating a
system with no stops may seem counter-intuitive. When you think about it
though, stop levels are pretty arbitrary — the market doesn’t really care if
you entered a position at $45. It may or may not have support 5% or 10%
below that amount. Allow the system to identify a viable stop-loss point when
backtesting it, then decide if it represents suitable risk for you.
System results were very favorable on a variety of measures for the initial
run, so no filter was added. The Max Adverse Excursion% was reviewed to
determine if a reasonable stop level could be added. A 15% stop was included
and the system test run once again. Results were only slightly less favorable
so the stop was incorporated. 
Charting packages may use different calculations for the same indicator. If
changing systems, be sure to compare indicator values that provide signals
so you’re trading the same system tested. Always consider re-testing the
system on the new platform.
Two forward tests were also run, with and without the stop. A two year
period was used for each and the system remained viable, with much lower
profitability. Expect this to happen with forward tests and actual system per-
formance. This is due to changing conditions and inefficiencies that get
worked out of the markets. That’s one of the reasons why you need to period-
ically review system performance and incorporate reasonable stops when-
ever possible.

A lower percentage stop can be considered to bring the average and median
return closer, but because average gains are outpacing average losses (letting
profits run) you want to first compare the average and median for winning
trades and losing trades separately.
120
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

You can use a standard deviation calculation to assess the stability of profits
for any market approach. 
Adding risk management to a backtest
All trade approaches need to take risk management into account. Focus on
larget adverse moves for a strategy when trying to identify stops that still
allow the strategy to work. If adding this stop maintains profitability and sta-
bility of the system and is consistent with your risk tolerance, you can con-
sider implementing the strategy or system. 
Cutting losses
An approach that is systematic, but not mechanical, can still be backtested.
Regardless of how you go about performing that backtest, you should keep
an eye on large adverse moves that occurred for the trades generated. This
allows you to identify reasonable, systematic filters and stops geared toward
minimizing losses. 
A stop-loss order can result in a larger percentage loss by the time a trade is
executed. A worst-case scenario occurs when a signal is generated at the
close of trading one day and the security has a price gap at the open the 
next day.
Taking profits 
Identifying stop-loss points that manage risk is probably secondhand to you
by now. On the other end of the spectrum, have you ever been in a profitable
trade that starts moving the wrong way? Right around that point you realize
you don’t have a specific exit plan for taking profits. Sometimes you focus so
much on risk that you forget to identify favorable price targets. Or maybe you
did identify a profitable exit point, but conditions start to deteriorate before
that price level is reached. 
In addition to identifying a stop-loss level, identify a trailing stop percentage
or dollar amount to minimize the number of profitable trades that turn into
losses. The trailing stop should be incorporated into your system or strategy
and tested. If you want the system to generate the trailing amount, evaluate
trades with large favorable moves that yielded significantly less in the way of
profits (or turned into losses). After completing your review, you may do as
follows:
 Add a filter that accelerates your exits
 Generate a trailing percentage using max favorable excursion % data
121
Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

Letting profits run
An effective trading approach doesn’t necessarily have to have more winning
trades than losing trades. It just needs profits to outpace declines. That’s
actually the case for many trend-oriented systems. You end up with more
losing trades, but the average value of the loss is much smaller than the aver-
age value of gaining trades. And so goes the mantra, “be sure to cut your
losses while letting profits run.”
Sorting trades by greatest lost to greatest profit allows you to more easily
review statistics for both.
Although you need to identify a method for taking profits, you also have to
avoid cutting profit levels in such a way that they no longer outpace losses.
Trading successfully requires quite a bit of pre-work. You’ll see your trading
evolve by focusing on the following:
1. Cutting losses.
2. Preventing profits from turning into losses.
3. Letting profits run . . .
Shifting from Knowledge to Mastery
Strategy mastery doesn’t mean that every trade you place for a given strat-
egy is profitable — it means that the appropriate conditions were in place
when placing a particular trade, putting the odds in your favor for a prof-
itable trade. Managing the position correctly is also another component that
highlights discipline by exiting a trade if conditions change. It sounds pretty
easy, but strategy mastery can take years to evolve. Your goal is to stay in the
trading game long enough to achieve this mastery.
By focusing first on basic concepts and mechanics, you create a strong foun-
dation that allows you to grasp advanced techniques more quickly. You
implement new strategies via paper trading to avoid the most costly mis-
takes. When you’re ready to take the new strategy live, you can further mini-
mize the cost of mistakes by reducing your position size and remembering to
take profits. This approach keeps you in the markets longer, allowing you to
find and develop strategies that are best suited to your style.
Setting the right pace
There are a ton of great option strategies in this book, with some that proba-
bly pique your interest more than others. Start out paper trading a couple of
122
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

the more straightforward approaches, then transition to live trading with
them. After that check out the strategy that has the most appeal to you, again
by paper trading. There’s no guarantee that market conditions will be con-
ducive to that strategy, so you may prolong your paper trading days until the
market changes or you’re ready to explore a new strategy. But . . . it’s really
important to keep this in mind. You want to focus on strategies that make
sense to you and better suit your style. That’s how you’ll ultimately develop
mastery.
Starting with a few strategies
Learning new strategies is hopefully something you enjoy. It’s amazing to find
out about all the different ways you can make money in the markets. But not
all strategies work in all market conditions. More importantly, they won’t all
suit your style. If you’re new to option trading, stick with one or two basic
strategies to develop a really good understanding of premium changes and
mechanics.
There are a variety of strategies available to you that allow you to make
money in the markets. Just like your preferred method of analysis, you’ll find
you develop a preferred list of strategies that work for you. 
Experienced option traders should identify current market conditions, then
explore one, maybe two strategies that excel given those conditions. Start by
paper trading and progress from there. If there’s a specific strategy that really
intrigues or speaks to you, but conditions aren’t quite right, just paper trade
it. In the long run, it’s better to focus on market approaches that make sense
to you.
Adding strategies as market conditions change
I look at the markets as a lifelong pursuit because conditions are always
changing. Although there’s a continuous cycle of bullish and bearish phases,
the market is never exactly the same. It seems you already recognize this by
purchasing the book in the first place.
When strategies that typically work well for you start weakening, take some
time over the weekend to complete a comprehensive market assessment. You
may detect early signs of a change in conditions.
Option trading allows you to implement strategies that can be profitable
regardless of market conditions. A sampling includes:
 Bullish, low volatility (basic long call, married puts)
 Bullish, high volatility (covered calls, credit spreads — Chapter 11)
123
Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

 Bearish, low volatility (basic long put, debit spreads — Chapter 11)
 Bearish, high volatility (collars, credit spreads — Chapter 11)
 Range-bound, low volatility (butterfly, condor — Chapter 16)
The combination of stock with options or options with options really provide
you with great choices. That can be good and bad news because each
approach requires some time to master. Be careful about checking out a 
strategy haphazardly, then discarding it because “it doesn’t work.” 
Chances are you won’t be trading every strategy available. Most traders try
different ones along the way, then master a smaller number of them. The
experience gained allows them to maximize profits on their favored strategies
(knowing when to hold them), while minimizing their losses (knowing when
to fold them). 
Deciding which option strategies to use is just like market analysis — there
are a variety of ways to approach it, none of which represent the one ‘right’
way. The best approach for you is the one that intuitively makes the most
sense so that when conditions change and things get tougher (and they will),
you have the confidence to stick to your plan.
Achieving mastery through longevity
Experiencing different markets and exploring suitable strategies requires you
to have longevity in the markets. Bull markets can run for years and volatility
conditions can remain stable too. Expect to incur additional losses when mar-
kets transition or when implementing a new strategy. Managing risk by using
limited loss, unlimited gain strategies whenever possible sets a foundation
for longevity. 
Paper trading provides a technique to minimize learning curve losses. A
second method is through proper position sizing. By starting out with
smaller initial positions, potential losses are manageable. Adding rules that
include profit-taking is the icing on the cake.
Successful trading does not happen overnight. Be prepared to spend time
making low-cost mistakes, observing different market conditions, experienc-
ing varying levels of emotion, and developing your trading skills.
124
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Determining appropriate trade sizes
There are different techniques available to identify proper trade sizes. Many
are beyond the scope of this book simply due to space constraints. Two
easily incorporated ones include the following:
 Identifying a maximum dollar amount allocated per trade
 Identifying a maximum percentage amount allocated per trade
I prefer the latter because it automatically changes as your account size
changes.
Options represent a leveraged position (see Chapter 3) so you don’t need to
allocate the same amount to option positions as you do for stocks. In fact, it’s
probably not a good idea to do that at all. Using your stock allocation plan as
a base, you can estimate an initial allocation amount by identifying an option
position that controls the same amount of stock. This serves as a starting
point that should be tested and reviewed.
Establish trade allocation amounts prior to analyzing a specific trade. You
need to know in advance the maximum amount available for an individual
trade so that you minimize your account risk.
When trying a new strategy (after paper trading), further reduce trade sizes
so mistakes are more forgiving. If that means trading in one option contract
sizes, so be it. Remember, you’re not out there to impress Wall Street with
your trade sizes — you’re out there to make money in the markets.
As your skills develop, increase position sizes to those tested allocations.
This will improve profits because option trading costs are often higher than
stock trading costs from a percentage standpoint. If you’ve properly prepared
and continue to manage your risk, increasing position sizes shouldn’t be a
problem. In fact, it should improve results because you’ll realize economies
of scale with trading costs.
Emphasizing profit-taking
Throughout this book there’s an emphasis on managing risk. In this chapter
though there’s an additional emphasis — that’s on profit-taking. It’s not
enough to simply have a high number of profitable trades. Your profits must
include the following:
 Exceed trading costs
 Exceed conservative investment approaches
 Exceed your losses
125
Chapter 7: Kicking the Wheels of a New Strategy

This doesn’t just happen out of the blue, you have to have a plan that
includes reviewing strategy and trade results to put the best profit-taking
rules in place. Such rules should minimize the number of profitable trades
that turn into losses and allow profits to run. Developing these skills means
you’re evolving as a trader.
There are a lot of different price points that can invoke an emotional
response while in a trade. Be sure to identify exit points for a loss as well as
exit points for profits.

Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack
In This Chapter
 Identifying business costs
 Minimizing learning curve costs
 Understanding order execution
T
rading is a business and developing as a trader means evolving as a busi-
ness manager. Understanding the costs associated with the business
helps you budget accordingly. Initially certain costs will be higher and others
will be lower. You’ll likely be paying more for education and your learning
curve (a.k.a. losses) when you start out. As your trading evolves, those costs
will go down while subscriptions to analysis platforms and data services will
go up. 
Always keep in mind that losses are part of operating expenses. Minimizing
them by managing risk is your goal — not eliminating them. This is done by
determining proper trade allocation amounts and maximum loss per trade.
Effectively executing trades is another step toward minimizing losses. I cover
all these topics in this chapter.
Managing Your Costs 
There are a variety of costs to consider with your trading — some are higher
when you first start and many continue throughout your career. You need to
think of trading as a business and manage these expenses so you can mini-
mize them as your business matures. The expense categories included in the
following list will all continue throughout your trading career, but some will
begin higher than others:
 Education: Education expenses include materials, courses, and learning
curve costs for new markets and strategies. These costs will decrease as
time progresses, but will remain on-going as stay current with market
conditions (books, periodicals) and continue to develop new strategies. 

One of the largest education costs is your learning curve. These decline
as you figure out how to: 
• Trade under best conditions for the strategy
• Use options with the appropriate liquidity
• Develop paper-trading skills
• Allocate the appropriate amount to the trade
• Effectively enter orders for the best exit
• Take profits
 Analysis costs: As your skills progress and your trading generates regu-
lar profits, you may add analytical tools to your business costs. Talking
to fellow traders that use such tools and finding out which ones you may
be able to take for a spin using free trials are good places to start. Such
costs represent one of the few that may increase over time. Be sure to
only subscribe to a limited number of services so you can make the
most out of them. 
 Trading costs: You have to not only have to account for commission 
but also for slippage. Slippage is the cost associated with the market
spread — the difference between the bid and the ask. A good exercise 
is to calculate commission and slippage percentages for different size
option positions (i.e. 1, 5, 10 contracts) established at different price
points (i.e. $1, $5, $10).
Taxes are another consideration, so you need to identify what types of
trading will be completed in different accounts. In addition, when estab-
lishing certain option positions, you may trigger a tax event in the
underlying. Be sure to contact your accountant about option trading tax
considerations. The bottom line for these cumulative costs is that in the
long-term, they must outpace a buy and hold approach.
If you borrow from your broker via trading on margin, you need to add
monthly margin interest charges to your trading costs as well. Short
option positions have margin requirements that can get complicated.
The main consideration for this margin is whether the option is covered
or naked. If you decide to move forward with strategies requiring
margin, be sure to contact your broker so you fully understand all of the
calculations and account requirements. Then add these costs to your
expenses.
Losses are another trading cost that should be considered part of doing busi-
ness. They will likely be higher at first, but reduced with time and experience.
Following these trading plan guidelines should help keep these initial costs to
a minimum:
128
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

 Determining the trading allocations: As part of an overall trading plan
you should identify both your total trading assets and your maximum
allocations for different assets and strategies. Stock and ETF trading will
require larger allocations than option positions. You may even want to
break this down further to include a maximum allocation amount for
new strategies based on paper trading results.
 Calculating trade size: You must also determine guidelines for maxi-
mum position size prior to entering any trade. Once these are set, identi-
fying the maximum number of contracts you can allocate to a position is
pretty straightforward. Divide the option price by an allocation amount
below your maximum and you’re all set. Don’t anticipate using the max
allocation.
 Identifying maximum acceptable loss on trades: Your maximum accept-
able loss can be defined as a dollar value or a percentage. I prefer the
latter because a fixed dollar amount can be significant with smaller
trades or if your trading assets decrease. Periodically perform an analy-
sis on your trade results to determine if your losses remain at reason-
able and sustainable levels.
 Focusing on entry and exit rules: Option entries are often driven by
trending and volatility conditions, but may also be time oriented with
positions created prior to specific scheduled event. Option exists can
also be time driven (post-event or pre-expiration) or may be triggered by
movement in the underlying security. Regardless, these methods must
be focused on supporting your risk management and maximum allow-
able loss. 
Exiting with technical indicators typically does not provide you with a price
for use with risk calculations. A maximum loss price should also be identified.
Optimizing Order Execution
Successfully trading options means gaining proficiency with order execution.
A variety of factors come into the mix here including:
 Understanding order placement rules unique to options
 Knowing how different order types work
 Learning how to use combination orders for multi-leg positions
 Gaining skill while using the underlying to identify option exits
 Recognizing your broker’s role in execution quality 
129
Chapter 8: Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack

There is also a learning curve for executing option trades, but for the most
part these are mechanical steps that can be easily mastered with some prac-
tice. This will go a long way toward successful strategy implementation. 
The ask, or best price available from sellers, is also referred to as the offer.
Understanding option orders
Options are not limited to a certain number of contracts the way stock is con-
strained by its float. Contracts are created by the marketplace, so they have
some unique considerations when placing orders for them. An option is cre-
ated when two traders create a new position; or open a trade. This increases
open interest for that specific option. Open interest decreases when traders
close existing positions. 
Float is the term used to describe the number of shares outstanding and
available to trade for a stock. 
Open interest doesn’t get updated on a trade by trade basis, it’s more an end
of day reconciliation through the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). That
explains why option orders are placed in a specific manner — the OCC needs
to keep the accounting straight. It also means you’ll be communicating a little
more information when placing option orders.
Knowing basic option order rules
Buying or selling options can be done in any order. Choosing whether you
want to be long (buy) or short (sell) a contract depends on your strategy and
the option approval level for your account. You can’t jump out of the gate cre-
ating unlimited risk, short option positions until your broker approves you
for it — after checking your temperature of course.
The current bid and ask price for a security is referred to as its current
market.
Because contracts are created and retired, you need to enter orders in a way
that supports this end of day reconciliation by the options markets. You need
to identify: 
 A new position you’re creating as an opening order
 An existing position you’re exiting as a closing order
Using a call option as an example, Table 8-1 provides you with the transac-
tions required to enter and exit a long call or short call position.

When exercising or getting assigned on an option contract, there is no clos-
ing transaction. The same holds true for options expiring worthless. In each
case the appropriate amount of contracts are removed from your account
after the transaction completes or expiration weekend comes to an end.
Reviewing order types
You have a variety of different order types available to you, some guarantee
executions (i.e. market order) while others guarantee price (i.e. limit orders).
Although there are unique considerations for option orders, this execution
versus price distinction remains the same. Effectively managing order execu-
tion means knowing when it’s more important to get the order executed
versus the price where it’s executed. When in doubt, consider what limits
your risk.

tee execution or price.

Generally, limit orders are good for entering a position so you only establish
those that are within your trading allocations. If you need to guarantee an
exit only a market order accomplishes this for you.
A stop order is your risk management tool for trading with discipline. The
stop level triggers a market order if the option trades or moves to that level.
The stop represents a price less favorable than the current market and is 
131
Chapter 8: Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack

typically used to minimize losses for an existing position when emotions run
high. Placing a stop order is similar to monitoring a security and placing a
market order when certain market conditions are met.
Stops are superior to stop limit orders for managing risk because they guar-
antee an execution if the stop condition is met.
In terms of duration, the two primary periods of time your order will be in
place are:
 The current trading session or following session if the market is closed 
 Until the order is cancelled by you or the broker clears the order (possi-
bly in 60 days — check with your broker)
Order duration is identified by adding Day or good ’til canceled (GTC). Market
orders guarantee execution so they are good for the day only.
If you want to cancel an active order, you do so by submitting a Cancel Order.
After the instructions are completed, you receive a report back notifying you
the order was successfully canceled. It is possible for the order to already
have been executed, in which case you receive a report back indicating, too
late to cancel, filled with the execution details. Needless to say, you can’t
cancel a market order.
Changing an order is a little different than canceling one because you can
change an order one of two ways:
 Cancel the original order, wait for the report confirming the cancellation,
and then enter a new order
 Submit a Cancel/Change or Replace Order which replaces the existing
order with the revised qualifiers unless the original order was already
executed. If that happens, the replacement order is canceled.
Even though the order process is incredibly fast, when replacing an order it’s
better to use the Change/Cancel approach. Otherwise you must wait for the
cancellation confirmation to avoid duplicating an executed order. 
There are other less widely used order types available. Check with your
broker if you need additional information about them or if you need help
placing a new order type. For the most part, they’d much rather be on the
phone helping you place an order than explaining to you why the trade
wasn’t executed as you expected. 
132
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

It is absolutely, positively your responsibility to understand order types and
how they are executed (or not) in the market. Do I sound wishy-washy on this? 
Identifying option stop order challenges 
Just in case your eyes haven’t glazed over yet, there are a few additional con-
siderations specific to option stop orders. Maybe more than a few, but I’ll try
to focus on couple of the major ones. An option stop order can be triggered
in two ways:
 If a trade is executed at the stop price
 If the bid or ask moves to the stop price 
Because option contract volume is much lower than stocks, the quote fre-
quently is the trigger for a stop order. Otherwise it’s possible for hours to
pass before an actual trade triggers the stop. At that point, who knows where
the underlying would be trading and what the quote would be when your
market order got triggered. 
Typically when placing a stop order on an option you use a maximum risk
amount to target an exit price for the option. It’s an estimated amount since
the order may be triggered by the option quote and you won’t know in
advance the spread amount when it’s triggered. 
The worst-case scenario for this type of order is to have the underlying secu-
rity gap up or down (against you) at the open, causing the order to be trig-
gered well below your risk target. Actually, the only thing worse than that is
to have no order in place and be left with a position that keeps declining.
Some systems allow you to have two standing orders for the same underly-
ing. They include a stop loss order (risk management) and a limit order
(profit-taking). If your platform allows a “one cancels other” trade type, then
enter such orders using that feature. If not, be extremely careful about enter-
ing two orders — they both may be filled.
A one cancels other order allows you to enter two different orders that are
active in the market. If and when one of those orders is executed, the system
automatically cancels the other order. If this order set-up is not available to
you, having two live orders for the same position is pretty dangerous. A
strong swing in the position can result in both orders being executed, possi-
bly leaving you with an unlimited risk position.
The best market for bidding and asking (offering) prices are referred to as the
NBBO, which stands for the National Best Bid-Offer. The NBBO represents
composite information from the various option exchanges.
133
Chapter 8: Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack

A sell stop order gets triggered when the option trades at or below your stop
price or if the ask reaches your stop. A buy stop order gets triggered when
the option trades at or above your stop or the bid reaches your stop. Because
you sell on the bid and buy on the ask, you need to account for the bid-ask
spread when determining an option stop level. 
A second issue with option stop orders is duration. The option contract
you’re trading may only allow day stop orders. If this is the case, you’ll need
to enter a new stop order each evening after the market closes.
If you’re used to trading stock, don’t assume option orders work the same
exact way. Be sure you know the implications of all orders you place.
Entering a new position
Okay getting ready to enter an option order? Just a few more points ahead.
Option positions can include:
 Single option contracts
 Options contracts and stock
 Multiple option contracts
A quick review of single contract order entry is provided, followed by combi-
nation orders.
Creating a single option position
A single contract option order entry requires information about:
 The transaction type (buy or sell)
 Position information (open or close)
 Contract specifics (underlying, month, strike price and option type)
 Order type (market, limit, . . .)
 Order duration (day, good ’til canceled, . . .)
After entering your order, it goes from broker’s system to one of six option
exchanges. The exchanges are linked so your order can be executed on the
exchange receiving the order or it can be forwarded to the exchange with the
best market. Technology makes the process is seamless and speedy. Some
brokers also allow you to direct the order to the exchange of your choice.
134
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

Option exchange linkage and the introduction of penny increment trading has
minimized the benefit to direct access trading.
Creating a combination position
Combination positions can be entered as a single combined order or individ-
ual orders for each portion of it (a.k.a. legging in). An advantage to combining
the order is that you have a better chance of having the trade executed
between the bid-ask spread. This applies to both option-stock combinations
as well as option-option combinations.
Assuming ABC is trading at 33.12 by 33.14 and the ABC Jan 30 put is trading
at 1.00 by 1.05. You wish to place a limit order for a married put position that
is good for the current market day, so the combination is entered as follows:
 Buy 100 shares of ABC
 Simultaneously Buy to Open 1 ABC Jan 30 put
 For a limit (net debit) of $34.17, good for the day
All legs for a combination order will either be executed or not executed.
The qualifiers for a combination order are the same for each leg and you can
only get filled on both portions of the order. Chapter 11 introduces spread
trades including a Bull Call Spread which is a debit position that combines
two calls. A long call is purchased at the same time a less expensive call
expiring the same month is sold. 
Using ABC, you create a Bull Call Spread by purchasing a $30 call and selling
a $35 call. The quotes for the two options follow:
 Mar 30.00 Call: Bid $3.10 by Ask $3.30
 Mar 35.00 Call: Bid $1.00 by Ask $1.05
Because you’re buying the 30 strike call (Ask $3.30) and selling the 35 strike
call (Bid $1.00), the net debit at the quote is $2.30. You can identify this net
debit as a limit amount for the spread order or can try to reduce the cost by
reducing the debit slightly. Entering an order slightly lower than the market is
accomplished as follows:
 Buy to Open 1 ABC Mar 30 call and
 Simultaneously Sell to Open 1 ABC Mar 35 call
 For a limit (net debit) of $2.25, good for the day
135
Chapter 8: Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack

Again, the qualifiers for a combination order are the same for each leg and
you can only get filled on both portions of the order. 
Fill is another term for order execution.
Exchange traders agree to make a market on the list of securities they handle
which subjects them to risk that they must manage constantly. They do this
for single option orders by buying and selling the underlying stock or other
options to hedge the risk (see Chapter 12). 
Spread trades are different — they represent a naturally hedged position and
are appealing to the trader regardless of whether it creates a debit or credit
in their account. When trading spreads you should:
 Moderately reduce the limit below the market on a spread debit order 
 Moderately increase the limit above the market on a spread credit order
Spreads have high appeal on the trading floor; try to shave a little off the
market price for these orders.
Spread orders are less automated on the exchanges, which means it can take
a little more time to receive an execution report. With this in mind, expect the
process of replacing an order to really take some time if you’ve shaved too
much off the price. If executing the spread is more important than shaving
some money from the current quote, stay closer to the current market. Prices
can move significantly in the time it takes you to receive a confirmed cancel-
lation report for an unexecuted order.
Executing a quality trade
Execution quality describes a broker’s ability to provide speedy order execu-
tions at or better than the current market for the security. This means if you
have an order to buy a security with a bid of $22.95 and an ask of $22.98, your
order will be filled in a timely manner at $22.98 or better. When considering
brokers, good execution quality is as important as reasonable commission
costs.
Trading platforms are so fast these days and a lot of orders never even touch
an exchange trader’s hands — it’s all about the technology. If you’re having
significant option execution problems it’s possible your broker does not
handle many option trading accounts and you should consider using a differ-
ent broker for the option trading portion of your assets. 
136
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

A variety of factors can impact your execution quality and are generally good
for you to know about when trading. I discuss a few of these in the sections
that follow.
Fast markets 
A security is in a fast market when a very large volume of orders is flowing to
the market and it’s difficult for the market maker or specialist to maintain an
orderly market for the security. Volume is high and quotes and execution
reports are delayed. Although technology has reduced the number of securi-
ties placed in Fast Markets by the exchange, traders must be aware that stan-
dard rules for execution are waived at this time. 
When a stock goes into a fast market, so do the options derived from it.
If you place a market order when fast markets are declared, the trade may
end up getting executed minutes after the order is placed when the price is
significantly different. The trade could cost you much more than anticipated. 
If you must exit a position, you may have no choice but to trade under these
conditions, but consider entering a marketable limit order that provides you
with a cushion because it’s not uncommon for movements to occur quickly in
both directions. As always though, managing your risk comes first.
Trader-driven conditions
Consider your trading platform and connectivity when identifying factors
that impact order execution. If the time it takes to get a quote and submit an
order is lengthy, the delay in obtaining an order execution may be on your
end and not the broker’s or exchange’s. Given the amount of bandwidth
required for trading platforms, a slow computer or connection could put you
behind the trading curve. 
If you’re trading this way and can’t upgrade, keep the real short-term trading
to a minimum and consider using marketable limit orders instead of a market
order any time you enter a new position so you can control your costs. 
Execution delays may not be a broker or exchange issue — it may be your
system.
Booked order
When an order that is better than the current bid or ask enters the option
market, the exchange can fill it or post it as the current best bid or best ask. If
this is done the order is considered a booked order. The impact to you is that
the depth of the market at this price may be pretty small — the order may
represent just one or two contracts. Execution quality rules don’t apply to
such quotes.
137
Chapter 8: Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack

Electronic review
Your broker may have an electronic order review process that delays routing
your orders to an exchange. This delay can be several minutes. You may
trade actively and never encounter such a delay or experience such a quick
review that order routing appears to be seamless. Only a very small fraction
of retail orders are reviewed during any given trading day. Check with your
broker if it appears to be an issue.
Exiting an existing position
The order platforms and trading screens available today also provide you
with a variety of approaches to exit an option position. In addition to placing
an order for the specific option contract, you can place contingent orders
based on the movement of the underlying security. This is extremely helpful
in protecting your downside and establishing exits based on technical levels.
Understanding what to expect in actual trading is pretty important. There are
times when different types of orders are appropriate, but without a lot of
experience using them, you’re not sure how to proceed. Your broker should
always welcome your call when clarifying exchange rules or proper order
entry for their trade platforms. 
There are SEC rules in place requiring brokers to provide execution statistics
on different orders. The regulation primarily covers market and marketable
limit stock orders, but also include some reporting for options. 
Managing risk with single options
There are a couple of different ways to manage risk when you hold a single
option position. The first includes using a stop order on the option itself and
was discussed earlier. The second involves placing a conditional or contin-
gent order on the underlying stock.
Conditional or contingent orders refer to those that rely on movement in the
underlying or an index to trigger an option order. There are a variety of crite-
ria that can be established on the underlying or index, including
 Closing price equal to, greater than or less than a certain value
 Intraday price equal to, greater than or less than a certain value
 Percentage changes in price
 Quote levels equal to, greater than or less than a certain value
138
Part II: Evaluating Markets, Sectors, and Strategies 

After setting the criteria for the trigger, you enter the specifics for the option
order, which has the standard qualifiers available. A big distinction between 
a stop order and a contingent order is that a stop order is active on the
exchange while a contingent order is active on your broker’s system. The
market doesn’t have a view of your contingent order. 
An advantage to placing stop orders to exit a position versus contingent
orders on the underlying stock is that you can better estimate the trade value
with the option order.
Some of the triggers appear similar to a stop order for the option, but remem-
ber the contingent order generates an option order when you have much less
of a handle on where the option is trading. You can estimate the expected
option value using the price of the underlying and the option Greeks. 
The absolute best reason to use contingent orders is they allow you to iden-
tify technical (or fundamental) exit points for the stock. Since managing risk
is critical, this approach allows you to exit the option when conditions in the
underlying have changed.
Consider using an option calculator to estimate an option’s value when a con-
tingent order is triggered.
Be aware of all active orders with your broker, there is a potential to dupli-
cate them if your platform doesn’t have safeguards. Having triggers set above
the market and below the market at the same time can be dangerous. The
best way to manage this is by using the one cancels other (OCO) order type
which can be discussed with your broker. 
Exiting a combination
Combination orders are exited in the same way they are created — either by
legging out of the position or by entering a combination order for a credit or
debit. When presenting a hedged position to the floor, consider shaving off a
little from the debit or adding a bit to the credit. Unless you’re very close to
expiration for the position, you’ll likely have the order executed at the more
favorable limit.
Rolling an option position
You may hear people talk about rolling an option and wonder what exactly is
involved in this process. Roll is used to describe an option transaction that
involves closing one position and opening a similar one for the same stock.
It’s common for this process to occur near expiration as protective or income
positions are pushed further out in time. 
139
Chapter 8: Mapping Out Your Plan of Attack

Rolling out involves pushing back expiration for a strategy. When rolling an
option, you place a combination order similar to the any other combination.
Because the expiration date is so close, you may not be able to get a more
favorable execution for the combination.
You end up paying an extra commission to close the original option, which
probably would have expired worthless, but you are also gaining some time
value for the new option sold. 
Instead of rolling the option out in time, you can roll up in price to avoid
assignment risk or capitalize on atypically high implied volatility for a higher
strike option. 
A third alternative to rolling out or rolling up is rolling down the strike price.
Again, you may elect to do this to avoid assignment risk or capitalize on atyp-
ically high implied volatility for a lower strike option. 
These rolling combinations can also be combined so that you can roll out
and up or roll out and down, depending on the price for the underlying,
you’re market outlook for it, and implied volatility conditions.

What Every Trader
Needs to Know
About Options

In this part . . .
O
ptions provide you with some distinct trading advan-
tages, but like other types of securities, they are not
without risk. In fact, used the wrong way, they can be very
risky. By understanding option styles and the risks associ-
ated with each you can manage that risk. Even if you chose
to use options on a limited basis, you can consider a few
core strategies to limit your overall market risk. These 
can be implemented with existing stock positions, single
option positions, or through combination option positions. 
All of the strategies provided in this part focus on 
alternative, reduced risk approaches to stock positions.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and option strategies using
ETFs are also discussed here to provide some insights 
on ways to reduce portfolio volatility as well as single
stock risk.

K
nowing your risk as a trader means you really understand the market
mechanics for the securities you use, as well as the different ways it can
hit you with losses. Options present you with a unique challenge because
they come with an expiration date — you need to know how to handle a secu-
rity that eventually “goes away.” In this chapter, I focus on key points about
indexes and index options that impact trading. I also address exercise style
exercise, and assignment issues, as well as other things you need to be wary
of going into expiration.
Nailing Down Index Options
You can group most monthly listed stock options together when applying
strategies or managing a position because their basic features match. For
instance, the last trading date and exercise cutoff time for each are the same
for all monthly stock options. Index options are slightly more challenging
because those things can vary by contract. Here’s a primer on index and
index options to help you avoid some unpleasant surprises.
Getting to the nitty-gritty of indexes
An index is a tool that combines individual stocks, bonds, or commodities
into one value so you can track the health of a particular market. This helps
you target your trading on broad, diversified markets or narrower, focused
ones. 

Taking a peek at popular indexes
You’re probably familiar with indexes, by name at least. The refresher on the
next page shows you a few of the most popular indexes Wall Street has to
offer and what they do:
 S&P 500 (SPX): If you want to get a feel for the health of a diverse group
of U.S. large-cap stocks, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) is the one to do just
that. It is used by professional money managers and individual investors
all over the globe to check the pulse of the U.S. stock market. 
 The Dow (a.k.a. the Dow Jones Industrial Average): To gain insight on
how 30 select manufacturers in the U.S. stock market are doing, use
another widely followed index, the Dow.
 Nasdaq-100 (NDX): If you like a faster pace, the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX)
is made up of the 100 largest, nonfinancial companies trading on the
Nasdaq exchange. The index is made up primarily with stocks in the
technology industry and is most frequently used to measure this sector.
It usually swings up and down more widely than the S&P 500 or the Dow.
The market capitalization or cap of a company is calculated by multiplying
the current stock price by the total number of shares outstanding. Market
cap sizes include small-, mid-, and large.
Shifting to a more specific focus and showcasing variety
If you wish to focus on a more specific group of stocks, this list shows you
the wide variety of indexes available:
 PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX): If you want to concentrate on
just semiconductor stocks rather than all technology stocks, one index
you may want to track is the SOX. It’s made up of 19 different companies
in the semiconductor industry.
 AMEX Select Utility Index (UUO): In addition to choosing stocks in one
sector, the Select Utility Index ranks the group by dividend payments
and uses the top 20 ranked companies to create the index. The names in
the group are updated quarterly.
 Russell 2000 Growth Index: This index allows you to narrow your focus
on two levels — it tracks stocks that are both small-cap and growth ori-
ented. Expect big moves in both directions because small-cap names
take less volume than large-cap names to impact where the stock trades.
Because an index is made up of a group of stocks, declines in one stock can
be off-set by increases in another stock. As a result, you’ll find that indexes
tend to be less volatile than individual stocks. 
144
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Creating indexes and creating change in stocks
It’s important to understand that not all indexes are created equally (well . . .
one is). The three ways to construct an index are as follows:
 Price-weighted: Favors higher priced stocks
 Market cap-weighted: Favors higher cap stocks
 Equal dollar-weighted: Each stock has same impact
By having a basic handle on the different methods, you gain a much better
feel for how changes in one stock translate into changes for the index. The
construction names should help. The following examples show you what I
mean:
 When a high-priced stock declines in a price-weighted index, it leads to
bigger moves down in an index compared to declines in a lower priced
stock. The Dow is an example of a price-weighted index that is affected
more by Boeing (trading near $100) than Pfizer (trading near $25).
 A market-cap weighted index such as the S&P 500 is impacted more
by higher market capitalization stocks regardless of price. Even
though Microsoft may only be trading at $30 per share, its market cap 
is huge — about $290 billion. When it moves up or down it creates a
greater change in the S&P 500 than say, Amgen which trades at $55 per
share, but only has a market cap of approximately $64 billion.
 All the stocks in an equal-dollar weighted index should have the same
impact on the index value. To keep the index balance, a quarterly
adjustment of the stocks is required. This prevents a stock that has seen
large gains during the last three months from having too much weight on
the index.
The best way to obtain specific construction information for an index is by
accessing the Web site of the company that created the index. You can often
bring up a list of component stocks, bonds, or commodities for the index,
along with other useful information. For instance, you can access index
levels, charts, construction approach and component lists for Dow Jones
indexes when you access: www.djindexes.com. 
So who creates these indexes and why should you care? Different groups con-
struct them, including financial information companies, exchanges, or broker-
age firms. By knowing the company that creates them, you know how to get
the index detail you need for different strategies. Table 9-1 provides sample
indexes that include the company that constructs them and how you can use
them.

Capitalizing on an index with options
In addition to options whose value is derived from an individual stock, you
can also find many options that are based on index levels. In fact, the S&P 500
(SPX) is one of the most widely traded option series for all stock and index
options, so it’s very easy to create and exit a position. But because you can’t
actually own an index, how can you deliver one if you chose to exercise an
index put?
The answer is . . . you can’t. Index options don’t actually involve the exchange
of an asset. Index options are referred to as cash-settled because the exercise
and assignment process involves the transfer of cash instead of a security.
The amount of cash is determined by the intrinsic value of the option. (See
Chapter 3 for more detail on intrinsic value.)
146
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Determining value
Options on an index are very similar to options on a stock. There are calls
and puts with different expiration months and strike prices available. This list
identifies factors that determine the option’s value:
 Its type (call or put): Calls increase in value as the index increases while
puts increase in value when the index decreases.
 The value of the index level relative to the option’s strike price: A call
has intrinsic value when the strike price is below the index level. When
the index is trading below the call strike price, the option only has time
value. On the other hand, a put has intrinsic value when the index is
trading below the put strike price.
 Time to expiration: The more time until expiration, the greater the
chance an option will have value at expiration. So you pay more money
for options with more time until expiration, regardless of type.
 Historical volatility: An index that has made bigger moves in the past
will have options that are more expensive than an index that historically
moves less because there is more uncertainty about where it will be at
expiration. Index gains or losses can be significant.
 Volatility expected in the future: The expected future movement affects
an option’s value in the same way its past movement does — in fact, it’s
partially based on it. The greater the potential move, the more expen-
sive the option.
Detailing option components
The main components of an index option are basically the same as those for
a stock option. (See Chapter 2 for more detail.) The main difference is that an
index isn’t a physical asset — this affects the exercise or assignment process
though. 
Here’s a list of index option components similar to stock options:
 Underlying: Name of the index the option is based on.
 Strike Price: Level that determines where the owner has rights and the
seller has obligations.
 Premium: Total cost of the option based on the current market price
and the option multiplier.
 Multiplier: Number used to determine the total value of the option pre-
mium and the exercise value.
 Exercise/Assignment Value: Amount credited to the option owner and
debited from the option owner seller. It is determined by multiplying the
strike price by the option multiplier.
 Settlement Value: Index closing value used to determine intrinsic value.
147
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

Moneyness is another term used to describe the option’s intrinsic value. It is
the amount an index closes above a call option strike price or below a put
option strike price. Moneyness is zero for out-of-the-money options at 
expiration.
Suppose the SPX closes at 1,523 at June expiration and you own one June
1,520 call. Since a short option holder can’t deliver the SPX to you, they sat-
isfy their obligation in cash. You receive a $300 credit in your account and the
short contract holder is debited the same amount. This is how the cash
amount is determined:
(Index Settlement Value – Call Strike Price) × Multiplier
(1,523 – 1,520) × 100 = $300
You probably noticed the cash settlement amount at expiration is similar to
the intrinsic value calculation for a stock option. The two types of options do
have many similarities, as well as important distinctions. In the next section I
provide you with some differences between stock and index options. 
Watching Out for Style Risk 
I’m not worried about you trading last year’s big fad — I want to make sure
that you know options have style. An option’s style primarily refers to the
way the contract is exercised, but it also impacts the end of trading for the
option. You have to know where to look to find an index option’s style and
how it affects you.
If you don’t know the style for a particular option, you could end up with an
unpleasant surprise . . . such as missing an opportunity to sell an index call
contract before it takes a tumble on the settlement value day.
The U.S. markets trade two styles for option contracts:
 American style: If you own an American-style option you can exercise
your rights at any point up to the exercise cutoff time.
 European style: If you own a European-style option you can only exer-
cise your rights on a designated date.
American-style options
Options that use stock for the deliverable package are American style. Unless
stated otherwise, I refer to American-style stock options whenever I use the
148
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

general term “option contract” in this book. You can determine an option’s
style by checking out its product specification sheet available from the
Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) or the different option exchanges. The
OCC Web site (www.optionsclearing.com) and exchange Web sites serve
as excellent resources for this information.
Here are instructions for accessing some popular index options: 
 CBOE: www.cboe.com/products/IndexOptions.aspx
 PHLX: www.phlx.com/products/index.html
 AMEX: www.amex.com, select “Index” from the “Other Products” menu
 ISE: www.iseoptions.com, select “Index Options” from “Products
Traded”
American-style stock options have these characteristics:
 When initiated by the OCC, the option contract trades from that point in
time until the last trading day prior to option expiration. Recall that
option expiration is the Saturday following the third Friday of the month.
 After purchased, these contracts can be exercised by the holder at any
point during the life of the contract. Retail brokers have different
requirements for submitting exercise instructions — find out your
broker’s specific rules. In most cases, you can exercise a long contract at
least an hour after the close on the last trading day prior to expiration.
 After assigned the option seller must fulfill their obligation under the
contract by delivering or taking delivery of the option package (usually
100 shares of stock for a stock option).
 The option seller can “buy to close” the option in the market prior to the
close on the last day of trading to offset the position and alleviate the
obligation. 
European-style options
Options that use an index to derive its value are often, but not always
European style. This type of option has a specified exercise date if you are
long the contract. So you can’t exercise the option prior to that date the way
you can with American-style options. Not only is there a specified exercise
date for an index option, but this date also varies by index — there’s not one
common index exercise day each month. 
149
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

With this in mind, it’s extremely important for you to check the product spec-
ification sheet prior to trading one of these contracts. Key dates for you to
note for European-style index options include:
 Last trading date: The last date the contract can be traded in the 
market — it may be two days prior to expiration.
 Settlement date: The date (and time) used to determine the index clos-
ing value at expiration.
 Exercise date: The date in which a long contract holder can exercise
their rights under the contract.
Some index options stop trading on a Thursday rather than a Friday so you
need to know the specifics to properly manage your position. The style desig-
nation, expiration, and exercise dates, and other critical trading details are all
included in the option contract specifications available from the OCC or dif-
ferent exchanges that trade the ocntract.
The stock option package identifies the deliverable asset(s) for a contract.
Although there are securities that track an index, indexes themselves are 
not physical securities. As a result, index options settle in cash rather than a
physical asset because a trader can’t deliver an index. This cash-settlement
approach applies to index options regardless of exercise style.
European-style index options have these characteristics:
 When initiated by the OCC, the option contract trades from that point in
time until the specified Last Trading Date which is usually two trading
days prior to option expiration. Check the contract specifications to
determine the last trading date for each index option.
 After purchased, these contracts can only be exercised by the holder on
the exercise date which is usually the last business day before options
expiration. Retail brokers have different requirements for submitting
exercise instructions so you need to contact your broker to get their
specific rules — which may be different than stock option exercise.
 When assigned, the index option seller must fulfill their obligation under
the contract with a cash settlement. The appropriate amount of money
is debited from the account.
 The option seller can “buy to close” the option in the market prior to the
exercise date and close of trading for the contract to offset the position
and alleviate the obligation.
You should note that not all index options are European style. The S&P 100
Index (OEX) includes the top-100 stocks in the SPX and is an example of an
American-style index option. These contracts can be exercised at any time
during the life of the option.
150
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Indexes are generally less volatile than stock and a diverse index such as the
S&P 100 is generally less volatile than a sector-oriented index. That’s because
a group of stocks in the same industry tends to respond the same way to
news, pushing the index in one direction. That won’t necessarily happen with
a diverse index because some news can be bullish for one industry and bear-
ish for another. 
The S&P 500 Index is one of the most widely followed indexes and options on
the index are offered by the CBOE as a proprietary product. They are high-
volume contracts used by many institutional traders, so they are very liquid.
Using this option contract as an example, here are some things to note from
the specification available at www.cboe.com:
 Underlying symbol: SPX
 Multiplier: 100
 Premium: Quote x Multiplier, so 1 point is equal to $100
 Expiration date: Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration
month
 Exercise style: European — options generally may be exercised on the
last business day before expiration, usually a Friday.
 Last trading day: Trading usually stops on the business day (usually a
Thursday) prior to the day the exercise-settlement value is calculated.
 Settlement of option exercise: The exercise-settlement value (SET) is
calculated on the last business day before expiration using the first
reported sales price for each component stock from the market where
the stock is listed. This day is usually a Friday.
 Margin: Check the specification margin rules and then check your
broker’s rules which may be more stringent.
 Trading hours: 8:30 a.m. – 3:15 p.m. Central Time.
Additional information is available, but key elements are previously listed. 
Not all European-style options have the same specifications — one may cal-
culate the settlement value using an opening price while another may use
closing values from the previous day. To trade an index option, first check the
specs!
Exercising Your Options American Style
How you exercise an option is much more straightforward than whether or
not to exercise, so I cover mechanics first. As a retail trader, you provide
exercise instructions to your broker who then provides these instructions to
151
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

the OCC. The OCC randomly assigns a broker with accounts holding the same
option short and the broker assigns one of those accounts.
When you own an American-style call or put, you have the right to exercise
the contract at any point up until your broker’s exercise cutoff time. You
exercise the contract by submitting exercise instructions to the broker either
by phone or electronically. 
It can’t be stressed enough: do not assume that you have the same exercise
cutoff time as your trading partner, a clearing firm, or anyone else. Always
check the specific cut-off time and exercise process with your broker. Be sure
to leave sufficient time to reach them and provide instructions.
Mechanically speaking
I recommend contacting your broker ahead of time to check their exercise
process — you want this information in advance so everything goes smoothly
when you actually need to submit instructions. Prior to exercising a stock
option contract, be sure to check the following:
 For calls, that sufficient money is in the account to pay for the stock 
purchased
 For puts, that shares are in the account or that you are able (and wish
to) create a short stock position. This would be prohibited in a retire-
ment account.
Definitely ask any questions you may have during the broker discussion.
Even if you can submit exercise instructions electronically, you may want to
contact your broker directly the first few times you complete the process. 
What you see is what you get
Although clearing and brokerage systems are getting more efficient all the
time, you may not immediately see the exercise take place when you submit
instructions. Typically you’ll see the appropriate transactions in your
account by the next trading day. 
When you exercise an option, the actual option position is reduced by the
number of contracts exercised and a stock buy or sell transaction appears.
After you submit exercise instructions to your broker the action is final. If
you decide to exercise your call rights to purchase a stock at 10 a.m. on a 
152
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

certain day and by 2 p.m. that same day the stock drops dramatically due to
bad news, you cannot cancel your exercise instructions.
When you exercise a put and do not have the underlying stock in your
account, you create a short position. This means a previously limited risk
position is now technically an unlimited risk position because a stock can
just continue to rise. Be sure you consider the exercise ramifications before
submitting instructions.
To exercise or not, that is the question
Before you exercise an option, there are a couple of calculations you need to
complete to decide if it’s the best approach. You want to make sure you maxi-
mize profits by checking two alternatives:
 Exercise the rights under the contract to buy or sell stock
 Sell the option, then buy or sell the stock in the market
As a basic rule of thumb, complete both of these calculations when the
option contract has time value (premium greater than the intrinsic value). It’s
a good habit to always complete the checks when first using options. The last
thing you want to do is walk away from money on the table . . . or in the
market.
The option exercise decision is different than the stock ownership decision.
You need to consider the most profitable way to execute your transaction in
the market, which is why you want to calculate both alternatives provided in
this section.
Here’s an example to show you what I mean. Suppose you own 100 shares of
ABC. You purchased the stock at $23 per share and at the same time pur-
chased one 22.50 put for $0.50. Later the stock is at $27, but news just hit that
ABC is under investigation for funny accounting practices. The price plum-
mets to $21 per share and the 22.50 put immediately moves to $2.50. What
should you do?
Assuming you no longer wish to own the stock, you need to calculate the net
gains or losses for the two alternatives available: 
 Alternative 1: Exercise put
Buy 100 ABC @ $23 = Debit: $2,300
Buy 1 ABC 22.50 put @ $0.50 = Debit: $50
Exercise Right to Sell @ 22.50 = Credit: $2,250
Net Loss = $100
153
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

 Alternative 2: Sell put and sell stock in market
Buy 100 ABC @ $23 = Debit: $2,300
Buy 1 ABC 22.50 put @ $0.50 = Debit: $50
Sell 100 ABC @ $21 = Credit: $2,100
Sell 1 ABC 22.50 put @ $2.50 = Credit: $250
Net Gain = $0
It makes more sense for you to sell both the option and stock in the market.
After you add trading costs the difference narrows but will still likely favor
the second alternative.
Generally when an option has more than $0.20 time value remaining the
second alternative will result in a credit that exceeds the extra transaction.
This includes commissions and the extra trading costs due to spreads in the

Exercising Your Options the Euro Way
When trading European-style index options, you need to be more familiar
with the contract specifications. Here I cover what you should understand
about the index settlement process which determines option moneyness at
expiration. It is the index settlement value that you use for exercise decision-
making. 
Stock option moneyness is calculated using the closing value during regular
market hours for the stock on the last trading day before expiration.
Occasionally a late print gets posted by the exchanges that can confuse
things a bit, but all stock options use this “last trade” rule. 
Tracking index settlement (the “SET”)
Because stock index values are calculated using a group of stocks, determin-
ing option moneyness at expiration is more complicated. Not all stocks have
opening and closing trades at the exact same time, so the opening level for an
index won’t necessarily include the opening price for all components — some
prices may include closes from the previous day. 
You access the index settlement value to address this timing issue. This index
level is calculated using only opening or closing values and is referred to as
the SET. Check the option specification for more detail on how a particular
settlement value is determined and the symbol used to access it. 
154
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Exercise instruction procedures can vary by broker and instrument. Even if
you provided stock option exercise instructions with your broker in the past,
you may find their index exercise process is different. Check with your broker
about their exercise process for index options before you need to submit
instructions.
Cashing in with exercise
Your window of opportunity to exercise a European-style option is much
smaller than with American-style options — it’s usually just a day. That day is
very close to the Saturday of expiration and may or may not coincide with
the last trading day for the option. 
Because European-style index options are based on something that can’t be
traded, these options are referred to as cash-settled. That means no securities
change hands during exercise or assignment — just cold hard cash. The
amount of cash for this option is determined by the option moneyness and
option multiplier.
You calculate European-style option moneyness using the SET as follows:
Index SET – Option Strike Price = Call Moneyness
Option Strike Price – Index SET = Put Moneyness
So you determine the exercise cash amount this way: 
Option Moneyness × Option Multiplier = Cash Settlement Amount
When moneyness falls below zero an option has no intrinsic value. In this
case no cash would change hands.
Even though there is just one day to exercise cash-settled European-style
options, they can be traded any time up to the close on the last day of trad-
ing for the contract.
Assuming a SET value of 1523 for SPX and a multiplier of 100, the exercise 
and assignment amount for expiring call and put options with a 1520 strike
price is:
 Call Moneyness: 1523 – 1520 = 3
 Call Exercise Amount: 3 × 100 = $300 credit
 Call Assignment Amount: $300 debit
155
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

 Put Moneyness: 1520 – 1523 < 0
 Put Exercise Amount: 0 × 100 = $0 credit
 Put Assignment Amount: $0 debit
Because no asset changes hands during this process, your market risk over
the weekend due to good or bad news is nonexistent. 
Satisfying Option Obligations
When you sell an option short, you have an obligation not a right. This makes
your decision-making about whether or not you wish to be assigned really
easy — you have no choice. The only way you can avoid assignment is by
purchasing the option back to off-set your position. This is the same for both
option styles.
Although all stock options are American-style contracts, not all American-
style contracts are stock options. There are also American-style index
options that settle in cash.
American-style stock options
Assignments usually occur over expiration weekend, but because we’re talk-
ing about American-style stock options, it could occur anytime after you
create the short option position. In either case, you satisfy the assignment
through the transfer of shares into or out of your account. 
There are a couple of nuances for you to consider regarding assignment, but
first I provide information about basic mechanics. When you are assigned on
a stock option, two transactions appear in your account:
 Assigned: The short option is removed from your account and the term
Assigned or abbreviation “ASG” appears.
 Buy/Sell: The stock transfer appears the same as a regular stock order.
The assigned contract(s) is no longer in your account; however, you may not
have been assigned on all contracts. Be sure to check your positions to see if
there are any short contracts remaining. Also, a commission is usually
applied to the buy/sell transaction.
156
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

You usually get assigned when your short option no longer has time value.
Puts generally have a better chance of being assigned early because the
person exercising the right will be bringing in money. The risk of you being
assigned early on a call jumps significantly when certain corporate actions
are pending and the option holder wants to own the stock by the record date.
Such actions include the distribution of large cash dividends.
Most short in-the-money (ITM) options get assigned over expiration week-
end. Early assignment of puts usually increases when strong market declines
drop stock values significantly.
Now for those nuances I mentioned . . .
Short put assignment
Assuming you were assigned on a short put, you are now the proud owner of
ABC stock at a cost that is likely higher than the current market. 
You need to decide whether or not you wish to keep the assigned shares and
how it impacts your account. If you didn’t have enough money for the trans-
action, you can either bring in more cash before stock settlement or you may
be able to buy the shares on margin. When you buy shares on margin you are
borrowing money from your broker. This can only be done in certain
accounts and the borrowing terms are determined by the following: 
 The cost and margin requirements for the stock
 The cash in your account before the assignment
 Your broker’s rules and rates
When buying on margin, your expected returns should exceed the risk-free
rate associated with US Treasuries plus the interest rate charged by your
broker for using margin. Because the market value of an assigned position is
likely below what you paid, you need to consider cutting your losses and sell-
ing the position. 
Short call assignment
If you were assigned on a short call, things get trickier unless you already
owned the stock. Then it simply is sold at the option strike price, which is
likely below the current market price. 
When you don’t own the stock, assignment of the short call results in a short
stock position. This exposes you to significant risk because the stock can
keep going up. Even if you want to hold the short position, your broker may
not have access to shares for lending. If that happens, the stock is bought at
whatever price it’s trading in the market to close the short position. This can
be done with or without your knowledge.
157
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

The only thing worse than shares bought back without your knowledge is
being short the stock without knowing it! Be sure to always monitor your
accounts regularly when holding short option or stock positions. Beware of
conditions that may trigger assignments, such as deep in-the-money options
or news events that significantly impact the value of the underlying.
To create a short position, your broker must go out and borrow the shares.
These may or may not be available. As a result, even if you have enough
money and want to hold a short position, it may not be an option. 
Expiring uninspiring options
Because it’s always best to actively manage your account, ideally expiration
will come and go without incident. That said, I’m sure there will be a time
when you end up holding a position at expiration. Here’s what to expect
when you are long or short an option going into expiration weekend.
Long option positions
Before you buy an option you should know how you will close it. As you near
expiration, here is what you need to consider:
 If the option is out-of-the-money (OTM) or roughly at-the-money (ATM)
and you don’t want to exercise the contract rights, try to sell it when the
credit you receive exceeds your commission for the transaction.
 If you want to buy or sell the stock, calculate whether selling the con-
tract or exercising it is more cost effective.
Never assume a slightly OTM or ATM option will expire worthless. It’s possi-
ble for the stock’s last trade to get reported late, resulting in an in-the-money
(ITM) option. Even if the stock closes exactly at the strike price or is OTM,
monitor the news after the close. You may decide to exercise the option if
you expect a big change in the company’s value over the weekend. 
When you hold an ITM option into expiration, here’s what will happen: 
Exercise by exception (auto-exercise) 
Currently, when a stock option is ITM by $0.05 or more at expiration, the
Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) assumes you did not want an option
with value to expire worthless. They exercise it on your behalf over expira-
tion weekend. So even without specific instructions, stock shares are bought
or sold for you. This may create a short position in your account without
your knowledge. 
158
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

You can instruct your broker to not allow auto-exercise for specific contracts,
but you must do so within their cutoff times. Specific instructions are required
for each long option position you hold through expiration. Note that the OCC
trigger levels for auto-exercise has declined over the years.
Short option positions
A short stock option obligates you to buy or sell shares of the underlying
stock. As a result, you’re more reactive at expiration than active. Short
options are usually assigned when market conditions are against you. The
only way to prevent assignment is to exit that position before the market
closes on the last trading day.
Stock price can change significantly over the weekend if important news is
released. A stock’s value will shoot through the roof if they just discovered
cures for five major diseases or would drop like a brick if they disclosed they
were just kidding about their profits for the last three years. Monitor news
after the close to see if you can benefit from exercising expiring options.
If your short option is OTM, there is a good chance that it will expire worth-
less. However, traders long the option will monitor conditions after the close.
If big news comes out about the company, you still may be assigned over
expiration weekend on the OTM option. Table 9-2 summarizes what you
should expect heading into expiration weekend.

Monitor market news and your
account over expiration. Since auto-
exercise occurs when an option is
ITM > $0.05, you should expect
assignment at this level. Close the
short position on the last day of trad-
ing if you want to avoid assignment.
Whether you hold a long or short option position, it’s best to actively manage
the position. This usually means exiting it before the close on the last trading
day, but can include providing specific instructions to your broker. 
After an option closes even a penny ITM, expect it to be assigned. Currently,
if it’s ITM by $0.05 or more, auto-execution kicks in for long contract holders.
At that point you can forget about dodging the assignment bullet.
When you hold a stock position that meets the short option obligation, you’ll
be less stressed over expiration. But when the assignment creates a new
position in your account, you have two choices: 
 Exit the position in the market Monday morning, or
 Hold the position, if you have sufficient funds.
160
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Your broker may or may not have shares available for a short stock position,
so exiting the position could be your only choice.
When trading a European-style option, you must know the option’s last trad-
ing and exercise days, as well as how the SET is determined.
When you manage risk it means you manage your positions, long and short.
Although you don’t typically consider a long option very dangerous, there
are times when it can catch you off-guard. A perfect example is when a long
put is auto-exercised.
European-style options
European-style options provide you with an advantage over American-style
options if you are short the option contract. That’s because you don’t have to
worry about early assignment. You can completely avoid assignment when
you buy the option back by a specific date to off-set the short position.
Other than covering a short position, you don’t have much to decide heading
into expiration weekend. If the option is in-the-money (ITM) at expiration
your account will be debited the settlement value for the assignment. 
Note there may be a period of time when news affects an index SET, but you
are past the last trading day for a European-style option. If you are short OTM
SPX puts at the end of trading on Thursday, bad news overnight could result
in a strong drop in the morning when the SET is determined. This may result
in OTM puts becoming ITM.
Breaking It Down: American-Style 
Index Options
One of the most popular American-style index options is the S&P 100 Index
(OEX) contract. You can exercise your rights anytime you own a long con-
tract or be assigned whenever you hold a short contract. American-style
index options settle in cash because an index can’t be bought or sold.
Because these contracts can be exercised any time, you have to know how
the settlement value is determined prior to expiration. You can find these
details in the contract specification. 
161
Chapter 9: Getting a Handle on Option Styles

Using the OEX specification from the CBOE as an example, here’s how it
works: 
 OEX SET at expiration: Uses primary market closing prices on the last
day business day before expiration (usually a Friday).
 OEX settlement for early exercise: Uses primary market closing prices
for the day the exercise instructions are submitted. 
Exercising rights
You need to contact your broker to find out the exercise cut-off time for
American-style options since the settlement value for the index option you
trade may be determined by closing values. You should consider time value
when deciding whether to sell the index option in the market or exercise
your contract rights. If you decide to exercise the contract, the amount cred-
ited to your account is determined using the option strike price, the index
settlement value and the multiplier, as outlined in the contract specification.
One reason you may decide to exercise your rights even when time value
remains in the option is if there is a news event that could significantly
impact the index value the next day. Consider the type of rights you own and
the likely impact the news will have on index trading levels. 
Meeting obligations
The only decision you have as a short contract holder for American-style
index options is whether or not to buy back the option to avoid assignment.
Because early assignment is possible, you need consider this each day you
hold the position, rather than just on the last trading day. If assigned, your
obligation is met in a cash amount using the option strike price, the index set-
tlement value and the multiplier. 
Always, always check contract specifications prior to trading both European-
style and American-style index options.

y adding option strategies to both your investment and trading portfo-
lios, you minimize trading stress. Trading is challenging enough, but
when market conditions threaten your long-term holdings, the distraction
can be downright destructive. Reducing stress is one key to better decision-
making for both aspects of your portfolio. 
Options offer protection for both portfolios and trading positions. Because
there are a variety of strategies available to you, you need to have a plan for
implementation. In this chapter I discuss a few protective strategies and
some things to consider when putting them into practice. 
The last portion of the chapter addresses a unique risk that adjusted options
pose to investors and traders alike. Adjusted options are those contracts
with a non-standard deliverable package due to corporate actions that
occurred during the option’s life. I cover adjusted options here because 
they can add risk to even conservative, protective strategies included in 
this chapter.
Putting Protection on Long Stock
I generally focus on shorter term option trading strategies in this book, but
options are definitely well suited for longer term holdings as well. Applying

protective strategies to your existing holdings can turn anxious, sleepless
nights into restful ones during market downturns. Since no one knows when
these downturns will occur, incorporating protective strategies as a regular
consideration in your investment planning could be the difference between
meeting your financial goals on time or waiting for the next bull run to get
you there.
Combining puts with long stock
Purchasing puts on your existing stock investments provides insurance
against significant losses when a major downturn occurs. Like other forms of
insurance, it’s frustrating to write a check for something you may not need,
but it’s really nice to have when the time comes. Two strategies that combine
long stock with a long put are:
 Married put (stock and put purchased together)
 Protective put (stock and put purchased separately)
The two positions are essentially the same, but differ in the timing of pur-
chases. Each consists of one long put for every 100 shares of stock held.
There’s no need for you to distinguish between the terms. What is important
for you is understanding why and how you protect your assets. I use the term
protective put for the remainder of this chapter.
A put option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying
stock at the contract strike price until the trading day prior to the option’s
expiration date. You can also sell this right in the market up until this time.
Protection considerations
The expression, “A rising tide lifts all boats” is sometimes used to describe
the stock market and its tendency for all stocks to rise together during a bull-
ish run. Unfortunately the reverse is also true. Regardless of the merits of an
individual stock, when a bear market hits it takes no prisoners — even qual-
ity stocks decline. 
Trying to anticipate swings in the market is almost impossible, so the next
best thing is protecting stock earmarked for the long-term. Suppose you
bought stock ABC a few months ago at $34.00 and wish to hold it for the long-
term. You can lock in a sell price for that stock at anytime by purchasing a
put. It doesn’t matter whether it’s your intention to exercise your right or
simply off-set losses with option gains.
164
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

When considering two different stock investments with equal growth poten-
tial and prospects, check to see which has options available. This may make
your investment decision easier if one allows you to purchase protection on
it while the other doesn’t.
Rather than an all-or-nothing approach that includes selling ABC and trying
to buy it back if the market declines, the position can be protected over the
short-term or long-term using puts. Before analyzing specific options, you
need to decide whether you will continually protect a position or if you will
do so intermittently according to your market outlook. 
Suppose you seek temporary protection for ABC (30 to 60 days) When look-
ing at option chains, you’ll then need to evaluate options with 60 to 90 days
to expiration. This gives you the flexibility to exit the position prior the accel-
eration of time decay 30 days prior to expiration. The next thing to consider
is how much protection you want to have. Table 10-1 provides partial put
option chain data for ABC to help with this decision.
Open interest is the total number of contracts outstanding for a specific
option contract. Since option contracts are created by demand, it reflects
information from the previous day’s trading activity.
One size does not fit all
Since you’re concerned with market action in Sep and Oct, it’s reasonable to
focus on options for Oct and Jan to cover the bearish period. Next you have
to identify the losses, if any, you’re willing to accept. You purchased the stock
at $34 and it’s currently trading at $37.50. Do you want protection ABC at the
current price or the level where you purchased it? These are questions you
face each time you consider protecting a position.
The more time remaining until expiration, the more uncertainty there is
regarding the price of the stock at expiration. An in-the-money (ITM) has
more time of becoming an out-of-the-money (OTM) and vice versa. Option
pricing uses past movement in the stock to value different probabilities for
future price movement. Use delta as a resource to check the probability the
option will be ITM at expiration, given its movement in the past.

Although the protective put is a relatively simple strategy, the number of
ways that protection can be provided is numerous. To help with your analy-
sis, identify your protection time horizon along with the maximum loss you
seek prior to viewing option chains. This will aide your decision-making.
Assuming you seek protection above the stock purchase price, you then have
limited your analysis to the 35 and 37.50 strike prices. Table 10-2 provides an
analysis of the protection provided by select puts if you choose to exercise
them.

The exercise column is calculated by subtracting your purchase price from
the option breakeven. From Chapter 4, the breakeven for a put option is:
Put Strike Price – Put Purchase Premium = Put Breakeven
(Put Breakeven – Purchase Price) × 100 = Net Profit/Loss
Unless otherwise stated, the multiplier for a stock option is 100. When work-
ing with a combined position that includes 100 shares of stock, be sure to
remember to incorporate this value in the formulas. 
166
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

From this point, the actual option selected for the strategy is definitely a per-
sonal decision. You may prefer longer term protection and include April put
options in your review. You may only seek catastrophic coverage in which
case you may add strike prices below 35.00 as well. 
To wrap up the example, the 37.50 strike should be selected if you don’t want
to see a profitable position turn into a loss when exercised. If you’re bearish
through the entire month of October, the ABC Jan 37.50 put option provides
you with protection for the full time period. 
There are a variety of things to consider when seeking protection for an exist-
ing stock position including:
 Term for the protection (expiration month)
 Level of protection (strike price and option price)
You could also consider the likelihood an option will be ITM at expiration by
referencing delta. By making use of options that have a greater chance of
being ITM at expiration, you may find you can trade out of the protective
position and use the proceeds to help finance a new protective put. The more
experience you gain, the more you’ll find an approach that suits your style.
You can always sell a protective put before it expires if you feel the markets
have stabilized and the intermediate outlook for your stock turns bullish
again.
Since no one knows what the next day in the markets will bring, an investor
may decide to maintain some level of protection on stock positions regard-
less of the short-term or intermediate outlook. To minimize expenses, 
lower strikes may be considered as part of a plan that provides catastrophic
coverage — kind of a crash protection approach. 
Accelerated time decay
When trading options for this strategy or others, you need to consider the
impact of time decay on the option position. Theta is the option Greek that
identifies the daily loss of option value associated with the current price of
the option.
Using an ABC Oct 37.50 put option with 60 days to expiration, you can obtain
theta by accessing an option calculator such as the on located on the OIC
Web site (www.optionscentral.com). 
167
Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

The theta value for the option trading at $1.05 is –0.0078. That means if every-
thing stays the same tomorrow, the option quote will lose 0.0078 in value. It
may not sound like much, but it can add up. 
In addition to the cumulative impact of time decay, this rate of decay acceler-
ates as expiration approaches particularly within the last 30 days of an
option’s life. 
The impact of time decay accelerates the last 30 days of an option’s life. This
means extrinsic value will decline more quickly along with the value of the
option — assuming all other conditions remain the same.
To minimize the impact time decay within 30 days of expiration, trading
strategies that make use of long options should incorporate an exit plan that
addresses the issue. I generally exit a long option position 30 days prior to
expiration to avoid accelerating losses to its extrinsic value.
Table 10-3 provides theta values for the ABC Oct 37.50 put for various days to
expiration, assuming all other factors remain the same.

If you think $0.02/day is manageable, consider what this represents in terms
of percentages. With ten days to go until expiration, 0.0216 is 4.8% of the con-
tract’s value.
The way you go about protecting positions is similar to any other investment
decision — it depends on your risk tolerance and personal preferences. Find
an approach that suits your style.

graph in Figure 10-1 displays the improved risk-reward profile that results
when you add a put to long stock. Losses are now capped.

Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Weighing protection cost versus time
When you have a specific, reasonably short time horizon to protect a posi-
tion, selecting the expiration month is pretty straightforward. Once you seek
longer term protection the analysis requires a bit more effort. Since you
expect the security to move upward on a longer-term basis, ATM options
should be OTM by expiration and may be minimally effective. You need to
weigh the cost of protection against the amount of time the protection is in
place.
The investment process requires you to balance risk and reward. Without
risk there is no reward, but it doesn’t mean you have to risk it all. Consider
protective positions as a means of limiting your losses while letting your 
profits run. 
Long-term protection
Suppose you noted that stock XYZ has consistently realized annual gains of
8%, even during years with a 2% decline along the way. How do you go about
protecting such a position? A $2.15 ATM put that provided five months of pro-
tection was used in the ABC example. Since ABC was at $37.50, the put pre-
mium represents 5.7% of its value.

Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

Balancing the cost of protection versus returns is difficult and requires a
game plan. Again, it’s not a one size fits all proposition. If you buy puts on a
regular basis you could be sacrificing stock returns and then some. On the
other hand, ignoring protection completely could cost you a big chunk of
your initial investment. 
The short answer to this problem is that you pretty much have to find the
balance that is right for you. You may decide to intermittently use puts when
bearish periods arise, but if you could time the markets that well you proba-
bly wouldn’t need protection. Give the issue some thought.
When purchasing puts to protect your investments, be sure to balance the
cost of protection versus net returns for the protective put position.
By carefully evaluating different options rather than just looking for the
cheapest alternative, there is a better chance the option will have some value
30 days prior to expiration. As part of your plan consider:
 The net exercise value and level of protection provided
 The statistical chance the option will be ITM at expiration (delta)
 The cost of protection versus the net impact on returns
Being clear about your strategy goals from the start should definitely help.
Cost per day calculations
As a last consideration, when selecting protective puts:
 Be careful about buying seemingly cheap puts that don’t offer adequate
protection and will likely expire worthless
 Consider the cost of protection over your stock holding period
Using the 37.50 strike price put for ABC, you can calculate the daily cost of
protection for the two options. This is accomplished by dividing the option
premium by the number of days to expiration:
 ABC Oct 37.50 put @ $1.05 = $1.05 × 100 = $105
 $105 ÷ 60 days = $1.75 per day
 ABC Jan 37.50 put @ $2.15 = $2.15 × 100 = $215
 $215 ÷ 150 days = $1.43 per day
The ABC Jan 37.50 put translates to a cost of approximately $0.014 per share
for the option if held to expiration.

Do what you can to manage your positions by responding to market condi-
tions, not over-reacting to them. No one can completely control their emo-
tions when markets race up or come tumbling down. Do your best to manage
them by completing your analysis when the markets are closed whenever
possible.
Limiting Short Stock Risk with Calls
Long puts provide you with a means of protecting your investments for a spe-
cific period of time. Although you probably don’t hold any short stock posi-
tions in your investment portfolio, you may periodically trade strategies that
use short stock position that are held overnight. A long call can protect you
from losses due to overnight gaps upward.
Protecting a short stock position
In the same way a long put protects a long stock position, a long call protects
a short stock position. A call gives you the right, but not the obligation, to
buy stock at a specific strike price by the expiration date. You can exercise
your call rights to close out a short position if the stock rises quickly. 
Since a short stock position is generally held for less time, protective call
option selection is much easier. Typically you can evaluate options with the
least amount of time to expiration or those in the following month. Stocks
with options will have both months available.
Option months that are closest to expiration are generally referred to as near
month options and those that expire right after that are referred to as next
month options.
In addition to paying less for time for the protective call, strike price selec-
tion should be easier since there is less of a chance the stock will move far
away from the entry price in the relatively short period of time the position is
held. Try to use options that matches your maximum loss criteria. 
Further reducing short stock risk
If you’re really committed to reducing short stock risk, why not just consider
implementing a long put strategy to capitalize on your bearish view for a par-
ticular stock? Suppose you didn’t own stock ABC and you are bearish on the
171
Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

stock instead. How does a long put position compare to a short stock posi-
tion? Assuming ABC is trading at $37.50, Table 10-4 compares a $37.50 put to
the stock position, including maximum risk and reward:
Table 10-4

Max Reward

$105
$3,645
Short 100 Shares ABC
$1,875

$1,875
Here’s what you need to consider:
 Stock entry cost: The initial cost for the short stock position is 50% of
the current stock price because short selling has a 150% margin require-
ment. 100% is credited to the account from the stock sale and the
remaining 50% is cash you need to have available for the position. 
 Stock maximum risk: Since the stock can theoretically rise without
limit, the risk to a short seller is also considered to be unlimited. You
may try to limit this risk by having an order in place to buy the stock
back if it rises past a certain price, but overnight gaps in the stock could
result in this maximum risk stop level being exceeded. 
 Option maximum risk: The maximum risk for a long option position is
the premium paid. In this case, that’s $105.
 Option maximum reward: If you own the right to sell a stock for $37.50
and it is currently trading at $0, the intrinsic value of the option will be
$37.50. Theoretically you can buy the stock in the market for $0 and then
exercise your right to sell it for $37.50. The $1.05 you paid for this right
must be subtracted from the $37.50 per share gain for the stock transac-
tion to determine the maximum reward for the option position.
 Option breakeven level: The breakeven point for the option position is
the put strike price minus the option price, or $37.50 – 1.05 = $36.45.
Puts increase in value when a stock decreases and represent a bearish posi-
tion. Although they are wasting assets that are negatively impacted by time
decay, they have limited risk and limited, but high reward potential.
Looking at your risk first, the put position limits the maximum risk to $105.
This is equivalent to a $1.05 per share amount that could easily be exceeded
with an overnight gap in the stock. From a reward standpoint, you’re reducing
the maximum gain by the cost of the put ($105), but you have the potential to
far exceed the short stock reward when comparing the gains on margin.
172
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Hedging Your Bets with Options
You can use the following options to protect stock positions:
 A long put with a long stock position
 A long call with a short stock position
The option can be exercised to close the stock position or gains in the option
can be used to off-set losses in the stock. The term hedge describes a posi-
tion used to off-set losses in a security resulting from adverse market moves.
Protecting a position or portfolio with options is a form of hedging. But not
all hedges are created equal . . . some are more perfect than others. A perfect
hedge is a position that includes one security that gains the same value that
is lost by a second security. The gain offsets the loss. So a $1 dollar move
down in ABC coincides with a $1 move up in XYZ. 
The option Greek delta obtained using an option calculator provides the
expected change in the option’s value given a $1 change in the underlying
stock.
Protecting a portfolio . . . partially
You partially hedge a position when you own a security that gains value when
the hedged position loses value. Usually, when you combine two securities
that tend to move in opposite directions you find it’s not always a one-to-one
relationship. A $1 gain in one stock may correspond to a $0.75 loss in another
security. Assuming the relationship between the two continues, combining
them provides you with a partially hedged position. 
Delta can be used to help construct partially or completely hedged positions.
Hedging stock with stock options
The ABC Oct 35.00 put option has a delta of -0.186. Assuming you own 100
shares of ABC and the Oct 35.00 put, the expected impact to your account
with a $1 decline in ABC is calculated as follows:
(Change in Underlying) × (Delta) = Change in Option
(–1) × (–0.186) = +0.186
When the stock moves down to $36.50, the option should move up to approx-
imately $0.54. The stock position lost $100 and the option position gained
173
Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

about $19. Because the Oct 35.00 put gained value when the stock lost value
it provided a hedge for ABC. However, the option gain was smaller than the
stock loss, so it’s only a partial hedge for the position.
Listed index options have different characteristics than listed stock options.
For instance, an index is not a security so its not something you can buy and
sell. As a result, index options settle in cash rather than the transfer of a
physical asset. See Chapter 9 for details on options characteristics.
Hedging a portfolio with index options
Because listed options are available for both stock and indexes, portfolios
can be protected on an individual position basis or with index options,
assuming the portfolio is well correlated to a specific index. Hedging your
portfolio may actually require both an index option for a group of stocks and
individual stock options for others that don’t correlate well with a given
index. 
Correlation is a term used to describe the relationship between data sets.
The values range from –1 to +1 and when applying to stocks provide you with
the following information:
 Stocks with returns that move in the same direction, by the same magni-
tude are said to be perfectly positively correlated (+1)
 Stocks with returns that move in the opposite direction, by the same
magnitude said to be perfectly negatively correlated (-1)
 Stocks with returns that do not move consistently in terms of direction
and magnitude are considered not correlated (0)
As an example, suppose you have a $150,000 portfolio that is well correlated
to the OEX, trading at approximately 680. One quick approach to partial
hedging uses the portfolio value and index strike price to estimate the hedge.
OEX index options are available for different months in five point strike price
increments. When it is trading at 682, a 680 call will have $2 of intrinsic value
since option moneyness is the same for index and stock options. 
Using a short-term protection approach, Table 10-5 provides potential put
candidates for next month options expiring in approximately 60 days. These
options may seem pricey, but a five-point move in the index reflects less than
1% of the index value.

*Delta using the Ask value
A common multiplier value for an index is also 100, so the total option pre-
mium for March 670 put is $1,050 ($10.50 × 100). The option package is
valued using the strike price and multiplier, or $67,000 for the March 670 put
(670 × 100).
The option multiplier is the contract valued used to determine the net option
premium (Option Market Price × Multiplier) and the deliverable value of the
option package (Option Strike Price × Multiplier).
Suppose you decide you want to protect the portfolio against market
declines greater than two percent. You can estimate the hedge by starting
with the current index level (682) and subtracting the decline you’re willing
to accept to obtain a starting point for strike price selection as follows:
 682 – (682 × 0.02) = 13.6
 682 – 13.6 = 668.4 
Both the 665 and 670 strike prices can be considered. Using the 665 put
option:
 Protection Provided by 1 Put: 1 × 665 × 100 = $66,500
 Protection Provided by 2 Puts: 2 × 665 × 100 = $133,000
 Portfolio Protected: $133,000 ÷ $150,000 = 88.7%
If the OEX drops below 665, your puts gain intrinsic value at a pace that is
equal to the put’s delta. The further the OEX declines, the closer the puts get
to a 1:1 move with the index. The time remaining until expiration will also
affect the actual gains made by the hedge.
175
Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

At-the-money (ATM) puts and calls have deltas that are approximately 0.50.
Once an option moves from ATM to in-the-money (ITM) or out-of the-money
(OTM), delta changes in value. The option Greek that provides you with a feel
for just how much delta change is gamma.
A stock option package generally represents 100 shares of the underlying
stock. When using the strike price and multiplier of 100 to value the option
package, it’s common to think your paying the strike price for each share of
stock. That’s okay when applying this to regular stock options, but it’s not
quite accurate when considering index options or adjusted stock options. In
both of these cases, it’s best to consider the option package value as simply: 
Strike Price × Multiplier
A stock option package is typically 100 shares of stock. When put contract
rights are exercised, the stock option owner receives the strike price times
the option multiplier — usually 100. The amount the put option holder
receives is also called the option package exercise value. Other terms you
may see for this value include:
 Option package assignment value
 Option package deliverable value 
It depends on what side of the option you’re on. All of these terms refer to
the same thing, the money that is exchanged when the rights of a call or put
contract are actually exercised. 
Protecting a portfolio . . . completely
Recall in Chapter 3, that delta was given the following ranges:
 Call: From 0 to +1 or 0 to +100
 Put: From 0 to -1 or 0 to -100
To better discuss hedging, it helps to use the alternate range of 0 to +100 and
0 to –100 for delta. That’s because it turns out that one share of stock has a
delta of 1. Using this information and the ABC example, the Oct 25 put with a
delta of –0.186 provides a near perfect hedge for 19 shares of ABC stock.
ATM calls generally have deltas that are slightly greater than 0.50 while ATM
puts are generally slightly less than 0.50. Using 0.50 as an approximation is
usually fine for the initial strategy evaluation.
176
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Stock hedge
Starting with a perfect stock hedge using ABC, assume you have allocated
approximately $5,000 to a combined position (stock plus put). Since ABC is
trading at $37.50, you anticipate owning about 100 shares Using the ABC
option data from Table 10-1, you focus on the Jan 35 strike price option with
five months to expiration. The put has a delta of –29.1. Since three puts won’t
quite hedge 100 shares of stock you evaluate a potential position using four
puts. The delta for four Jan 35 puts is:
Position Delta = # of Contracts × Delta = 4 × (–29.1) = –116.4
Given that 1 share of stock has +1 delta, a long position of 100 shares repre-
sents +100 deltas. A perfectly hedged position has a combined delta equal to
zero, so 116 shares of ABC are required. You calculate the position delta as
follows: 
 116 shares × +1 delta per share = +116 Deltas
 4 puts × –29.1 delta per put = –116.4 Deltas
 Position delta = +116 + (–116.4) = –0.4 Deltas
The cost of the position is the following:
 116 shares × $37.50 = $4,350
 4 puts × $1.35 × 100 = $540
 Position cost = $4,350 + 540 = $4,890
This near perfect hedge will not stay intact long, every time ABC moves up or
down $1, delta changes approximately by its gamma value. Part IV provides
you with ways to profit from this changing situation.
Recall that the delta for an option changes by gamma for each $1 change in
the underlying stock. Because of this, options are referred to as a variable
delta security. The delta for one share of stock on the other hand stays con-
stant. One long share of stock will also represent +1 delta so it is referred to
as a fixed delta security.
Portfolio hedge
You approach a perfect portfolio hedge in a similar manner, but the fact that
not all portfolios are perfectly correlated to an index causes problems. The
perfect hedge becomes elusive because the option delta changes when the
index value changes and there is inexact movement between the index and
portfolio.
177
Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

Using a delta approach to protect the $150,000 portfolio will get you closer to
a perfect hedge than the strike price estimate. Using an index level of 682, the
Mar 690 puts are ITM by 8 points. The market price for these puts is $20.85
which corresponds to a delta of –0.549. A goal is to get closer to 1:1 protec-
tion, so purchasing two Mar 690 puts results in the following:
 2 × 690 × 100 = $138,000
 2 × –0.549 = –1.10
In this case, for each 1 point decline in the OEX, the value of the combined
puts increases by 1.1. For a short period of time, this results in 1.1 times the
protection of a $138,000 portfolio. Multiplying $138,000 by 1.1 yields protec-
tion for a portfolio valued at $151,800. Given the variable nature of an
option’s delta, you’ll likely be satisfied with portfolio protection that is a little
less exact.
Avoiding Adjusted Option Risk
Adjusted options are those that existed when certain corporate actions took
place. As a result of those actions, the contract terms required adjustment to
reflect the action. Business activities that can prompt this include:
 Stock splits
 Large cash dividend distributions
 Mergers and acquisitions
 Spin-offs
Most dividends do not result in option contract adjustment. 
Justifying option adjustments
The two main reasons options are adjusted after different corporate actions is:
 To ensure the existing contracts retain their proper value
 So the contract reflects the corporate action in its deliverable package.
Without adjustments, the stock option market could be more dangerous.
Maybe exciting is the right word . . . imagine one of your calls losing all of its
value after a stock split and a put option doubling after a big cash dividend is
distributed. 
178
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Corporate action 1: Stock splits
Adjustments due to stock splits are the quickest to understand. When a stock
you own splits two for one (2:1) you receive one additional share of stock for
each share you own on the record date — the date used to identify existing
stockholders. On the day you receive the additional share, there is nothing
significantly different for the company in terms of its financial statement. To
correctly value the stock, its price is divided by two in the market on the day
of the split.
Option adjustments resulting from a 2:1 split are handled the same way the
stock split is handled:
 The number of contracts held is adjusted (similar to shares)
 The price where the owner has rights (strike price) is adjusted
A new option contract is created to address this corporate action and it is
provided a new symbol. When you own an option with the underlying stock
going through a 2:1 split, you’ll see 2 contracts of a new option in your
account for each 1 contract you owned previously.
In the current option symbol nomenclature, adjusted options are almost
indistinguishable from regular options. The problem arises when the option
deliverable or multiplier must change to reflect the corporate action, which
is the case for a 3:2 split. Adjusting an option after a 3:2 split requires a lot
more tweaking to get the valuation right.
When you exercise a put without holding the underlying stock in your
account, you create a short position. This is because the put rights allow you
to sell the underlying stock at the contract strike price. Selling a stock you
don’t own reverses the typical order for a stock transaction and creates a
short position.
Corporate action 2: Mergers, spin-offs, and dividends
Mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and large cash dividends all change the
underlying option package when an option contract is adjusted. This 
happens because the original 100 shares of stock may now represent owner-
ship in:
 100 shares of original stock + shares of acquired stock (merger)
 100 shares of original stock + shares of new stock (spin-off)
 100 shares of original stock + cash amount (large cash dividend)
 No original stock + shares of acquiring stock (acquired)
179
Chapter 10: Guarding Your Assets with Options

In the last case, the original underlying stock may not exist if the company
was acquired by another company. The adjusted options are now based on
some ratio of shares in the company that acquired it. 
If you think you found an option deal that seems to good to be true, you may
have very well stumbled upon an adjusted option. Traders on the exchanges
who are very familiar with corporate actions completed by the stocks they
trade and know how to value adjustments to them. There’s no free money on
Wall Street so don’t jump in to these options without fully understanding
them.
The way you value these type of contract adjustments is more complex and
beyond the scope of this book. It is extremely important to understand your
rights, obligations and position valuations if a contract you own gets
adjusted. Contact your broker if this occurs. And never, never create a new
position using an adjusted option contract you don’t completely understand.
Whenever a combined position (stock plus option) you own is adjusted, be
extremely careful about exiting the stock or option position separately. The
combined position maintains the proper stock-option ratios initially created,
but by selling any portion of the adjusted stock position, you may be creating
high risk in the option position. Call your broker to discuss any position
changes.
Adjusting from adjustments
It’s all well and good that the options markets have a way to address contract
valuations and deliverable packages for different corporate actions, but what
does that mean for you? Two things:
 When you note any adjusted option in your account, be sure to check
the contract specifications so you understand your new rights or obliga-
tions, as appropriate.
 More importantly, be aware of adjusted options when establishing new
positions so you properly value securities you trade and know your
rights and obligations.
Whenever an option quote doesn’t seem quite right, be sure you take the
time to check the contract details.
180
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Avoid creating new option positions using adjusted options. There’s no
hidden money in these contracts, just extra effort to understand and value
them. 
Detecting an adjusted option
The Option Symbology Initiative provides a revised approach to option 
symbols that should more clearly identify adjusted options. Until all option
chains are changed over to the proposed system, you must be aware of ways
you can detect adjusted options. Here are some things to check:
 An abbreviation “ADJ” appearing after the symbol in a quote
 A different option root symbol than the standard root
 Option package details may be partially listed with the quote heading —
check the full quote to see any changes to the deliverable package
 One strike price appears twice in one month with different symbols
 An atypical strike price appears for a stock (i.e. 46.375)
 The market price for the option seems way out of line, either high or low
These are primary ways to distinguish adjusted options in the market. As
with any security, when something doesn’t seem quite right in terms of a
quote or volume, be sure to dig deeper so you know why this is the case.
Valuing your split-adjusted options
When an option is adjusted due to a 2:1 split, the new contracts are valued
the same way regular options are. Atypical splits, such as a 3:2 split require a
little more of your attention. To value an option after a 3:2 split:
1. Use the adjusted strike price and multiplier to calculate the package
value (JKL 60 call: 60 × 150 = 9,000).
2. Determine the value of the underlying package in the market using
current quotes (150 shares JKL × $62 = $9,300).
3. Subtract the package value from the market value to obtain the
option’s intrinsic value ($9,300 – 9,000 = $300).
4. Assuming an option quote of $3, the extrinsic value is what remains
after subtracting the intrinsic value ($3 × 150 = $450, $450 – 300 =
$150).

Chapter 11
Limiting Your Downside 
When Trading the Trend
In This Chapter
 Reducing risk with options
 Combining options for trend trades
 Benefiting from strong directional moves
You have two basic choices when trading stocks — you can create a long
position to benefit when a stock price goes up or you can create a short
position to benefit when it goes down. Along the way you may receive or
have to pay a dividend here and there, but that’s pretty much it on the trad-
ing side. Options allow you to benefit from up and down stock movement,
while also offering a few more ways for you to capitalize on changes in price. 
By establishing a basic option position, you can gain from upward stock
movement (call) and downward movement (put). In either case your initial
investment is usually much smaller than a similar stock position. In addition
to single option positions, these securities can be combined to further
reduce cost. This chapter provides you with ways to trade for less money
and less risk.
Leveraging Assets to Reduce Risk
Usually when you think of leveraging assets you think of increasing your 
risk — at least on the stock trading side. Options allow you to leverage your
assets while also decreasing your investment at risk. That’s a nice combina-
tion. With options the premium you pay allows you to lock in a price for a
stock without putting up 100% of its value. Although there’s no guarantee the
stock will move in the direction you want, this is the case whether you’re
trading options or stocks. So why not do it for less?

Determining your total dollars at risk
Options reduce risk because less money is invested — that’s the bottom line.
Once you create a position anything can happen — the stock can sky rocket
upwards, drop like brick or sit around making minimal movements while the
rest of the market is active. You just don’t know. Nobody knows what’s going
to happen next.
Any stock can drop to zero, so any long stock or call position you own can
similarly go to zero. As a result, your initial investment is your maximum
potential loss. Actually, I take that back — if you buy a stock using margin
you can lose twice as much as your initial investment. 
The risk for a long stock position is considered limited, but high. That’s
because a stock cannot fall below zero. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of room
for losses between zero and the price of some stocks.
There are lots of possibilities between total loss and no losses at all though.
The main takeaway here is that when you invest with less money at the start,
you usually have less to lose. It’s rare to have such a distinct advantage with-
out any disadvantages. The distinct disadvantage with options is that you
can’t wait around for the move you anticipate to happen your investment to
rebound because there’s a time constraint.
Calling risk out when bullish
When you’re bullish on a stock you can either:
 Create a long stock position
 Create a long call position
If the stock goes up you can profit with either of these positions — the extent
you benefit depends on the actual move. Your risk is reduced when you pur-
chase a call option because you reduced the total investment.
Figure 11-1 presents this using risk graph overlays for the two positions.
Two main things for you to note from the risk graph are:
 The significant difference in losses
 Profits accrue faster with the stock position
Because there are a series of tradeoff in this business, I’ll take the slower
accrual of gains with less total risk. It is certainly possible for the stock to
remain dormant for months, causing me to exit the position for a loss only to
then have it begin a serious upward move. Again, it’s a tradeoff I’m willing to
take.
184
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

A risk graph provides a very efficient way for you to understand the risks,
rewards and breakevens associated with a particular strategy.
When monitoring option values, you’ll find that if the stock moves around a
little bit over time, the option can gain and lose value as follows:
 Increases or decreases as the stock price increases or decreases
 Increases or decreases as the option’s implied volatility increases or
decreases
 Decreases as time passes
Price alone doesn’t dictate an option’s price. The contract’s implied volatility
(IV) also plays a role in its value with higher IVs resulting in higher contract
values. On a daily basis time decay plays a smaller role, but the cumulative
effect can eat away at the option’s value.
Establish long option positions when implied volatility (IV) is relatively low
to increase the probability for profits and minimize losses due to decreases
in IV. Keep in mind that a relatively low IV environment does not guarantee IV
will rise over the life of the option.
Using LEAPS for long-term option positions
A LEAPS contract is a Long-term Equity AnticiPation Security. This isn’t a 
new type of trading instrument, it’s just an option that has a long time to
expiration — anywhere from more than six months to as much as 21⁄2 years.
Not all stocks with options have LEAPS available, but for those that do the
expiration month is almost always January. You’ll note different root symbols
for these options.
Figure 11-1:
Overlay risk

XYZ long
stock and

positions.
185
Chapter 11: Limiting Your Downside When Trading the Trend

LEAPS work something like this:
 LEAPS contracts are created in May, June, or July, depending on the
option’s cycle (see Chapter 3 for more information on Option Cycles).
 The new contracts expire in January approximately 21⁄2 years from the
creation date so by August 2008 there are options available for both
January 2010 and January 2011. The 2011 are the newly created LEAPS.
 When new LEAPS are rolled out, the closest January LEAPS (expiring in
2009) becomes a regular option as the Options Clearing Corporation
(OCC) revises the symbol to include the regular option root.
The root symbol for a LEAPS contract is different than the root symbol for a
particular stock to distinguish it from other January options expiring in dif-
ferent years. This approach to naming LEAPS may become obsolete when the
new option symbol program goes into effect in 2008.
The acronym for a LEAPS contract comes from Long-term Equity Anticipation
Security. These contract are simply options with a lot of time until expiration.
The more time you have to expiration for an option, the more money you pay.
So it follows that you should expect to pay more for LEAPS contracts. Your
risk increases with this increased cost, but the additional time provides you
with a greater chance of holding a contract that is in-the-money (ITM) at expi-
ration. LEAPS are:
 Available for some stocks and indexes that have regular options
 An investment alternative, providing you up to 21⁄2 years to benefit from
your contract rights.
In addition to providing more time for investing strategies, LEAPS provide
extended warranties on the asset protection side. Combining a LEAPS put
with long stock significantly reduces the cost per day for protection. You do
have to balance the reduced cost with your desired level of protection since
ideally the stock will rise over the time as you hold it. If this happens, the put
value decreases during this time while the strike price remains the same.
Stocks that are more volatile generally have a larger number of strike prices
available each month because there is a greater chance the stock will reach a
strike price that is farther away.
To provide you with some pricing perspective, a partial option chain for
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is provided in Table 11-1. It includes regular
calls and puts, along with LEAPS contracts. When reviewing the details,
assume MSFT trades at $27.90 and is pretty quiet, making relatively gradual
moves up and down.

Since options that expire in January could potentially exist for 21⁄2 years, they
are the ones that have the highest potential for being adjusted due to differ-
ent corporate actions. Be especially careful when trading Jan options with
quotes that seem “off.” Check contract specifications for details on the
underlying package.
Putting limits on a moving bear
When you’re bearish on a stock you can either:
 Create a short stock position
 Create a long put position
If the stock goes down you can profit with either of these positions. The
rewards are limited because a stock can only move down to zero. At the same
time, the rewards are potentially high if the stock does become worthless. 
Figure 11-2 presents this using risk graph overlays for the two positions.
Two main things for you to note from the risk graph are:
 The significant difference in losses
 The less than significant difference in gains
187
Chapter 11: Limiting Your Downside When Trading the Trend

Relying on market timing
After trading for any period of time, you come to realize that it’s pretty hard
to identify the future direction for a stock, let alone how far it will go and by
when. But selecting a proper time frame for an option is clearly an important
part of trading these securities. That means you have to:
 Recognize the role probabilities play in trading stocks and options
 Be prepared to be “wrong” and limit your losses
 Pay the right amount of premium for moves that are realistic.
Basic option trading requires you to correctly predict the direction the
underlying will move, the magnitude of the move and the maximum time it
will take for the move to occur. All of these things are required for stock trad-
ing too — the difference is you can hold on to long stock position for months
as it trade sideways. Managing a position this way doesn’t mean you’re nec-
essarily trading successfully though.
There are times when a stock breaks out of a limited range, sideways chan-
nel, only to return back into the channel. If you’ve created a directional posi-
tion based on the breakout, you must exit the position (stock or option) if the
stock returns to the channel since the conditions that justified the trade no
longer exist.
Predicting proper direction
In order for you to capitalize on either a stock or single option position, you
need to correctly identify the direction of the underlying stock move.

188
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Predicting the right direction is a challenge you face regardless of the secu-
rity you select, so it seems reasonable to favor one that uses less of your cap-
ital for at least some of your trading. Only you know the answer to that. 
Some general rules of thumb for increasing your probability of success
include:
 Trading with the trend when using technical tools,
 Or (for proficient contrarians) trading against the trend when momen-
tum is weakening and your indicators point to a pending turn, 
 Trading undervalued stocks that are gaining some positive attention
when using fundamental tools,
 In every trade, limit your losses with unbiased exit strategies.
Predicting the magnitude of the move
Time risk is the main disadvantage to trading options, but there is another
risk that requires discussion. You can be correct about the direction and
timing of a stock move and still have the magnitude be too small to make
your option position profitable. This happens to all option traders. 
How can you minimize these shortfalls? For the most part, it helps to have
some tools — technical or fundamental — that provide estimated price
projections. 
Your overall trading profitability can be improved by focusing on higher
probability trades (higher deltas indicating the move is more likely to occur)
over lower probability “home run” trades. Allow gains to accumulate over
time and you’ll probably be fortunate to get a home run or two along the way. 
Consider taking a portion of your profits off the table by exiting part of your
total position when the move you anticipated is partially complete. 
Option pricing models also help you identify higher probability trades by
providing you with:
 Expected movement implied by the option price (implied volatility)
 An estimate of the probability the option will be ITM at expiration.
By using these option components in your trade analysis, you can determine
if the option price is relatively expensive or inexpensive given the stock’s his-
tory, past option pricing and market conditions. This is shown later in an
example.
189
Chapter 11: Limiting Your Downside When Trading the Trend

Predicting the right time
The forced time limits for an option provides newer traders with their first
rules-based system when risk is properly managed. This means both:
 The trade represents a reasonable portion of the account 
 The position is exited prior to the acceleration of time decay
A long option position has a clear, built-in exit rule. Ideally this isn’t the only
guideline you use to exit a position though. 
There is no one size fits all criteria for selecting expiration periods since they
can vary by strategy and your trading style. The most straightforward time
horizon for option trading is associated with scheduled releases of news or
reports that can prompt strong movement by a specific date. These include:
 Economic or industry reports such as unemployment figures or semi-
conductor orders
 Earnings releases 
Some technical tools also provide estimated time projections, including price
patterns or cycles. Identify your time horizons first, then check option chains.
Combining Options to Reduce Risk
In Chapter 4, a put option was combined with long stock to protect it by limit-
ing the position risk. This was also accomplished when a call option was
added to a short stock position. In both cases, the position cost increased.
The breakeven level for a stock is simply the entry price. Since option premi-
ums represent a cost to you above and beyond your strike price contract
rights, a breakeven value must be calculated using both the strike price and
option price.
When creating positions that are focused on specific market outlooks, you
can combine the following:
 Call and/or put options with stocks
 Different call options together
 Different put options together
 Calls and puts together
190
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Adding long puts or calls to stock were the only combined positions discussed
so far, but short options can also be used to reduce risk by:
 Further reducing the net cost of the position and/or
 Increasing the potential directions the underlying can trade while still
realizing profits.
When a short option is properly combined with the underlying stock or a
long option of the same type, it is said to be covered. That’s because your risk
(obligations) under the short contract can be satisfied using the stock or by
exercising your rights under the long contract. Without such protection, the
short contract is referred to as naked. That’s kind of a good visual on your
exposure.
Trading naked options allows you to receive a credit when you open a
position — this credit is equal to the option premium. If all goes well the
option expires out-of the-money (OTM) and you get to keep the credit.
Different newsletters promote naked option strategies and this may seem
like a great way to bring in monthly revenue, but seller beware. 
Going naked a call option is the riskiest position you can create and I strongly
advise against such a trade. Rather than creating a limited risk, unlimited
reward consistent with good risk management, a naked call is an unlimited
risk, limited reward position.
Unfortunately what often happens with these strategies is that months of
smaller credits get wiped out with losses from just one or two trades that go
against you. I’m not opposed to creating a trade for a credit, I just don’t like
doing it while completely exposing myself from a risk standpoint. 
Risk can be limited by combining options for credits or debits using covered
option positions. This section introduces spread trades which are limited
risk, limited reward combination positions. 
Spreading the risk with a debit trade
A vertical spread is a position that combines two options:
 One long and one short option of the same type (calls or puts)
 Having the same expiration month and
 Different strike prices.
It is referred to as “vertical” because that’s how the strike prices line-up on
when you look on an option chain. You can create a vertical spread for an ini-
tial debit or an initial credit. In each case the position has limited risk and
limited reward.
191
Chapter 11: Limiting Your Downside When Trading the Trend

Each option position in a vertical spread is referred to as a leg.
The type of vertical spread selected depends upon your market outlook. You
vary risks and rewards by changing the strike prices used to establish the
position. You can create two types of vertical spreads for a debit, one using
calls and the other using puts. They are referred to by the outlook for the
stock and include:
 Bull call spread: You create a bull call spread by purchasing a call
option and simultaneously selling another call option that expires the
same month. The short call has a higher strike price. Since the price of
that higher strike call is less expensive, you pay a net debit for the trade.
The short call ends up reducing the price of the long call, so this spread
trade has less risk than buying a long call option alone.
 Bear put spread: You create a bear put spread by purchasing a put
option and simultaneously selling another put option that expires the
same month. The short put has a lower strike price. Since the price of
that lower strike put is less expensive, you pay a net debit for the trade.
The short put ends up reducing the price of the long put, so this spread
trade has less risk than buying a long put option alone.
Going naked a put option is a very risky position, even if you’re willing to buy
the stock at the short put strike price. Short put assignment generally occurs
when the stock is declining or bad news is released. Purchasing a stock in the
market or though assignment at a time like this goes against reasonable risk
management principles. 
Assessing risk and reward for a call debit spread
Your maximum risk for the bull call spread is the initial debit you paid to
create it, similar to a basic long call position. Since the position combines a
short call to reduce the long call cost, it also reduces the risk for the position.
Since you don’t get something for nothing on Wall Street, reducing your risk
this way comes at a price in the form of reduced rewards.
If ABC is trading at $37.65 and you are bullish on the stock, you can create a
bull call spread by completing the following transaction: 
 Buy 1 Jan 35 call @ $4.20 and
 Sell 1 Jan 40 call @ $1.50
The debit for the bull call spread position is $270 ([$4.20 – 1.50] × 100). This
is also the maximum risk and occurs when ABC closes at $35 or less at expi-
ration. At this price both calls will be worthless.
192
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Unlike a basic long call, your maximum reward is limited for a bull call spread
because the short obligation prevents you from realizing unlimited rewards.
Your maximum reward is the gain you realize from the exercise-assignment
transactions minus the initial debit paid for the position $230 [($40 – 35) ×
100 – 270.00]. The maximum reward occurs when ABC trades at $40 or higher
at expiration. 
Your actual gain or loss may be somewhere between the max risk and max
reward if ABC closes between 35 and 40. The bull call spread breakeven cal-
culation is similar to the one for a long call. Using the strike price for the long
call, you add the difference between the two option prices (the initial debit
without the multiplier) to determine your breakeven level. In this example,
the breakeven is $37.70 (35 + 2.70). 
Figure 11-3 displays the risk graph for the ABC Jan 35-40 bull call spread using
Optionetics Platinum, an options analysis software package.
Since a vertical debit spread is a net long position, its value will suffer the
same accelerated time decay within 30 days to expiration as a basic long
option position. Incorporate a method to exit the spread prior to this time if
the position is at risk of losing value this way.
The risk chart identifies the following important areas:
 Max risk of $270 displayed by the lower horizontal line
 Max reward of $230 displayed by the upper horizontal line
 A breakeven stock price of $37.70 displayed by a dark vertical line
 A range from losses to profits displayed by a diagonal line extending
from the lower strike price to the higher strike price.

193
Chapter 11: Limiting Your Downside When Trading the Trend

Risk, reward and breakeven calculations for vertical spreads are completed
by assuming you’re assigned on your short obligation and exercise your long
rights.
Assessing risk and reward for a put debit spread
Your maximum risk for the bear put spread is the initial debit you paid to
create it, similar to a basic long put position. Since the position combines a
short put to reduce the long put cost, it also reduces the risk for the position. 
If XYZ is trading at $50.85 and you are bearish on the stock, you can create a
bear put spread by completing the following transactions:
 Buy 1 Jan 50 put @ $2.75 and
 Sell 1 Jan 45 put @ $1.30
The net debit is also the maximum risk. The risk, reward and breakeven cal-
culations are similar to those for the bull call spread:
 Debit = Max Risk = (2.75 – 1.30) × 100 = $145.00
 Max Reward = [($50 – 45) × 100] – 145.00 = $355.00
 Breakeven = $50 – ($2.75 – 1.30) = 50 – 1.45 = $48.55
The maximum reward occurs when XYZ trades at $45 or lower at expiration.

using Optionetics Platinum, an options analysis software package.

 A breakeven stock price of $48.55 displayed by a dark vertical line
 A range from losses to profits displayed by a diagonal line extending
from the higher strike price to the lower strike price.
Consider entering a vertical debit spread when there is at least 60 days to
expiration to give the position time to become profitable.
Never exit the long leg of vertical spread without also exiting the short side of
the spread — otherwise you are significantly changing your risk profile. This
applies even when it appears the short leg will expire worthless. 
Summarizing your debit risks & rewards
In both vertical debit spreads your risks and rewards are limited. Each
spread has less risk than its corresponding basic long option position
because you reduce the initial debit by the price of the short option. The
decreased risk comes at a cost in the form of significantly reduced rewards
for you since the short option position also caps your profits.
Table 11-2 provides a summary of the risk, reward and breakevens for a bull
call debit spread and bear put debit spread.

Chapter 11: Limiting Your Downside When Trading the Trend

When you place an order for a new vertical debit spread, consider using a
limit amount that is less than the quoted price for the combined position to
reduce the impact of slippage. You probably won’t be able to execute the
trade at the mid-point of the spread, but you likely can get the order filled if
you shave a little off the debit amount. 
Spreading the risk with a credit trade
Debit spreads are not the only type of spread trade you can create using calls
or puts. You can switch which strike price is purchased and which is sold in
the debit spreads to create a credit spread instead. Once again, the spread
requires that you buy one option and sell another of the same type expiring
the same month. You can create two different vertical credit spreads:
 Bear call spread: You create a bear call spread by purchasing a call
option and simultaneously selling another call option that expires the
same month. The short call has a lower strike price. Since the price of a
lower strike call is more expensive, you receive a credit for the trade.
The long call ends up covering the short call, so this spread trade has
significantly less risk than a naked short call option.
 Bull put spread: You create a bear put spread by purchasing a put
option and simultaneously selling another put option that expires the
same month. The short put has a higher strike price. Since the price of a
higher strike put is more expensive, you receive a credit for the trade.
The long put ends up covering the short put, so this spread trade has
significantly less risk than a naked short put option.
196
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 
Spread Trade Floor Appeal 
Traders on the exchange floors manage their
risk by staying hedged in the market. This
means when they make a market for your long
call order and end up with a short call position,
they will usually buy shares of stock or other
long calls to cover this new short position.
When you enter an order for a vertical spread
for a debit, the trader can execute your order
without having to worrying about hedging the
position. They basically just create a vertical
spread for a credit. It’s not that they’re trying to
trade against you — all they care about is stay-
ing hedged.
Vertical spread orders are appealing to floor
traders because when they execute the trade,
they don’t have to do anything else. They’re
already hedged. That’s why you can usually get
a vertical spread order executed below the
debit quoted in the market. 

Assessing risk and reward for a call credit spread
Your maximum risk for the bear call spread is limited to the difference
between option strike prices minus the credit received when creating the
trade. The position uses the long call to limit the short call risk which by
itself is unlimited. Instead of placing an XYZ bear put spread for a debit, you
can create an XYZ bear call spread for a credit.
You create the bear call spread by purchasing the higher strike less expen-
sive call option and selling the lower strike more expensive call option:
 Buy 1 Jan 55 call @ $0.95 and
 Sell 1 Jan 50 call @ $3.20
For credit spreads, the net credit is also the maximum reward. The reward,
risk, and breakeven calculations for a bear call spread follow:
 Credit = Max Reward = (3.20 – 0.95) × 100 = $225.00
 Max Risk = [($55 – 50) × 100] – 225.00 = $275.00
 Breakeven = $50 + ($3.20 – 0.95) = 50 + 2.25 = $52.25
A bear call spread position reduces the risk by capping losses for the short
call. Reducing your risk this way means your rewards are reduced. Your maxi-
mum reward is the initial credit for the spread. This occurs if XYZ closes below
the short call strike price at expiration, resulting in both options expiring
worthless.

using Optionetics Platinum, an options analysis software package.

The risk chart identifies the following important areas:
 Max risk of $275 displayed by the lower horizontal line
 Max reward of $225 displayed by the upper horizontal line
 A breakeven stock price of $52.25 displayed by a dark vertical line
 A range from losses to profits displayed by a diagonal line extending
from the lower strike price to the higher strike price.
If the underlying stock is near the short strike price on the last trading day
before expiration, you run the risk of being assigned on the short option over
expiration weekend, but may no longer have the ability to exercise your long
contract rights. Close a vertical credit spread for a debit on the last trading
day before expiration if the price of the underlying is near the short strike
price. 
Assessing risk and reward for a put credit spread
Your maximum risk for the bull put spread is limited to the difference
between option strike prices minus the credit received when creating the
trade. The position uses the long put to significantly reduce the short put risk
which is high. Instead of placing an ABC bull call spread for a debit, you can
create an ABC bull put spread for a credit.
You create a bull put spread by purchasing the lower strike less expensive
put option and selling the higher strike more expensive put option:
 Buy 1 Jan 35 put @ $1.70 and
 Sell 1 Jan 40 put @ $4.10
For credit spreads, the net credit is also the maximum reward. The reward,
risk, and breakeven calculations for a bull put spread follow:
 Credit = Max Reward = ($4.10 – 1.70) × 100 = $240.00
 Max Risk = [($40 – 35) × 100] – 240.00 = $260.00
 Breakeven = $40 – ($4.10 – 1.70) = 40 – 2.40 = $37.60
A bull put spread position reduces the risk by capping losses for the short
put. Reducing your risk this way means your rewards are reduced. Your maxi-
mum reward is the initial credit for the spread. This occurs if ABC closes
above the short put strike price at expiration, resulting in both options expir-
ing worthless.

The cost of slippage is included in this risk graph.
Always monitor conditions for the stock after the close of trading on the last
day of trading before expiration. You never want to allow a limited risk posi-
tion to turn into a high or unlimited risk position because you failed to
manage the trade though the end.
Summarizing your credit risks & rewards
The risk graph for a vertical credit spread is similar to that of the vertical
debit spread with both risk and reward limited. It significantly improves the
short call or short put risk graph by capping risks that are either unlimited or
limited but high. This is accomplished by creating a position that covers the
short option rather than leaving it naked.

Combining Options to Limit
Your Position Risk
In This Chapter
 Covering options with stock
 Reducing the cost of protection
 Expanding on vertical spreads
 Changing the spread time horizon
B
asic option positions reduce risk by reducing your position cost.
However, the real power from these securities is unleashed when combin-
ing them with stock and other options. Starting with option positions covered
with stock, I profile the risk and provide you with a strategy that discounts the
cost of put protection for long stock. This strategy is known as a collar. 
Covered option strategies with stock can be expanded to include just options
when you vary different components of a vertical spread. By using the same
strike price in the vertical spread while varying the expiration month for the
two options, you create a calendar spread which adds time flexibility to the
position. By allowing the strike prices to also change, you create a diagonal
spread that provides even more flexibility for almost any short-term to long-
term outlook.
Combining Options with Stocks
When you protect a short option position with stock or a long option of the
same type, it is said to be covered. Calls can be sold when holding a long
stock position to reduce the cost of the position and bring in some incremen-
tal income. Similarly, a short put can be sold against short stock to boost the
returns. Both positions reduce risk slightly by reducing the stock’s cost basis,
but neither option protects it. Fortunately, you can add protection in the
form of a collar strategy.

Creating “covered” positions
A covered position includes a short option with an obligation that you satisfy
with stock or a long option of the same type for the same underlying. Rather
than the unlimited or high risk associated with naked options, covered posi-
tions significantly reduce your risk. Approaching covered options from the
stock side, you sell options against the underlying to bring in additional
income and reduce the position risk by changing the cost basis.
Covered calls
When you own stock you can sell calls against it to bring in additional
income. Because a credit is brought into your account when you sell the call,
you also reduce the risk of the long stock position. A significant downside for
you when bringing in this incremental income is that you’re capping potential
gains. If the market price of the stock moves up, rising above the strike price
of the call, you’ll be obligated to sell the stock at the lower strike price.
If for any reason you need to hold onto a stock position (i.e. capital gains or
similar reasons), do not sell calls against it. Otherwise the covered call
behaves just like a naked call — a position with unlimited risk.
Use long stock with a covered call to
 Reduce long stock risk incrementally by the short call credit
 As an income strategy for a portfolio position
When implementing a covered call strategy as a shorter term trade, your
preference is to realize gains though assignment. For that reason, the short
call strike price should be above the long stock purchase price. Always keep
in mind that your risk with such a position is still pretty high — just because
you have a bullish outlook for the stock doesn’t mean it will necessarily go up
in the short-term (or the long-term for that matter).
It’s best to have a long option when the impact of time decay is at a minimum
and it’s best to have a short option when time decay accelerates — that is
less than 30 to 45 days to expiration.
Covered puts
When you are short stock you can sell puts against the position to bring in
additional income. Because a credit is brought into your account when you
sell the put, you also reduce the cost basis of the short stock position result-
ing in slightly reduced risk for the position. The downside for you is that
you’re capping potential gains. 
202
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

But why cap your gains this way? When I’m bearish on a stock, I prefer to
capitalize on that with a long put or bear put spread.
The short put position is an obligation, not a right. You can’t elect to have the
stock put to you to offset the short stock position. The put doesn’t serve as
protection — you would need to buy a call to change the position risk from
unlimited to limited.
If you’re like me and like to reduce risk and maximize rewards, I’d focus more
on vertical spreads than this particular strategy. For that reason, this strat-
egy discussion is limited. 
Covering the covered call position
You can use covered option position as short-term strategies or to increase
income for longer term holdings. One main thing you need to keep in mind is
that short options come with obligations not rights. The option leg is covered
not the stock, which maintains high risk for the covered call.
Covered call strategy
A short call is a bearish position that is created for a credit. Since time decay
works in your favor, you generally establish this position with 30-45 days or
less until expiration. There are two reasons you create this position:
 You own the stock and you’re long-term bullish on it, but moderately
bearish in the short-term or
 As part of a trading strategy, you’re short-term bullish on a stock and
seek to boost returns by selling a call and being assigned on the stock.
Even though both of these are slightly different, the risk-reward profile for the
combined position is the same. Your risk is high but limited due to the unpro-
tected stock. This risk is slightly reduced by the call credit. 
The covered call position is appropriate when you have a moderately bullish,
short-term outlook for the stock. If you are extremely bullish in the short-
term, a long call is a better strategy since it allows unlimited gains while the
covered call position caps gains. 
Your rewards are capped with a long stock-short call position because if the
stock rises above the short call strike price by expiration, you will be
assigned on the position and forced to sell your shares of stock.
203
Chapter 12: Combining Options to Limit Your Position Risk

Covered call risk profile
You purchase stock and sell a short call when you have a short-term bullish
outlook for the underlying. The short call strike price should be above the
stock purchase price so the stock gets called away for a profit. If you remain
bullish at expiration, it’s ideal for the stock to close just below the strike
price so you can sell another call (assuming the original call expires worth-
less). You can continue to do this if your outlook is bullish and you own the
stock.
Your risk associated with a long stock-short call position is similar to a basic
long stock position – limited but high. Your maximum reward for the position
is capped by the short option. After the stock rises above the short call strike
price, you are at risk of assignment. If the strike price is higher than your
stock purchase price, you profit when assigned. You calculate risk, reward,
and breakeven for a long stock-short call position as follows:
Max Risk = (Stock Purchase Price × # of shares) – Call Premium
Max Reward = [(Call Strike Price – Stock Purchase Price) × 100] + Initial
Credit
Breakeven Level = Stock Purchase Price – Call Price
Your breakeven price for the position is the stock purchase price minus the
option price when the position is sold. Below this level, losses accrue. 
Never allow a short call that is part of a covered position become uncovered
by selling the underlying stock. This turns a limit risk position into an unlim-
ited one. If you wish to exit the long stock position, you must buy the call
back first or exit both at the same time using a combination order.
Suppose ABC is trading at $37.72 and you’re short-term bullish on it. With 30
days to go until expiration, the market for the near term 40 strike price call is
$0.50. This represents a $50 credit when sold. Before entering a trade, you
calculate your risk, reward, and breakeven for a position that includes 100
shares of ABC stock and one short call.
Max Risk = ($37.72 × 100) – 50 = $3,722
Max Reward = [($40 – 37.72) × 100] + 50 = $228 + 50 = $278
Breakeven = $37.72 + 0.50 = $37.22
Figure 12-1 displays the risk graph for the ABC covered call strategy. Your
breakeven appears as a vertical line drawn where profits = 0 (37.22). 
204
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

The risk graph includes three curved lines displaying the expected value of
the position given ABC’s price and the implied volatility of its options. The
price of the short option decreases as expiration near. 
A short call that is covered by long stock does not protect the long stock.
The position risk remains similar to long stock alone.
Reducing protected stock costs
Covering a short call obligation and protecting a long stock position are not
the same thing. Although the covered call strategy is considered a relatively
conservative approach to investing, it actually leaves you exposed to risk
that is very similar to long stock. Another way you can manage stock risk for
less money than a protective put strategy (see Chapter 10) is by creating a
collar on the stock. You create a collar using the following:
 Long stock
 Protective put on the underlying stock
 Short call on the underlying stock
By selling a call in combination with a protected stock position you reduce the
cost of that protection. Your only obligation is from the short call because the
put represents a right. The short call remains covered by the stock.
A short option represents an obligation that is only considered covered if
there are no other obligations or requirements for the associated stock or
long option. 
Figure 12-1:

205
Chapter 12: Combining Options to Limit Your Position Risk

Defining a collar
You create a collar by purchasing a put and selling a call for a new or existing
stock position. It is a limited risk, limited reward position that:
 Significantly reduces long stock and covered call risk from limited, but
high to simply limited
 Significantly reduces long stock rewards from unlimited to limited
A covered call strategy is often considered a short term trade or income gen-
erator while a collared position is considered a protected position. The main
goal of the short call is to reduce the cost of protection. This slightly reduces
the risk of a protected put position.
Once you sell a call short you are obligated to sell the underlying stock when
assigned. Do not create a collar around a position unless you’re willing and
able to part with the underlying stock.
Collaring long stock
A collar is a hedged position that has limited risk and limited reward. Your
risk is limited to the downside by the put strike price and your reward is lim-
ited to the upside by the call strike price. If the stock goes below the strike
price you don’t necessarily need to exercise the put. You can decide to sell
the put for a profit instead.
The long put and short call strike prices create a cap on long stock risks and
rewards, respectively. The two option positions in combination provide a
collar around the stock price.
As a general example, you can use a collar when you have a definite short-
term bearish view on a stock position that you prefer to hold in anticipation
of longer term gains. In this instance, you would want to have both the put
and call as close to at-the-money (ATM) as possible to minimize both the
downside risk and the cost of the protection. 
The term peg is used to describe the cap a short call creates on long stock
appreciation. You may see this applied to the short call position when review-
ing account balances. 
Profiling collar risks
The risk associated with a collar strategy is significantly less than long stock.
The long put caps the risk, while increasing the position’s cost. This cost is
slightly off-set by the credit received when selling the call.
Suppose you own 100 shares of ABC at $37.86 and you’re bearish on it over
the next 11⁄2 months. You want to protect your position, but don’t want to
spend a lot of money to do it. You decide to create a collar around ABC using
next month options which expire in 45 days. 
206
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Before buying a 37.50 strike put option for $1.20 and selling the 40 strike call
option at $0.70 you complete the following key calculations: 
Net Debit = (1.20 – 0.70) × 100) = $50
Max Risk = [(Stock Purchase Price – Put Strike Price) × 100)] + Net Debit =
[($37.86 – 37.50) × 100] + 50 = $86
Max Reward = [(Call Strike Price – Stock Purchase Price) × 100] – Net
Debit = [($40 – 37.86) × 100] – 50 = $164
Breakeven = Stock Purchase Price + Net Debit = $37.86 + 0.50 = $38.36
Your risk for the position is the difference between your stock purchase and
the put strike price, plus the net cost of the options. In terms of the maximum
reward, after the stock rises above the short call strike price, you are at risk
of assignment and will be obligated to sell your shares at the strike. If the
strike price is higher than the stock purchase price plus option premiums,
you profit when assigned.
Figure 12-2 displays your risk graph for the collar position. 
Varying Vertical Spreads 
A vertical spread is a position that combines a long option and a short option
for the same underlying that meets all of the following:
 Are the same type (call or put)
 Expire in the same month
 Have different strike prices
Figure 12-2:
Risk graph
for a long
ABC stock

207
Chapter 12: Combining Options to Limit Your Position Risk

You can create a vertical spread for a net credit or a net debit depending on
your outlook for the stock and the current level of volatility implied in the
options. By changing the strike prices, you can change the risk profile for a
given vertical spread.
A calendar or diagonal spread is long the closer month option and short the
further month option is equivalent to holding a naked position. These are not
strategies consistent with good risk management. 
It’s also possible to create a spread that varies the time until expiration for
the two options rather than the strike price. This position is known as a cal-
endar spread and is similar to a vertical spread using the same strike price,
but different expiration months. 
You can also vary both the expiration month and strike prices for the two
options. This is a diagonal spread referring to the diagonal line that can be
drawn between strike prices on an option chain. 
Calendar spreads and diagonal spreads that use a long option for the later
month leg of the spread are limited risk positions. 
 Call calendar and diagonal spreads have unlimited reward potential after
expiration of the short option. 
 Put calendar and diagonal spreads have limited, but high reward poten-
tial after expiration of the short option.
Changing your vertical spread risk profile
You can change the risk profile for a given vertical spread by changing the
strike prices used in it, while maintaining your outlook for the stock. That’s
one reason you need to explore different vertical spreads. Although a few ver-
tical spreads might satisfy your outlook, there may be one that is best suited
to your risk. Calculating the reward-risk ratio for different spreads is one way
to obtain an apples-apples comparison for the different alternatives.
You can create vertical spreads for a debit or a credit. To help keep the out-
look and credit/debit result clear, consider the outlook for the more expensive
option. A short call is bearish and brings a credit into your account. The short
call option in a bear call spread is more expensive so this is a credit spread.
In addition to identifying the vertical spread with the best reward-risk ratio,
you may also uncover a volatility skew that makes one particular position
stand out. A volatility skew is a condition that arises in the option markets
where options for the same underlying have implied volatilities (IVs) that are
significantly different from the others. This can happen when demand factors
impact option prices.
208
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

There are two types of volatility skews: 
 Price skew: Options expiring in the same month have IVs that deviate
from normal conditions (i.e. ITM options higher IV than OTM options).
 Time skew: Options expiring in different months have IVs that deviate
from normal conditions (i.e. options expiring sooner have IV that is
higher than options expiring later).
You capitalize on volatility skews by selling the option with atypically high IV
and/or buying the option with the atypically low IV as part of the strategy.
When uncovering a volatility skew, be sure to check the news for the company
to determine if there is a specific reason for the condition.
Spreading time with calendars
You create a calendar spread by combining a long option and a short option
for the same underlying that meet the following:
 Are the same type (call or put)
 Expire in different months
 Have the same strike price
The longer term option costs more than a shorter term option with the same
strike price, so you create the position for a net debit to your account.
You may decide to use a calendar spread in place of a vertical spread if your
 Short-term outlook is neutral to bearish while your long-term outlook is
bullish (call calendar spread)
 Short-term outlook is neutral to bullish while your long-term outlook is
bearish (put calendar spread)
In both cases the short-term, short option reduces the cost of the later
month long option. The strategy isn’t appropriate if you’re strongly bearish
or bullish because of either of the following:
 The short-term option will be assigned
 The long-term option will lose too much value
Your risk is limited when using the long option as the longer term leg of the
spread for both call and put calendar spreads. 
209
Chapter 12: Combining Options to Limit Your Position Risk

When a debit spread position includes two options that expire in different
months the reward and breakeven levels are estimates based on the price of
the underlying and volatility at the earlier expiration for the short option.
Assessing calendar risk and reward
When creating a call calendar spread you buy a longer term call and sell
a shorter term call, both at the same strike price. The longer term call is
more expensive so the position is generally created for a net debit. This
initial debit is your maximum possible risk. Managing this trade is a little
different than a vertical spread because you need to consider two time
horizons. 
Although I specifically describe a call calendar spread here, a similar break-
down occurs for a put calendar spread position. There are three scenarios
to consider at expiration for the short option:
 Scenario 1: The stock moved significantly higher than the calendar
strike price and the short call was assigned. In that instance you need to
determine which approach is best:
• Exercising your long call option to satisfy the short call assignment
• Buying the shares in the market and selling your long call if time
values remains (see Chapter 9)
• Buying the shares in the market and creating a bull call spread by
holding the long call and selling a higher strike call option for the
same month
 Scenario 2: The stock moved significantly below the calendar strike
price and the short call expired worthless. In that instance you need to
determine which approach is best:
• Selling your long call option if it still has value
• Creating another spread with the long call if bullish
Consider your outlook for the stock to determine if you want to maintain
the long call position. If bearish exit the position. This highlights the
importance of identifying a downside exit price for the stock prior to
creating a calendar spread. Your decision-making is much easier by
knowing this value in advance. In fact, by expiration you may not have a
decision at all if you already exited both legs of the position as part of
your trade risk management.
A near month option is one that is the closest to its expiration date. A
next month option is one that expires in the month that follows the near
month option.
210
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

 Scenario 3: The stock is near the calendar strike price and the short call
expired worthless. In that instance you need to determine which
approach is best:
• Selling your long call
• Creating another calendar spread using the existing long call and
selling another closer term option at the same strike price
• Creating a bull call spread using the existing long call and selling a
higher strike call option for the same month
After the short term has expired you may be left with an unlimited reward
(long call) or limited but high reward (long put) position.
Profiling calendar spread risk
It’s difficult to calculate potential rewards and breakeven levels for calendar
spreads with a later month, long option because of the different expiration
months for the two legs. Of course this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to
understand them. Fortunately, the strategies are reasonable to include in your
arsenal because you can identify a limited, maximum risk for the position. 
Options analysis applications can estimate rewards and breakeven levels for
calendar spreads using probabilities based on historical and implied volatili-
ties. This data can be extended to risk graphs which are also available.
Figure 12-3 provides a risk graph, accompanied by a price chart for a call cal-
endar spread.
Profits are now displayed on the x-axis and price for the underlying on the 
y-axis. This coincides with price levels for the stock chart.

Chapter 12: Combining Options to Limit Your Position Risk

You must always understand the risks and margin requirements for positions
you create. Paper trading helps you better appreciate risk. Contact your
broker to be sure you truly understand option margin requirements.
Defining diagonal spreads
Diagonal spreads are vertical spreads with different expiration months. You
can vary calendar spread risks and rewards by varying the strike prices used
for the options. You create a diagonal spread by combining a long option and
a short option for the same underlying that meet the following:
 Are the same type (call or put)
 Expire in different months
 Have different strike prices
The longer term option may or may not cost more than a shorter term
option — it just depends on the strike prices and expiration months selected
for the two. This means that both debit and credit spreads are possible when
using a diagonal spread strategy. 
Diagonal spreads can morph into different strategies after the short option is
exited or expires.
Because so many diagonal spread combinations are possible, it’s more diffi-
cult to categorize short-term versus long-term views for the underlying stock.
That’s not really bad news, it’s more of a comment on your flexibility when
using these spreads.
You may decide to use a diagonal spread in place of a calendar spread if your
 Short-term outlook is slightly more bullish than neutral and your long-
term outlook is bullish (call diagonal spread for a debit)
 Short-term outlook is slightly more bearish and your long-term outlook
is bullish (call diagonal spread for a credit)
 Short-term outlook is slightly more bearish than neutral and your long-
term outlook is bearish (put diagonal spread for a debit)
 Short-term outlook is slightly more bullish and your long-term outlook is
bearish (put diagonal spread for a credit)
These diagonal spread combinations are provided as a calendar spread com-
parison in case you have a dilemma trying to find one that fits your outlook
and objectives. The same may hold when considering vertical spreads — a
diagonal spread may be more appealing if you feel the long option could ben-
efit from more time or if a volatility time skew exists. 
212
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

If you exit or allow to expire a long option position that covers a short
option, you have a naked option position. Risk ranges from limited but high
to unlimited.
Your risk is limited when using the long option for the later month leg of the
spread for both call and put diagonal spreads. These spreads present the
same type of timing problems as calendar spreads when calculating the
reward and breakeven values. They should be considered estimates rather
than absolutes when using options analysis applications. 
If considering a diagonal spread that uses the short option for the later
month expiration, think of it as holding a naked position.
Assessing risk and reward for diagonal spreads
Suppose you’re moderately bullish on a stock in the short-term and believe
that when the market strengthens in a couple of months, it will give a nice
boost to the stock. It is currently trading at trading at $46.64. You note there
is currently a modest time skew between next month options and those that
expire three months later. 
You wish to purchase a call that is near the money and want to finance the
trade with a short call that expires sooner. To reduce the chance of assign-
ment, you decide to use a diagonal spread in place of a calendar spread. 
The next month $50 strike price call expires in 35 days and has a bid at $1.80
(IV of 34.6). The 47.50 strike price call expiring three months later has an
offer price of $3.10 (IV of 32.4). The risk for the position is the initial debit
which is $130.00. The reward and breakeven are variable. 
Figure 12-4 displays the risk graph for the call diagonal spread. If the stock is
below $50 at the closer term expiration and the short call expires worthless,
you have a few alternatives available for the remaining long call.

Exchange-Traded Funds
In This Chapter
 Understanding exchange-traded funds
 Reducing volatility with sectors
 Implementing ETF strategies in your portfolio
 Trading ETFs and ETF options
E
xchange-traded funds (ETF) are relatively new investment products well
received by Wall Street so the ETF universe should continue to grow.
Much more importantly, they are a great tool for retail traders enabling you
to trade a variety of markets and sectors individually or with options. No
wonder I’m a fan.
ETFs enable you to reduce risk by offering un-leveraged access to certain
asset classes and implementing strategies only previously available to larger
investors. ETFs can also reduce volatility. As an option trader I don’t feel the
need to completely avoid volatility — quite the contrary. It has its place on
the trading side. But that place may be best explored after you’ve taken care
of you longer term financial goals. 
Introducing the Exchange-Traded Fund
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a security that is made up of different com-
ponent stocks, bonds, and/or commodities and is typically designed to track
a specific index or segment of the market. If you’re not very familiar with
these instruments, one of the best ways to understand them is by comparing
them to market indexes. There are many similarities between the two, but
one important difference makes ETFs very powerful: you can own an ETF.
That means you expand the option strategies available to you.

Because ETFs track a group of securities, ETF volatility is less than that of its
component stocks, bonds, or commodities. That’s because a strong decline
in one security in the group is offset by less severe declines or gains in the
other components. Option traders don’t want to shy away from volatility, but
can benefit from recognizing when using a less volatile instrument is helpful.
And this concept is a must to understand if trading options derived from a
security that is less volatile.
ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but trade like a stock. This means you don’t
have to wait until the end of the day to exit a position.
Comparing ETFs to Indexes
ETFs are similar to indexes in that they both are based on a group of specific,
related securities. An index is a measurement of the market value for these
component stocks, bonds, and/or commodities, while an ETF is a security
that allows you to own that measurement. Most ETFs actually track a specific
index. See Chapter 9 for an index review.
One of the best characteristics ETFs and indexes share is they both have
options available for trading. Since you can own an ETF you can create combi-
nation positions to include index-like products via the ETF. You’ll find this is
a really nice strategy addition given the size of the ETF universe. Navigating
through all the available products should be easier with some of the resources
identified at the end of this section.
Check with your accountant to fully understand the tax implications of
investing and trading ETFs.
Connecting the common ground
Clearly a measure (index) and a security (ETF) are different beasts, but for
now consider these similarities (ETFs share the following characteristics with
indexes):
 Available for a variety of asset classes, sectors, and regions
 Both impacted by the index construction weighting method 
 Offered by a variety of financial service firms
If you’re looking for a segment of the market to invest or trade, there’s a good
chance there’s an ETF that will fit the bill for you. There’s been explosive
growth in these instruments so don’t hesitate seeking an ETF for a market
you wish to trade or a risk you wish to hedge.
216
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Weight management for ETFs
ETF managers use weightings similar to the index weighting method to
achieve similar returns.
The weighting method used for index construction determines the impact a
component security has on the index value. Although an ETF won’t always
track an index exactly, the weighting method affects ETF value changes given
component changes. Here’s what you want to remember about construction
methods for stock indexes:
 A market-capitalization weighted index is impacted more by higher capi-
talization stocks.
 A price weighted index is impacted more by higher priced stocks.
 An equal-weighted index is impacted equally by all component stocks.
Checking out the differences
Before moving on to ways you can access ETFs, here are some differences
between ETFs and indexes:
 You can own an ETF but not an index.
 The actual components used to create an ETF may be different than the
component securities and can include futures and swap arrangements.
 ETFs can be leveraged or have an inverse relationship with the index it
tracks.
ETFs not comprised of the exact basket of component securities can have
moderate daily fluctuations known as premium or discount trading. Some
also possess an additional degree of risk of catastrophic losses if the fund
company used more exotic trading instruments (such as swaps) if not
hedged properly.
Stock risk is high, but limited to the total amount invested when purchased in
a cash account. 
ETFs and risk
Your risk with an ETF is the same as stock ownership; limited, but high
depending on the price of the ETF and whether it was purchased with cash or
on margin. Some of the managed products have yet to be tested under
extreme market conditions.
Certain ETFs have gained popularity because of their uniqueness in the
market. There is a family of ETFs that offers leveraged, inverse, or both attrib-
utes in the ETF. For instance, QID is the Proshares Ultrashort QQQQ which
217
Chapter 13: Benefiting from Exchange-Traded Funds

tracks the inverse value of the Nasdaq 100 Index by two. Owning the QID is
like being short 200 shares of QQQQ. This means you have a second means of
creating a limited risk bearish position for some indexes. Of course put
options tops this list of alternatives.
Many ETFs are passively managed and based upon a specific index such as
the S&P 500 Index. Some newer ETFs are actively managed by portfolio man-
agers who select specific securities for investment. Always check the ETF
prospectus or tear sheet to determine which index, if any, the ETF tracks.
Pinpointing ETF resources 
ETFs trade on major U.S. stock exchanges. Buying and selling these securities
is the same as buying and selling stocks — you enter an order via your
broker using the same order entry process. ETF popularity has also given rise
to the availability of research and scanning tools for these securities on
broker web sites. 
Avoiding “analysis to paralysis” can be tough given the broad range of ETFs
available. By identifying your objectives first, you have a better chance of
staying on track so you can move forward implementing ETF strategies.
When accessing a particular web site or other product materials, consider
the objective of the site sponsor to be sure all of your needs are being met.
For instance, the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) benefits when you trade
ETFs listed on their exchange since that’s how they make their money.

Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Distinguishing ETF and index options
Index options and ETF options both provide you with a way to use option
strategies on a group of related securities. The two products differ in three
important respects:
 Because ETF options have an underlying security you can own, they
lend themselves to combination strategies.
 Index options are cash-settled while ETF options are settled using the
underlying instrument. 
 Index options are European style or American style while ETF options
are only American style.
If you want to avoid assignment on all but the exercise day, then an index
option may be your only alternative. 
Leverage is a double-edged sword. It can magnify your losses just as it magni-
fies gains.
Naturally there are similarities as well. Whether using index option or ETF
option strategies, be sure to consider the following:
 Contract liquidity: Not all options are actively traded. Be sure spreads
don’t significantly impact your slippage costs.
 Impact of dividends: Certain groups of stocks provide higher dividend
payouts. Be sure to incorporate dividends in option pricing calculators.
 Volatility: Because both represent baskets of securities they tend to be
less volatile then their components.
Checking out strategies and new instruments by paper trading is a good way
to get an inexpensive lesson for unexpected risk for either of these securities.
Index and ETF values are both affected by dividends and as a result, so are the
options for them. As soon as dividend announcements are made these values
are priced into calls and puts currently available. Option calculators allow you
to incorporate dividend payments that occur during the life of the option.
Identifying ETF option advantages
Because this book focuses on option trading, the number-one advantage of ETF
options over index options is the opportunity to access combination strategies.
ETF options are more flexible because you can own the underlying security.
ETF option characteristics also make them more straightforward. You won’t
be worrying about different exercise, expiration or last trading days for ETF
options because they are all American style, just as with stocks. If you have
219
Chapter 13: Benefiting from Exchange-Traded Funds

already traded stock options, ETF options are a pretty natural next step
for you.
ETFs have expense ratios just like mutual funds. Because so many ETFs are
passively managed they are generally lower than mutual funds fees, but com-
pare ETFs to be sure you’re accessing one with reasonable ones. 
By using ETFs in your investing, you quickly and inexpensively access a group
of securities which can reduce the fluctuations (volatility) in your portfolio.
This topic is covered more in the next section, but basically you’re able to
accomplish a big investing goal: diversification. ETF options provide this at a
significantly reduced cost, reducing your risk.
As with stocks, not all ETFs have options available for trading. For those that
do, not all will have LEAPS available. These are long-term option contracts
that have expirations ranging from more than nine months to 21⁄2 years. 
Two additional risks ETF options and ETF LEAPS introduce for you the
following:
 Time risks associated with options in general because these securities
can expire worthless
 Potential leveraged losses on the downside
Weighing out my choices, I’m personally okay with increasing the potential
percentage loss when I’m significantly reducing my initial investment. But
remember, this is a personal choice and you must weigh your own risk toler-
ances and preferences against using such approaches.
Commissions are charged on ETF purchases and sales, which can raise the
cost of using these products for investing or trading. Many mutual funds can
be bought and sold without a commission if held a minimum period of time.
Accessing combination strategies
When combining ETFs with ETF options, you have access to an index-based
security that you can protect, reduce its cost, or both. Using ETFs, you can
incorporate these strategies to manage risk:
 Protective put position: Long ETF combined with a long put. Limits the
ETF downside risk to the put strike price and slightly increases the cost
of the ETF. A high, but limited risk is turned into a limited risk position.
Potential rewards remain unlimited above the price of the ETF plus ETF
option.
 Covered call position: Long ETF combined with a short call. Reduces the
cost of the position, moderately reducing risk. It is an income-generating
strategy for a short-term bearish outlook on a long-term holding.
Potential rewards are capped by the call strike price, so a previously
unlimited reward position becomes limited.
220
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

 Collared position: Long ETF combined with a long put and a short call.
Limits the ETF’s downside risk to the put strike price and increases the
cost of the ETF. This net increase to cost is less than a protective put
position because the credit brought in by the call slightly off-sets the put
cost. As a result, the high, but limited risk is turned into a limited risk
position. Potential rewards are capped by the call strike price, so a pre-
viously unlimited reward position becomes limited.
Not all ETFs have options available for trading. When researching ETFs for
investing or trading, be sure to check whether options trade for the underly-
ing and how liquid the fund and option contracts are. 
Reducing Portfolio Volatility with ETFs
Volatility is a measure of security movement and varies by asset. An ETF is
less volatile than one of its component stocks. However, if you decide to use
longer term ETF option strategies for investing, you still have to be sure to
purchase long options when the volatility conditions are right. If you have
access to options analysis software, check relative historical volatility (HV)
and implied volatility (IV) levels for the options. If you don’t have access to
IV charts you can get a quick view of relative volatility conditions for an ETF
using Bollinger bands on a price chart. 
In addition to the important role implied volatility has in option pricing, rela-
tive levels for each will help an individual select a strategy appropriate for
market conditions.
Revisiting volatility
An exchange-traded fund’s (ETFs) historical volatility (HV) calculation is just
like the one for stock — it uses past price changes over a certain period of
time to quantify the range an ETF travels. It allows you to complete an
apples-to-apples comparison to:
 Different HV time horizons for the ETF
 The implied volatility of the ETF
 The HV of another security
Implied volatility (IV) is the option volatility implied by current market prices.
It includes different market participants’ expectations for the ETF, along with
demand factors for that particular option. IV is a “plug” figure in option pric-
ing models meaning it’s the value needed to correctly price an option after all
of the known values such as strike price, ETF price, and so on are considered.
Vega is the option Greek that measures the expected change in option value
for every 1% change in implied volatility.
221
Chapter 13: Benefiting from Exchange-Traded Funds

Getting just a current reading of the IV for an ETF is usually not enough to
gain a sense of relative levels unless you are so familiar with the ETF’s price
movement that you know when the reading is in-line with typical values.
By using a chart to compare current IV to previous levels, you gain a much
better sense of whether the values represent high, low, or average readings. 
Trends and volatility are two primary factors impacting market conditions.
There are three possible trends for the markets to exhibit: upward, down-
ward, or sideways. In terms of volatility, the markets can be quiet traveling
over a moderate range over a given period or more explosive with wider
ranges reached over the same period.
Figure 13-1 displays an IV chart for a broad-based stock market index ETF.
Different lines are used to identify IV for different expiration periods.
While checking relative IV levels, you should also compare current IV levels
to HV. This provides you with a comparison of expectations versus past
movement and will alert you to something unusual that may be happening.
“Unusual” may be a trading opportunity or it may be a trading pothole you
want to navigate around. Figure 13-2 displays an HV chart for the same broad-
based stock market index ETF used in Figure 13-1.
Volatility and risk
Volatility is a measure of risk and reward because the moves a security makes
has a direct impact on your returns. The bigger the price swings in an ETF,
the bigger the potential risk since declines can occur rapidly. You may decide
to accept this high potential risk because price swings go both ways — gains
can accumulate quickly too.
When buying options you pay more for those based on an underlying secu-
rity that is more volatile since its past movement (measured by historical
volatility) is a major component in the option’s implied volatility (IV). It’s
really important to understand that IV is part of the time value portion of an
option — the portion that decays each day you get close to expiration. 
Figure 13-1:
Two-year
implied
volatility
chart for
SPY.
222
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

The fact that this risk measure increases an option’s cost makes it that much
more critical for you to understand both volatility measures (HV and IV). It’s
not just about increased risk and reward, it’s about paying for this risk. Do
what you can to minimize the cost by purchasing volatility when IV levels are
relatively low and selling it when value decay accelerates near expiration.
Historical volatility (HV) also referred to as statistical volatility (SV) does not
predict the future volatility of an asset. It uses past data to quantify movement
of the asset and allow for an apples-to-apples comparison to other assets.
Security risk
Risk varies by security type and is inherent in the stock, bond, and commodi-
ties market. While diversification alleviates some market risk, it doesn’t
create a risk-free investment. Investors accept market risk to address another
financial risk — the risk that savings will not outpace inflation.
You must always understand the risks associated with the securities you
choose for investments and trading. If you don’t thoroughly understand
these risks, you should continue to use securities you do understand.
Generally higher risk for an individual stock translates to higher volatility
which means rewards can be greater with an investment in an individual
stock. Table 13-2 summarizes the relative risk/volatility levels for stocks, sec-
tors and the market as a whole.

Investing with ETFs
Although most of the discussions in the book address trading topics, you
have to admit it’s hard to focus on trading if things in your investment portfo-
lio aren’t in good order. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide you with inex-
pensive access to a diversified group of stocks via broad-based index ETFs or
a combination of sector ETFs, similar to mutual funds. What ETFs have that
mutual funds don’t offer is protection via option strategies. 
ETF investing opportunities available to option traders include:
 Investment in diversified market portfolio via broad-based sector ETFs
 Development of a diversified market portfolio via sector ETFs
 Protective put positions using ETFs
 Collared positions using ETFs
 ETF LEAPS portfolios
Since mutual funds similarly provide an inexpensive way to diversify, the best
thing ETFs bring to your investment plan is the opportunity to protect the
portfolio with options.
Portfolio management includes the allocation of assets across and within
asset classes. This means you seek to diversify holdings by investing in differ-
ent types of assets (i.e. stocks, bonds, and commodities) while diversifying
within those assets as well.
This section provides one approach to investing using a protective put posi-
tion for the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY). Unfortunately it has to be said that this
is just for illustrative purposes — it’s not a recommendation since everyone’s
situation is different. 
Traders managing their investments should complete an investment analysis
and trading analysis at separate times since the holding period time horizons
are different for each. It’s difficult to exit a short-term position on market
weakness and not think about similarly exiting your longer term holdings.
Selecting ETFs for investment (for illustrative purposes only)
Although an ETF may track a major index, it doesn’t mean that particular ETF
is your best choice. Things to look for when selecting an ETF include:
 How well it tracks the index or benchmark: The most thorough way to
determine how well a passive ETF tracks its benchmark index is to per-
form a correlation analysis for the returns of the benchmark and the
224
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

ETF. This requires access to daily closing values for an extended period
of time, minimally a year. 
There are Web sites that allow you to obtain correlation results for
either a limited period of time or using a limited number of ETFs. Smart
Money has a Correlation Tracker in the subscription portion of its Web
site that is licensed to a variety of ETF providers (no fee). One of the
best ways to find current correlation tools information is by completing
a Web search on “ETF correlation”.
 The liquidity of the ETF: If you find an ETF that uniquely meets your
needs and you’re planning on holding it for a longer time, liquidity is less
of an issue. If you plan on being more active with the ETF consider those
with volume of one million daily shares as a quick rule of thumb.
 Whether options are available and option liquidity: For both ETFs and
options, the Bid-Ask spread can be used as a relative measure of share
or contract liquidity. Large spreads indicate less liquid, while small
spreads indicate more widely traded issues. Use option chain data to
check spreads for the highest open interest contracts to get the best feel
of whether the option contracts will meet your needs.
 The expense ratio for the ETF: Expense ratio data and the instruments
used by the fund to track an index should be available via the research
portion of your broker’s Web site, or using prospectus and tear sheet
data from the ETF provider or other ETF resources.
 What instruments the fund uses to obtain its results: Some funds may
use more exotic derivatives to track its target index. Read the prospec-
tus to determine if these securities add any additional risk to the ETF.
The asset allocations you hold depend on your individual needs, constraints,
and risk tolerance, as well as your outlook on different groups. There is no
one size fits all for investing.
Assessing market conditions (illustrative)
Suppose one of your main investment goals is to obtain results that are simi-
lar to the S&P 500 Index (SPX). The actual annual returns for the past 30
years for this index suits your risk tolerance and time horizon. Using this as
your portfolio benchmark, you want to select an ETF that serves as a good
proxy for the index — SPY fits the bill. 
It’s early fall 2007 — you just added $10,000 to an investment account and
need to decide how to put the money to work. You are primarily focused on
whether you should allocate this money to a broad-based market index now
or wait for your next portfolio assessment scheduled in a few weeks. 
225
Chapter 13: Benefiting from Exchange-Traded Funds

You plan on evaluating the following to help with your decision-making:
 Weekly chart for SPY with volume, a volume indicator, and two moving
averages
 Weekly chart for SPY with a momentum indicator and Bollinger bands
 Arm’s Index readings for the New York Composite Index (NYA) with an
NYA overlay
 Weekly VIX chart with SPX overlay and relative strength comparison
Even though you tend to avoid using market timing techniques for your
investment dollars, you’re still leery about creating new positions in the fall.
You can’t help but think about the quick, strong declines (a.k.a. crashes) that
have occurred in the past. Unfortunately, you know nice rallies have devel-
oped during this time too.
No one knows what the market will do in the next day, week, month, or year.

226
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

SPY is well correlated to the SPX and serves as a reasonable proxy to com-
plete market analysis. Rather than analyzing SPX for your market assessment
and SPY for position analysis, you decide to use SPY in the market analysis as
well. Using the charts you note that:
 SPY is in a long-term uptrend: The 10-week exponential moving average
(EMA) is trending upward and is higher than a slightly upward trending
40-week EMA.
Check longer term trends first since they tend to be stronger.
 ETF volume still needs to confirm the move: Volume is a little bit of a
concern because last month’s strong decline was accompanied by
strong volume, while the more recent recovery occurred on lighter
volume. In addition, the current on balance volume (OBV) reading has
not yet confirmed the recovery. It’s possible it can diverge from here.
 Momentum is not confirming the move: Typically, sustainable moves
for SPY are accompanied by movement of the 13-week ROC above its 21-
period simple moving average (SMA). ROC remains below the SMA, but
is not signaling a divergence since it is moving upward. 
 Bollinger bands showing decreased volatility: Price recently moved
above the 20-week SMA as the bands were contracting.

227
Chapter 13: Benefiting from Exchange-Traded Funds

Technical tools can confirm a price move or may diverge from price actions
providing a warning about the current trend.
These chart conditions do not provide an overwhelmingly bullish picture,
but you can’t ignore the long-term trend for the ETF . . . especially since
many indicators lag price. You decide to evaluate put options to protect
your existing SPY position given the current volatility environment. You
continue your market analysis by evaluating the daily Arm’s Index (TRIN)
chart.
The Arm’s Index is a breadth indicator that uses advancing and declining
stock data for the New York Composite Index (NYA). For more detail on
applying this tool, See Chapter 5. The indicator is currently in neutral terri-
tory and is strengthening after the recent decline in NYA. This index has a
strong positive correlation with SPX and SPY. Recent spikes down on the
chart may have signaled a bottom was formed in August.
Many ETFs are actually unit investment trusts which are similar to mutual
fund investment companies.

relative strength comparison line.

228
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

The VIX and SPX have a strong negative correlation with spikes down in the
VIX coinciding with upward moves in the SPX. The VIX is currently heading
downward indicating a bottom may have formed last month in the SPX. 
The VIX is a measure of implied volatility for SPX options and is also referred
to as the “Fear Index.”
Establishing a position
Rather than waiting to invest the money because of fear about what may
happen, you decide you need to invest the money based on what your techni-
cal and sentiment tools are telling you. You are still committed to hedging
your risk with the purchase of protective puts. 
SPY is trading at $151.97. You purchased 100 shares of SPY in early January at
$141.67 which are now valued at $15,197. You consider purchasing an addi-
tional 50 shares of SPY for approximately $7,600 providing you can purchase
sufficient puts to reasonably hedge all 150 shares. 
Since you are buying the options, you consider both November and
December expiration months to provide the desired protection while still
allowing time to sell the contracts before your 30 days to expiration rule. In
either case, you can re-evaluate SPY conditions when you sell the puts and
roll the contracts out to a later month. You choose not to look beyond
December in the event SPY makes a big move upward by mid-November.
After a quick look at the puts for the two months, you note the December
options are trading for about $1.00 per contract more than the November
contracts. You decide to focus on December options to take you through
most of the Fall before reaching that 30-day mark. Table 13-3 provides a par-
tial option chain for December SPY puts.

Chapter 13: Benefiting from Exchange-Traded Funds

The tightest Bid-Ask spread is for the 150.00 strike price puts, reflecting the
high open interest and strong market for this put. This should reduce costs on
both entry and exit. Although the 154.00 strike price put has a delta near -50
offering a near perfect hedge, you’re considering purchasing four 150.00 strike
price puts to reduce slippage costs and gain additional delta protection for
slightly less money.
Calculating delta you obtain:
SPY
150 shares × +1 = +150 Delta
154.00 Call
3 × –49.96 = –149.9
150.00 Call
4 × –39.00 = –156.0
Stock delta is +1 per share.
The 150.00 strike price put deltas exceed the SPY position, resulting in a
slight directional bias to the downside. Calculating premiums you obtain:
154.00 Call
3 × $5.90 × 100 = $1,770
150.00 Call
4 × $4.30 × 100 = $1,720 
Since the position is an investment and has protection beyond the number of
shares held, you do not identify an exit for a loss price level. At the 30 days to
expiration mark, a new hedge will be implemented.
Tilting Your Portfolio with Sector ETFs
A portfolio tilt is an investing approach that attempts to beat a market bench-
mark by allocating a portion of the funds to an asset that is highly correlated
with that benchmark and adding smaller allocations in sectors that are out-
performing the benchmark. Alternatively, underperforming sectors can be
underweighted. 
Both sector index options and exchange-traded fund (ETF) options can be used
to implement the tilt portion of the portfolio. Using the protected SPY position
created in the last section as a base portfolio, sector ETFs are added to tilt the
portfolio. Assume there is $5,000 available for ETF sector allocations.
Adding sector ETFs to a portfolio
The goal of a portfolio tilt is to add a moderate investment in outperforming
sectors and/or create a bearish position on underperforming sectors. You
230
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

can accomplish this using the sector ETFs from a specific family of ETFs
and comparing the relative strength for each. This next section outlines
one basic approach to selecting outperforming sector ETFs during bullish
periods.
Using SPY as the proxy ETF for the benchmark index — the S&P 500 — the
sector ETFs in the same family are used for the tilt. The method used to
create the tilt is a long only approach with a very basic moving average
market timing tool to identify bullish periods. Long positions are the only
ones considered to minimize risk and the approach remains out of the market
during bearish periods since all of SPDR Sector ETFs have a strong positive
correlation with SPY.
Past performance does not guarantee future returns.
Selecting strong sectors
Relative strength comparison lines are constructed by dividing the price of
one security (A) by the price of another (B). A rising line indicates A is out-
performing B, while a declining line indicates that A is underperforming B.
This line does not provide you with information about the trend of A or B —
both may be rising or declining. A relative strength line provides good, unbi-
ased information on a chart to compare two securities.
Using a technology index and utility index and comparing each to a bench-
mark index, you’ll obtain unrelated ratio values because the two sector
indexes are trading at unrelated levels. To compare the performance of tech-
nology to utilities, you need to either of the following:
 Plot a relative strength comparison for these two indexes
 Calculate the change in value for the sector versus the benchmark
By using changes in the relative ratios instead of the absolute ratio you have
a value that can be compared. This allows you to rank a group of indexes.
Another alternative is to simply calculate the change in values for each index
over a given period. Again, you can’t use index values to rank the sectors but
you can rank the week over week percentage change in value (rate of
change).
Put options provide a limit risk alternative to shorting stock.
Identifying an approach
Using SPY and the nine major Select Sector SPDR ETFs, an investment in an
outperforming ETF will be made to tilt an ETF portfolio. The nine ETFs are
included in Table 13-4.

Outperforming sectors are identified during bullish periods as follows:
1. On a weekly basis rank the ETFs using three-month returns. The top
ranked ETF is the one with the best returns over a three-month period
2. Invest in the top ranked ETF.
3. Maintain investment in ETF until it drops below the third rank
(ranks 4 – 9) for two consecutive weeks.
4. Identify new ETF for investment by repeating steps 1 through 3.
By requiring a two-week drop in rankings, there are fewer changes to the tilt,
keeping costs to a minimum.
Many technical tools can be used to provide you with unbiased rules to follow.
Tracking bullish and bearish periods
Different sectors outperform the market at different times, but when a strong
bear market enters the picture you’ll find few sectors come out unscathed, at
least in the short-term. To minimize the risk on this basic tilt model, no
sector investment is made during bearish periods. 
Two other ETF-like securities are currently available for trading. They include
the widely held Merrill Lynch HOLDRS and the lesser traded Exchange-traded
Note (ETN) from iShares.
232
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Once you feel comfortable the mechanics and risks associated with a tilt
approach, consider using a long ETF plus long put combination for top
ranked ETFs during bearish periods or long puts on bottom ranked ETFs.
Using daily chart for SPY with 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages
(SMAs) plotted, bullish periods are identified as those periods when the 50-
day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. Bearish periods are identified as those
periods when the 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA. So as the 50-day
SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a bearish period is identified. In terms
of the portfolio tilt, this means the sector ETF position is exited.
The advantage of using SMAs to identify bullish and bearish periods is that it
represents an unbiased measure that signal the change. The disadvantage to
this method is that there is a reasonably long lag in signals since SMAs use
historical prices. It’s a trade-off and its validity is one you have to decide for
yourself.
Using the signal to identify bullish and bearish periods, it’s assumed that
$5,000 is the initial investment in the outperforming ETF as a new bullish
period is signaled. The only re-balancing that occurs with the tilt is after the
next bearish-bullish cycle takes place.
Measuring results
Using data from 1/3/2000 to 9/21/2007, there were two bullish periods in
which the tilt was in place:
 1/3/2000 to 11/3/2000
 8/8/2003 to 9/21/2007
Table 13-5 provides some additional statistics for the approach. The SPY
columns provide buy and hold comparison returns for the two bullish periods

The last position entered produced large, atypical gains. Adding mean,
median, and standard deviation calculations to those identified in Table 13-4
will help you assess the consistency of results. It’s deemed that after remov-
ing this last trade the results are still acceptable. The new largest gain is now
27.09% and the end of period value $9,940.
Always complete your own assessment for any system approach you con-
sider implementing to determine suitability.
Selecting the right approach
Investing in the markets requires a reasonable plan that suits your risk toler-
ances and preferences. From a financial standpoint you may be able to afford
a market decline of 10%, but that doesn’t mean it suits you. Some less than
scientific ways to identify whether you’re risking more than maybe you
should is by gauging how you sleep at night or your irritability levels during
market declines. These measures do matter.
Selecting an approach that works for you takes an investment in time. Don’t
expect to map out your perfect plan the first go around. By identifying a rea-
sonable approach that manages risk and then testing it, paper trading it,
and/or initiating small positions to start, you’ll develop a plan that’s suitable
for you. 
Using a sector approach with a portion of your investments has advantages
and disadvantages. Considering both is an important part of building your
own plan.
234
Part III: What Every Trader Needs to Know About Options 

Advantages of sector investing with ETFs
The main advantage to sector trading is that it allows you to benefit from
gains in outperforming sectors and ideally eek out slightly better returns than
a simple buy and hold approach using a passive fund. Other advantages to
sector investing includes:
 Produces less volatile result than individual stock positions
 Reduces trading stress by minimizing portfolio decision-making
 There are a variety of ETF choices making it a flexible approach
Disadvantages of sector investing with ETFs
The main disadvantage to sector trading is that strong declines in the mar-
kets are often widespread — usually all sectors will drop together. This
means that you cannot bank on profits week after week, month after month.
Sector investing may only moderately outperform a declining market. Other
disadvantages include:
 Costs of trading including slippage, taxes, and commissions
 Represents risk that is not hedged
 Cost of protection for the core holding may offset or exceed gains from
sector approach
 Approaches generally based on past data which cannot be guaranteed in
the future
 Requires identifying suitable sector proxies for a group of ETFs
 Is not a substitute for effective risk management

In this part . . .
O
ption strategies go beyond stock trading alternatives.
When trading options you can beneﬁt from large
moves in a stock, regardless of the direction of the move
when using the right strategy. There are also ways you can
create a perfectly hedged position that has minimal risk
from moves in the underlying. Through position adjust-
ments you can maintain a completely neutral market view,
but still proﬁt. The key to these strategies is changing
volatility — a topic addressed throughout this part.

a Market Outlook

 Monitoring the Greeks 
 Adjusting trades
I
keep mentioning that on any given day the market can move three ways —
it’s really to reinforce the fact that no one knows what the market will do in
the next month, week or even day. If knowing exactly what’s next is a trading
goal, you really have to find a way to shift your thinking. Managing your risk is
the first and foremost rule of trading. 
The strategies I’ve covered so far only scratch the surface of option benefits.
It’s a pretty deep scratch since a lot of them significantly decrease risk, but
they’re still on the surface. This chapter introduces a trading approach
unique to options — profiting without a directional outlook for the underly-
ing stock. By incorporating delta and gamma analysis into your approach,
you can apply strategies that make money if the market goes up or down.
Part of this analysis includes adjusting trades so you can take some profits
off the table while gearing up for the next move follows. Whichever way that
move is. 
Limiting Directional Risk
How would you like to anticipate a big move, be wrong about the expected
direction of the move and still profit? Rather than direction, the next two
strategies rely on increasing volatility. Anticipating this environment is more
straightforward than anticipating direction because volatility changes often
occur when scheduled reports and other news items are released.

It’s generally easier to anticipate a change in volatility for a stock than a
change in price.
Two basic strategies that allow you to profit under such conditions include:
 A straddle
 A strangle
Both of these position combine a long call and a long put. The strategy works
best when the stock moves enough to have the call or put realize gains that
cover the cost of both options with some profits to spare. 
Capitalizing on a big move
A straddle is a combination position you create by purchasing both a call and
put for the same underlying stock. You use the strategy when you expect a big
move to occur in the stock, but you’re not sure of the direction. You construct
a straddle using:
 A long call and long put
 The same expiration month
 The same strike price
The reason the basic form of this strategy requires a large directional move is
because all of the profits are expected to result from one leg of the position
while the other leg expires close to worthless. The reality is that there are a
few different ways the straddle position can realize profits.
Straddling opportunities
In terms of finding straddle opportunities, there are a few different times you
can anticipate big moves:
 When observing sideways trending consolidation patterns on a price
chart, you’ll find it’s not uncommon for price to break away from the
pattern and make a big move. 
 Prior to scheduled events such as earnings reports and company
announcements get released. 
 Prior to scheduled events such as economic reports. The biggest swings
generally occur when the news is counter to the market’s expectations.
The advantage of a straddle is that it doesn’t matter which way the price
moves, as long as it moves. Using straddles helps you trade with the odds
because rather than betting on one direction, there are two possible direc-
tions for the stock to move. 
240
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

For a straddle to be profitable, the stock doesn’t actually have to move above
or below the position breakevens. There are times when a smaller move is
profitable since the OTM option will probably not decrease as quickly as the
ITM option increases. The IV for both options usually increases as well.
Straddling the markets
The position can be profitable given three different scenarios for the underly-
ing stock:
 When the move results in an increase in the value of the call or the put
by an amount that exceeds the cost of both options
 When a smaller move increases the in-the-money (ITM) option faster
than the out-of-the-money (OTM) option decreases
 When the move allows you to sell one option for a profit, then changes
direction allowing you to sell the other option for a modest gain or loss
You want to purchase a straddle when implied volatility (IV) is relatively low
and expected to increase. Since there are two long options in the position,
you also need to provide enough time for the stock to react without giving up
too much value to time decay.
Since a straddle is comprised of two long options, your maximum risk is the
net debit you paid to enter the position. The stock can move up or down for
you to gain — it just has do so with some magnitude. Since there are two
directions the stock can move and still realize profits, there are two
breakeven points associated with the position. 
For you to profit from a downward move, the stock must go lower than the
strike price minus the net option cost. Below this level your gains are limited,
but high. For you to profit from an upward move, the stock must go higher
than the strike price plus the net option cost. Above this level, your gains are
unlimited.

Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

It’s ideal to purchase a long straddle when implied volatility (IV) is relatively
low and to sell it when IV is relatively high.
Benefiting from a big move
Remember Wall Street worrying equals market volatility.
To show you what I mean, I set up an example trade here. Monitoring an
investment bank stock you like to trade options on (symbol GS), you notice
that it’s pretty quiet a few days ahead of a holiday weekend. The stock
recently took a slide recently after some hedge fund headlines, but typically
it performs well. The company’s earnings announcement is due two days
after the Fed meeting. After noting low relative implied volatility (IV) levels,
you decide to take a look at a straddle anticipating increased volatility as the
news comes out in the very near future. 
Figure 14-2 displays a daily bar chart of GS with volume, Bollinger bands and
two horizontal lines. The lines denote an upper area of resistance and a lower
extreme level reached a couple of weeks earlier.
The dotted lines represent potential moves for the stock.

Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Time decay accelerates in the last 30 to 45 days for a long option. This means
a straddle is impacted twice as much since the position includes two long
options. When purchasing a straddle, be sure to leave enough time for the
event to occur and still be outside of the window for accelerated time decay.
Figure 14-3 displays the six-month implied volatility chart for ATM options.
The two news events you expect to cause volatility will both pass about 30
days prior to October expiration. Since the stock closed at $178 you check
the Oct 180 strike price calls and puts obtaining the following:
Oct 180 Call Bid: $9.20 by Ask: $9.50
Oct 180 Put Bid: $10.50 by Ask: $10.80
The quotes reflect IV levels of approximately 37%. You enter a trade by plac-
ing a limit order to buy the straddle at a discount as follows:
Buy to Open 2 GS Oct 180 calls and simultaneously 
Buy to Open 2 GS Oct 180 puts, for a net debit of $20.10.
Volatility in the market and individual stocks tends to be cyclical. 
Your risk for the position is the initial debit (sum of the two long options
times the multiplier and the number of contracts).
[(Price of Put + Price of Call) × multiplier × # of contracts] = Max Risk
[($9.40 + 10.70) × 100 × 2] = $20.10 × 100 × 2 = $4,020
Your potential reward for the position is limited, but high to the downside
(long puts) and unlimited to the upside (long calls).

Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

There are two breakeven levels for this position, one to the downside and
one to the upside. The downside breakeven is equal to the straddle strike
price minus the sum of the call and put option prices. The upside breakeven
is equal to the straddle strike price plus the sum of the call and put option
prices.
Downside Breakeven: Strike Price – (Price of Put + Price of Call)
$180 – ($9.40 + 10.70) = $180 – 20.10 = $159.90
Upside Breakeven: Strike Price + (Price of Put + Price of Call)
$180 + ($9.40 + 10.70) = $180 + 20.10 = $200.10
The Fed meeting (Tuesday) and earnings report (Thursday) occur the week
of September option expiration. You plan on exiting half the in-the-money
(ITM) leg if price makes a move that is 80% to the target region. On the day
earnings are released, you plan on closing out the remaining options. This is
one full month before expiration.
If you purchase an even number of contracts for straddle positions, you have
an opportunity to do some profit-taking while allowing greater gains for the
portion of the trade left in place.
Reviewing the straddle risk profile
Your risk with a long straddle is limited to the initial debit paid since the posi-
tion combines a long call and a long put. A strong move up or down in the
underlying will result profits. 
Figure 14-4 displays the straddle risk graph with an adjoining price chart. 
Figure 14-4:

Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

This risk graph includes three curved lines which estimate the position value
given various days to expiration. The curved line closest to the straight lines
(expiration) use 18 days to expiration — note how large the gap is between
this curve and the value at expiration. This is the time decay factor.
Using the target areas identified in the daily bar chart for GS, you plan on
exiting half of the ITM leg will be exited if the stock moves up to 198.50 (80%)
or down to 161.50 (80%). On the day of the Fed meeting, the stock closed at
200.50 and one call was exited at a price of $22.80 (IV = 40%). Two days later
when earnings are released the remaining call and two puts were sold for
$30.10 and $0.70, respectively. The net gain for the position follows:
[($22.80 + 30.10 + 0.70 + 0.70) × 100] – 4,020 = $5,430 – 4,020 = $1,410
Reducing straddle risk & reward
A strangle is very similar to a straddle, but reduces the risk and generally the
reward for the position. You accomplish this by purchasing a call and a put
with different strike prices that are out-of-the-money (OTM) and expire the
same month. 
Since OTM options are less expensive, the initial debit is smaller and you
have less money at risk. Reducing your risk usually means giving up some-
thing and that something is usually gains. The move generally needs to be
larger for a strangle since both options begin OTM.
A strangle requires a bigger move than a straddle since there is a spread
between the strike prices.
Defining a strangle
A strangle is created by purchasing a call and a put:
 For the same underlying stock
 Using the same expiration month and 
 Different strike prices that are both usually OTM
The ideal scenario is for a move in the underlying to be sufficient to sell one
leg of the strangle while covering the costs (and then some) for both legs.
When this happens, it’s not uncommon for the remaining OTM option to
expire worthless or with little value. It just depends on conditions.
A strangle is a straddle that reduces potential risk by reducing the cost of the
position. 
245
Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

Using the straddle set-up, you decide you want to risk less on the position by
placing a strangle instead of a straddle. You still believe the move can be
large enough to yield profits. With the stock closing at $178 you check the
Oct 185 strike price call and the 170 strike price put obtaining the following:
Oct 185 Call Bid: $6.90 by Ask: $7.20 (IV = 36)
Oct 170 Put Bid: $6.50 by Ask: $6.70 (IV = 40)
You enter the trade by placing a limit order to buy the strangle at a discount
as follows: 
Buy to Open 2 GS Oct 185 calls and simultaneously 
Buy to Open 2 GS Oct 170 puts, for a net debit of $13.90.
The short strangle is an extremely risky position since it combines a limited
but high risk if the stock moves down (short put) and an unlimited risk if the
stock moves up (short call).
Your risk for the position is the initial debit (sum of the two long options
times the multiplier and the number of contracts).
[(Price of Put + Price of Call) × multiplier × # of contracts] = Max Risk
[($7.20 + 6.70) × 100 × 2] = $13.90 × 100 × 2 = $2,780
Your potential reward for the position is limited but high to the downside
(long puts) and unlimited to the upside (long calls).
There are two breakeven levels for this position. The downside breakeven is
equal to the put strike price minus the sum of the call and put option prices.
The upside breakeven is equal to the call strike price plus the sum of the call
and put option prices.
Downside Breakeven: Put Strike Price – (Price of Put + Price of Call)
$170 – ($7.20 + 6.70) = $170 – 13.90 = $156.10
Upside Breakeven: Call Strike Price + (Price of Put + Price of Call)
$185 + ($7.20 + 6.70) = $185 + 13.90 = $198.90
The exit for the GS strangle is similar to that of the strangle, which includes
an exit of all option positions by the close on earnings day.
The term leg is used to describe the different securities in a combined position.
246
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Reviewing the strangle risk profile
By separating the strike prices and using two OTM options, there is a range
of prices in which both options expire worthless, resulting in the maximum
loss. Rather than a v-shaped bottom, the strangle risk graph has a flat loss
region which moves upward towards profits similar to a straddle.
Figure 14-5 displays the risk graph for the GS 185c-170p strangle with an
adjoining price chart.
Exiting the position on the same day as the straddle yields the following:
[($18.80 + 25.5 + 0.30+ 0.30) × 100] – 2,780 = $4,490 – 2,780 = $1,710
Always have an exit strategy before you exit a position. Including specific
price levels where you exit for a loss and exit for a profit is a great risk man-
agement tool to use whenever possible.
Neutral View versus Neutral Position
The term neutral can have two meanings in the market and it’s important to
clarify them here. You may hear of an analyst having a neutral view on a
stock, suggesting it is neither a buy nor sell and that it will likely move with
the market. The other use refers to a neutral strategy which is one that can
benefit from a move upward or downward — there is no directional bias. 
Options help you implement neutral strategies. Straddles and strangles are
examples of such strategies, but there’s more to these positions than meets
the eye. Optimizing a neutral trade means looking once again at delta.

Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

Hedging a position means you invest in securities that go up in value when
the original security goes down.
Defining a neutral approach
A neutral approach is a combination of stock and options or just options that
limit directional bias. As a result, trading with a neutral approach allows you
to realize gains whether the market goes up or down. When market moves
are accompanied by increased volatility, neutral strategies can really benefit.
You successfully implement long delta neutral strategies by focusing on delta
and gamma during low implied volatility (IV) periods. Using these measures
allows market conditions to dictate the positions you establish rather than
trying to force a particular strategy or view on the market. 
It’s important to note delta neutral trading isn’t the “holy grail” for option
approaches. You still need to consider the position’s risk profile to see if the
trade has a reasonable reward:risk ratio and is one that fits your risk. Stocks
that are trading sideways can continue to do so for extended periods so there
are no guarantees that the position will yield profits.
Delta neutral trading does not guarantee profits — you still must evaluate
potential risks and rewards for a position and identify reasonable positions
sizes and exits to minimize losses. 
Identifying neutral positions
Neutral approaches were introduced with hedged positions in Chapter 10.
Using puts for the underlying stock, you protect a position since a move down
in the stock price results in a move up in the put’s price. When this movement
is one to one — the put goes up $1 for every $1 decline in the stock — the
stock is perfectly hedged. This occurs when the put is deep ITM and has a delta
of -1.0. The combined position behaves neutrally to price changes.
The relationship between stock and put movement can vary depending on the
put(s) used for the strategy. When the movement between the two is less than
one to one the position is referred to as a partial hedge. This occurs when the
cumulative delta for the put position is less than -1.0 in absolute terms.
A problem you encounter when using options to hedge a stock, is that delta
changes as the price of the underlying changes. So what may initially be a per-
fect hedge can turn into a partial hedge. The expected change in delta is mea-
sured using gamma and varies depending on the moneyness of the option.
248
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

The stock-put position is not the only one available to you for hedging pur-
poses. By combining other stock and options or just options, you can achieve
perfectly and partially hedged positions that are neutral.
Delta neutral trading is more geared towards longer time frames (on the
higher end of 30 to 90 days). This gives the position time to yield profits. 
Calculating delta for combination positions
Stock has a +1 delta per share while option deltas vary. You calculate the
position delta by adding the deltas for all of the individual legs.
Suppose you held a protective put position with two puts and 100 shares of
long stock. If each put has a delta of –45 (net –90), you calculate the delta for
the combined position as follows:
(Shares of Stock × Stock Delta) + (Contracts × Option Delta)
Together, the puts move up $0.90 for every $1 decline in the stock. This is a
partial hedge with a minor loss in the position when the stock goes down.
Your position gains modestly when the stock goes up. As a result, it is has a
slight directional bias to the upside. 
Delta values can be used to identify the directional bias for a position.
Combined delta values that are less than 0 have a downward directional bias
while those with deltas greater than 0 have an upward bias. The bias indicates
the direction for the underlying to move for the position to realize gains.
Trading with Delta
Delta is the Greek value that tells you the expected change in an option for
every dollar change in the underlying stock. You can access delta values
using an options calculator based on one of a variety of different option pric-
ing models. This is important from the standpoint of understanding that each
pricing model has assumptions you need to keep in mind.
You can gain an intuitive sense about delta values by considering an at-the-
money (ATM) call option. Suppose ABC is trading at $50. It’s expected that a
50 strike price call option will have a delta of 50, so if ABC goes to $51 the call
option will increase by $0.50. Why 50? One model assumption is that a stock
has a 50% chance of going up and a 50% chance of going down. So the call
option has a 50% chancing of being ITM.
249
Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

A problem arises once the stock actually moves up and the option price
changes. Using an options calculator again you’ll find delta has gone up.
Trading neutrally with this moving target presents a challenge. Fortunately,
the change in delta is not some random amount. By looking at an option’s
gamma you’ll have some idea of the expected move in delta. 
Gamma is like the delta for delta. It represents the expected change in delta
for each $1 change in the price of the underlying stock.
Monitoring two key Greeks
Trading neutral strategies means monitoring the position delta and gamma,
along with the stock and option price movement. And in case I haven’t men-
tioned it in awhile — managing your risk. Delta and gamma values are acces-
sible via an options calculator. Their impact on option prices is also covered
in Chapter 3. Options analysis software may also provide you with a graphi-
cal view of both of these values. 
Understanding changes in delta
Delta is primarily effected by the option strike price relative to the price of
the underlying, but there are other factors as well. Both volatility and the
time remaining until expiration impact delta values.
 As volatility increases, all option deltas move towards 0.50 (+0.50 for
calls and –0.50 for puts).
 As time to expiration decreases, all options deltas move towards 0
These are trends often describing general shifts for delta. A 10% increase in
volatility does not cause a call option with a +0.80 delta to jump to a +0.50.
Assessing gamma changes on delta
Understanding changes in delta also means understanding the option greek
gamma. Gamma is greatest for ATM options, then decreases once the option
becomes more ITM or OTM. As a result, you’ll find the biggest moves in delta
occur for your ATM options. 
Gamma is greatest for ATM options so delta changes the most when holding
an ATM option.
Like delta, gamma is a moving target, but on a smaller scale. Some general
characteristics you should note about gamma is the following:
 Gamma is always positive
 Gamma is highest for ATM options
 Gamma increases as you approach expiration
250
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Since gamma is always positive, when the price of a stock goes up $1 a call
delta increases by gamma. The put delta also increases, but this translates
to a reduction in the magnitude of the put’s delta since a put delta is
negative.
Creating a delta neutral straddle
Creating a straddle allows you to realize gains whether a stock moves
strongly up or down. Sometimes it’s not even necessary for the move to
be that big — the stock just has to keep moving. You establish a straddle
position by purchasing a long call and a long put, with the same expiration
month and strike price. That strike is either at or near the money, so
paying attention to gamma and delta when initiating a neutral position
is important. 
The changing nature of both option pricing factors also make it necessary to
monitor delta and gamma throughout the position’s life. A once neutral posi-
tion can become directionally biased within one day’s trading. In terms of a
straddle that’s not terrible news since 1/2 the position will then be profitable.
Returning to delta neutrality may mean adding to the position or taking prof-
its off the table.
When purchasing at or near the money straddles, you are predominantly pur-
chasing time value. You must manage your risk by minimizing the effect of
accelerating time decay on such a position by closing it at least 30 days prior
to expiration.
Checking delta status
Gong back to the GS straddle example earlier in this chapter, the initial
position delta is obtained using the options calculator from Optionetics
Platinum:
GS Oct 180 call trading at $9.40: (Call delta = +51.191)
GS Oct 180 put trading at $10.70: (Put delta = –48.688)
Position Delta: [(2 × +51.191) + (2 × -48.688)] = +102.382 – 97.376 = +5.006
The position was similar to one that was long five shares of stock.
What about a few days into the position — is there directional bias? It actu-
ally didn’t take long at all for bias to be introduced. The next trading day GS
dropped seven points, decreasing the magnitude of the call deltas and
increasing the magnitude of the put deltas. Within a week, the bias was posi-
tive once again.
251
Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

An increase in the volatility of the underlying causes all option deltas to move
towards 50. This increased volatility increases uncertainty as well as the potential
for a deeper ITM option to expire OTM. Delta decreases towards 50. However,
this increased uncertainty also increases the chance an OTM option will expire
ITM, increasing delta towards 50.

position delta on different days over the 24 calendar day life of the straddle.

Maintaining a delta neutral position
The method of using primary support and resistance areas is reasonable for
identifying price targets, but there are no guarantees price will reach either.
That could be a problem with a straddle. Applying this technical analysis tool
primarily for risk (and profit-taking) is good for identifying extreme points. 
Stock deltas are considered fixed — 1 long share of stock always represents
+1 stock. Option deltas on the other hand are variable covering a range of
values determined primarily by the option’s moneyness.
With the benefit of hindsight, wouldn’t it have been nice to return the straddle
towards delta neutrality by going long another call on T+1 (position delta from
–35.810 to 4.952)? What if two calls were exited on T+16 when the position only
had about one week remaining (position delta from +136.81 to 2.453)?
So to what extent do you need hindsight to act on T+1 and T+16? When
preparing this, I just picked random trading days along the way and looked
at the easiest way to return the position to delta neutrality. Timing issues
252
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

certainly come into play when thinking about adding to or reducing a position,
but hopefully this quick example provides incentive to incorporate delta
neutral trading into your overall approach to the markets.
Reviewing changes to the risk profile
Are you wondering how adding a call to the position impacted the risk profile
of the trade? First, the dollars at risk is the total debit for the position, which
now includes an additional call. Assuming the call was purchased at $7.00,
the net position risk was $4,720. The directional bias with this addition was
reduced most of the days tracked. 
When adding to or reducing a position, it helps to review the current risk
graph to most easily see the impact the change has on the strategy.
The original call was exited on T+22 at the more favorable price of $22.80. As
a result, both approaches to the trade yielded a gain of $1,410, but the delta
neutral approach relies less on potentially subjective price targets and had
less directional risk.
Figure 14-6 provides an updated risk graph for the adjusted straddle position
on the T+1 date. In this case, the risk area decreased slightly because the
straddle acted as it was supposed to — increased volatility resulted in the
put value increasing at a faster rate than the call decreased. When the third
call was purchased there were already profits in the position, reducing the
impact of the additional debit. 
The stock prices that occur between strangle strike prices identifies the
range for maximum risk. At these prices, both options expire worthless.
The “risk area” refers to the distance between the two trade breakevens. In
the straight straddle the breakevens were 159.90 and 200.10 (40.20) while the
adjusted straddle breakevens were 156.40 and 195.73 (39.33).

Chapter 14: Profiting Without a Market Outlook 

Understanding Trade Adjustments
Adjusting a trade is something you do to maintain delta neutrality — not
something to avoid taking losses when a position has gone against you. In the
GS straddle example I added to a leg that had declined in value, but the posi-
tion as a whole increased in value. The straddle was basically working as it
should with the ITM leg increasing at a faster rate than the OTM leg was
decreasing. An increase in volatility also helped.
“Adjusting” is not synonymous to “avoiding”. If a position has gone against
you and is not acting properly, you should exit it and take your losses.
The purpose of adjusting trade is to keep the positional bias to a minimum.
You accomplish this by maintaining delta neutrality, but not at all costs. At
some point you may need to simply exit the position. Factors that impact
your decisions include:
 Time to expiration and whether the adjustment buys or sells time value
 Relative implied volatility (IV) levels
 Trading costs
A quick comment on the last item — straddle positions can be hedged with
stock which may be a more cost effective approach at for some adjustments.
Deciding when to adjust a trade
Focusing on a straddle position, trade adjustments should be made once the
position becomes overly reliant on the stock moving in one direction. That’s
when one leg really begins losing value. If you’ve purchased the straddle in a
high IV environment and IV declines, then the ITM leg is not gaining at a
faster rate than the OTM leg and it’s probably time to cut your losses. 
Different aspects of trading are referred to as “art not science”. While you can
specifically identify some trading rules and mechanical steps, others parts of
trading require experienced assessment of conditions and a best guess of
how to proceed.
So far my answer about “when” has been kind of fuzzy. Unfortunately it’s the
nature of the beast and looking back at a position you may find a more opti-
mal adjustment time or method. The following should help you more suc-
cessfully implement delta neutral strategies:
254
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

 Experience with the specific strategy, in this case straddles
 Understanding the cyclic nature of IV for a specific stock
 Analyzing how a stock behaves after different events
Some traders make adjustments every trading day to start out as close to
delta neutral as possible. Others may use specific delta values above or
below zero to trigger adjustments. It just depends on style. 
It’s reasonable to consider a set time schedule for adjustments or to base
adjustments around different event dates. Just be sure you understand the
implications of the position delta you hold and how it may deviate from a
delta neutral approach.
Making money in the markets can be done in a variety of ways. It’s bets to
find approaches that suit your temperament, time, and style.
Deciding how to adjust a trade
Straddles can be adjusted in the following ways:
 Purchasing more calls (+delta) or puts (–delta)
 Selling calls (–delta) or puts (+delta)
 Buying stock (+delta)
 Selling stock (–delta)
Deciding which approach is best depends on your cost of trading (commis-
sion and slippage) and how many contracts you use to create positions. Even
though you hold rights with the two option types, you may decide shorting
stock is not a way you want to reduce delta. This means the fourth alterna-
tive is only possible if you hold a position that is long stock.
Another factor for you to consider is how much time remains to expiration.
You may be at a point when it’s best for you to do some profit-taking by clos-
ing out one or more positions if the 30-day to expiration mark is coming. 
If there is plenty of time to expiration and IV is relatively low, you can pur-
chase more of the original strike price options or improve delta neutrality by

lthough stock prices exhibit some cyclical properties, the cyclic nature
of volatility is much more reliable for certain stocks. Even the market 
as a whole can display such tendencies as seen by the VIX (see Chapter 5).
Using relative volatility levels for strategy selection can help put the odds in
your favor by capitalizing when volatility changes. 
Ratio spreads and backspreads are strategies that also benefit from volatility
changes. Incorporating delta neutral concepts can then help improve 
strategy success. As your experience builds, you’ll develop more skill imple-
menting approaches that are well-suited to existing market conditions.
Analyzing Implied Volatility Levels 
Implied volatility (IV) is impacted by some of the following factors:
 Past price movement (historical volatility)
 Time until expiration
 Expected future movement given scheduled events before expiration
 Demand factors for the specific option
IV determines the time value for an option. The greater the value of the listed
factors, the greater the option’s extrinsic value. Because they all vary, it’s
really important to buy and sell options under proper IV conditions.

It’s all relative
There are two types of volatility for you to consider when analyzing an
options trade:
 Historical volatility for the underlying security
 Implied volatility for the option
Because you’re paying for implied volatility (IV), focusing on this measure 
is pretty critical. But that doesn’t mean you can ignore historical volatility
(HV) — far from it. HV allows you to take the first step in determining
whether IV is reasonable. So when gauging an option’s IV level, you need to
look at both types of volatility. 
An option’s intrinsic value is its “moneyness” factor. For a call option, intrin-
sic value is the stock price above the call strike price and for a put option, it
is the stock price below the put strike price. Intrinsic value is set to zero for
any options that are out of the money. 
Evaluating past movement
Historical volatility (HV) provides you with information about past stock
movement.HV can be calculated using any number of trading days, but the
measure itself gives you information about annual movement. The data is
extrapolated which means what happens during the shorter term is extended
to a one-year period using statistical techniques.
HV periods include 6-day, 10-day, 20-day, and 100-day. The movement that
occurs during these periods varies depending on what’s happening in the
markets and for the security. An annualized measure that is created using 10
trading days can suggest much more volatility than one using 100 trading
days. But, that really depends on events taking place over the last 10 and 100
trading days. If it’s summertime and Wall Street was vacationing in the
Hamptons, the ten-day measure may understate volatility.
The best way for you to get a good feel for past volatility in a stock is by 
viewing HV charts. This quickly provides you with a visual on HV conditions.
Extrinsic value is the time value component of an option price. It’s what is
leftover after intrinsic value is determined.
Figure 15-1 displays a 12 month HV chart for Akamai Technologies Inc
(AKAM), a computer services company. The chart includes 6-day, 10-day, 
20-day, and 100-day HV measures and is courtesy of Optionetics Platinum. 
One year typically consists of 252 trading days.
258
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

You can see that the six-day measure (69.90%) reflects increased volatility
during the last few days. The 10-day (53.99%) and 20-day (52.32%) measures
include this recent volatility, along with quieter trading days which bring
down their respective values. 
It appears these “quieter” periods may be less typical for the stock, given a
100-day HV at 61.90%. This 100-day measure is telling you that if the stock
moves similar to the last 100 trading days in the next 252 trading days, its
volatility for that period will be 61.90%. 
Note the different spikes in volatility which has recently reached one-year
highs. Expect options for this stock to have implied volatility levels that
incorporate these HV spikes in its value. 
What may be typical historical volatility (HV) levels for one security may be
high for another. Viewing a stock’s HV chart gives you the quickest feel for
recent volatility for a stock and more importantly, how this movement relates
to what’s happened in the past.
Viewing implied volatility
Implied volatility (IV) levels change over time, similar to historical volatility
(HV) levels. When using an options calculator to determine the current IV for
a particular option, you’ll want to take the next step of viewing an IV chart
that displays at-the-money (ATM) IV values to determine if conditions do the
following:
 Reflect reasonable levels given past IV values
 Are relatively low making the option cheap
 Are relatively high making the option expensive
A cheap option in terms of relative implied volatility (IV) levels can remain
cheap through the life of the option. Try to dig deeper into this measure to
determine what’s driving relative IV levels.

Before viewing the 12-month ATM IV for AKAM, look at the price chart to gain
insight on what was happening to the stock during the most recent 12
months. Figure 15-2 displays the price chart for AKAM. Generally price charts
are also available with volatility charts when accessing an options analysis
package. This chart is courtesy of Optionetics Platinum. 
Option type refers to call or put.
Looking at the chart, you can see AKAM experienced two significant drops
right before and after March 2007 — that’s approximately 10% in a few days,
which is pretty significant to me. After asking and answering, “Why did this
happen?” don’t forget to double-check news stories for that time period.
This first gap coincided with a market decline that occurred in late February
on concerns a stock market bubble was bursting in China. Price recovered a
bit, and then gapped down in late July, possibly in sympathy with a declining
US market dealing with sub-prime mortgage problems. 
When an at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility (IV) figure reflects a range 
of days, the value is a composite of call and put IV values expiring in that
time period.
Was AKAM just a victim of a turbulent market or was something else going
on? Checking headlines for AKAM the following was noted:
 In late February AKAM hosted a conference call and raised 2007 earnings
expectations. No other significant news was found during the search, so
it appears AKAM fell with the market.
 In mid-March news of significant insider selling during a six-month period
made the headlines — this could potentially have amplified AKAM’s
losses as other technology stocks were also dropping. 
 In late July AKAM had an earnings report that disappointed investors and
analysts even though they were in line with expectations.

An option position that is delta neutral when created will become direction-
ally biased as the price of the underlying changes and/or implied volatility
levels change.
Figure 15-3 displays the 12-month ATM IV chart for AKAM. The chart includes
composite IVs for both option types with expirations in 7 to 30 days, 30 to 60
days, and greater than 90 days, courtesy of Optionetics Platinum. 
Spikes in the IV correspond pretty well with spikes in HV for AKAM, with 
HV spikes appearing slightly more extreme. If you compare the two y-axis
volatility scales, you can see that the range for HV is greater. 
Historical volatility is one component that impacts implied volatility values.
Suppose you were considering a long option expiring in 30 to 60 days with an
IV of 57.9%, you note the following from the two volatility charts:
 The current composite IV value for options expiring in 30 to 60 days is
57.7%, so the option you’re analyzing is very slightly above the average.
 Recent HV for the stock was approximately 54.0% (10-day) and 52.3%
(20-day), so the IV in your option is above short-term movement.
 Longer term HV for the stock 53.8%, so the IV in your option is about 8%
greater than longer term movement.
 The current IV levels for options expiring in 30 to 60 just recently spiked
to 60%, up from 40% 21⁄2 weeks ago.
 Although there have been times when IV remained at high levels, it
seems IV returned towards longer term IV (>90 day) values more often.
A current relatively low implied volatility value can remain low.

Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

After comparing current IV levels to past levels, as well as the current and
past HV levels, does this appear to be an optimal time to purchase the
option? Although you can’t predict IV, its cyclic nature seems to favor selling
the option rather than buying it. Because this may not be consistent with
your directional outlook for the stock, you can consider the following:
 Monitoring the stock and option to see what happens to price and IV
during the next few days
 Evaluating combination positions that are consistent with your outlook
while allowing you to be a net seller of elevated IV
 Buying the option and hoping that when you wake up tomorrow IV has
increased again or the stock has moved your way
Of course that last approach is not really one associated with disciplined
trading. That said, it’s something we’ve all experienced once or twice along
the way in our careers. Anytime the word “hope” gets strongly associated
with a position, alarm signals should go off in your head that it’s a trade you
need to avoid (or seriously consider exiting). 
The margin requirement is the amount needed to establish a position while
maintenance requirements are those needed to hold the position in the
account.
Recognizing potential changes to volatility
When viewing IV charts you may notice seasonal tendencies. The most
common reason for such periodic changes to volatility levels is the release 
of a quarterly earnings report. 
Figure 15-4 displays a two-year IV chart for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO). It 
provides a great example of seasonal tendencies for volatility.
Short options that are either naked or covered by another option generally
have margin and maintenance requirements.
Figure 15-4:
Two-year
implied
volatility
chart for
CSCO.
262
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

A two-year chart was provided to show how consistent the increase in IV has
been for CSCO, particularly for the shorter term options. The eight spikes 
on the chart coincide with earnings announcements for the company. This
seasonality has persisted for years.
You may find you trade certain stocks and options, more frequently than
others. By becoming familiar with IV charts and potential seasonality in this
pricing component, you can better tailor strategies that meet current market
conditions for the underlying and also anticipate future conditions. Although
there are no guarantees IV will continue to exhibit a specific seasonal pattern,
such an approach is consistent with putting the odds in your favor. If nothing
else, you want to be aware that these conditions exist.
An implied volatility (IV) smile is the term used to describe the typical IV 
pattern for equity and index options, with IV levels lowest for the at-the-
money (ATM) strike price options and increasing moderately as you move
away from this central area.
When options are skewed
The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model is the Nobel Prize-winning model 
created to price European Style options and serves as the basis for many
other pricing models that followed. A significant model assumption is that
implied volatility (IV) is constant across strike prices and expiration months.
The reality is IV can vary across both, sometimes significantly. It’s important
to understand this so you can select the strategies and options that are the
best given current conditions.
Skew is the term used to describe option IV levels that vary from normal 
conditions. The two types of skews include the following:
 Price Skew: Condition where certain options have atypically high IV
compared to others expiring in the same month. The skew will often
follow a pattern. 
 Time Skew: Condition where options expiring in later months have 
atypically high IV compared to those expiring earlier. 
Skews can exist when demand for specific contracts increase price. Calendar
and diagonal spreads are optimal when the right time skew exists (see
Chapter 12). Here strategies that have the most success when a price skew
exists are discussed. There are two types of price skews:
 Forward Price Skew: Condition where higher strike price options of the
same type have higher IV compared to those expiring in the same month.
 Reverse Price Skew: Condition where lower strike price options of the
same type have higher IV compared to those expiring in the same month. 
263
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

When trading option spreads, skews help increase the odds of profitability
when you sell the relatively high IV options and buy the normal or relatively
low IV options. 
A forward price volatility skew exists when higher strike options have greater
implied volatility than lower strike options.
Identifying volatility skews
A skew chart is a visual display of option IV versus strike price for each type
of option by month. Figure 15-5 displays typical IV conditions with at-the-
money (ATM) options having the lowest IV, increasing moderately as you
move away from this strike price. Note the smile that results when a curved
line is drawn through the data points.
A reverse price volatility skew exists when lower strike options have greater
implied volatility than higher strike options.
Figure 15-6 displays a forward price skew and a reverse price skew. These
skews can remain in place for extended periods of time and do not necessar-
ily revert to the typical skew pattern. However, changing conditions can
improve profits when using strategies that sell relatively high IV options and
buy relatively low options.
Options analysis applications can save you a great deal of time searching for
optimal market conditions for a specific strategy.
In addition to viewing a skew chart, you can locate volatility skews by using
an options analysis application that scans the market for them. Figure 15-7
displays an output table for a basic IV scan seeking price skews. Positive
values in the skew results reflects a price skew for the option pair listed.
Figure 15-5:

Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Taking advantage of skews
Trading opportunities emerge when a large IV skew exists, allowing you to
create combination positions for a smaller debit or a larger credit than when
normal conditions are in place. Skews can persist for the life of the option 
in any expiration month, so there are no guarantees IV levels will return 
to normal. 
The ideal IV skew scenario is when the atypical IV results from temporary
contract demand — the demand may simply reflect institutional hedging for a
large stock position. In this instance the skew is likely temporary, allowing
you to capitalize as conditions return to normal.
Make sure you match your strategies to existing market conditions.

Understanding Ratio Spreads
Ratio spreads are similar to vertical spreads, but with an uneven number 
of long and short contracts. They are generally created for a net credit by
selling more contracts than you buy. Unlike limited risk vertical spreads, the
extra short contract(s) in a ratio spread creates risk that is either unlimited
(call ratio spread) or limited, but high (put ratio spread). Given the high to
unlimited risk for a ratio spread, you must know and execute your exit point
for a loss prior to establishing a ratio spread. Trade management is key to
risk management. 
As part of the risk-reward trade-off, the maximum gain possible when creat-
ing a call ratio spread can actually exceed the initial credit you receive when
establishing the position. Ratio backspreads, which are covered in the next
section, arelimited risk alternative to ratio spreads.
Ratio spreads have an uneven amount of short and long options of the same
type, with the number of short options exceeding the number of long
options. As a result, the position incorporates naked options and has either
unlimited risk (call ratio spreads) or limited but high risk (put ratio spread).
Reviewing ratio spread risk profiles
As you might expect by now, there are two types of ratio spreads you can
create — one for each option type. So ratio spreads include
 Call ratio spreads
 Put ratio spreads
A review of these spreads follows, along with risk profiles and basic guide-
lines to consider when employing them. Always remember a ratio spread has
limited reward with risk that is either high or unlimited.
Risk graphs provide a great, quick view of your potential risk and rewards
with a strategy.
A call ratio spread has the following characteristics:
 Includes a long option plus a greater number of short options expiring
the same month, with the short options having a higher strike price.
 Is used when your market outlook is bearish or moderately bullish for
the underlying.
 Should be implemented for an initial credit.
 Generally uses a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio for long to short call options.
266
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

 Is best when a forward price skew exists for implied volatility (IV)
because the higher strike price options are being sold.
 Is an unlimited risk position with high margins required due to one or
more uncovered short calls.
The net credit for the position is the credit received from selling the short,
higher strike calls minus the debit required to purchase the long, lower strike
call. Although IV may be high for the short options when the position is initi-
ated, maximum profits are achieved when the stock moves to the short
option strike price at expiration. 
Suppose XYZ is trading at $115.70 and you were evaluating this call ratio
spread which expires in approximately 43 days:
 Buy 1 XYZ 110.00 Call @ $7.70 and simultaneously
 Sell 2 XYZ 115.00 Calls @ $4.20 each
Delta values may be measured on a scale from -100 to +100 or -10 or +1.0,
both of which are acceptable.
Because a call ratio spread includes an unprotected short call, it’s critical for
you to identify and execute an exit criteria before you establish the position
to minimize your risk if the stock moves upward.
The combined position brings in a credit of $70 and has a bearish directional
bias (delta of –—38). It has unlimited risk, but limited reward. Calculating the
potential reward is accomplished by breaking the position into a vertical
debit spread (110-115) plus one short call (115) as follows:
Spread: [(115 – 100) – (7.70 – 4.20)] × 100 = $150
Short Call: (4.20 – 100) = $420
Call Ratio Spread: $150 + 420 = $570
See Chapter 11 for details on calculating vertical spread risks, rewards and
breakeven levels. Losses accumulate after XYZ moves above the upside
breakeven which you calculate as follows:
Breakeven: Higher call strike + [(Difference in strikes × # of short calls) ÷
(# of short calls – # of long calls)] – net option prices*
Breakeven: 115.00 + (5 × 2) ÷ (2 – 1) + 0.70 = 115.00 + 5.00 + 0.70 = 120.70
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
The worst-case scenario for the position is when XYZ moves upward above
$120.70. Although your losses are capped for one of the short calls, they 
will accumulate as prices rise due to the remaining naked short call in the
position.
267
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

The best-case scenario for the position is when XYZ closes at $115 on expira-
tion, allowing you to keep the credit for the short calls while maximizing the
value of the long call. 
An option’s intrinsic value is the value associated with the option’s money-
ness while the extrinsic value is the portion associated with time.
Figure 15-8 displays the risk graph for the XYZ call ratio spread.
Implementing this call ratio spread strategy provides you with a reasonably
sized price range for profits given the time until expiration. The fact that prof-
its can increase beyond the initial credit is also nice. Regardless, the thing
that should really catch your attention is that downward sloping arrow 
displaying unlimited losses as prices rise.
Always contact your broker to obtain their specific margin and maintenance
requirements for option combination positions.
A put ratio spread has the following characteristics:
 Includes a long option plus a greater number of short options expiring
the same month, with the short options having a lower strike price.
 Is used when your market outlook is bullish or moderately bearish for
the underlying.
 Should be implemented for an initial credit.
 Generally uses a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio for long to short put options.
 Is best when a reverse price skew exists for implied volatility (IV)
because the lower strike price options are being sold.
 Is a limited, high-risk position with high margins required due to one or
more uncovered short puts.
Figure 15-8:
Risk graph
for 110–115
call ratio
spread.
268
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

The net credit for the position is the credit received from selling the short,
lower strike puts minus the debit required to purchase the long, lower strike
put. Although IV may be high for the short options when the position is initi-
ated, maximum profits are achieved when the stock moves to the short
option strike price at expiration.
Because a put ratio spread includes an unprotected put option, it’s critical
for you to identify and execute an exit criteria before you establish the 
position to minimize your risk if the stock moves downward.
Always ask yourself, “What if I’m wrong on my outlook”? Know your risk.
Calculations for risk, reward, and breakevens for this position are similar to
the call ratio spread, with some minor adjustments. A put ratio spread is a
limited, but high risk as displayed by the risk graph in Figure 15-9.
Ratio spreads generally rely on moderate movement once established.
The reward for the put ratio spread reaches the maximum when the stock
trades at the lower strike price heading into expiration. Even though the
stock can trade anywhere above the lower strike price to realize profits, the
fact remains that a significant risk is taken for limited reward potential.
Identifying best conditions for ratio spreads
Because you are selling implied volatility (IV) on a net basis when using a
ratio spread, optimal market conditions for either strategy is when IV is 
relatively high for the options being sold. This means the following:
 Capitalizing on a forward price skew when creating a call ratio spread
 Capitalizing on a reverse price skew when creating a put ratio spread
Figure 15-9

269
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

Elevated IV often accompanies elevated price volatility. However, both types
of ratio spreads realize maximum reward when the stock settles down and its
movement is limited to the short option strike price. Additional conditions 
to seek for ratio spreads include the following:
 Call ratio spread: When implementing this strategy you should also
have a neutral to moderately bearish outlook on the stock because
these conditions yield profits or limited risk. A strong bullish move for
the underlying is extremely detrimental to the position, with unlimited
losses possible. 
 Put ratio spread: When implementing this strategy you should also 
have a neutral to moderately bullish outlook on the stock because these
conditions yield profits or limited risk. A strong bearish move for the
underlying is extremely detrimental to the position, with limited, but
high losses possible.
When short options have very little time value remaining (say, less than
$0.20), your chance of assignment goes up significantly.
The range of profitability for a ratio spread is dictated by both the long 
and short option strike prices, but generally tends to be narrow when imple-
mented for a credit. As a result, the best conditions to implement a ratio
spread is when there has been recent volatility in price of the underlying and
that volatility is expected to subside.
Deciding your strategy
When deciding on which strategy to use, you need to consider both current
market conditions and your future outlook for those conditions. Two areas 
to consider for option trading include
 Directional bias: bullish, bearish or sideways (neutral)
 Volatility bias: implied volatility and stock volatility
You can identify the current directional and volatility bias with price and
volatility charts. Because volatility displays stronger seasonal tendencies and
is often driven by scheduled reports, you can generally identify a more 
reliable IV outlook for the future than price. 
The bottom line is that you want to use strategies that are consistent with
current market conditions and can benefit if your outlook plays out. With this
in mind, it’s a good time to identify strategies that may be used in place of the
unlimited risk call ratio spread or the limited but high risk put ratio spread.
270
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

When evaluating high or unlimited risk strategies, ask yourself if there are
other strategies that can capitalize on the same market conditions.
Considering other bearish alternatives
A call ratio spread is best employed under forward volatility skew conditions
(higher strike price options have higher IV) when you have a neutral to 
moderately bearish directional outlook for the stock. 
Other strategies discussed that can also profit under such circumstances
include
 Limited risk bearish call credit spread
 Limited risk bearish put debit spread
 Limited, but high risk covered call position
 Limited risk collar position
Although it generally takes more capital to initiate a combination position
that includes stock (covered call or collar), keep in mind that a short option
position has margin requirements that can increase the costs associated with
a trade. Rather than an unlimited risk call ratio spread, it makes sense for you
to consider alternate strategies that can reduce risk.
List the conditions that are optimal for each strategy you use in your trading. 
Looking to gain with other bullish options
A put ratio spread is best employed under reverse volatility skew conditions
(lower strike price options have higher IV) when you have a neutral to 
moderately bullish directional outlook for the stock. 
Other strategies discussed that can also profit under such circumstances
include:
 Limited risk bullish put credit spread
 Limited risk bullish call debit spread
 Limited, but high risk covered put position
Again while it takes more capital to initiate a combination position that
includes stock (covered put), margin requirements for a put ratio spread
must also be considered as part of the overall costs for the trade. Rather
than a limited but high risk put ratio spread, it makes sense to consider other
less risky strategies.
The next section identifies two strategies that take advantage of price skews
when your directional outlook is stronger: ratio backspreads.
271
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can also be used in place of stocks for ratio
spreads and ratio backspreads — just be sure to check implied volatility
characteristics of the specific ETF.
Using Ratio Backspreads 
Ratio backspreads are similar to ratio spreads because there are an 
uneven amount of long and short options of the same type. However this
strategy has limited risk because you buy more option contracts than you
sell. Although I generally avoid ratio spreads, I really like to trade ratio 
backspreads. Ratio backspreads are among my favorite strategies because
the risk is limited while reward is potentially unlimited. Add to this the fact
that you can create these positions for a credit, and then you get a sense of
why I like them so much. 
This section covers two types of ratio backspreads (call and put), along with
risk profiles and optimal conditions for their use.
Ratio backspreads have an uneven number of short and long options, with
the number of long options exceeding the number of short options. As a
result, the position is like a vertical spread plus additional long option(s). 
Defining ratio backspreads
You can create ratio backspreads using calls or puts, for either a debit or a
credit. I prefer the latter because gains can actually go up from there. Here’s
some detail on the two types of backspreads:
A call ratio backspread has the following characteristics:
 Includes a short option plus a greater number of long options expiring
the same month, with the long options having a higher strike price.
 Should be established when a reverse price skew exists for implied
volatility (IV) because the lower strike price options are being sold.
 Is used when your market outlook is strongly bullish.
 Realizes the largest losses when the underlying closes at the long call
strike price at expiration.
 Is most profitable when an explosive upward move occurs (increasing
intrinsic and extrinsic long call value).
 Is best when implemented for an initial credit which allows the position
to yield profits when the underlying declines modestly.
 Is a limited risk position with unlimited reward potential.
272
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Ratio backspreads have risk that is limited while reward is potentially unlim-
ited (call ratio backspread) or limited, but high (put ratio backspread).
A put ratio backspread has the following characteristics:
 Includes a short option plus a greater number of long options expiring
the same month, with the long options having a lower strike price.
 Should be established when a forward price skew exists for implied
volatility (IV) because the higher strike price options are being sold.
 Is used when your market outlook is strongly bearish.
 Realizes the largest losses when the underlying closes at the long put
strike price at expiration.
 Is most profitable when a strong bearish move occurs (increasing 
intrinsic and extrinsic long call value).
 Is best when implemented for an initial credit which allows the position
to yield profits when the underlying rises modestly.
 Realizes the largest losses when the underlying closes at the long put
strike price at expiration.
 Is a limited risk position with limited, but high reward potential.
Both positions can be established for a credit or debit. When paying a debit
to enter the position, try to get as close to $0 as possible. In either case, it’s
best to maintain a short to long ratio multiple of 1:2 or 2:3 for these positions.
The most important thing to keep straight when entering a ratio backspread
is that there are more long option contracts than short option contracts. This
results in a position with short options that are covered.
Profiling call ratio backspread risk
When properly implementing a call ratio backspread you’re taking advantage
of a reverse price skew in volatility to improve trade odds and off-set long
call costs. This is accomplished when you sell a lesser number of high
implied volatility (IV) calls. 
Your losses are greatest with a call ratio backspread when a moderately bull-
ish move occurs and the underlying stock closes at the long call strike price
at expiration. At this level the long calls expire worthless, while the short
calls realize their maximum loss. 
You may have more success finding ratio backspreads for a credit when you
focus on stocks trading between $25 and $75 per share.
The trade does best when an explosive move upward occurs, increasing 
the long call moneyness and IV. Because long calls have unlimited profit
potential, a call ratio backspread also has unlimited profit potential.
273
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

The initial credit for a call ratio backspread is
[(# of Short Calls × Short Call Price) – (# of Long Calls × Long Call Price)]
× 100
The combination may result in a net debit rather than credit.
Your maximum risk occurs when the underlying expires at the long call strike
price and is calculated as follows: 
[(Number of Short Calls × Difference in Strike Prices) × 100] – Initial
Credit (or + Initial Debit)
Your maximum reward is unlimited above the position breakeven level.
There are two breakevens for this position when it is established for a credit.
The upside breakeven is calculated as follows:
Higher Strike Price + [(Difference in Strikes × # of Short Calls) ÷ (# of Long
Calls – # of Short Calls)] + net option prices*
There is no downside breakeven if the trade is established for a debit. In the
event the position is created for a credit downside breakeven is calculated as
follows:
Lower Strike Price + (Net Option Prices* ÷ # of Short Calls) 
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
Margin requirements are dictated by your brokerage company.
Call ratio backspread example
While completing a volatility scan, you find a reverse skew for options on 
a consumer discretionary company that are expiring in 67 days. The longer
term chart looks bullish, but because you’re approaching a traditionally 
bearish period for the market you decide to evaluate a slightly out-of-the-
money (OTM) call ratio backspread. Assume ABC is trading at $69.90 when
you note the reverse price skew. You analyze the following trade:
 Buy 3 ABC 75.00 Calls @ $0.60 and simultaneously
 Sell 2 ABC 70.00 Calls @ $2.45
The net credit for the position is $310, [(2 × 2.45) – (3 × 0.60)] × 100. The best
move for the stock is one that is strongly bullish, but if the stock follows the
market downward, the position will still be profitable.

Using a delta neutral approach to ratio backspread positions may increase
your strategy success.
Figure 15-10 displays the skew chart for the ABC options expiring in 67 days.
Identify your risk, reward, and breakevens when you evaluate a potential
trade.
Calculating other important trade values you obtain the following:
 Maximum Risk: Your maximum risk occurs when the underlying expires
at the long call strike price, or 75: 
[(Number of Short Calls × Difference in Strike Prices) × 100] – Initial
Credit (or + Initial Debit)
[(2 × 5) × 100] – $310 = $690
 Maximum Reward: Unlimited above the position breakeven level.
 Upside Breakeven: There are two breakevens for this position since it is
established for a credit. 
Higher Strike Price + [(Difference in Strikes × # of Short Calls) ÷
(# of Long Calls – # of Short Calls)] + Net Option Prices*
75 + [(5 × 2) ÷ (3 – 2)] – 3.10 = 81.90
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
 Downside breakeven:
Lower Strike Price + (Net Credit / # of Short Calls) 
70 + 1.55 = 71.55
The initial credit and debit amounts usually refer to the total amount
received as a credit or paid as a debit. When calculating breakeven values, it
refers to the option prices themselves, without the option contract multiplier.

Figure 15-11 displays the risk graph for the ABC call ratio backspread.
Risk management is an important aspect of all trades — including those with
limited risk. Have an exit plan that includes purchasing the short leg of a
ratio backspread when you want to avoid assignment.
From the time the position was established until the last trading day before
expiration, this stock barely moved — it closed at $70.65. The short options
were $0.65 in-the-money (ITM) and were bought back at $0.65 ($130) to avoid
weekend assignment. These conditions are far from optimal for the strategy,
but you ended up making $180 [$310 – $130]. That really is not too bad. 
Sometimes it’s exciting to see a textbook example of a trade, but in this case I
think it’s even better to see a trade where conditions aren’t optimal or things
don’t really go as expected and you still have gains. That’s pretty powerful.
See the end of this chapter for hints on creating call ratio backspreads with
the best chances of success. 
Profiling put ratio backspread risk
When evaluating a put ratio backspread, you want to look for a forward price
skew on the implied volatility (IV) so that the higher strike price put — those
being sold — have the higher IV. You then buy a larger number of lower strike
prices, lower IV puts, ideally for a credit.
Your losses are greatest with a put ratio backspread when a moderately bear-
ish move occurs and the underlying stock closes at the long put strike price
at expiration. At this level the long puts expire worthless, while the short
puts realize their maximum loss.

Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

If placing a ratio backspread order with a broker, keep the order as simple as
possible by specifying both the long and short options along with the
number of contracts for each. Avoid a lot of terminology shortcuts that could
result in placing the wrong type of ratio spread.
The trade does best when an explosive move downward occurs, increasing
the long put moneyness and IV. Because long puts have limited but high profit
potential, a put ratio backspread also has limited, but high profit potential.
The initial credit for a put ratio backspread is:
[(# of Short Puts × Short Put Price) – (# of Long Puts × Long Put Price)] 
× 100
The combination may result in a net debit rather than credit.
Your maximum risk occurs when the underlying expires at the long put strike
price and is calculated as follows: 
[(Number of Short Puts × Difference in Strike Prices) × 100] – Initial Credit
(or + Initial Debit)
Your maximum reward is limited, but high to the downside since the underly-
ing stock can only fall to zero.
Ratio backspreads have an upper and lower breakeven value.
There is no upside breakeven if the trade is established for a debit and two
breakevens when created for a credit. The upside breakeven is calculated as
follows:
Higher Strike Price + (Net Option Prices* ÷ # of Short Puts)
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
In the event the position is created for a credit downside breakeven is 
calculated as follows:
Lower Strike Price – [(Difference in Strikes × # of Short Puts) ÷ (# of Long
Puts – # of Short Puts)] – Net Option Prices* 
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
Margin requirements are dictated by your brokerage company — be sure to
contact them for specifics!
This time when scanning IV you find a minor forward price skew for a stock
with a pending news that could be bearish. The stock is in the brokerage
business and is trading at $73.85. There’s a moderate skew between the 75
277
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

and 65 strike price puts. Because the stock is volatile, you look at a shorter
term ratio put backspread in case stock takes off higher instead. You con-
sider the following trade:
Buy 2 XYZ 65.00 Put @ $2.75 and Sell 1 XYZ 75.00 Puts @ $7.20 each
The combined position brings in a credit of $170, [(1 × 7.20) – (2 × 2.75)] 
× 100.
A typical ATM IV chart is said to display an IV smile which refers to the image
produced when the IV points are connected. When you find volatility skews,
identify the strategies you can implement to take advantage of the skew.
To evaluate other important trade data you obtain the following:
Your maximum risk occurs when the stock expires at 65. This maximum 
risk is: 
[(Number of Short Puts × Difference in Strike Prices) × 100] – Initial Credit
(or + Initial Debit)
[(1 × 10) × 100] – $170 = $830
Your maximum reward occurs if the stock goes to zero. You can calculate this
maximum reward by breaking the position into a put credit spread and a long
put, and assuming the stock goes to zero:
Spread: [(7.20 – 2.75) – [(75 – 65)] × 100 = ($555)
Put: [(65 – 0) – 2.75] × 100 = $6,225
Put Gain – Spread Loss = $6,225 – 555 = $5,670
There are two breakevens when created for a credit. The upside breakeven is
calculated as follows:
Higher Strike Price + (Net Option Prices* ÷ # of Short Puts)
75 – (1.70/1) = 73.30
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
The downside breakeven is calculated as follows:
Lower Strike Price – [(Difference in Strikes × # of Short Puts) ÷ (# of Long
Puts – # of Short Puts)] – Net Option Prices*
65 – [(10 × 1) ÷ (2 – 1)] + 1.70 = 56.70
* This is a negative value if there is a credit.
Always consider the margin requirements necessary to implement a trade.
278
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Because the stock is already trading above the upside breakeven and the
reward to risk is reasonable, you establish the position. You’ll allow the trade
to expire if the stock continues upward and exit one month prior expiration if
a move down has occurred. 
Figure 15-12 displays the risk graph for the XYZ put ratio backspread.
Recognize that all trades don’t play out in textbook fashion — manage your
risk so you can build experience that allows you to most effectively manage
different trades.
The stock was near a peak when the trade was put in place. About three
weeks before your exit date the stock reaches a low and bounces back. On
your planned exit date, the stock has reached the low again and is moving
upward. It’s possible a double-bottom has formed. Regardless, this is your
planned exit date. 
The stock is trading at $55.08 when exit the put ratio backspread. Both
options were in-the-money (ITM) and the short options were bought back at
$20.20 ($2,020) and the long options sold for $10.70 ($2,140) for an additional
profit of $120. The position gain was $290 because it was initially established
for a credit.
It can be difficult to find ratio backspreads for a credit, but by understanding
the IV conditions that are optimal for these types of trades, you have a much
better chance of locating credits. If you do establish the position for a debit,
try to keep that debit as low as possible.

Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

The trickiest option to manage at expiration is a barely out-of-the-money
(OTM) short option leg that is covered by another expiring option. If the
short option is at-the-money (ATM) or even slightly OTM while your long
option is OTM, you could have the short option assigned after the long
option has expired. Always manage your risk by actively managing the
assignment possible as much as possible.
Spotting best conditions 
for ratio backspreads
Both ratio spreads and ratio backspreads rely on volatility price skews for
best results. Although backspreads are clearly the preferred strategy — you
have unlimited to high rewards for the ratio backspread versus unlimited to
high risk for the ratio spread — your outlook for the stock ultimately deter-
mines which strategy is reasonable. 
Price skews provide ratio backspread opportunities while time skews provide
calendar spread opportunities.
Putting a call ratio backspread to work
A call ratio backspread combines a lower strike, short call with a greater
number of higher strike, long calls that expire in the same month. The risk for
the position is limited, while the potential gain is unlimited.
When seeking a call ratio backspread position, look for the following market
conditions:
 A reverse price skew in implied volatility (IV) so the lower strike short
calls have a greater IV than the higher strike long calls.
 Bullish conditions for the underlying stock, with the potential for an
explosive move upward (i.e. very favorable report).
 A potential increase in IV for both options.
When noting the above conditions are in place, here are some additional tips
to help you successfully implement a call ratio backspread:
 Even though the trade can be created for a credit, losses occur when
there is limited movement in the stock. Identify a maximum loss amount
for the combined position and exit the position if it is reached.
 Keep the ratios you use to multiples of 1:2 or 2:3 at most. Calculate net
delta to determine which ratio best minimizes directional bias for the
position.
 Seek an initial credit. If you create the trade for a debit, keep that debit
as low as possible.
280
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

 Use options with 90 days to expiration when possible to allow time to
for the stock to continue an upward move.
 Focus on stocks valued between $25 and 75 per share.
 Consider exiting an equal number of long and short calls when the posi-
tion has 50% profit above the upper breakeven. This allows for profit-
taking while leaving one or more long calls in place for additional profits.
 Exit the position with 30 days to expiration when time decay negatively
impacts the long calls — be particularly diligent when the stock is 
trading between the two call strike prices which represents the area of
maximum risk.
 Never hold an in-the-money (ITM), at-the-money (ATM) or slightly out-of-
the-money (OTM) short option into expiration weekend. Manage your
assignment risk by buying the short option back to cover the position.
Successfully implementing a call ratio backspread strategy takes a little time
to find the proper market conditions and identify options that work best.
This means it’s perfectly suited to paper trading for honing your skills. You’ll
find the time you invest can be well worth it. 
Paper trading is a great way to gain experience with different strategy 
dynamics.
Making the most of put ratio backspreads
A put ratio backspread combines a higher strike, short put with a greater
number of lower strike, long puts that expire in the same month. The risk for
the position is limited, while the potential gain is limited, but high.
When seeking a put ratio backspread position, look for the following market
conditions:
 A forward price skew in implied volatility (IV) so the higher strike short
puts have a greater IV than the lower strike long puts — generally low
implied volatility conditions will help.
 Bearish conditions for the underlying stock, with the potential for an
explosive move downward (i.e. unfavorable report).
 A potential increase in IV for both options.
Never assume a short out-of-the-money (OTM) option will expire worthless.
Always monitor conditions through expiration weekend to confirm you have
not been assigned on a short option.
When noting the above conditions are in place, here are some additional tips
to help you successfully implement a put ratio backspread:
281
Chapter 15: Keying In on Volatility

 Even though the trade can be created for a credit, losses occur when
there is limited movement in the stock. Identify a maximum loss amount
for the combined position and exit the position if it is reached.
 Keep the ratios you use to multiples of 1:2 or 2:3 at most. Calculate net
delta to determine which ratio best minimizes directional bias for the
position.
 Seek an initial credit. If you create the trade for a debit, keep that debit
as low as possible.
 Use options with 90 days to expiration when possible to allow time for
the stock to continue an upward move.
 Paper trade the strategy to hone your trade selection skills and under-
stand how changes in the underlying impact the position value 
throughout its life.
 Consider exiting an equal number of long and short puts when the posi-
tion has 50% profit below the lower breakeven. This allows for profit-
taking while leaving one or more long puts in place for additional profits.
 Exit the position with 30 days to expiration when time decay negatively
impacts the long puts — be particularly diligent when the stock is 
trading between the two put strike prices which represents the area 
of maximum risk.
 Never hold an in-the-money (ITM), at-the-money (ATM), or slightly out-
of-the-money (OTM) short option into expiration weekend. Manage your
assignment risk by buying the short option back to cover the position.
Again, successfully implementing a put ratio backspread strategy takes time
and practice. If it didn’t require an effort, everyone would be doing it.

Capitalizing When Markets 
Move Sideways
In This Chapter
 Boosting current returns
 Trading sideways markets
 Understanding spread impact
A
lthough people generally think about the markets moving in one of 
two possible directions, it also spends significant time moving in a third
direction: sideways. Major averages, sectors, and individual securities all 
display varying degrees of trending (up or down) and trendless (sideways)
conditions. 
Option strategies are unique because they allow you to realize profits when
sideways movement is in place. By using options, you can reap additional
rewards on existing positions or trade the markets with limited risk. Long
butterflies and condors are two such strategies introduced here.
Winning Positions in Sideways Markets
You have two dilemmas when the markets move sideways:
 Dealing with stagnant returns on existing positions
 Finding gains with new positions
You may find yourself getting restless when sideways movement persists,
wondering whether you should close out current positions and when things
will get moving again (and in which direction). Although I don’t know the
exact statistics on how much time the market spends in such a “trendless”
mode, I do know that because I trade options it doesn’t really matter all that
much. Let’s look first at position management when the market settles into a
sideways trading range.

Managing existing positions
Long calls allow you to realize gains from bullish moves while long puts allow
you to realize gains from bearish moves. When the markets are spending time
moving sideways, you can realize gains by combining positions. Hopefully 
by now you’re comfortable with combination positions because there are so
many different ones available to you. As a starting point, options can be
added to existing stock or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to boost returns
when the markets seem to be directionless. 
As a general rule of thumb for initiating new positions, you want to sell 
premium when implied volatility is relatively high and buy it when it is rela-
tively low.
Sideways gains: DELL case study
Suppose it’s late 2001 and you purchased Dell Computer Corporation (DELL)
for $24.00 because technology names were finally strengthening. This came
after a long decline in this sector and you felt DELL was a leader in its field.
You identify $22.00 as your stop-loss exit point, which represents a decline 
of 8.3%.
After a move upward in price, DELL has stalled a bit. You re-evaluate some of
the technical indicators you prefer under such conditions and decide the
longer term outlook for DELL remains bullish. Rather than having the asset
just sit there, you evaluate a covered call strategy to increase your returns.
In March 2002, DELL is trading at $26.50, about 10% higher than where you
purchased it. You note that historical volatility (HV) and implied volatility
(IV) are relatively low for the stock compared to the last 12 months, so you
monitor conditions to see if IV strengthens at all. You also note that the next
quarterly earnings report for DELL is due in mid-May. 
Leg is the term used to describe each individual security in a combined 
position.
Selling a call against a long stock position doesn’t protect it — it moderately
reduces risk by reducing your net costs.
Because you’d prefer to keep the shares of DELL, you rule out the two in-the-
money (ITM) calls with a strike price of 25.00. You also note that the May
earnings report is due one day prior to May expiration and decide to wait
until you are closer to that time to capture an IV boost for options expiring in
May. Instead of May options, you focus on the Apr 27.50 and 30.00 strike price
calls expiring April 19. 
284
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

After capturing the sideways price movement by drawing a linear regression
channel from the share purchase date to the current date, you extend the
channel lines to the right to monitor price changes. See Chapter 6 for more
information on price movements and projections using this technical tool.
Selling the Apr 30.00 will barely break-even after commission, so you sell 
the Apr 27.50 call for $0.70. You note there is a 39% chance the shares will 
be called using pricing model assumptions (delta = 39.1). You also note the
upward directional bias for the position has been reduced from +100 to +60.9.
Volume levels may provide hints about the direction of a breakout from a
consolidation pattern, as well as its chance of success. Volume should
increase with the breakout. Adding a moving average line to volume data
helps with this approach.
DELL traded in a range from $27.13 to 27.70 on the Friday before expiration,
closing at $27.34. You retained the shares. After April expiration, you note 
the following:
 Your indicators remain long-term bullish for DELL, while the short-term
view remains flat.
 IV levels are relatively low and they will likely increase as you get closer
to the quarterly earnings report.
 Because the earnings report is so close to expiration, you’ll sell a May
call when IV increases and roll that option to June after earnings are
released. This assumes DELL remains within its sideways channel and
you remain long-term bullish on the stock.
Bollinger bands are bands constructed above and below a simple moving
average, using a standard deviation calculation. As a result, the expansion
and contraction of the bands coincide with expanding and contracting 
volatility.
DELL moves down to its lower Bollinger band near the end of April, but
remains well within its sideways channel. It then moves back to its 20-day
simple moving average (SMA) with an increase in IV a couple of days later.
Once again it is trading near $26.50 and you evaluate May 27.50 and 30.00
strike calls. Figure 16-1 displays the current 12-month at-the-money (ATM) 
IV chart for DELL.
Even if you can realize additional gains by selling calls against an existing
stock position, it doesn’t mean you should necessarily hold onto that 
position. Consider both your shorter term and longer term outlook for the
security before you decide whether to offset position cost by selling calls
against it.
285
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

The cost basis for DELL is now $23.30, because the covered calls that were
sold for $0.70 expired worthless. Although IV increased for the Apr 27.50 call,
time decay had a greater impact on the option premiums. You decide to sell
the May 27.50 strike call for $0.55.
Do not sell calls against a position you are not willing to part with. Although 
a stock can seem to spend lengthy periods of time moving sideways, it can
explode upward at any time. 
Four days after the call was sold, DELL declined rapidly through the lower
regression channel line, but remained above your stop-loss exit price. The
stock once again rebounds, but you do note there are wider Bollinger bands
and longer daily price bars, indicating conditions are getting more volatile.
Expectations are bullish on the day earnings are set to be released (after the
close) and DELL moves up to $27.85. The report is good and the stock opens
up an additional $0.42 with movement remaining within the channel lines.
You roll out the May call to June and also roll it up from 27.50 to 30.00 to 
minimize the risk of being called out of a longer term bullish position.
The IV for the May 27.50 call sky-rocketed with one day remaining to expira-
tion, resulting in a $0.30 loss for the Apr 27.50 call. The position cost basis
rises to $23.60. The June options did not realize the same magnitude spike in
IV. You tell yourself to remember that for next time. As a result of selling the
June call, your cost basis declines to $22.90.
Conditions deteriorate and DELL closes at 23.98 on the Friday of expiration
weekend in June. You allow the Jun 30.00 strike price call option to expire
worthless and decide to re-evaluate the stock position over the weekend. 
The short-term trend is downward and on a longer term basis it appears 
a more bearish picture has emerged. You elect to sell the stock at the 
open on Monday, rather than protecting the position with a collar (long 
put-short call).
Figure 16-2 displays the daily bar chart for DELL with a regression channel
based on nearly five months of trading. The vertical lines denote stock entry

and exit days, as well as short call transaction days. Volume data with a 20-
day moving average and the directional movement indicator (DMI) are also
included.
The stock was sold for $23.68 for a net gain of $0.78 per share, when the short
call positions are included. These results do not include commissions, which
would have added approximately $0.60 for an active trader (option and stock
commissions). Although this is certainly significant, compare this to a net
loss inclusive of stock commissions (approximately $0.52 per share) if the
stock was held by itself until this time. These values translate to a 0.8% gain
for the covered call approach versus a 2.2% buy and hold loss.
When a stock is consolidating and its volatility decreases, implied volatility
(IV) for the stock’s options will likely also decrease. This creates an environ-
ment that’s not ideal for covered call strategies because premiums are
decreasing. Regardless, the strategy can still be profitably implemented.
Strategy comments
As it turns out, DELL had one more daily close below the lower regression
channel line in late July 2002 and a few closes above the upper regression
channel in early November 2002, before finally breaking out above the side-
ways consolidation pattern in May 2003. The price remained within the chan-
nel range all but a handful of days for 18 months. 
Figure 16-2:
Daily price
chart for
DELL with

287
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

The covered call strategy could have been continued for profits throughout
this period. Had the stock been called away during the May 2003 breakout, it
could have been purchased again later that month when DELL returned to
test the upper channel line, which now serves as support. 
Do not place a standing stop-loss order for the underlying stock used in a
covered call strategy. In the event the stop is triggered, you’ll be left holding
a short, naked call which is an unlimited risk position.
While reviewing the DELL case study, hopefully you noted the following
important points:
 The short call does not protect the stock position; it will typically just
reduce the cost basis which moderately decreases risk
 You still need to manage your risk by identifying a stop-loss exit level,
even if that means buying back a short call option to exit the stock
 Historical volatility and implied volatility both generally decrease when
a stock is in a trading range
 Earnings reports and other company and economic-related news can 
significantly impact implied volatility even when price is basically
moving sideways
 You should consider your longer term view for the long stock position
because there is potential for limited, but high losses with such a 
strategy
 As an alternate approach, a long-term put can be purchased while the
calls are sold each month to protect the downside
 Short calls that close in-the-money (ITM) may be rolled out a month and
up a strike price for a modest gain when the stock moves upward
 Commissions can significantly impact trade results
 Other trading costs such as tax consequences need to be considered
when implementing this or any trading strategy
 Trading rules based on stop-loss exits and regression channel breaks
help implement a strategy successfully while managing risk 
 Paper trading provides you with issues that can arise when implement-
ing a new strategy, such as the price impact of IV versus time
 When a breakout away from a longer term consolidation occurs, it’s
common for the stock to return to test the pattern
If you exit or get called out of a position while implementing a covered call
strategy during a consolidation, a move back to the pattern may provide you
with an opportunity to establish a new directional position in the stock. 
288
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

A LEAPS contract is a long-term option available for certain underlying indexes,
exchange-traded funds, and stocks. These contracts generally have more
than 9 months to 21⁄2 years to expiration and become regular options after
that time decreases.
When selling calls on a long stock or ETF position, you increase the number
of ways the stock can move while still allowing for gains. You also limit your
potential gains if an explosive upside move occurs. That’s simply a strategy
trade-off you need to weigh when considering different trade approaches.
Option strategies for sideways moves
The covered call strategy is just one that can yield gains during sideways 
trading periods. As mentioned in the Strategy Comments, you may elect to
protect the stock position with a longer term put option, and then selling calls
each month until a breakout occurs or the long put expiration month nears.
In addition to stock and option combination positions, you can extend 
the same concept to just option combination positions using a Long-term
Equity AnticiPation Securities (LEAPS) contract in place of the stock leg. 
This approach will typically reduce risk by reducing the overall cost of 
the position.
Managing risk comes before bringing in income. If you feel prolonged side-
ways movement for a security you hold may set up a more bearish outlook
for the stock, either exit the position or protect it with puts.
Things to consider with option combinations
One advantage options generally have over the individual stocks and
exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that serve as the underlying for the options 
is that they generally require less of an investment. The end result is that 
you have less money at risk. The trade-off is that the entire asset can expire
worthless. And so it goes for you on the trading side — there are a series of
things to consider for every asset type you decide to use. That is why manag-
ing your risk is a common thread throughout. The only security considered
to be risk-free is a U.S. Treasury Bill.
When a stock moves sideways for a period of time it is said to be in a consoli-
dation phase. The longer the consolidation, the greater the chance for a
strong directional move away from this consolidation.
Rather than a portfolio of individual stocks or ETFs, you may hold LEAPS
contracts for different sectors or stocks. A covered call strategy can also be
implemented using the LEAPS option as the sideways moving asset from
which you’re boosting your income. There are a few things to consider if you
go this route:
289
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

 Use a LEAPS contract as an underlying will subject you to margin
requirements because the position technically represents a spread, not
a pure covered call position.
 Spread strategies require a different option approval level from your
broker — you may or may not be able to access these strategies depend-
ing on the account type (i.e. IRAs).
 Because LEAPS are also subject to the same pricing factors as a regular
option contract, implied volatility (IV) conditions that are good for 
selling calls are not necessarily optimal for buying LEAPS. The strategy
may work best on an existing position.
 The double-edge sword of IV may result in conditions where you’re
better off selling your LEAPS contract which may have declined less
than the underlying asset itself. 
In addition to a LEAPS strategy, additional income may be generated from a
calendar strategy using simply an existing long call. In this case, shorter term
calls are sold against a long call for the same underlying. Risk is moderately
reduced by reducing your net investment in the position and the same 
considerations apply as those listed for a LEAPS short call approach.
The option term roll out refers to the process where an existing option position
is closed with an off-setting transaction and a new similar position is created
for a later expiration month.
Strategy short-list
A few strategies covered in this book that can either provide gains during
sideways markets, moderately reduce risk, or both include the following:
 Long stock — covered call (limited but high risk position)
 Call credit spread (slightly out-of-the-money)
 Put credit spread (slightly out-of-the-money)
 Call calendar
 Put calendar
 Call ratio spread (unlimited risk position)
 Put ratio spread (limited but high risk position)
Next up, two limited risk strategies specifically designed to benefit from 
sideways market action — the butterfly and the condor.

Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Understanding Butterfly Positions 
A butterfly is a strategy specifically designed to gain when a stock or ETF is
trading sideways. Some characteristics of the strategy include the following:
 Limited risk and limited reward
 Can be created using calls or puts
 Combines two vertical spreads
 Is shorter term in nature
 Is generally created for a debit
 Maximizes gains when the underlying security remains within a trading
range dictated by the option strike prices
A variation on the basic butterfly is the iron butterfly which combines calls
and puts. This position is generally created for a credit with time decay 
working in its favor. 
A sideways moving market can also be referred to as trendless or directionless.
Defining the long butterfly
As with most of the strategies in this book, the butterfly comes in two 
varieties:
 Long call butterfly
 Long put butterfly
Both of these strategies combine a vertical credit spread and a vertical debit
spread to capitalize on sideways moves in the markets. The strategy name
comes from the three options used to create the position, as follows:
 Body: two short options of the same type
 Wing 1: one long lower strike price option
 Wing 2: one long higher strike price option
Generally the short option strike prices are at-the-money (ATM) or near the
money, with profits maximized when the underlying closes at expiration at
the short option strike price. 
291
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

Always consider different strategies suitable to current market conditions.
You may decide that an alternate strategy does a better job of reducing 
your risk.
Call butterfly
A long call butterfly combines a bull call spread and bear call spread, using
the same strike price for the short leg of each. It is a limited risk, limited
reward position that is profitable during range-bound trading for the underly-
ing stock or ETF.
The butterfly is constructed by creating two spreads:
 A bull call spread with a short option strike price that is near or at-the-
money (ATM)
 A bear call spread with the same short option strike price as the bull 
call spread
The maximum risk for the position is the initial debit, which is determined by
subtracting the bear call spread credit from the bull call spread debit. See
Chapter 11 for more information on vertical spreads.
The best way to think about risks and rewards for a butterfly is to remember
it combines two vertical spreads.
The long call butterfly strike prices compare to the spread strikes as follows:
 The lower strike price long call in the bull call spread is the lowest strike
price call in the butterfly position and serves as the first wing.
 The two short options represent the next higher strike price and repre-
sent the body.
 The last call is the highest strike price in the group and comes from the
long call in the bear call spread position.
Because the short options are approximately ATM, profits are maximized
with the strategy when the stock moves very little and closes at the short
option strike price on the last trading day before expiration. At this level
three of the four options expire worthless. The lower priced long call will be
ITM by an amount equal to the butterfly spread.
As price moves away from the short option strike price, profits diminish to
the position breakeven levels where they are equal to zero. Beyond these
price levels, the initial debit is the maximum risk. 
Because a butterfly combines three different options, you must consider 
trading costs when evaluating a specific position. 
292
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Suppose it’s late July and you feel the market has finally settled into vacation
doldrums after some initial summer volatility. You note the ADX is declining
below 20 and the 20-day and 30-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are 
relatively flat. 
The Diamonds ETF (DIA), which is based on the Dow Jones Industrials, is
trading at $106.48 and you evaluate a few long call butterfly alternatives with
August 106 calls serving as the strike price for the short options (body).
Figure 16-3 displays the daily price chart for DIA with the ADX and SMAs.
Because butterflies combine vertical spreads there are margin requirements
for the position.
Different DIA butterfly spreads are discussed in the next section, so for now,
assume the Aug 103-106-109 call butterfly spread was established. This trade
shorthand translates to the following:
 Long 1 Aug 103 Call @ $4.00
 Short 2 Aug 106 Calls @ $1.45
 Long 1 Aug 109 Call @ $0.30
Figure 16-3:
Daily price
chart 
for DIA.
293
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

Calculating the net debit for these options you obtain the following:
[(Wing 1 Option Price + Wing 2 Option Price) – (2 × Body Option Price)] 
× 100
[(4.00 + 0.30) – (2 × 1.45)] × 100 = $140
To remember which options are long and short in the butterfly strategy,
imagine a butterfly with a short body and long wings.
Figure 16-4 displays the risk chart for this butterfly position.
When maximum risk is identified for a position with short options, it’s
assumed that assignment risk will be managed properly by 1) meeting any
assignment obligations with existing shares or exercising a long call, or 2)
closing out any short options that could be potentially assigned over 
expiration weekend.
As always, you need to know the risk, reward, and breakevens for the 
position:
 Maximum Risk: The initial debit of $140 is the maximum risk for the DIA
Aug 103-106-109 call butterfly position. 
 Maximum Reward: There are a couple of ways to calculate the maxi-
mum reward for the position. You can either calculate each spread 
separately (as shown) or use a single butterfly formula (put butterfly
example).
 Bull call spread:
[(Difference Between Strikes) – (Long Option Price – Short Option
Price)] × 100 
[(106 – 103) – (4.00 – 1.45)] × 100] = (3 – 2.55)] × 100] = $45.00
Figure 16-4:

294
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

 Bear call spread: Initial credit
($1.45 – 0.30) × 100 = $115
 Call butterfly:
Bull call spread maximum reward + Bear call spread maximum
reward
$45 + $115 = $160
 Upper breakeven:
Highest strike price – initial debit
109.00 – 1.40 = $107.60
 Lower breakeven:
Lowest strike price + initial debit
103.00 + 1.40 = $104.40
Options that are slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) on the last trading day
before expiration will almost always have some offer price available, 
allowing you to buy it back at $0.05 or less plus commissions, to eliminate
assignment risk. 
As expiration approaches, the following four distinct areas are where the
stock could be trading. If you elect to sell any long option legs to either 
realize gains or minimize losses, be sure to also buy back the corresponding
short option. The four areas are
 Underlying below lowest strike: All options will expire worthless 
realizing the maximum loss.
 Underlying from the lower breakeven to the short strike price: Close
out the bull call spread for profits and allow the bear call spread to
expire worthless.
 Underlying between the short strike price and upper breakeven: Close
out the bull call spread plus the additional short call for profits.
 Underlying above highest strike price: Close out both spreads and 
realize maximum loss. 
If assigned early on a short option, use the corresponding long option or 
evaluate costs to buy shares in the market to meet the short obligation 
(see To Exercise or Not in Chapter 9).
Don’t allow long options to expire worthless while you still have short 
option assignment risk. Properly manage a butterfly position into expiration
weekend by focusing on potential risk. 
295
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

In the DIA example provided, the ETF was trading at 105.73 into the close on
the Friday before expiration. The bull call spread was closed out for $255 by
completing the following transactions:
 Buy to Close 1 Aug 106 call @ $0.05 and simultaneously
 Sell to Close 1 Aug 103 call @ $2.60
Both options making up the bear call spread expired worthless. Because the
initial debit was $140, the position gain was $115 ($255 – 140).
If you have a slightly bullish to neutral outlook you can purchase a call butterfly
using an out-of-the-money (OTM) instead of at-the-money (ATM) body.
Put butterfly
A long put butterfly combines a bull put spread and bear put spread, using
the same strike price for the short leg of each spread. It is a limited risk, 
limited reward position that is profitable during range-bound trading for the
underlying stock or ETF.
The butterfly is constructed by creating two spreads:
 A bull put spread with a short option strike price that is near or at-the-
money (ATM)
 A bear put spread with the same short option strike price as the bull 
put spread
The maximum risk for the position is the initial debit, which is determined by
subtracting the bull put spread credit from the bear put spread debit. See
Chapter 11 for more information on vertical spreads.
Calculate the net delta for the butterfly to identify the directional bias for 
the position.
Because both positions focus on range-bound markets, what would have 
happened if a put butterfly was used in place of a call butterfly for the DIA
example? Before checking out an Aug 103-106-109 put butterfly for DIA, 
consider a few questions first — keep in mind DIA was trading at $106.48
when the position was initiated and closed at $105.73 going into expiration:
 Would you expect the put butterfly spread to be higher or lower than
call butterfly spread, assuming the same strike prices were used?
 Using your first answer, would the range of profitability for the put 
butterfly be more or less than the call butterfly?
 Would you expect the gains for the put butterfly to be higher or lower?
296
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Long put butterfly
Okay, it’s late July . . . vacation doldrums . . . market’s flat. 
DIA is trading at $106.48 and you’re evaluating a long put butterfly spread with
August 106 puts serving as the short option strike price (body). Assuming you
purchase the Aug 103-106-109 put butterfly spread, the following position 
was created:
 Long 1 Aug 109 Put @ $2.85
 Short 2 Aug 106 Puts @ $0.85
 Long 1 Aug 103 Put @ $0.30
Look for liquid options to avoid additional trading costs in the form of 
slippage, which is the difference between the bid-ask spread. These costs 
can be significant given the number of legs used to create butterflies.
Calculating the net debit for these options you obtain the following:
[(Wing 1 Option Price + Wing 2 Option Price) – (2 × Body Option Price)] 
× 100
[(2.85 + 0.30) – (2 × 0.85)] × 100 = $145
Figure 16-5 displays the risk chart for this butterfly position.
If you flip back quickly to Figure 16-4, you can hardly tell the difference
between the two butterflies. Calculating the risk, reward and breakevens for
the position you have:

297
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

 Maximum risk: The initial debit of $145 is the maximum risk for the DIA
Aug 103-106-109 put butterfly position. 
 Maximum reward: The maximum reward for a long butterfly position is
a single spread value minus the initial debit.
[(Difference Between Bull Put Spread Strikes × 100)] – (Initial Debit)
[(106 – 103) × 100] – $145 = $155
 Upper breakeven: Highest strike price – initial debit
109.00 – 1.45 = $107.55
 Lower breakeven: Lowest strike price + initial debit
103.00 + 1.45 = $104.45
The breakeven range is the same, but has shifted upward $0.05 reflecting
the additional debit required to create the spread.
Many ETFs have dollar strike price increments giving you a great deal of 
flexibility when selecting butterfly options. By varying the long and short
option strike prices, you vary your risk profile.
Approaching expiration, you have four distinct areas where the stock could
be trading. If you elect to sell any long option legs to either realize gains or
minimize losses, be sure to also buy back the corresponding short option.
Here are your positions and options:
 Underlying below lowest strike: Close out both spreads and realize
maximum loss.
 Underlying between lower breakeven and short strike price: Close 
out the bull put spread plus the additional short put for profits.
 Underlying at short strike price to upper breakevens: Close out the
bull put spread for profits and allow the bear put spread to expire 
worthless.
 Underlying above highest strike price: All options will expire worthless
realizing the maximum loss.
Because vertical spreads create a naturally hedged position for the floor
trader they are desired orders. Try to execute the order below the market
price by shaving a little bit off the debit limit amount for your order.
With DIA trading at 105.73 into the close on the Friday before expiration, 
the bear put spread was closed out for $295 by completing the following
transactions:
 Buy to Close Aug 2 106 puts @ $0.35 and simultaneously
 Sell to Close Aug 109 put @ $3.30
298
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

The long option for the bull put spread expired worthless. Because the initial
debit was $145, the position gain was $150 ($295 – 145). This higher return
should be expected given the moderately bearish move for the ETF.
Combination orders may take additional time to execute, so keep this in mind
if you want to cancel and replace the limit amount for the trade — the market
may have moved by the time the order is updated. 
In this example the short options were approximately ATM, so profits are
maximized when the stock closes at the short option strike price on the last
trading day before expiration. At this level three of the four options expire
worthless. The higher priced long put will be ITM by an amount equal to the
butterfly spread.
As price moves away from the short option strike price, profits diminish to
the position breakeven levels where they are equal to zero. Beyond these
price levels, the initial debit is the maximum risk.
Digging deeper into butterfly risk
When selecting a butterfly spread, you need to make some trade-offs in 
terms of risk and reward, along with the range of profitability for the position
and its directional bias. This applies to both call and put long butterflies. In
general, the following hold true:
 Using an OTM option for the body will increase directional bias
 Increasing the spread distance increases the range of profitability
 Increasing the spread distance decreases the reward-risk ratio
If you have a slightly bearish to neutral outlook you can purchase a put but-
terfly using an out-of-the-money (OTM) instead of at-the-money (ATM) body.
Paper trading helps you see how these trade-offs impact your trade success
without having money on the line during your learning curve.
Narrow wings — smaller risk
When you decrease the spread distance for long butterflies, you also
decrease the risk. This is true for vertical spreads as well. By using the DIA
long call butterfly spread example and narrowing the spread, Table 16-1 
provides the position impact.

In this table, the initial debit is the Butterfly Risk and the Breakeven Range is
the difference in breakevens divided by the short option strike price of 106. 
Calculate the range of profitability for a butterfly by obtaining the difference
in breakevens and dividing it by the security’s price to get a quick feel 
of whether the range is reasonable given past movement in the underlying 
security.
A few observations you should make as you decrease the butterfly spread
distance:
 The risk decreases and the reward-risk increases
 The breakeven range decreases
 The directional bias generally becomes more neutral
You need to properly manage your risk, but also be realistic about the range
in which the underlying will travel. 
Wider wings — bigger risk
When you increase the spread distance for long butterflies, you also increase
the position risk. Once again using the DIA call example as a starting point,
Table 16-2 provides similar data to Table 16-1 creating wider spreads for 
the butterfly.

A few observations you should make as you increase the spread distance:
 The risk increases and the reward-risk decreases
 The breakeven range increases
 The directional bias generally becomes more bearish for a call butterfly
and bullish for a put butterfly
In the case of the long call butterfly, as the bearish directional bias increases 
 The position realizes increased losses for bullish moves in the underlying,
to a point (the upper breakeven).
 The position realizes increased gains for bearish moves in the underlying,
to a point (the lower breakeven).
If you’re trading different underlying securities, explore different-sized
spreads to get a feel for what’s suitable for the security and your risk prefer-
ences. Fortunately, the limited risk nature of the strategy provides you with
the time needed to build your butterfly skills.
Always check the news when you see big drops or advances in a company
stock. You need to beware of adjusted option’s resulting from a potential cor-
porate action. It’s also just as important to know significant news impacting
the underlying for options you trade.
Creating an iron butterfly
The long iron butterfly is a twist on call and put butterflies that allows you to
create the position for a credit. You do this by using a bear call spread and a
bull put spread, both for a credit. The position remains one that has limited
risk and limited reward. It also relies on sideways movement to maximize
gains. In the category of “you don’t get something for nothing,” these spreads
require additional margin because both vertical spreads are credit positions. 
The put and call butterfly
The iron butterfly combines two vertical credit spreads to capitalize on 
sideways movement in a stock as follows: 
 A bear call spread with a short option strike price that is near or at-the-
money (ATM)
 A bull put spread with a short option strike price that is near or ATM
and the same strike price as the short call
Brokers may base iron butterfly margin requirements on a short straddle —
long strangle combination instead of two vertical credit spreads. Check with
your broker on their specific requirements before creating a position.
301
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

The vertical spread differences are the same for the two credit spreads; 
the maximum risk for the position is the difference in strike prices for one
vertical spread minus the initial credit. The long iron butterfly has strike
prices that line up like this:
 The lowest strike price is a long put.
 The next lowest strike price is a short put.
 The same strike price is used for a short call.
 The highest strike price is a long call.
When creating the iron butterfly, you use the same strike price for the short
option. The initial credit you receive when establishing the position is your
maximum reward.
Iron butterfly risk
Using an iron butterfly with a wider spread reduces the reward-risk ratio 
for this position. This next example uses a stock that typically moves more
quietly (100-day historical volatility 12%), with slightly low implied volatility
(IV) levels relative to the last 12 months.
Corporate actions can lead to adjustments to existing option contracts. Be sure
to check the specs for the options you use, especially when the prices seem off.
Long iron butterfly example
It’s mid-June and after a big drop in the stock three months ago, MO has
returned to a more typical trading range. It turns out it had a spinoff 
that changed the company’s valuation (see Chapter 10 for information about
adjustments to existing options due to corporate actions).MO is trading
around $70 and after deciding the spinoff shouldn’t impact the stock going
forward, you evaluate the following iron butterfly:
 Long 1 Jul 60 Put @ $0.05
 Short 1 Jul 70 Put @ $1.20
 Short 1 Jul 70 Call @ $1.30
 Long 1 Jul 80 Call @ $0.05
So now instead of a $3 spread on index-based stock trading around $106,
you’ve increased the spread to $10 on a $70 stock.
An iron butterfly combines four different options — remember to consider
your trading costs before entering a position. 
Calculating the net credit for these options you obtain the following credit,
which is your maximum reward:
302
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Bear Call Spread Credit + Bull Put Spread Credit 
[(1.30 – 0.05) + (1.20 – 0.05)] × 100 = $240
Because both spreads are the same distance, the maximum risk is the 
difference between the two strike prices minus the initial credit.
[(Difference in Strike Prices × 100)] – Initial Credit 
[(80 – 70) – $240] = $760
Butterflies and condors have two breakeven levels — one to the upside and
one to the downside.
Figure 16-6 displays the risk chart for the MO iron butterfly position.
The breakeven calculation is centered on the short option strike price: 
 Upper breakeven:
Short call strike price + initial credit
70.00 + 2.40 = $72.40
 Lower breakeven:
Short put strike price – initial credit
70.00 – 2.40 = $67.60
Always manage your assignment risk into expiration weekend. Don’t assume
a short option will expire worthless when the underlying is trading near the
short option strike price.

Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

As expiration approaches, there are four distinct areas where the stock could
be trading. If you elect to sell any long option legs to either realize gains or
minimize losses, be sure to also buy back the corresponding short option.
Here are your options:
 Underlying below the long put strike: Both put options are in the money
and the maximum risk for the bull put spread is realized. The maximum
reward is realized for the bear call spread.
 Underlying from the lower breakeven to the short strike price: Partial
profits are realized for the bull put spread. The maximum reward is 
realized for the bear call spread.
 Underlying from the short strike price to the upper breakeven: Partial
profits are realized for the bear call spread. The maximum reward is 
realized for the bull put spread.
 Underlying above the call strike price: Both call options are in the
money and the maximum risk for the bear call spread is realized. The
maximum reward is realized for the bull put spread.
If assigned early on a short option, use the corresponding long option or 
evaluate costs to buy shares in the market to meet the short obligation 
(see Chapter 9).
In the MO example provided, the stock was trading at 69.80 into the close on
the Friday before expiration. The short put position was bought back for $20
and the remaining options expired worthless. Because the initial credit was
$240, the net gain was $220 (240 – 20).
The impact of dividends already declared are priced into the value of existing
call and put options if they expire after the dividend is issued. It is new 
dividend declarations that can affect the value of options you hold. 
Understanding Condor Positions
The condor relates to a butterfly in the same way a strangle relates to a 
straddle — it splits the center strike price (see Chapter 14). The condor then
combines two vertical spreads for the same type of option (call or put) using
four different strike prices. Condors do the following:
 Increase the range of profitability versus a similar butterfly
 Decrease the maximum reward versus a similar butterfly
Condors are limited risk, limited reward positions that rely on sideways 
trading action in the underlying to maximize profits.
304
Part IV: Advanced Strategies for Option Traders 

Evaluate limited risk positions before high- to unlimited risk positions so a
strategy comparison can be made prior to establishing a new position.
Defining a condor spread
There are actually three types of long condors available to you for trading:
 Long call condor
 Long put condor
 Long iron condor
The iron condor combines a bear call credit spread and a bull put credit
spread, with the short option legs at least one strike price apart.
Single type condors
Long call condors and long put condors allow for more movement in the
underlying stock during the life of the trade than a similar call or put butter-
fly position. This means you have a better chance of making a profit, but that
profit will be smaller. 
Historical volatility (HV) does not predict future prices and implied volatility
(IV) may incorporate factors beyond HV. Regardless, using past HV and IV
data provides you with valuable information when evaluating strategies.
Suppose a stock is trading at $134.45. You can create the following positions
expiring in 31 days that include 10 point vertical spreads:
 A call or put butterfly using a short strike price of $135 (125-135-145)
 A call or put condor using $130 and $140 strike prices for the short
options (120-130-140-150)
When evaluating strategies, you need to decide whether the higher probabil-
ity gain using a condor is worth the additional risk. In this particular exam-
ple, your risk is almost three times your potential reward. Your risk using a
butterfly is less than your potential reward, but the stock can only travel in a
range of 8% versus 11% for the condors. 
Similar strategies will provide different advantages and disadvantages in
terms of risk, reward and breakeven depending on a variety of factors. Be
sure to evaluate a few alternatives. 
The actual comparison between different strategy statistics are impacted by
the specific underlying stock, option strike prices, and spreads used. The
better risk-reward versus profitability range alternatives will not always be so
clear. If the stock was trading at a midpoint between two strike prices, all the
305
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

statistics for both strategies would be closer. The main point to keep in mind
is that when you’re selecting a trade that seeks to capitalize on sideways
movement, explore different strategies and spread alternatives.
Iron butterflies and iron condors combine call and put vertical spreads rather
than combining vertical spreads for just calls or just puts.
Iron condors
Throwing an iron condor into the mix for the butterfly-condor comparison, 
a similar table can be created using an iron butterfly versus an iron condor.
Using a stock trading at $134.45, the following positions expire in 31 days:
 An iron butterfly using a short strike price of $135 (125-135-145)
 An iron condor using $130 and $140 strike prices for the short 
options (120-130-140-150)
Again, the iron condor increases the profitability range, but sacrifices poten-
tial gains while taking on additional risk. Both positions combine two vertical
credit spreads (call plus put) so the margin requirement can be significant. 
Always contact your broker prior to implementing new strategies to deter-
mine the margin requirement calculations and approval levels for the strategy.
Recognizing condor risks
Butterflies and condors are not all or nothing positions — you can close out
either or both spreads for the position to reduce the maximum risk level if
you choose to do so. Just remember that after creating a limited risk posi-
tion, you want to keep it that way. Don’t remove legs that will expose you to
unlimited risk.
Condor risk profiles
As expiration approaches, there are four distinct areas where the stock could
be trading relative to the condor strike prices. If you elect to sell any long
option legs to either realize gains or minimize losses, be sure to also buy
back the corresponding short option.
If assigned early on a short option, use the corresponding long option or 
evaluate costs to buy shares in the market to meet the short obligation 
(see Chapter 9).
Even if you don’t have access to an options analysis software package, 
understand the risk graph for strategies you’re evaluating.

Iron condor risk profile
The original example used in this chapter was for an ETF trading at 106.48
with $1 strike price increments. Using the same trade set-up, an iron condor
can be created with slightly out-of-the-money short options to explore the
iron condor risk profile. 
Creating a $3 spread iron condor for DIA trading at $106.48, you have:
 Long 1 Aug 103 Put @ $0.30
 Short 1 Aug 106 Put @ $0.85
 Short 1 Aug 107 Call @ $0.85
 Long 1 Aug 110 Put @ $0.15
The maximum reward is the initial credit and the maximum risk is one spread
difference minus this credit. Calculating these values you have:
 Maximum reward:
[(0.85 – 0.15) + (0.85 – 0.30)] × 100 = $125
 Maximum risk:
(3 × 100) – $125 = $175
After calculating breakeven levels, ask yourself if the stock will realistically
trade in the area(s) of profitability during the life of the trade.
Calculating the breakevens using short option strike prices and initial credit:
 Lower breakeven:
Short Put Strike Price – Initial Credit = 106 – 1.25 = 104.75
 Upper breakeven:
Short Call Strike Price + Initial Credit = 107 + 1.25 = 108.25
Figure 16-7 displays the risk chart for the DIA iron condor position.
By increasing the bear call spread by one point and combining puts and 
calls to create the position, the maximum risk was increased $35 (25%), the
maximum reward reduced by $35 (22%), and the breakeven ranged increased
0.30 (9%). This reflects a pretty good improvement when you can better split
the price of the underlying between the two short options. 
Paper trading allows you to understand strategy mechanics without risking
capital.
307
Chapter 16: Capitalizing When Markets Move Sideways

Because the underlying closed at 105.73 going into expiration weekend, 
the short 106 put would have been bought back at $0.35 for a net position
profit of $90 versus $115 for the long call butterfly and $150 for the long 
put butterfly. The condor’s sweet spot was a closing value between 
$106 and 107.

T
rading is part art, part science. Developing specific rules and steps to
follow is part of a process that gets you up and running on a path toward
skillful trading. Implementing them with a focus on managing risk gives you
the time needed to develop your craft. A great first step on the science side is
creating a strategy list. This allows you to methodically approach a new type
of trade so you gain the most knowledge and experience possible. 
To get you started, I wanted to provide you with a list of ten great option
strategies. The common thread with these strategies is that they have limited
risk and are alternatives for you to consider. The unlimited risk or limited but
high risk strategies they could potentially replaces are provided with the
strategy summary.
Each top ten strategy includes:
 Strategy name and components
 Risks and rewards
 Optimal market conditions (trends, volatility)
 Advantages and disadvantages 
 Basic risk profiles
 Additional information by strategy
By all means consider adding notes to these to make them your own.

Married Put
A married put combines long stock with a long put for protection. The 
position is created by purchasing the stock and put at the same time, but the
key is creating put protection. Buying a put for existing stock or rolling out 
an option to a later expiration month remains true to that strategy goal. Long
out-of-the-money (OTM) options should be sold 30 to 45 days before expira-
tion. Table 17-1 gives you some ideas on strategy and Figure 17-1 shows you a
a married put risk profile.

Collar
A collar combines long stock with long put protection and a short call that
reduces the cost of protection. An optimal scenario occurs when you can buy
the stock and long put during low volatility conditions allowing you to buy
longer term protection. Calls are sold as volatility increases and there is 30 to
45 days to expiration so that time decay accelerates short call gains. Check

Long Put Trader
A long put is a limited risk bearish position that gains when the underlying
declines. This replaces an unlimited risk short stock position that requires
more capital to establish. The bearish move must occur by option expiration
and out-of-the-money (OTM) puts should be exited 30 to 45 days prior to
expiration. See Table 17-3 for a summary of strategies and Figure 17-3 for an
example of the profile.

LEAPS Call Investor
A Long-term Equity AnticiPation Security (LEAPS) call option reduces the
cost and risk associated with a long stock position. The position is best
established when implied volatility is relatively low. The LEAPS owner will
not participate in dividend distributions which reduce the stock value. See

Diagonal Spread
A diagonal spread combines a short near month option with a long later
month option of the same type. When the strike prices are the same, it is
referred to as a calendar spread. A near term neutral view allows you to sell
the short option to offset the long option costs. A call diagonal is described
here, but a put diagonal works equally well when you’re bearish longer term.

Bear Call Credit Spread
A bear call spread combines a short, lower strike price call and a long, higher
strike price call expiring the same month. It creates a credit and replaces 
a short call with unlimited risk. It’s best applied when implied volatility is
high and there are 30 or 45 days or less time to expiration. See Table 17-6 for
a summary of investment strategies and Figure 17-6 for an example of the

Straddle
A straddle combines a long call with a long put using the same strike price
and expiration. It’s created when volatility is low and expected to increase
and gains when prices moves strongly up or down. Because there are two
long options, exit the position with 30 to 45 days to expiration to avoid time
decay. See Table 17-7 for a summary of investment strategies and Figure 17-7

Chapter 18
Ten Do’s and Don’ts 
in Options Trading
In This Chapter
 Understanding what makes a trader successful
 Creating your success
T
rading is part art, part science. Developing as a trader begins with using 
a formula-type approach to the markets and different strategies. Skillfully
applying it as a seasoned pro requires practice, patience, and experience. It’s
a journey and one you ideally welcome.
Hopefully there are plenty of rules, steps, and concrete methods you can 
take away with you from this book. I genuinely hope I’ve also provided you
with some important nuances of trading . . . things that can’t quite be
mechanically applied. It seems the perfect point to focus on those here.
Do Focus on Managing Risk
Managing risk is the name of the game. In fact, when people ask you about
your trading and what you do, tell them you’re a risk manager. Become one
with it. Now if that isn’t nuance, I don’t know what is.
By just exploring option strategies you are actively addressing other financial
risks in your life. These include inflation risk, income risk, and even market
risk associated with buy and hold investing. 
When your trading is built on risk management you
 Understand the risks and rewards associated with the markets you trade
 Learn and test strategies before putting money on the line
 Create a plan that identifies trade sizes entry and exit approaches and
maximum loss allowed

 Identify how the plan will be implemented to honor your risk parameters
 Understand how to establish positions and manage a trade
 Have a plan for taking profits
 Ask yourself, ‘What if I’m wrong?’
Other more general risk considerations include diversifying sectors and
strategies traded. You may properly allocate trade sizes, but if you enter five
trending trades using the same strategy on stocks in the same sector, well
then, you’ve kind of gone against that trade sizing rule. That’s the nuance. By
extending these guidelines on a portfolio basis you’re acting more as an effec-
tive risk manager.
Don’t Avoid Losses
One way or another you will have losses in your trading. It’s not a beginner’s
trait; it’s simply a cost of doing business. As a matter of fact taking small
losses is a skill that’s developed by experienced traders. Try to get to that
level sooner than later.
Avoiding losses is a sure way to make them bigger. You can follow your rules
and see positive results with a series of small gains and losses, only to have
the slate wiped clean (and then some) with one big loss. It’s a discouraging
setback.
By shifting your view of what constitutes a successful trade from one that is
profitable to one that follows your rules, you’re on your way to true success.
Initially you can tell yourself to do this, but often you become a true believer
with experience. As this happens you become more committed to a 
rules-based approach and that’s when the shift occurs.
Do Trade with Discipline 
Trading with discipline means following your rules on each and every trade.
Not some of the time, or most of the time, but every time. Will you have a
perfect record on the discipline front? Probably not . . . somewhere along the
way your human emotions will get the better of you. If you lack discipline
early on and you’re fortunate enough to remain in the trading game, your 
discipline better continually improve. Otherwise it’s just a matter of time
before your luck will run out.
Unfortunately those experiencing initial success may delay an appreciation
and commitment to disciplined trading. Early success can give you a false
feeling of being right, which is not what trading is about.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Characteristics of trading with discipline on each trade include the following:
 Allocating a reasonable amount of money to a trade
 Identifying a maximum risk for the trade
 Identifying entry and exit signals 
 Executing an order when your plan requires it
Those are the checklist items, but trading with discipline goes beyond this.
Doing your homework, reviewing your trades, assessing your plan . . . I don’t
think I could create a comprehensive list. It’s about learning what you have to
do to trade successfully, mapping out how you’ll do it, and then putting it
into practice. 
Don’t Expect to Remove Your Emotions
Some traders assume that trading successfully means completely conquering
your greed and fear emotions. I’m here to tell you, when that day comes it
means you won’t have any emotions at all . . . definitely not a good thing.
Eliminating emotions when trading is not a reasonable goal; however, manag-
ing them is.
Things that can elevate emotions include:
 Trading using a discretionary approach
 Making trading decisions when the markets are open
 Using an underlying stock or sector that ‘owes’ you on a trade due to
previous losses
Ways to address these specific items include:
 Focusing on more systematic approaches
 Identifying an after-hours time for trade review and management 
 Stepping away from a specific stock or sector, even if you typically trade
with it successfully
There are even times when stepping away from trading for a period of time is
the best way to adjust your attitude and approaches.
Monitoring your emotions is the first step to managing them. Consider
adding a note to your trade management sheets to track them. Also note your
emotions during off-market hours . . . if you wake up cranky or even worse,
can’t get to sleep at night, your emotions are managing you.
325
Chapter 18: Ten Do’s and Don’ts in Options Trading

Do Have a Plan
Many Wall Street sayings have been around for awhile because they simply
remain true to form year after year. Other adages do as well including one
that fits perfectly here, ‘when you fail to plan, plan to fail’. 
Creating a base plan should definitely be considered a process rather than 
a one-time event. Think “draft” and start by writing an outline. Completing it
with an easily edited word processing document or spreadsheet may be
great, but if you feel you’re at the computer too much, a plain old piece of
paper and pen is fine. The old-fashioned approach allows you to jot notes
along the way without procrastinating because your computer is off. The
bottom line is, create something. 
When working on your first trading plan, set a timeframe for completion 
and re-visit it about three months later. This gives you a chance to kick 
the wheels, identifying what seems to be working and not working. It also
highlights what elements may be missing. Anticipate a second review about
six months later, and then get on a regular schedule that makes sense.
In addition to primary risk management elements, start incorporating items
such as general rules (i.e. buying low implied volatility options and selling
high implied volatility options when feasible) and the steps you’ll be taking to
accomplish this (i.e. reviewing historical and implied volatility charts and
checking implied volatility levels with an options calculator). 
Identifying other aspects of your trading job helps too (i.e. analyzing market
conditions for long-term investments separately from short-term trading) and
again, how you’ll be accomplishing this (i.e. monthly Saturday analysis for
investments, weekly Sunday analysis for trades).
Because both the markets and your personal situation change over time,
expect your trading plan to change as well. Better yet, plan on it.
Do Be Patient
Because so much emphasis is placed on managing risk and creating a plan,
you may feel a lot of pressure to create the “right” plan. Try to understand
that there’s almost always more at stake when there is no plan as opposed to
a plan that needs some work. 
Part of the trading plan process includes making adjustments to your rules.
That’s definitely something you do outside of market hours and is the result
of assessing strategy performance and works toward improving your overall
trading plan. It may mean increasing trade allocations or your stop loss 
percentages or trading fewer strategies at one time.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Your plan may be too aggressive or too conservative, but at least it serves as
a base for making adjustments. Will draft two be better? Probably, but chang-
ing market conditions could impact the effectiveness of your adjustments. It’s
okay; at some point you will have traded under a variety of conditions and
will have learned techniques to capitalize on them. It’s called experience and
it takes time.
Patience is not just for trading plans. Sometimes the best thing a trader can
do is nothing . . . waiting for the trade or waiting to take profits are useful
skills that can have a big impact on trading profitability.
Don’t Suffer Analysis to Paralysis
If you like playing around with numbers, the economy and financial markets
provide you with an endless supply of them. You could probably go years
seeking out relationships between different measures trying to obtain market
timing signals. Then you can backtest and forward test every existing 
indicator to see which ones give you the optimal trading signals. 
Paper trading it the whole time won’t necessarily get you any closer to suc-
cessfully trading. At some point you need to experience the markets where
you, the human trader, will respond differently when in a live trade. 
As mentioned, part of trading successfully means managing your emotions
not removing them. There’s another side to that, because there are also great
emotions and traits you bring to the trading table. Confidence becomes so
important when the market picture begins to get hazy — it’s what keeps you
following your reasonably tested rules. 
So the market with all its data can provide some interesting diversions, but it
does keep you from the task at hand. After all your learning, reviewing, test-
ing, practicing, and analyzing are done for a strategy, taking it live provides
experience that solidifies your understanding of it all. If it’s your first time
trading options, use limited risk strategies and proper trade sizes to gain that
experience. And if all goes well, you’ll also make some money along the way.
Do Take Responsibility for Your Results
Never, ever, ever shift any responsibility for your trading results on anyone 
or anything but you. Why put your success in someone else’s hands? It
makes it too elusive.
Along your trading career different situations or problems will certainly arise
that impact trade profitability. If there’s a problem with executions consider
327
Chapter 18: Ten Do’s and Don’ts in Options Trading

how you’re placing the orders and discuss it with your broker. If problems
persist, remedy it by shifting a portion of your assets to another broker and
measure those results. 
When you don’t have sufficient time for your standard analysis due to work
constraints, personal commitments . . . whatever, shift to strategies that you
do have time to do the right way. If there is still insufficient time, stepping
away from trading is your only responsible choice. Don’t worry, the markets
will still be there chugging away when you’re able to get to them. And when
you do, you will have preserved some assets for trading.
By always acknowledging the fact that you are responsible for your own
results, you seek out solutions faster and take control. You don’t have to wait
for someone else to take action or some event to occur. Doing this early in
the game helps you assert much greater command over your learning curve
and accelerates successful trading.
Don’t Stop Learning 
The changing nature of the markets make it almost impossible to avoid this
one. Because economic conditions, bullish and bearish phases for the market
and international markets never repeat themselves exactly, there’s always 
the opportunity to learn. 
There are a variety of analytical approaches to trading, and within each of
them a bigger variety of techniques and tools for you to explore. Add to the
mix new products periodically introduced, and you have your work cut out
for you.
There may seem to be a conflicting message here; I’ve suggested focusing on
a couple of strategies rather than taking on a variety of different approaches.
The goal there was strategy mastery and remains important. However, when
you’re on that path, a manageable number of new strategies should be
explored. Market conditions will simply dictate it. 
It’s helpful to have a game plan regarding continued education . . . especially
if you want to stay on good terms with your friends, family, work colleagues,
etc. (a.k.a. balance in your life). Here are some quick thoughts to help you
when creating yours: 
 When mastering strategies you’ll find topics you want to understand
better. Address those in a focused manner through self-study (books,
CDs, periodicals).
 Move on to additional analysis forms and strategies, through more
formal education if needed (live courses or via DVD, books manuals) or
self-study.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Start the year with general topic goals (i.e. learn two strategies and more
on technical analysis), along with more specifics (i.e. find strategies 
benefiting in sideways trending markets; better understand intermarket
analysis).
Most traders naturally continue learning because they gravitate toward
books, articles, news programs, conversations . . . dealing with the markets.
This is a perfect lead-in to my closing comment on what I believe is critical
for your success in trading . . . 
Do Love the Game
As with many other traders, I enjoy reading about the markets, trading and
other traders. When checking out discussions on traits of successful traders,
I see “loving the game” time and time again. Believe it. 
Primary drivers for successful traders include really enjoying the challenge 
of understanding the markets, applying the right approach and being disci-
plined. It’s not about getting even or making money for them. That’s partially
because you have to love something that requires such intense work –– not
necessarily long hours, but certainly focused ones. And in terms of making
money, that singular driver will eventually lead to large losses for most
traders. The long, practiced road for everyone else should be enjoyed.
There’s a chance you think you know what I mean, but I have a feeling you
know exactly what I mean. Be passionate about your trading and embrace 
its challenge. There’s a healthy excitement about this lifelong pursuit 
you’ve chosen.

backtest: Using historic data to generate trading signals so system perfor-
mance can be measured in the past. 
bear call spread: A vertical call spread created for a credit. It is a limited risk,
limited reward position that benefits from a bearish move in the underlying
stock. The long call has a higher strike price than the short call, minimizing
short-call risk.
bear put spread: A vertical put spread created for a debit. It is a limited risk,
limited reward position that benefits from a bearish move in the underlying
stock. The short put has a lower strike price than the long put, reducing the
long put cost.

booked order: An order that improves the current quote for a security and is
entered into the market by the market maker or specialist as the new best bid
or offer.

limited reward position that benefits from a bullish move in the underlying
stock. The short call has a higher strike price than the long call, reducing the
long-call price.

limited reward position that benefits from a bullish move in the underlying
stock. The long put has a lower strike price than the short put, minimizing
short-put risk. 
butterfly (long): A limited risk, limited reward strategy that combines the
same type option for a vertical debit spread and a vertical credit spread. It
benefits from sideways moves in the markets. The two short options in the

(body) and the long option strike prices are above (wing 1) and below (wing
2) the short strike price. 
calendar spread: A limited risk, potentially high- to unlimited-reward strategy
combining a short option with a long option of the same type that has the
same strike price and a later month expiration. The strategy benefits when a
volatility skew exists. Option analysis software is the best way to view a posi-
tion risk graph because the different expiration dates impact the risk-reward
profile.

underlying closes at the long call strike price at expiration. 
call ratio spread: An unlimited risk, limited reward strategy that includes a
long option plus a greater number of short options with a higher strike price,
expiring the same month. The position has high margin requirements due to
the uncovered short call(s) and is not recommended because other limited
risk strategies are available for the same market outlook.
