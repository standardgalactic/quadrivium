a Role in Executive Decision-Making

Executive Decision-Making
Executives and managers must make decisions in their work. Some of these decisions 
are made spontaneously, based on intuition, and others may need to apply data-driven 
approaches through analytics and Big Data. Intuition has a significant role in trust-
building in business (Parikh, Neubauer, & Lank, 1994; Burke & Miller, 1999; Hayes, 
Allinson, & Armstrong, 2004; Sadler-Smith & Shefy, 2004; Miller & Ireland, 2005; 
Dane & Pratt, 2007; Salas, Rosen, & Diaz Granados, 2010; Miles & Sadler-Smith, 
2014; Pretz & Liebowitz, 2016). By using intuition, for example, people can develop 
trust in themselves, which creates the foundations to develop trust to others. Many 
researchers and practitioners have explored the significance of trust in: the organiza-
tion (Cacioppo et al. 1984; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Lewicki & Bunker, 
1995; Bibb & Kourdi, 2004; Six, 2004; Sprenger, 2004; Paliszkiewicz, 2013), mar-
keting (Soh, Reid, & King, 2007; Lee & Rao, 2010; Cho, Huh, & Faber, 2014), 
social media (Paliszkiewicz & Koohang 2016), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
(Garbarino & Johnson, 1999; Gołuchowski & Losa-Jonczyk, 2013), and in knowl-
edge management processes especially in knowledge sharing and organizational per-
formance (Koohang, Paliszkiewicz, & Gołuchowski, 2017).
In this age of “Big Data,” knowledge gained from experiential learning may take 
a back seat to analytics. However, the use of intuition and trust in executive decision-
making should play an important role in the decision process. In fact, a KPMG 

x  ◾  Preface
(2016a) study found that just one-third of CEOs trust data analytics, mainly due 
to concerns about internal data quality. KPMG (2016b) in their second study also 
found that most business leaders believe in the value of using data and analytics, but 
say they lack confidence in their ability to measure the effectiveness and impact of 
data and analytics, and mistrust the analytics used to help drive decision-making. 
Unfortunately, in the data analytics community, intuition typically hasn’t been 
discussed in terms of its application in executive decision-making.
Trusting Your Intuition
In looking at some examples of the research in this area, Kandasamy et al. (2016) 
found that hedge fund traders who relied on their gut feelings outperformed those 
who didn’t. Wang, Highhouse, Lake, Petersen, and Rada (2017) found that intu-
ition and analysis are independent constructs, rather than opposite ends of a bipolar 
continuum. Liebowitz (2014) discusses both the research and application of apply-
ing intuition-based decision-making across various sectors. Hanlon (2011) discussed 
how managers rationalize intuition in their strategic decision-making. Usher, Russo, 
Weyers, Brauner, and Zakay (2011) demonstrate how intuition can be used in place of 
analytics for complex decision-making. Swami (2013) found that in situations involv-
ing higher time pressure, higher stakes, or increased ambiguities, experts may well use 
intuitive decision-making rather than structured approaches. Violino (2014) indi-
cates a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit and Applied Predictive Technologies 
that found nearly three-quarters of the executives surveyed say they trust their own 
intuition when it comes to decision-making, and 68 percent believe they would be 
trusted to make a decision that was not supported by data. Akinci and Sadler-Smith 
(2012) provide a thorough historical review of intuition in management research. 
Woiceshyn (2009) has shown that effective CEOs share three thinking-related traits: 
focus, motivation, and self-awareness. Moxley, Ericsson, Charness, and Krampe 
(2012) found that both experts and less skilled individuals benefit significantly from 
extra deliberation regardless of whether the problem is easy or difficult. According 
to Hassani, Abdi, and Jalali (2016), intuition is a way of learning and is a type of 
legitimate knowledge in nursing. Certainly, intuition-based decision-making is an 
increasingly popular topic among those in the Naturalistic Decision-Making, Fast 
and Frugal Heuristics, and Heuristics and Biases communities (Klein, 2015).
Intuition Surveys of Caribbean and 
U.S. C-Level Executives
To gain further insight into how executives may be using intuition, Liebowitz applied 
Pretz’s et al. (2014) Intuition Scale survey with two groups of C-level executives 
in 2016 during separate workshops. One group was Caribbean executives, and the 

Preface  ◾  xi
other group comprised U.S. executives. The Caribbean sample had 29 respondents; 
the U.S. sample had 27 respondents. Tables 1 and 2 show the results of the surveys.
Holistic intuitions are judgments based on a qualitatively non-analytical 
process. As the names imply, Holistic–Big Picture looks at the “big picture” view, 
and Holistic–Abstract looks more at the abstract view. Affective intuitions are 
judgments based mainly on emotional reactions to decision situations. Inferential 
intuitions are judgments based on automated inferences, decision-making processes 
that were once analytical but have become intuitive in practice (Pretz et al., 2014; 
Pretz & Liebowitz, 2016).
Table 1 shows the mean scores for each question for the Caribbean executives 
and for the U.S. executives. Generally speaking, the U.S. scores were higher, mean-
ing that their responses tended to fall more toward the neutral to true values versus 
those mean averages for the Caribbean executives. However, there were some inter-
esting exceptions. For example, the question about “Is it better to break a problem 
into parts than to focus on the big picture?” showed that the mean value for the 
Caribbean executives was higher than that for the U.S. executives, indicating that 
the Caribbean executives seemed to prefer logic to emotions. The U.S. executives 
indicated that they seemed to trust their intuition in their area of expertise more 
than the Caribbean executives.
Table 2 provides the mean values for the types of intuition based on Pretz 
et al. (2014). Based on Table 2, it appears that the U.S. executives have higher 
scores for each of the four types of intuition, as compared with those scores from 
the Caribbean executives. The U.S. executives have scores between neutral and 
mostly true, whereas the Caribbean executives have scores between mostly false and 
neutral. It appears that the U.S. executives generally have a more positive outlook in 
terms of their use of intuition in their decision-making. Of course, the sample sizes 
for this experiment were small (29 for the Caribbean executives; 27 for the U.S. 
executives), so it is difficult to generalize. However, this experiment might suggest 
future research looking at cultural issues in terms of how intuition plays a role in 
executive decision-making.

Using Intuition for Decision-Making
To get a sense for how those interested in data analytics view intuition in their 
decision-making, a web-based survey was sent to the attendees of the Third Data 
Analytics Summit held on March 9–10, 2017 at Harrisburg University of Science 
and Technology. Screenshots from the first 100 respondents are shown below. The 
results show that intuition is important, but certainly “rational intuition” may be 
the way to go for decision-making to back up one’s hunches with data and analysis. 
Of course, the sample was biased as most of the Data Analytics Summit attendees 
were data-driven oriented (see next page).
Improving Intuition Awareness for Executives
Intuition is something that can be honed. Through experiential learning and tech-
niques to further stimulate one’s intuitive sense, intuition can play an important 
role in executive decision-making. According to Davis-Floyd and Arvidson (1997), 
exercises have been used for many years to further develop one’s intuition. Even 
organizations have held training courses to instill a greater intuitive capacity in 
their employees. For example, the Marine Corps stresses intuition as a central key 
to victory. Bell Atlantic Corporation listed intuition as an important quality on job 
descriptions. Even among midwives, intuition is a salient course of authoritative 
knowledge (David-Floyd & Arvidson, 1997). Sadler-Smith and Shefy (2004) high-
light some practical guidelines to becoming an “intuitive executive.” They include 
(Sadler-Smith & Shefy, 2004):

When making decisions, I value my feelings
and hunches just as much as I value facts.

Preface  ◾  xix
Open the closet: To what extent do you: experience intuition; trust your feel-
ings; count on intuitive judgments; suppress hunches; covertly rely upon gut 
feel?
Don’t mix up your I’s: Instinct, insight, and intuition are not synonymous; 
practice distinguishing between your instincts, your insights, and your 
intuitions.
Elicit good feedback: Seek feedback on your intuitive judgments; build con-
fidence in your gut feel; create a learning environment in which you can 
develop better intuitive awareness.
Get a feel for your batting average: Benchmark your intuitions; get a sense 
for how reliable your hunches are; ask yourself how your intuitive judgment 
might be improved.
Use imagery: Use imagery rather than words; literally visualize potential future 
scenarios that take your gut feelings into account.
Play devil’s advocate: Test out intuitive judgments; raise objections to 
them; generate counterarguments; probe how robust gut feel is when 
challenged.
Capture and validate your intuitions: Create the inner state to give your intui-
tive mind the freedom to roam; capture your creative intuitions; log them 
before they are censored by rational analysis.
These suggestions may increase one’s intuitive awareness, as well as even doing 
meditation and introspection. There is also a “spirituality management” movement 
which suggests that decisions may be influenced from “on-high” (in this case, way 
above the CEO and Chairman of the Board).
Of course, even though this preface looks at intuition, analytics and trust 
should still be part of the winning formula for making sound executive decisions. 
The adage that “Intuition + Analytics + Trust = Success” should be a great combina-
tion for any kind of decision-making.
This preface advocates that intuition should not be disregarded when mak-
ing executive decisions. The knowledge management discipline shows us that 
experiential learning adds greatly to the innovation process. Analytics, as a data-
driven approach, can also add value and insights to the decision-making process. 
Unfortunately, the “Analytics” community and the “Judgment and Decision-
Making” community haven’t quite synergized. The hope is that this book, in 
­general, will provide reasons why these two communities should be united, along 
with those in the “Trust” community, to improve strategic decision-making in 
organizations and beyond.

4  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faith-
ful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has 
­forgotten the gift.
Albert Einstein
Understanding intuition puzzled many researchers. Only philosophers feel ­comfortable 
to think about intuition not only as legitimate, but also as a possibly superior form of 
knowledge (see, e.g., Bergson, 1911, 1946; Jung, 1921, § 770; Spinoza, 1677, Part 5). It 
was during this early stage of intuition research, that philosophy provided the basis for 
one of the most fundamental claims in the human studies; if we are to fully understand 
human consciousness, we must also understand intuition. In fact, as David Chalmers 
(1998, p. 110) argues, intuition is “the very raison d’être,” why we know so little about 
human consciousness. Thus, psychologists started to develop the so-called “dual pro-
cess theory” that later also found recognition within management and organization 
research. Although intuition has found its way into mainstream research, we cannot 
say that we have a widespread agreement about some fundamentals of intuition, that 
is, whether it can be ultimately reduced to firings of neurons, should it be regarded as a 
complex mental phenomenon, or whether we should regard it as something mystical.  
Of course, intuition is not fundamentally different from other mental phenomena, 
only due to its peculiar characteristics discussed below, the possibility of looking at it 
in different positions are more apparent. However, we believe that this lack of agree-
ment will not prevent scholarly attempts to understand intuition better. Currently, 
researchers with very different beliefs seem to be able to build on one another’s results, 
and work together in a joint endeavor to catch the essence of this particularly interest-
ing and beautiful mental phenomenon.
Even though intuition as a valuable decision-making tool used by managers, par-
ticularly top executives, was deemed reasonable, it was not before Chester Barnard 
(1938) published his seminal book The Functions of the Executive that exploring 
intuition started. Although Chester Barnard was a practitioner himself, his book 
has been widely accepted in academia, and in the field of intuition it marked the 
beginning of scholarly interests in intuition. The first academic inquiry regarding 
intuition was Herbert Simon’s work on Administrative Behavior (first edition pub-
lished 1947). This led to one of the most cited descriptions of intuition: “Intuition 
and judgment—at least good judgment—are simply analyses frozen into habit” 
(Simon, 1987, p. 63). This description was followed by the study by Weston Agor 
(1986), the first empirical research on managers’ intuition, in which he explored 
both successes and failures—this has a symbolic value, as it shows that those who 
argue for the importance of intuition are not blind to the failures of intuition.
In this chapter, we will portray intuition in the context of decision-making by 
combining understandings from a variety of areas and drawing on both practitio-
ners as well as academic sources. We limit, for the sake of understanding, intuition 
to consist of intuitive knowledge that is often accompanied by somatic and affec-
tive charges, thus ignoring the multipotential aspect of intuition and generally, 
cognition (see, e.g., Dörfler & Szendrey, 2008). We will establish a link between 

The Underpinnings of Intuition  ◾  5
intuition and different levels of expertise, but essentially, will focus on intuition at 
the ­highest level of expertise.
What Is Intuition?
Intuition isn’t the enemy, but the ally, of reason.
John Kord Lagemann
Perhaps the easiest way to conceptualize intuiting is to see it as a way of “direct 
knowing,” that is, knowing “without any use of conscious reasoning” (Sinclair & 
Ashkanasy, 2005, p. 357). Although this is not an all-encompassing explanation, most 
people seem to understand it intuitively, and thus we adopt it as our starting point. 
Direct knowing means that knowledge is not achieved by the step-by-step reasoning 
that typically characterizes the academic view of decision-making, but through a pro-
cess that somehow seems to bypass these steps. Usually, when a concept is so vague, 
such as intuition, we often contrast it with something, that is, explain it through what 
it is not. Thus, intuition is often contrasted with analysis or with rational methods. 
However, none of these contrasts seem to stand scrutiny. The opposite of analysis is 
not intuition but synthesis. It is true that intuition often entails synthesis, and this 
is the point where Mintzberg (1994) challenged Simon on his conceptualization of 
intuition as being “analysis frozen into habit,” arguing that intuition is about synthe-
sis, which one will never achieve through analyses. Yet, synthesis can also be achieved 
through step-by-step reasoning, not only by means of intuiting. Similarly, intuition 
sometimes seems to bypass the analytical steps, without necessarily providing syn-
thesis. However, unless we understand what happens when we intuit, we cannot be 
sure that there was no synthesis involved in the process of bypassing the steps of the 
analysis. It is also possible that bypassing the analytical steps happens by synthesizing 
these steps. As we will show later, rationality cannot be contrasted to intuition; on 
the one hand, the opposite of rational would be irrational, on the other hand, “ratio” 
means mind, so anything that comes from the mind is rational. Furthermore, we also 
know about many different forms of rationality, and some of these, such as Simon’s 
“bounded rationality” leave ample space for intuition. Within the dual process theo-
ries, intuition is sometimes labeled parallel in contrast with the sequential mode of 
reasoning but what we know is that intuition is nonsequential; we are unsure whether 
it is parallel or not. Daniel Kahneman’s (2011) recent work on fast and slow think-
ing seems to be to the point, although there are other ways of fast thinking beyond 
intuition, such as guessing. Due to limited knowledge and research, it seems that we 
will only discuss intuitive versus nonintuitive reasoning.
We distinguish between two kinds of intuition, these can be conceptualized 
as intuitive judgment and intuitive insight (see detailed argument in Dörfler  & 
Ackermann, 2012; Stierand  & Dörfler, 2016). Intuitive judgment is what we 
primarily associate with decision-making, more precisely, with a step in the 

6  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
­decision-making process, usually called choice or decision taking, which is con-
cerned with the evaluation of the decision alternative(s). Intuitive insight is, con-
versely, the intuition of the creatives; it is getting us to a solution to an ill-structured 
problem. It is important that it is about a solution rather than the solution, as a vari-
ety of new solutions can be created. However, intuitive insight may also appear in 
the decision-making process, only it is not associated with the decision taking phase 
but rather with creation (often mistakenly referred to as generation) of decision 
alternatives. However, in what follows, we primarily focus on intuitive judgment.
We want to emphasize that we do not argue for an exclusive use of intuition. 
What we expect to see in decision-making is a cycle of intuitive and nonintuitive 
steps, as described by Bergson (1911, 1946). Decision makers usually follow nonin-
tuitive reasoning as long as they can, that is, as long as there is more information to 
gather and more time to gather it. However, when time is pressing and information 
is scarce, decision takers use intuitive judgment. They need to get into a nonintuitive 
mode again, to develop an explanation that justifies their intuitive judgment. The 
process is similar in the case of creativity, for example, when creating decision alter-
natives (see more details in Dörfler & Eden, 2014). It is important that the nonintui-
tive explanation always follows a flash of intuition and, although it often provides a 
meaningful explanation or even justification for the intuitive outcome, it may or may 
not have anything to do with what happened in the process of intuiting. Recognizing 
the cycles of intuition and nonintuition gains further importance when we consider 
that, for a long time, it was assumed that intuitive and nonintuitive reasoning are 
on the opposite ends of a single dimension and consequently the same person could 
only be good at one of these. Recent research (Hodgkinson, Sadler-Smith, Sinclair, & 
Ashkanasy, 2009), however, suggests that these are two different dimensions. Thus, 
we argue that for good decision-making we need good intuition as well as good non-
intuition. The intuitive and the nonintuitive minds are friends, not foes.
Expert Intuition
[…] with talent and a great deal of involved experience, the beginner 
develops into an expert who intuitively sees what to do without recourse 
to rules nor to remembered cases.
Hubert Dreyfus
Our interest in intuition stems from a workshop in which one of us was involved 
with the board of executives of a large telecom company. As the importance of 
knowledge came up, it became clear that the board members only considered 
“textbook”-type knowledge, so we drew a quick schematic diagram about posi-
tioning intuition as a separate knowledge type (Dörfler Baracskai, Velencei, & 
Ackermann, 2011). While they quickly understood intuition as condensed exper-
tise (Weick, 1995, p. 88), it was difficult to explain that it is not simply about 

The Underpinnings of Intuition  ◾  7
experience, as experience does not automatically convert to expertise. In the words 
of Klein and Weick (2000, p. 19):
The only thing that the passage of time achieves is to move you closer 
to retirement or termination. Too often, we treat experience as a noun 
rather than as a verb, something to accumulate.
Hence, experience is indispensable but not enough to become an expert. What 
matters most is what we do with that experience—we need to learn from it to 
develop expertise. In line with Dane and Pratt (2009), we see expertise as a pre-
cursor to trustworthy intuition; this view in the literature is emphasized by terms, 
such as “intuition-as-expertise” (Sadler-Smith & Shefy, 2004), “intuitive exper-
tise” (Kahneman & Klein, 2009), or “expertise-based intuition” (Salas, Rosen, & 
DiazGranados, 2010).
The notion of expertise can also explain much of the disagreement in the man-
agement and organization studies field about the usefulness of intuition. If we take 
a closer look at those studies regarding the failure of intuition, (including Bowers, 
Regehr, Balthazard,  & Parker, 1990, p. 97; Schoemaker  & Russo, 1993, p. 27; 
Trailer & Morgan, 2004), we will usually find experiments targeted at intuitions of 
novices. Remarkably, we did not find a single instance where this was not the case. 
These experiments are typically, but not exclusively, conducted with students; for 
instance, Trailer and Morgan (2004) observed that undergraduate business school 
students made poor intuitive judgments in the field of physics. But, why would busi-
ness school students have intuition in physics? In contrast, those who have found 
empirical (usually not gained through experiments) evidence of intuition working 
well in their respective fields of interest (including Burke & Miller, 1999 in manage-
ment; Hayashi, 2001 in leadership; Keren, 1987 in the game of bridge), typically 
focused on intuition at high levels of expertise. Due to the relatively small number of 
studies providing empirical and experimental evidence about intuition in manage-
ment, our argument is not conclusive but we find it intuitively convincing.
The significance of expertise for intuition can also be approached from the 
opposite end, from the development of expertise. There are three key models, devel-
oped using different methodological approaches, that explain all levels of exper-
tise. The first was originally put forward by Simon and his various collaborators  
(e.g., Chase & Simon, 1973a,b; Gobet & Simon, 1996a,b, 2000), using an experimen-
tal approach. Then, the Dreyfus brothers developed their model using phenomenol-
ogy (e.g., Dreyfus, 2004; Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Kreisler & Dreyfus, 2005). Last, 
Dörfler, Baracskai, and Velencei (2009) presented a purely speculative model of exper-
tise levels. While these models have been developed using different methods, they 
are complementary and have a common touchpoint in acknowledging that intuiting 
becomes the dominant mode of knowing at the highest level of expertise.
Currently, there seems to be considerable agreements that intuition works well 
only at a high level of expertise (cf. Hogarth, 2001; Kahneman & Klein, 2009; 
Prietula & Simon, 1989; Salas, Rosen, & DiazGranados, 2010). Daniel Kahneman,

who pointed out numerous flaws of intuition, always deliberately focused on 
­commonsense-level intuition and criticized those painting a positive picture of 
intuition for not emphasizing that it is only intuition at a high level of expertise 
that works well—the intuition of experts he also finds useful.
The Process of Intuiting
Intuition is not something that is given. I’ve trained my intuition to 
accept as obvious shapes which were initially rejected as absurd […]
Benoit Mandelbrot
We are unsure what happens when we intuit, for “much current knowledge rests 
largely on researchers’ speculative arguments and abstract theorizations” (Sadler-
Smith, 2016). Little empirical research has been done to date, only a fraction of this 
is qualitative, and only a small part of that focuses on the subjective experience of 
intuiting. Therefore, what we present here is how we speculate about what happens 
when we intuit, using Polányi’s (1962, 1966a,b, 1983) work as our starting point 
(see Dörfler & Ackermann, 2012).
Polányi’s original argument is concerned with tacit knowing more generally, but 
it also works for intuiting. Let us consider exploring a room with a stick with our 
eyes closed. Initially, we would be paying attention to what we feel in our fingers, 
such as the vibrations of the stick, the angle under which it is inclined, changes of 
direction, etc. These feelings are the particulars in the process of tacit knowing, they 
take place on the near end of the stick ( proximal term), and they belong to the realm 
of subsidiary knowing. If we continue exploring the room a little longer, we will soon 
start picturing the room at the far end of the stick (distal term). Thus, our atten-
tion turns from the particulars to the whole, to the picture of the room that is still 
forming in our mind, and this whole is what we focus on, thus we label it as focal 
knowing. The process of tacit knowing is then an integration process, in which the 
particulars are integrated into the whole and the particulars seem to be dissolved in 
this process. Initially, some particulars will likely belong to the tacit realm, others 
to the explicit, but the integration process is tacit, and as soon as the focal whole 
emerges, we lose awareness of the particulars. We cannot tell anymore about the 
feeling in our palm, we can only tell how we picture the room (Figure 1.1).
The above example was perhaps not what immediately comes to mind when 
thinking of intuition, but has the advantage of having the particulars and the whole 
on the two different ends of the stick and thus we find it useful to start with. 
However, recognizing a face or writing a poem can be described in a very similar 
way. We could tell some characteristics of a face we recognize, before the actual 
recognition happens, and we can know the rules of grammar, letters, and so on, 
when writing a poem. However, when we are in the process of recognizing the face 
or writing the poem, we will have no idea which facial characteristics we have seen 

The Underpinnings of Intuition  ◾  9
when the recognition took place or which rules of grammar we have used when the 
poem was written. What is interesting is that if we describe the facial characteristics 
of someone we have not seen for many years, we will recognize the face even if the 
characteristics we described beforehand have changed; we may not even notice that 
those characteristics have changed. Hence, we frequently don’t even know what 
particulars we use to recognize the focal whole.
Although some would question whether recognizing a face or writing a poem 
qualifies for intuition, the process of intuiting works the same way in the case of 
intuitive judgments as well. The particulars would include our explicit expectations 
and the information we have about the decision alternatives but can also include 
things we may have no idea about, such as a move or a look of our negotiating 
partner. When we make the choice, we will not know what particulars we used. If 
we come up with an ex post explanation, that may or may not have anything to do 
with how we made that choice.
We are confident that the above description of the process of intuiting holds, 
but we could not say that it is particularly detailed. Although further empirical 
studies, particularly firsthand accounts of intuitions, may shed further light on 
some details, we must expect that we may never have a good and detailed descrip-
tion of the process of intuiting. However, good descriptions or models do not make 
for good intuition. The expertise of the person does.
Features of Intuition
Intuition is what you know for sure without knowing for certain.
Weston Agor
What makes distinguishing intuitive from nonintuitive reasoning so difficult is 
that there is no single characteristic along which this contrast can be made. In this 
section, we provide a set of six characteristics. These together can do the job; all six 
are necessary for identifying intuition, and if any one of them is missing, then it is 
something else occurring (cf. Dane & Pratt, 2007; Dörfler & Ackermann, 2012;

10  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Kahneman, 2003, p. 698; Sadler-Smith, 2008, p. 13). Three of these refer to the 
process of intuiting, and three to the outcome of this process that we call intuition 
and have conceptualized earlier as intuitive knowledge.
Intuiting Is Instantaneous or, at Least, Very-Very Fast
In this respect, it is similar to guessing, however, it is guessing which is “frequently 
correct” (in line with Simon, 1983, p. 25). This speed of intuiting is particularly 
important today, when the time pressure is constant. As Handy (1995, p. 49) puts 
it, “[b]y the time you know where you ought to go, it’s too late to go there.” But 
how is intuiting so rapid? Per Prietula and Simon (1989, pp. 121–122), intuiting is a 
leap by which the expert bypasses the analytical steps and overcomes limitations of 
attention and of memory (both short-term memory [STM] and long-term memory 
[LTM]). We become aware of the right answer before consciously realizing it and 
without having to analyze everything simply by relying on our experience (Klein & 
Weick, 2000). This pattern recognition that helps bypass the steps of deliberate 
reasoning are not limited to situations the decision maker already knows. Expert 
decision makers will recognize patterns in new situations, not only in situations 
with which they are already familiar. This means that we should understand the 
patterns as particulars that are integrated in the whole in the process of intuiting, 
and this whole may be something we see for the first time.
Intuiting Is Spontaneous
Spontaneity means that intuiting does not require effort, at least at the moment 
when it happens (cf. Agor, 1984, p. 75). However, this also means that intuition 
cannot be produced at will (Isaack, 1978, p. 918). This does not mean that the 
decision makers just need to lay back and wait for intuition to arrive; hard work is 
needed beforehand, and then the intuiting happens in this relaxed state (for numer-
ous examples, see Hadamard, 1954). The work needed for good intuition is not 
limited to the work on a problem; it includes all the previous work in the discipline 
or in the problem area and has a strong link to the level of expertise (Prietula & 
Simon, 1989). This means that intuiting brings together everything we have experi-
enced in our field in various contexts and can have bearing on the decision situation 
at hand (cf. Rowan, 1986, p. 83). In terms of the intuiting process, we could say 
that the person can only integrate the particulars they have, and that involves all 
their knowledge in the discipline, in the problem area and about the context.
Intuiting Is Alogical
The terminology to describe this feature of intuiting is slightly different in every 
case: Kahneman and Tversky (1982, p. 124) describe it as “an informal and 
unstructured mode of reasoning, without the use of analytic methods or deliberate 

The Underpinnings of Intuition  ◾  11
calculation,” Barnard (1938, p. 301 ff) calls it a “nonlogical” process to ­contrast 
it to the logical process of reasoning, etc. However, the message is the same  
every time; intuiting operates independently of the general principles of reasoning 
that Russell (1946, p. 379) calls logic. We call this mode of reasoning ­alogical, 
meaning that it neither follows (logical) nor contradicts (illogical) the rules of logic. 
For similar reasons, we can describe intuiting as arational, meaning that it is not 
rational or irrational, simply independent from the rules of rationality. It is impor-
tant to note that qualifying intuiting as alogical does not tell us anything about 
its modus operandi, we only know what it is not. The question is whether we will 
ever discover some set of rules that intuition seems to follow. We believe that it is 
likely that we will not, as the particulars are of very personal natures, embracing 
apart from the accepted knowledge in the discipline and in the problem area also 
the subjective aspects of these as well as of the current context and also the personal 
history of the person. However, we agree with Simon (1987, p. 61) that “… intuition 
is not a process that operates independently of analysis; rather, the two processes are 
essential complementary components of effective decision making systems.”
Intuition Is Gestalt or a Holistic Hunch
Intuition is gestalt or a holistic hunch as mentioned by Beveridge et al. (Beveridge, 
1957, p. 73; Hayashi, 2001, p. 64; Miller & Ireland, 2005; Morris, 1967, p. 158; 
Sinclair & Ashkanasy, 2005, p. 357). This insight means two things. On the one 
hand, intuition is about the “big picture” of the decision situation, including the 
broad context, far reaching implications (and the implications of the implications, 
etc.) that are usually not considered in step-by-step reasoning, as the probabili-
ties would be considered very low. The decision situation also considers what we 
could call “invisible parts” that are inaccessible to deliberate step-by-step reasoning, 
which are sometimes referred to as the unknown unknowns. On the other hand, 
intuition also involves the totality of the person. This view is also fully in harmony 
with how the Dreyfus brothers (see “Expert Intuition” section) described the high-
est level of expertise, that is, that the totality of the situation is intuitively perceived 
and the response involves the complete personality in an intuitive response. This 
does not mean, however, that intuition needs to be vague. Intuition is about the 
“essence;” it means seeing the “big picture” as well as the relevant details, and being 
able to quickly switch between the two (Dörfler & Eden, 2014). Thus, the (expert) 
person will be able to see which detail needs to be changed, as well as how this will 
affect the big picture.
Intuition Is Tacit
Hayashi (2001, p. 60) asserts, based on numerous interviews, that top executives 
cannot describe the process of intuiting much beyond labeling it “professional 
judgment,” “intuition,” “gut instinct,” “inner voice,” or “a hunch.” Dane and Pratt 

12  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
(2007, p. 36) therefore characterize intuition as nonconscious, meaning that the 
outcomes of intuiting are accessible to conscious thinking, but how one arrives at 
them is not. On the one hand, this seems sensible based on how we described the 
process of intuiting in the previous section. On the other hand, tacitness is very 
difficult to accept for the schooled mind, as our schools educate us to require sound 
reasoning or even proof for our choices. However, this is only as we are focusing 
on the wrong side of the schooling when we think about decision-making, on the 
mathematical mind. In the arts, if we paint a picture or write a poem, we are not 
required to provide a justification for why we see things in a certain way. So, we are 
back to Barnard’s point of talking about the “executive arts.” If we want to make 
use of our intuition, we must accept that it is tacit. This, however, does not mean 
that we cannot provide a nonintuitive justification that explains why the intuitive 
judgment makes sense, only we need to know that this explanation is likely, not 
how we arrived at the intuitive judgment—and that we will never know how we 
arrived at it. Thus, we can say that the tacit nature of intuition is an additional rea-
son for why we need intuition and nonintuition to work in cycles.
Intuitors Are Confident about Their Intuitions
The explanations discussed under the previous section serve to make others accept 
the intuitor’s judgment—the intuitors usually do not need justification. Jung (1921, 
§ 770) distinguished four psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and 
intuition. He emphasizes that intuitive knowledge “possesses an intrinsic certainty 
and conviction.” This certainty is one of the most commonly described features of 
intuition emphasized by both decision makers and great scientists. One of the most 
often quoted examples is Poincaré’s story (e.g., Damasio, 1994; Goldberg, 1983b; 
Hadamard, 1954; Polányi & Prosch, 1977; Vaughan, 1979); likely because it is 
striking that his intuition “told him” the opposite of what he was trying to prove 
previously and later he proved this opposite. It is important to note that the built-in 
feeling of certainty of intuitive knowledge does not mean that intuition is infallible. 
Sadler-Smith (2008, p. 28) quotes critiques of intuition saying that “intuition is 
sometimes wrong but never in doubt.” No one claims that nonintuitive reasoning 
is always correct. We also must not expect this from intuition. However, when it 
is the nonintuitive reasoning that fails us, this is easier to accept, as we simply did 
some steps that can be checked afterwards, and it is relatively easy to blame the 
failure to something external. However, if intuition is tacit and we don’t have much 
to go on than saying that “I feel confident that I am right” and then we find that 
we were wrong, we can only blame ourselves. Not to mention, others will blame us 
as well. However, if we also know that intuition is not infallible, we have a good 
starting point for our intuitive endeavors.
There are two further things that are mentioned as features of intuition/ 
intuiting. The first are the somatic effects, the second are the affective charges. 
Bodily feelings (somatic effects) are often associated with intuition, as this seems to 

The Underpinnings of Intuition  ◾  13
be part of the language of how our intuitions speak to us. Expressions such as “gut 
feeling,” “butterflies in the stomach,” and similar are not simply metaphors; many 
intuitors have their somatic effects tell them that they have arrived at an intuitive 
judgment. We do not consider the somatic effects as features of intuition, as there 
seem to be a great variety, and they do not seem to be a necessary aspect of intuition 
and nonintuitive judgments may also be accompanied with somatic effects. We can 
also hear that intuitions are accompanied with emotional effects. Decision makers 
often seem to be married to their intuitive judgments. Most authors, however, are 
very cautious about the affective charges, and usually we can read that intuitions 
are “often affectively charged,” suggesting that this may not always be the case. 
We will probably learn more about this, considering that intuition research is still 
in its infancy. However, we have seen decision makers married to their statistics 
tables, feasibility studies, and pie charts. Therefore, we do not consider emotions to 
be a necessary feature of intuition, but if we notice emotions we are more likely to 
expect intuition.
Enhancing Intuition
[…] the methods of scientific inquiry cannot be explicitly formulated 
and hence can be transmitted only in the same ways as an art, by the 
affiliation of apprentices to a master.
Michael Polányi
From what we have said so far about intuition, we believe there is no doubt about 
the importance of intuition for expert decision makers. However, based on the 
process and features of intuition, it does not seem straightforward that one can 
become better at intuiting. We have shown that at a high level of expertise intuition 
becomes the dominant mode of knowing. Similarly, we have shown that reliable 
intuition is only available at high level of expertise. Therefore, it is probably clear 
that becoming more knowledgeable in a particular knowledge domain helps in bet-
tering intuition. We could consider this to be a generic way of enhancing intuition. 
The second group would include direct ways of enhancing intuition, meaning that 
these ways would focus on directly making intuition better. These direct ways often 
involve various mental exercises that the intuitors can perform themselves or in 
groups with or without supervision. There is, however, one direct way of enhancing 
intuition that stands out: the master-apprentice relationship. The third group of 
intuition enhancement ways we call indirect ways, as their focus is not on intuition 
itself, but something that relates to or interacts with intuition, namely the context 
of the intuitor, the awareness of intuition and the action taken based on intuition. 
In this section, we do not engage in the generic way, as that could include every-
thing that we know about learning. We also do not tackle most of the direct ways,  

14  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
as the academic basis of these are not particularly elaborate. The exception is the 
master-apprentice relationship, which we briefly describe, as it stands out both 
in its significance as well as how much we know about it. We also provide brief 
­description of the indirect ways.
The Master-Apprentice Relationship
The master-apprentice relationship is a widely accepted mode of achieving the 
highest level of expertise, and we have explored it at length elsewhere. (Baracskai, 
Dörfler,  & Velencei, 2005; Dörfler  & Eden, 2014; Dörfler  & Stierand, 2009; 
Stierand, 2015) We have argued that it seems to be the only known way of passing 
on tacit knowledge, and thus the only direct way of learning intuition from some-
one else. The essence of the master-apprentice relationship is that it is wrong to 
follow and to abandon the master’s way; however, from this struggle, a new master 
emerges. What happens in regarding intuition is best expressed by Polányi (1966a, 
p. 14): “A novice, trying to understand the skill of a master, will seek mentally to 
combine his movements to the pattern to which the master combines them practi-
cally.” So, the apprentice is watching the master using her/his intuition, perhaps 
asking questions about it, and then will apply what Polányi (1946) termed “intel-
ligent imitation”—which is imitation that is adapted to personality, context, and 
problem. Of course, the master provides feedback on the apprentice’s intuition and 
the apprentice gradually evolves into a master.
Creating an Intuition-Friendly Environment
It is often emphasized in the literature, as well as in personal communication with 
intuitive people, that they need to hide the intuitive origins of their achievements 
and provide a post-rationalized well-structured argument instead. Such environ-
ments discourage the use of intuition. Therefore, creating intuition-friendly envi-
ronments at personal, interpersonal and organizational levels can make a great deal 
of difference. At a personal level, this means putting our minds in a state where 
they are more open to intuition and accepting intuition. For example, it is well 
documented that reading poetry; enjoying art, music, or extreme sports; sitting in 
the woods or consuming “philosophical food” (Agor, 1984, p. 75) can help liberate 
the mind from “uninspiring” problems and may foster intuitive and creative ways 
of thinking. The interpersonal context means people who accept intuition as a valid 
form of knowledge can discuss it with the intuitor. Sadler-Smith and Shefy (2007), 
for instance, emphasize the importance of promoting the development of intu-
ition through feedback. Finally, in an intuition-friendly organizational context it is 
acceptable to admit to using intuition, which does not mean that an argument does 
not need to be provided to substantiate the intuitive judgment. However, those who 
proved themselves as good intuitors may gradually enjoy benefits of providing the 

The Underpinnings of Intuition  ◾  15
argument later or not at all. This is particularly important for ­organizations in a 
turbulent environment, when the response time is of crucial importance.
Increasing Awareness of Intuition
Experienced intuitors are usually good at recognizing and interpreting their intu-
itions. However, those who just rely on their intuitions often fail to notice or find 
it difficult to distinguish intuition from other phenomena, including hopes and 
fears, that may have similar somatic and affective characteristics. Knowing our 
bodies and emotions is very important in this sense. Personal level self-observation, 
reflection and keeping diaries can help to know your body and mind (Cartwright, 
2004; Goldberg, 1983a, pp. 193–194; Vaughan, 1979, p. 205). At an interpersonal 
level discussing intuitive experiences with peers and persons of trust can be helpful 
(e.g., Agor, 1984, p. 66). At an organizational level, we can only be supportive of 
the use as well as development of intuition; not only in terms of the above noted 
techniques, but also by supporting master-apprentice relationships.
Acting upon Intuition
Creating a supportive environment is likely to help intuition occur, better awareness 
will help to notice and understand intuitive leaps, but then we also need to act upon 
intuition. When the intuition happens, a person should not delay the action. We 
should think it through again, check by means of structured step-by-step reasoning 
“just in case” and so forth. If intuition is not followed by action, we will never know 
whether it has worked in the first place. There are no techniques suggested explicitly 
for improving how we can act upon intuition but many of the previously mentioned 
techniques also support action. Reflecting helps learning from previous actions and 
poetry, art, and philosophy may help to achieve an actionable mindset. Discussing 
it with peers provides examples as well as feedback. An organizational environment 
that supports intuition also supports acting upon it; most importantly, it does not 
sanction severely when intuition led to bad outcome through action. Of course, 
intuition is not always right, and neither is the nonintuitive step-by-step reasoning. 
While we cannot allow poor outcomes all the time, in the case of nonintuitive step-
by-step reasoning people are not usually penalized for a single failure—intuitors 
should be treated the same.
While we cannot simply set up courses or read a couple of books to increase 
our intuition, we wanted to show that there is much that we can do to support the 
development of intuition. Several of these things are not unique to intuition and 
not so alien to our culture, such as peer discussions, reflection and reflexivity, the 
master-apprentice relationship, etc. We make huge efforts to improve our nonintui-
tive step-by-step reasoning capabilities—if we do as much for intuition, it should 
be sufficient.

16  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Is Intuition Mystical?
I propose that the goal of science is to make the wonderful and the 
complex understandable and simple—but not less wonderful.
Herbert Simon
Having gone through the process of polishing the initial picture about intuition 
from various perspectives, we return to the initial question: Is intuition mystical? 
Lieberman (2000, p. 109) suggests that intuition is at best regarded as mysterious 
and unexplainable. To the contrary, Davenport and Prusak (2000, p. 11) argue: “We 
arrive at an answer intuitively, without knowing how we got there. That does not 
mean the steps not to exist—intuition is not mystical. It means we have thoroughly 
learned the steps that they happen automatically, without conscious thought, and 
therefore at great speed.”
Our answer is somewhere in-between these two. We believe that it is useful to 
try to understand intuition in the academic sense of the word. However, as intuit-
ing happens almost instantaneously and intuition is tacit, there is a limit to this. 
We agree with Isaack (1978, p. 919) that “intellect cannot completely understand 
the intuition since the artificial tools, preconceived categories, and symbols used 
by the intellect only represent reality and are not the substance of reality.” However, 
this should not stop us from trying to understand intuition. We need intuition to 
make sense of intuition.

Human behavior flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and 
knowledge.
Plato
Introduction
Freud stated that his work on the subconscious was a third outrage to humanity’s 
self-esteem (Freud & Strachey, 1977). First, Copernicus had shown that humans 
were not located at the center of the universe. Then, Darwin had shown that 
humans had not been specially created outside of the animal world. Finally, Freud 
showed that humans were not masters in their own mind. While there is not much 
scientific content to take away from Freud’s work, this insight is still relevant in 
some sense to understand the progress of our understanding of the human mind. 
This progress has followed a dialectical path with opposite views replacing each 
other over time.
Historically, the strength of the human mind has long been associated with 
its ability to engage in rational thinking, the conscious use of abstract reasoning 
to solve. Intuitions, emotions and subconscious processes were viewed as dangers 
to our rational minds. The rational action theory, which was, until recently, at the 
core of the economic science, was in perfect harmony with such a vision. Since its 
inception in the early twentieth century, this theory was purposely built without 
psychology content. However, in the second part of the century, psychologists led 
a scientific offensive against this paradigm, showing all the psychological flaws of 
the human mind, grounded in subconscious processes, emotions, and automatic 
responses. The “heuristic and biases” paradigm accumulated evidence about failures 
of human decision-making processes. To the perfect rational actor from econom-
ics, it substituted a worrying picture of an individual without consistent motives 
and without coherent decisions processes to achieve his goals. In some ways, this 
paradigm was pushing a humbling view of human consciousness echoing Freud’s 
remark. Unlike the naïve optimism of the rational action model, psychologists were 
suggesting that humans are quite hopeless at what they are doing, and that they are 
oblivious to this hopelessness.
As often in science, progress leads to going beyond oppositions between dif-
ferent views. New evidence from economics, psychology, and neuroscience point 
to a vision of the human mind which takes both from the rational action theory 
and from the role of subconscious processes. In this chapter, I will argue that the 
present evidence suggests seeing intuitions/subconscious processes and conscious 
rationality as complementing aspects of our cognition, designed to help us make 
good decisions in a complex environment. The question for the modern decision 
maker is not how to rely purely on intuitions/feelings or on analytical rationality, it 
is how to tap into these two elements to make the best decisions.

From Cold Rationality to Human Imperfection
Economics is at the heart of behavioral science. From its etymology oikono-
mos, the management of the household, economics is the science of decisions 
to allocate resources to competing uses—like consumption and production.  
Arguably, economics is one of the most formal and unified disciplines of the behav-
ioral sciences (Gintis, 2007). When compared to psychology or sociology, econom-
ics is characterized by a unified conceptual framework based on shared assumptions 
upon which formal models are built.
The formalism of the economic approach sets it apart from other behavioral 
disciplines. Perhaps the formal and quantitative nature of economics originates in 
the fact that economic is about making the best decisions with measurable quanti-
ties (e.g., working time, money, goods). In any case, the discipline followed a very 
distinct path to other behavioral sciences. From the beginning of twentieth century 
onwards, economics expelled psychology from its core theories to develop a study 
of economic decision based on rational decision makers (Bruni & Sugden, 2007).
The idea was very much in tune with the positivist argument that science should 
only focus on what is observable (Hahn, Neurath, & Carnap, 1996). The human 
psyche was not observable and should therefore be left outside of the realm of 
the scientific inquiry about economic decisions. Economists would look at people’s 
choices. The empirical study of what drives people’s preferences was left to other 
disciplines such as psychology. Economists instead opted to make minimal behav-
ioral assumptions considered so reasonable that they could be called axioms (i.e., 
evidently true). Specifically, economists “only” assumed that people have prefer-
ences over goods (they know what they want) and that whatever these preferences, 
they are consistent in some simple ways (not self-contradictory).
From that starting point, formal mathematical methods could be used to deter-
mine what would be the best decisions for an agent given his preferences. Whether 
this approach was normative (describing what agents should do) or positive (describ-
ing what agents do) was not always clear. The models unveiled the best decisions 
of rational agents, so surely they were normative in the sense that deviating from 
these models’ predictions would be worse in some sense. But models also became 
considered as ways of describing actual behavior, partly due to the fact that it was 
the only way economists knew to investigate behavior. 
The lines between the positive and normative nature of economic models of 
behavior were blurry. Many economists had a pragmatic approach, saying that 
models had the merit to exist and that a model is better than no model. Surely, 
human behavior was not as perfect as modeled but if deviations were minor, models 
offered a good approximation. At the same time, many economists adopted a more 
positive approach. Models were based on reasonable principles of rationality which 
would have been strange for people not to respect. Hence, economics was describ-
ing the actual behavior of decision makers (Stigler & Becker, 1977).

24  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
To those outside of economics, the decision maker described by economics text-
books was however strange and strikingly different from the common experience. It 
was a person who knew what he/she wanted without doubting about his/her prefer-
ences, could plan well ahead to reach his/her goals, could interpret complex signals 
accurately to form accurate beliefs, and could engage in complex computations to 
find out optimal solutions to his/her problems. This person was the perfect image 
of cold rationality.
In the second part of the twentieth century, a growing amount of work by psy-
chologists and experimental economists pointed to a range of problems with this 
model of human behavior. Placed in controlled behavioral experiments, humans do 
not excel at computations; they often misinterpret noisy signals leading to distorted 
beliefs, and they can fail to stick to their plans leading to inconsistent choices over 
time. Even more worrying, it appeared that humans do not respect one of the basic 
principles of rationality, the coherence of preferences, (Kahneman, 2012).
This work, led by psychologists such as Kahneman and Tversky, eventually formed 
the foundations of the behavioral revolution in economics. A huge amount of empiri-
cal evidence was accumulated showing a radically different view of humans as imper-
fect and biased decision makers. While homo economicus was the image of a perfect 
rational decision maker, homo behavioralis was a seriously impaired one. His prefer-
ences were often incoherent or just made up on the fly, his beliefs were distorted in 
many systematic ways, and his decision processes were slow and prone to errors.
However, paradoxically, this part of the behavioral revolution had kept something 
from the old economics textbooks. While it had rejected homo economicus as a positive 
theory describing how people make decisions in the real world, it kept it as a normative 
theory of how people should behave if they want to make good decisions. In this behav-
ioral approach, deviations from the standard model are “biases,” which lead people to 
make costly mistakes. The ability of humans to reasons (so-called system 2) must be used 
to correct mistakes from our intuitions (coming from the so-called system 1) (Kahneman, 
2003, “A Perspective on Judgment and Choice: Mapping Bounded Reality”).
In some way, at the heart of this approach, the traditional figure of cold ratio-
nality as an ideal is still present; an ideal which is not reached by real humans. In 
that view, decision makers need supporting tools to help make their decisions more 
rational/optimal, less influenced by their flawed psychology.
Heuristics as Adaptive But Cold Rationality Not Useful
In addition to the “heuristics and biases” approach from Kahneman and Tversky, 
another one in psychology proposed a radically different view about human decision-
making. The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer argued that heuristics, the psychological 
rules of thumb human use in their everyday life (instead of the complex computa-
tions assumed by the homo economicus model), are simple rules that make us smart 
(Gigerenzer, 2000). They are cognitive shortcuts that allow us to find quick solutions 
that are good enough in many situations in the complex environment we live in.

Intuition as a Complement to Analytics  ◾  25
A key argument at the heart of Gigerenzer’s view is the idea that problems to 
solve in the real world are incredibly complex—so complex as to be de facto out of 
bounds for reasonable computational abilities within a limited time frame. From 
that point of view, the idea that decision makers could find the “optimal solution” 
is naïve. Many problems that economic decision makers face are “computationally 
hard,” in that there is no algorithm to solve the problem whose computational time 
grows as a polynomial function of the size of the problem. Problems as mundane 
as selecting the best basket of goods in a supermarket for a given budget limit are 
computationally hard. While it may be easy to find a good enough solution, finding 
the optimal solution to such problems can require enormous computational effort.
To understand how decision makers live in such a complex world, the concept of a 
perfect Spock-like decision maker can be a misleading role model. Instead of idealizing 
cold rationality, one may want to understand how people make good decisions in the 
real world. As the outcome of eons of time of evolution, humans cannot be entirely 
flawed decision makers. It is more likely that the features of their decision-making 
processes are adaptive solutions to the problems they face.
A key aspect of this approach was not to dispel aspects of human psychology 
that do not fit with the model of cold rationality. Gigerenzer defended that things 
like emotions, intuitions and gut feelings should be appraised positively for the role 
they play in human decision-making. By providing ready-made answers, heuristics, 
in complex situations, can help humans reach ecological rationality: making good 
decisions in the context of the real world.
The influential research in neuroscience from Antonio Damasio has given further 
weight to such a view. It has shown that cold rationality is not the key to good decisions 
with emotions potentially leading us astray. Instead, emotions are the key to decision-
making (Damasio, 2006). A huge amount of information about the surrounding 
world is processed automatically by brain processes producing ­positive/negative values 
as output to help making decisions. These emotions/intuitions are positive/negative 
feelings that are not brought to the fore of consciousness in many situations. They are, 
however, essential to allow us to make even the simplest decisions. Some patients with 
damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex can lose the coupling of bodily arousal 
with decisions (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994). They can maintain 
normal intellect and can make rational judgments, but become unable to make mun-
dane choices such as picking a variety of potatoes in the supermarket. While humans 
with a fully functioning brain would quickly get a feeling for the best option and 
pick it often without thinking about it, these persons will not feel anything. While 
being able to describe all the characteristics of the options (e.g., shape, price) and the 
intended use (e.g., soup), they will feel blank about which option is best. Without emo-
tions, they are literally stuck in the allegorical positions of Buridan’s donkey who dies 
of hunger and thirst while being placed at equal distance of food and water.
Since Damasio’s contribution, the progress in neuroscience has pointed to the large 
amount of computations made by the brain beyond consciousness (Montague, 2007). 
The key role of a brain is to make decisions, as only decisions have in the end an impact 

26  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
on the individual’s fitness. Decisions require assessment of the different options avail-
able and their value. Behind most simple choices, the human brain is processing a large 
amount of new information to assess quickly the best option to pick.
The challenge is that the sheer quantity of information to process is too large 
to be extensively processed. Consider a simple walk in the supermarket. The brain 
must process rich visual information about the surrounding topography; the iden-
tity of a wide range of goods, and the presence of other human beings and moving 
objects (carts). It will also have to integrate this information with auditory informa-
tion containing background noises, voices of other surrounding human beings, and 
background music or supermarket announcements. This information is nowhere 
near enough to make decisions. Just to decide where to go in the supermarket, the 
human brain must form a goal about what is needed in relation to stated goals (e.g., 
dinner). It must decide what path is the best to get there, and must interpret the 
intentions of other humans moving around from observing them, to avoid bump-
ing into them. It has then to look at similar goods and assess which one is the 
most likely to fit the intended use for a low price. To appreciate the complexity of 
the amount of information a human brain must handle to solve such a task that 
is almost second nature to us, one can observe that despite having computers with 
tremendous computational power, we are still not able to design robots that carry 
mundane human activities.
Given the amount of information to process, a key ingredient is optimally allo-
cating cognitive resources to solve the problem at hand. It is achieved by heavily 
relying on memory. From all of our experiences with the outside world, we have 
built an internal model of it which we do not need to update. Any new stimulus 
fitting this model do not have to be re-interpreted and only deviations from all 
our expectations need to be processed. In that way, our brain can focus on just a 
thin slice of reality to make decisions (Gladwell, 2007). Going back to our super-
market example, as we walk in the aisles we do not need to consider the informa-
tion from all our visual stimuli to consider whether the objects pushed around by 
other shoppers are carts. The visual features of these objects are quickly associated 
with known visual patterns associated with carts, which are expected in this envi-
ronment. Consequently, our visual information about these carts can be largely 
ignored for our attention to focus on the question for which we do not have an easy 
solution: what we should get for dinner.
In some ways, the voice in our head is an illusory representation of our self. 
David Eagleman compares it to the CEO of a big company who believes he is mak-
ing all the decisions in the company (Eagleman, 2011). The reality is that a large 
company requires a huge number of decisions be carried out at a lower level than 
the CEO, because they cannot handle everything. For tough decisions, the CEO’s 
decisions are required to make a call. He/she receives technical reports and advice 
from experts in the company recommending consideration of the value of different 
options. As the CEO decides, most of the data analysis is already completed before 
he has even looked at the reports.

Intuition as a Complement to Analytics  ◾  27
This metaphor is quite handy. The CEO’s time is restricted and thus should only 
be used to solve complex/new situations; while lower divisions should solve easy/
usual problems. In the same way, our ability to process information consciously 
is much more limited than our ability to do it unconsciously. The reason seems 
to be that while separate areas of the brain can process specific information, the 
phenomenon of consciousness arises from activation of the whole brain (Dehaene, 
2014). Consciousness seems to arise as the brain integrates information from its 
different parts, sends it to other areas to compare and cross validate different types 
of information. As this activation takes place over the whole brain, it can only solve 
one given problem at a time.
Going back to the CEO metaphor, once his/her attention has been raised to 
a problem, the CEO will integrate the different inputs from different technical 
reports, compare them, and possibly ask an advisor in another area to interpret the 
information received from a previous advisor. This process is slow, but necessary to 
avoid mistakes in new situations. If the problem at hand becomes a regular one, 
new rules of decision-making can be established for the decision to be sent to a 
lower division.
From this visualization, it is important to recognize that most of the legwork 
is completed outside of consciousness. In most cases, we do not choose an option; 
we have rationally assessed its merit through a subconcious quantitative assessment. 
The estimation of the option value has been done behind the realm of our conscious-
ness by brain processes that have cross-referenced the characteristics of the options 
with characteristics of past experiences and hardwired patterns. If an option’s value 
is clearly better than others are, we can choose it without barely thinking about it. 
If several options have competing values, we may have mixed feelings, which will 
lead us to ponder consciously about the problem to compare the relative weight of 
evidence in favour of each option. In this decision-making process, our decision is 
not purely driven by objective reasons which are consciously voiced in our head, 
instead, it is driven by a stream of feelings which represent information which has 
already been processed by our brain beyond our consciousness.
Psychologists and neuroscientists have shown that, in many cases, the conscious 
reasons are made up after the decision is made in the brain to make sense of it ex post 
(Mercier & Sperber, 2011). For instance, through brain stimulation, a participant 
can be prompted to make a given choice in an experiment. When questioned why 
he made this choice, the participant will typically give reasons as though these had 
motivated his choice (Ramachandran, 2012).
These elements show that we are inclined to overstate the importance of the 
voice in our head as the center of our decision-making process. Our feelings, intu-
itions, and emotions are not irrelevant or even irrational elements; they are valuable 
inputs in our decision-making process and they are the outcome of computations 
processed subconsciously.
Not only do they provide the required preprocessed information for our con-
scious decision-making to take place, they do much more. At any moment in time, 

28  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
multiple brain processes treat information and assess whether it should be sent to 
consciousness to be treated. Even though we do not think consciously of things, our 
brain keeps scanning the available information. While consciousness only focuses 
on one question at a time, our brain is considering much more information to assess 
whether other issues must be considered.
If the weight of evidence is compelling enough, a new issue can supersede a 
previous one in our consciousness in the same way that an advisor can convince the 
CEO to look at new information.
Intuition in Financial Investment
The model of human cognition described above gives a new vision of the role of 
intuition and analytics. Intuitions are not irrational flukes that need to be kept in 
check. Traders should not primarily mistrust their feelings. Instead, they need to 
understand them to be able to make use of them.
If a trip to the supermarket is a complex task, investing on the financial mar-
ket is another challenge altogether. Financial decisions involve making judgments 
about forecasting uncertainty. Traders must form a view on the likely evolution 
of a wide range of economic, political and social phenomena that may affect the 
future value of assets. Furthermore, financial markets are characterized by even 
more complex uncertainty: the strategic uncertainty, which arises from the actions 
of other financial agents. A trader needs to anticipate the psychology of other trad-
ers and form best response strategies.
The complexity of financial decisions means that there are clear benefits from 
analytic tools. Modern computers can process enormous amount of data in seconds, 
solve optimisation problems and use quantitative models that contain accumulated 
insights from the past. Analytics is therefore a critical helping tool to survive and 
thrive in modern financial markets. They should not however lead to reject the role 
of intuitions.
Our evolved ape brain was not designed to solve financial problems. It is there-
fore not surprising that behavioral finance has listed a wide range of suboptimal 
behavior on financial markets. The evidence of the existence of irrational exuber-
ance in times of booms and bust comes in direct contradiction with the view of 
cold rational traders (Shiller, 2005; Newell & Page, 2017) and progress in neurosci-
ence has shown roots of such behavior (Coates & Herbert, 2008; Coates & Page, 
2016; Kandasamy et al., 2014).
However, it would be an error to put away all our intuitions and emotions. 
These are key parts of our decision process. They must play a role because analytics 
cannot, in most cases, provide a definite answer. If finding optimal financial deci-
sions is beyond a human brain, the truth is that it is beyond the ability of computers 
as well. The complexity of the real world is hard to understate. Analytic techniques 
can only provide a helping hand by relying on great simplifications of the world 

Intuition as a Complement to Analytics  ◾  29
through models. Consequently, there is a gap between the real world and the mod-
els used by analytic methods. In many situations, this gap may be small and ana-
lytic methods provide good answers quickly. In other situations, the match between 
models and reality may become more uncertain and therefore relying purely on 
analytics may not be as fruitful or even dangerous.
The human brain has a key advantage relative to computers; its ability to detect 
and makes sense of complex patterns. It is this ability that allowed a player like 
Kasparov to compete with Big Blue. Even though the program could estimate 
200 million positions per second versus 3 for Kasparov, his human brain could 
associate the patterns on the board with strategic perspectives and values that are 
very hard for a computer to assess (Silver, 2015).
Similarly, on a financial market, an investor can appreciate the complex pat-
terns and make sense of them in ways a computer cannot. Using experience, he/
she can get a feeling of what is likely to happen next and how to adjust decisions 
suggested by analytic techniques.
Gut feelings do not come naturally. The gut feelings of a naïve investor are 
likely to be of little help. However, our brain is also not designed to play chess. 
Through learning and experience, the expert chess player can acquire the intuition/
gut feelings, which will efficiently guide his decisions. Similarly, a financial inves-
tor, through experience and learning can be able to have intuitions that valuably 
complement analytic prediction. Indeed, we have found that traders Sharpe ratio 
tends to increase over time with experience (Coates & Page, 2009).
The positive intuition of an experienced trader will reflect a detection of patterns 
whose characteristics have been cross-referenced with experience, leading his/her brain 
to recognize more positive than negative opportunities. In a world where it is not good 
enough to be good, the best performing traders will be those who can harness the 
insights of these intuitions to make sense of and benefit from them (Coates, 2012).
Case Study: Interoceptive Ability 
and Trader’s Performance*
It is with this perspective that we designed a study to investigate the role of gut 
feelings in financial success (Kandasamy et al., 2016). We hypothesized that the 
ability of traders to understand and use their gut feelings can be linked with their 
ability to ready their physiological signals, which are associated with our emotions. 
Studies had found that measures of interoceptive ability (the sense of our inter-
nal body activity) were associated with superior performance to some laboratory 
gambling tasks (Dunn et al., 2010; Sokol-Hessner, Hartley, Hamilton, & Phelps,  
2015). However, little research has been done on real-world decision-making. 
*	This section largely reprints content from the study “Interoceptive Ability Predicts Survival on 
a London Trading Floor” (Kandasamy et al., 2016).

30  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
We conducted a study on the trading floor in a London hedge fund to test the 
hypothesis that traders with greater ability to sense signals from their bodies would 
make more money.
Interoceptive Ability
Research has shown that people vary in their ability to generate and sense intero-
ceptive signals. Physiological tests have been developed to measure this ability. The 
most common are heartbeat detection tests (Herbert, Pollatos, & Schandry, 2007; 
Katkin, Wiens, & Öhman, 2001).
In this study, we used two heartbeat detection tests. First, each trader per-
formed a heartbeat counting task, in which he was instructed to silently count, 
without touching chest or any pulse point, how many heartbeats he felt over brief 
time intervals (Schandry, 1981). This counting task was repeated six times, using 
randomized time periods of 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 seconds. The number of 
heartbeats perceived by the trader within each period was compared with the actual 
number of heartbeats, as recorded over that interval objectively and noninvasively 
by pulse oximetry. A heartbeat detection accuracy score was expressed as a percent-
age using the following equation (Hart, McGowan, Minati, & Critchley, 2013):

After each trial of the counting task, the traders rated their confidence in 
their heartbeat detection using a visual analogue scale. At one end of this scale 
was marked “Total guess/No heartbeat awareness,” at the other end “Complete 
­confidence/Full perception of heartbeat.”
In the second heartbeat detection task, traders were asked to judge whether a 
series of ten auditory tones was played synchronously with, or delayed relative to, 
their own heartbeats (Brener, Liu, & Ring, 1993; Whitehead, Drescher, Heiman, 
& Blackwell, 1977). The tones (presented at 440 Hz and lasting 100 ms) were trig-
gered by individual heartbeats. On synchronous trials, the 10 notes occurred at the 
rising edge of the finger pulse pressure wave; on delay trials, they followed 300 ms 
later. At the end of each trial, the participant indicated whether the tones were 
synchronized or not. Each trader performed 15 trials of this task. Their score was 
the percentage of right answers. This task was performed after the counting task to 
prevent the traders from developing any explicit knowledge about their own heart-
rates (Ring, Brener, Knapp, & Mailloux, 2015).
Data was also collected on each trader’s age, years of trading, and profit and 
loss statement, known as their P&L. Comparative data from a control group of 48 
high-functioning (mostly students and postgraduates) nontrader males, matched 
with traders on age, were drawn from participants who had performed identical

interoceptive tests (same equipment and procedures) in studies undertaken at the 
University of Sussex (Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki, & Critchley, 2015).
Traders Have Enhanced Interoceptive Ability 
Compared to Nontrading Individuals
As a first step in assessing the importance of interoception in financial risk taking, 
we tested simply whether traders scored higher on heartbeat detection tasks than 
nontrading controls. We compared the average score on the heartbeat counting 
task for the traders with the average score from our control group. We found that 
the traders had significantly higher scores, indicating greater interoceptive accu-
racy, than the controls, with a mean score of 78.2 for traders and 66.9 for controls 
(p = 0.011, N = 66, Figure 2.1).
Interoceptive Ability Predicts Trader Profitability
To test the hypothesis that interoceptive accuracy predicts trading performance, we 
collected data on each trader’s average daily profit and loss (P&L) over the previous 
year. One of the traders was acting as trading manager, so he did not have his own 
P&L; another trader had a P&L more than 5 standard deviations higher than the 
mean of other traders, so even with data transformations he distorted the distribu-
tion. Both traders were therefore omitted from analyses that used “raw” P&L. We 
found that the traders scores on the heartbeat counting task predicted their P&L 
(coeff = 2.61, R2 = 0.27, p = 0.007, N = 16). To further validate this association, we  
also rank-ordered the P&L, which permitted the inclusion of the trader with

the outlying P&L. Again, we found that heartbeat detection score predicted rela-
tive trading performance (coeff = 17.84, R2 = 0.22, p = 0.01, N = 17, Figure 2.2).
Interoceptive Ability Predicts Survival  
in the Financial Markets
If heartbeat detection score predicts traders P&L, does it also predict how long 
traders survive in the financial markets? To answer this question, we plotted heart-
beat detection scores against years of experience in the financial markets and found 
that a trader’s heartbeat counting score predicted the number of years he had sur-
vived as a trader (coeff = 21.64, R2 = 0.344, p = 0.001, N = 18, Figure 2.3).
The solid red line is the regression plot. A regression model with conditional 
mean and conditional standard deviation (std) estimated jointly is used to assess 
the significance of changes in the heartbeat detection mean and STD over years 
of trading. Light dashed horizontal lines are +/−1 std. Vertical dotted lines show 
distributions of residuals for each bucket of trading experience. These distributions 
show a declining variance of heartbeat detection as years of experience increase.
Does this result mean the markets select for traders with greater interoceptive 
ability? To pursue this analysis, we reasoned as follows: (1) If firms know nothing 
about interoception (and the hosting firm of our study did not) they will not hire 
traders based on heartbeat detection scores. We should find, therefore, that begin-
ner traders and the nontrading population have mean heartbeat detection scores 
and a standard deviation of scores that do not differ significantly. (2) If the market 
selects for traders with good gut feelings (i.e., high heartbeat detection scores), then

what we should find is that as the traders’ careers progress and the market selects 
for traders with better gut feelings, those with low heartbeat detection scores will 
be eliminated from the markets. Average heartbeat detection scores for the traders 
will rise, while the standard deviation of scores will fall as the lower end of the 
range drops out.
To test this possibility, we partitioned the group according to experience: junior 
traders (1–4 yrs experience), mid (5–8 yrs), and senior (>8 yrs), and then calculated 
the mean and standard deviation of detection scores for each bucket (Table 2.1). We 
found that beginner traders did not differ significantly from controls in the mean 
(p = 0.852, N = 53) nor standard deviation (p = 0.614, N = 53) of their heartbeat 
detection score. Over time, however, the traders mean heartbeat detection score 
did indeed rise, from 68.7 for beginners to 85.3 for experienced traders. This latter 
level differed significantly from controls (T test, p = 0.02, N = 56). In addition, the 
standard deviation decreased, from 16 for beginners to 8.6 for experienced traders, 
and this latter standard deviation also differed significantly from controls (F test, 
p = 0.018, N = 56) (Table 2.1). This result is represented graphically in Figure 2.3, 
where the variance of residuals declines with the number of years of trading (coeff =  
−0.063, p = 0.042, N = 18), the pattern of these residuals forming a wedge shape 
rather than the customary parallelogram.
Interoceptive Accuracy But Not Confidence 
Informs Trading Performance

(Ceunen, Van Diest, & Vlaeyen, 2013; Garfinkel et al., 2015). We found no signifi-
cant correlations between confidence and heartbeat detection accuracy (coeff = 0.17, 
p = 0.51, N = 17); nor between confidence and P&L (coeff = −0.01, p = 0.97, N = 17); 
nor between confidence and years of survival (coeff = −0.16, p = 0.54, N = 17).
This disjunct between the traders heartbeat detection accuracy and their con-
fidence in their accuracy may seem contradictory but, as with many physiological 
measures, objective performance and subjective appraisal often diverge. In the case 
of interoceptive ability, it is conceivable that a self-conscious awareness of intero-
ceptive signals impairs the signal’s utility because people may dismiss the signals 
as “merely” physical and distracting. Alternatively, self-consciousness may impair 
risk taking in much the same way that focusing self-consciously on, say, your ten-
nis stroke can impair your game. Related to this point, it is noteworthy that the 
control group in our study included 16 medical students who, despite their more 
advanced understanding of the cardiovascular system, performed on average worse 
than the traders on the counting task (65.9 versus 78.2), although this difference 
only approached significance (p = 0.056, N = 34).
Conclusion
In the old dichotomies, mind/body and rationality/passions, a coldly rational deci-
sion maker can abstract himself/herself from the influences of emotions and vis-
ceral feelings to engineer good decisions. Behavioral economics has shown that 
this vision of a rational decision maker did not stand as a positive theory of deci-
sion; that is, it does not correspond to the reality of how people make decisions.

However,  behavioral economists from the “heuristics and biases” school like 
Kahneman and Tversky implicitly kept the model of homo economicus as a nor-
mative model of what is a good decision. Human decision-making processes were 
in comparison considered as imperfect and flawed.
New research connecting behavioral economics and neuroscience now gives 
another picture whereby humans are better decision makers than we thought; but 
many of the decisions derive from brain processes beyond the realm of conscious-
ness. Faced with a highly complex environment, the brain optimally allocates its 
scarce computational resources and only thin slices of reality are acquiesced to a 
conscious analysis. Real-time decisions require the brain to rely on a wide range of 
automated processes to treat information and provide quick evaluations relevant 
for the value of different options considered. Given this large activity, a lot of what 
we perceive from reality gives rise to feelings which often only hover at the limit 
of consciousness. These feelings that present as intuition, and gut feelings are not 
irrational or irrelevant. They contain real information.
In the world of finance where agents are in a race to make the best decisions, 
dismissing these intuitions would be dismissing a lot of potentially valuable input 
in the decision-making process. Top traders certainly achieve high performance by 
fine-tuning their intuitions through extensive experience. While our gut feeling 
mechanisms have not been designed to help us operate in financial markets, accu-
mulated experience can be encoded in gut feelings, which can be helpful. Having 
informative gut feelings is not enough though. For them to play a positive role in 
financial decision-making, top traders must be able to recognize them and channel 
this information in decisions.
To test such an idea, I will report the result from a study conducted with col-
leagues, which found that the ability to sense internal body signals, interoception, 
is positively associated with performance on the trading floor. We conjecture that 
by being able to recognize the somatic markers associated with emotions, traders 
can make better decisions in a highly complex environment.
This research suggests that intuition, or gut feeling, should be valued on the trad-
ing floor as a complement of analytic tools. Like any signal, intuitions can be mistaken, 
but experienced traders will have encoded a wide range of experience and memories 
that will help them make sense of new situations, feeding them intuitions about the 
value of different choices. When making decisions, traders should be ready and will-
ing to use both types of input: analytics and intuitions. However, good traders will 
know that no tool should supersede the other one fully. Rather, intuitions should help 
question analytics, and vice versa. In many situations where analytic models may be 
lacking realism, intuition can fruitfully contribute to appreciate the degree of confi-
dence to give an analytic prescription; and whether one should deviate from them. In 
situations where analytics conflict with intuitions, one should consider questioning 
these intuitions to make sure they do not take precedence over good data. Such a way 
to proceed, is like aiming to look at a chess game like Kasparov, while being able to run 
the millions of Deep Blue simulations as a helping tool. The computer simulations are

a great help, but, for the time being, there are things that the human brain does which 
are beyond the scope of computer programs.

Data and Analytics: 
A Matter of Trust
Wilds Ross
Data analysis to support business decisions is nothing new; however, the ­application 
of new technologies enabled by the constant development in computing power, 
and the discovery or re-discovery of innovative techniques made practical by 
these developments is taking the business community by storm. With technologi-
cal acceleration, data and analytics (D&A) activities are subject to the adoption 
cycles of both technology and methodology. Technological adoption often follows 
the well-established normal growth curve first observed in the 1950s and includes 
innovators, early adopters, the majority adopters, and laggards. While methodol-
ogy adoption follows a similar pattern with process-unique drivers for acceptance, 
in the business community, both adoption patterns have a common basis before 
becoming ubiquitous: trust.

40  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
This is to be expected when anything challenges the status quo. Data and 
­analytics is replacing biased, gut-feel, and subjective decision-making with objec-
tive, data-driven prescriptive insights that allow organizations to better serve cus-
tomers, drive operational efficiencies, and secure their organization from both 
internal and external risks. Acting on findings from D&A activity requires a belief 
that the results represent reality, and accurately predict the behavior of the ­business. 
This is not easily done when the results are obscured within statistics and the 
abstract language of data science, or generated by teams of people that have limited 
experience within the business domain and thus may not have the expected level of 
alignment to business activity that is necessary for full realization. Big Data, data 
science, machine learning, and other analytics topics are not necessarily common 
currency for many executives that are accustomed to developing their own confi-
dence by examining traditional analysis methods with minimal effort. Coupled 
with a legacy of insecurity in the data, this has led to a trust gap, whereby some 
businesses have been reluctant to adopt the findings and benefit from D&A results. 
This is far from universal, however. The businesses that have developed effective 
D&A programs and can trust in what they discover have achieved success, and in 
many cases, superior data and analytics and the confidence to act upon it have been 
credited with significant effects toward business performance.
D&A are often deployed in support of three primary areas of business focus: 
growth, operational management, and compliance.
Helping to better understand customers and create new experiences
In today’s business ecosystem, customers are in the driver’s seat. 
Empowered by digital information and resources, customers will defect if a 
brand doesn’t meet their every need. To remain competitive in this environ-
ment, organizations must find new ways to deliver value to customers and 
prospects. So, it comes as no surprise that businesses rely on D&A capabili-
ties to create new sources of value for customers. Among other things, D&A 
is integral to understanding how products are being used, understanding 
existing customers better, and developing new products and services.
Streamlining existing operations
As firms become more efficient in existing processes, they open opportu-
nities to invest time and budget in things that will make them more competi-
tive. D&A is essential to gaining better visibility into business performance, 
driving process and cost efficiency, and driving strategy and change.
Managing risk and compliance
While there is a lot of upside potential to firms advancing their use of 
D&A, managing the downside risks is imperative. For example, D&A is crit-
ical for spotting fraud, and identifying and managing other business risks. 
For companies that need to comply with industry regulations, D&A helps 
them meet their reporting and transparency requirements. Beyond compli-
ance, an important consideration for how firms use D&A is customer trust.

Data and Analytics: A Matter of Trust  ◾  41
These areas are common to most businesses, and D&A is becoming more 
­prevalent across a wide range of industries, but as its importance grows, businesses 
are faced with significant challenges, and these issues revolve around trust.
A Matter of Trust
In a global environment defined by constant disruption, business leaders need to 
be confident in their decisions. This means being able to trust their data, their 
algorithms and their analytics capabilities. However, significant questions are now 
emerging about the trust placed in the data, the analytics and the controls that 
underwrite a new way of making decisions.
How do we know a result is right or that automated decisions are doing the right 
thing? What does “right” mean and to what extent does it matter? Who should be 
the judge? As analytics goes mainstream, questions surrounding trust will continue 
to evolve; not only across most sectors, but also for regulators, policymakers and 
those who safeguard consumer rights.
Executives cannot make sound business decisions if they don’t trust their data 
and analytics. Yet according to research by KPMG,* only around a third of orga-
nizations have a high level of confidence in their customer insights or the analytics 
they receive on their business operations.
As analytics increasingly drive the decisions that affect us as individuals, as 
businesses and as societies, there must be a heightened focus on ensuring the high-
est level of trust in the data, the analytics and the controls that generate desired 
outcomes.
To deliver business results, organizations must think about D&A trust not as a 
nice-to-have, but as a strategic way to bridge the gap among decision makers, data 
scientists, and customers.
In reality, trust is not at the forefront of many leaders’ minds. While some 
mistrust the input or the output, others often don’t care about trust until they 
are forced to. Unfortunately, by then, the damage could have already been done 
through poor and costly decisions or, even worse, through hurting the organiza-
tion’s reputation and brand with its customers.
At KPMG, we have spent some time analyzing the current trust gap affecting 
organizations around the world and developed a framework for assessing and build-
ing trust in D&A.
Trust in D&A should be nonnegotiable. Yet, our research of over 2,000 organi-
zations revealed a trust gap. Organizations not only lack confidence in their ability 
to effectively use and link D&A to positive business outcomes, they also high-
lighted a lack of trustworthiness in the analytics used to drive decision-making. 
*	“Building Trust in Analytics: Breaking the Cycle of Mistrust in D&A,” KPMG LLP, October 
2016. https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2016/10/building-trust-in-analytics.html

42  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
What is the result? Few firms understand whether the D&A models that are being 
created achieve what they were intended to. This creates a cycle of mistrust, which has 
an impact on future analytical investments and their return on investment (ROI).
The potential impact of mistrust in D&A can be seen beyond the four walls 
of an organization. As customers increasingly rely on D&A to make contextually 
relevant and difficult decisions, any mistrust from the organization can affect a 
brand’s reputation, and ultimately, its bottom line.
The trust gap has implications beyond the walls of an organization. Today, 
complex analytics underpin many important decisions that affect us as individuals, 
as businesses, and as societies. With so much riding on the output of D&A, sig-
nificant questions are starting to emerge about the trust that we place in the data, 
analytics, and the controls that underwrite a new way of making decisions.
When consumers are involved, the absence—or loss—of trust can clearly 
have a major impact on the success of a brand’s reputation and sales performance. 
Anecdotal evidence over the last few years suggests that data breaches of some of 
the world’s leading retailers which exposed millions of shoppers’ payment cards had 
a major impact on brand reputation and in some cases, financial results. Lack of 
trust and misplaced trust can also have a wider impact on society. For example, the 
financial crisis of 2008 was exacerbated by predictive risk models which were tech-
nically “correct,” but failed spectacularly in their intended purpose. Making deci-
sions or targeting consumers based on inaccurate predictions will quickly erode, if 
not extinguish, consumer trust and shake the confidence of those executives who 
rely on these predictions to make informed decisions.
At the core of trusted analytics are rigorous strategies and processes that aim to 
maximize trust. Some are well known but challenging, such as data quality. Others are 
relatively new and undefined in the D&A sphere, such as ethics and integrity. KPMG 
believes that organizations should take a systematic approach to trust that spans the 
life cycle of analytics and has outlined a framework that consists of four “anchors.”
“Anchors” of Trust
Organizations must strive to engender trust and accelerate the time-to-value for all 
D&A projects. To close the gap, KPMG has outlined a framework of four anchors 
of trust that underpin trusted analytics: (1) quality, (2) effectiveness, (3) integrity, 
and (4) resilience. Using these anchors, we outline the processes, practices, and 
governance that all organizations must implement to deliver trusted data, analytics, 
and models among decision makers, data scientists, and customers.
Let’s look at what each of the anchors means.
Quality: Are the fundamental building blocks of D&A good enough? How well 
do organizations understand the role of quality in their current approach to 
organizing, developing, and managing data and analytics?

Data and Analytics: A Matter of Trust  ◾  43
Effectiveness: Do the analytics work as intended? Can organizations determine 
the accuracy and utility of the outputs?
Integrity: Is the use of D&A considered acceptable? How well aligned is the 
organization with analytics regulatory compliance and privacy/ethical needs? 
Is D&A transparently used both internally and externally?
Resilience: Are long-term operations optimized? How good is the organization 
at ensuring governance and security throughout the analytics life cycle?
Each anchor of trust is relevant at every stage of the D&A life cycle—from data 
sourcing, to data preparation and blending, to analysis and modeling, to usage and 
deployment, and finally through to measuring effectiveness and back to the begin-
ning of the cycle.
Breaking the Cycle of Mistrust
Firms need to break the cycle of mistrust, and to do that they need to close several 
gaps in D&A capabilities that underpin the anchors of trust. Our study looked at 
core capabilities within each of the anchors and asked D&A decision makers to 
rate how well their organizations align to each of those capabilities. Unfortunately, 
many firms are ill-equipped to deliver trusted analytics due to significant gaps in 
capabilities. In fact, apart from D&A regulatory compliance, where organizations 
tended to perform strongest, they struggled to achieve excellence across each of the 
D&A anchors. The study showed that only 10% of organizations believed that they 
excelled in developing and managing D&A. Additionally, a mere 13% excelled in 
the privacy and ethical use of D&A, and less than a fifth (16%) performed well in 
ensuring the accuracy of models they produce. The following sections explore each 
of the anchors in more detail.
Quality
Quality is the trust anchor most commonly cited by internal decision makers. Most 
organizations understand and struggle with data quality standards for accuracy, 
completeness and timeliness. As data volumes increase, new uses emerge and regu-
lation grows, the challenge will only increase. Everybody recognizes that at some 
levels, all analytical models are “wrong” and not a perfect reflection of reality. But 
where does it matter most?
To drive quality in D&A, organizations need to ensure that both the inputs 
and development processes for D&A meet the quality standards that are appro-
priate for the context in which the analytics will be used. In many organizations, 
questions are raised about choice of data sources and data “lineage” (i.e., where 
the data originated and what process it took to arrive as input data to a system or 
decision engine).

44  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
The quality of analytics poses huge potential trust issues. Statistical and 
­algorithm design, model development approaches and quality assurance are becom-
ing critical. Organizations are struggling to assess quality in scenarios in which the 
impact of low quality can be high or where there is no known right answer with 
which to compare the output of a new decision engine.
Effectiveness
When it comes to D&A, effectiveness is all about real-world performance. It means 
that the outputs of models work as intended and deliver value to the organization. 
This is the top concern of those who invest in D&A solutions, both internal and 
external to the organizations.
The problem is that D&A effectiveness is becoming increasingly difficult to 
measure. In part, this is because D&A is becoming more complex and therefore 
the “distance” between the upstream investment in people and raw data is often far 
removed from the downstream value to the organization.
When organizations are not able to assess and measure the effectiveness of 
their D&A, it becomes easy for those making decisions to miss the full value of 
their investments and assume that a large proportion of their D&A projects “don’t 
work.” This, in turn, erodes trust and limits long term investment and innovation.
Organizations that can assess and validate the effectiveness of their analytics in 
supporting decision-making can have a huge impact on trust at the board level. The 
corollary of this, of course, is that organizations that invest without understanding 
the effectiveness of D&A may not move the needle on trust or value at all.
Integrity
Integrity can be a difficult concept to pin down. In the context of trusted analyt-
ics, we use the term to refer to the acceptable use of D&A, from compliance with 
regulations and laws such as data privacy through to less clear issues surrounding 
the ethical use of D&A such as profiling. This anchor is typically the top concern 
of consumers and the public, generally.
Behind this definition is the principle that with power comes responsibility. 
Algorithms are becoming more powerful, and can have hidden or unintended con-
sequences. How do we decide what is acceptable and what isn’t? Where exactly does 
accountability lie, and how far does it extend?
This is a new, uncertain and rapidly changing anchor of trust with few glob-
ally agreed best practices. Individual views vary widely, and there is often no right 
answer. Yet integrity has a high media profile and has potentially enormous impli-
cations, not only for internal trust in D&A, but also for public trust in the reputa-
tion of any organization that gets it wrong.
Integrity goes beyond consumer trust issues. Most organizations understand 
that D&A offers huge potential benefits by replicating good decisions and limiting 

Data and Analytics: A Matter of Trust  ◾  45
human inconsistencies and biases. If algorithms are well “trained,” then race or 
­gender biases, for example, can be removed. It stands to reason, therefore, that an 
effective combination of human and machine can offer fairer, more trusted decisions.
However, this is not guaranteed. If not well managed throughout the D&A life 
cycle, algorithms can also introduce unintentional, hidden biases because of the 
data on which they have been trained. Automated decision engines can also make 
the ethical consequences feel emotionally distant to the humans who are nominally 
accountable.
Resilience
Resilience in this context is about optimization for the long term in the face of 
challenges and changes. Cyber security is the best-known issue here, but resilience 
is broader than information security. Failure of this trust anchor undermines all 
the previous three.
Unlike traditional software, applications which apply machine learning and 
operate in a complex D&A ecosystem with fast-changing data sources are likely 
to change their function, impact, and value throughout their operational lifetime, 
sometimes quite suddenly.
Basic resilience is key to winning customer trust. It only takes one service out-
age or one data leak for consumers to quickly move to (what they perceive to be) 
a more secure competitor. It also only takes one Big Data leak for the regulators 
to come knocking and for fines to start flying. Strong governance and control can 
also help reduce duplication of effort and therefore, help improve the value of D&A 
across the enterprise.
Release of new data sources by third parties can also have unintended impacts 
on existing analytics and the art of the possible. In 2009, for example, academics 
in the United States demonstrated that it was possible to predict an individual’s 
social security number with remarkable accuracy using only public data such as the 
Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and other personal data such as 
profiles on social networking sites.*
Recommendations for Building Trusted Analytics
Trust is not a project. Strengthening the anchors of trust is not a one-time exercise 
or a compliance checklist. It is a continuous endeavor that should span the entire 
enterprise. From the sourcing and preparation of data through to the outcomes and 
measurement of value, building trust in analytics requires executives to look across 
their D&A life cycle, from data through to insights and ultimately to generating 
value. There are no roadmaps for driving trust, no software solutions or perfect

answers. However, there are some best practices that all organizations can consider 
and adopt.
Here are seven ideas that should help any organization create their own approach 
to building D&A trust.
1.	Start with the basics—Assess your trust gaps: Undertake an initial assess-
ment to see where trusted analytics is most critical to your business, and then 
focus on those areas. Key risks can often be reduced with some very straight-
forward changes, such as the use of simple checklists.
2.	Create purpose: Clarify and align goals. Ensure that the purpose for your 
data collection and the associated analytics is clearly stated. Make D&A 
performance and impact measurable. The aims and incentives of the D&A 
“owners” should align with the goals of its users and with those who could 
be affected by it. Lack of clarity around purpose and misalignment of D&A 
goals can create mistrust, dilute ROI and open the door to inadvertent misuse.
3.	Raise awareness: Increase internal engagement. Building awareness and 
understanding of D&A among business users is critical to breaking the cycle 
of mistrust. Involve key stakeholders and establish multidisciplinary project 
teams, combining D&A leaders with IT and business stakeholders across dif-
ferent departments.
4.	Build expertise: Develop an internal D&A culture and capabilities as your 
first guardian of trust. D&A practitioners are critical to being able to elevate 
the wider understanding of D&A across the organization. Identify gaps and 
opportunities in your current capabilities, governance, structure and pro-
cesses. Ensure that you have expertise in analytics quality assurance: experi-
mental design, A|B testing, and other means of validation. Ultimately, make 
trust in D&A a core company value.
5.	Encourage transparency: Open the “black box” to a second set of eyes. And 
a third. There are many potential actions to help improve D&A transparency. 
You may want to establish cross-functional teams, third-party assurance and 
peer reviews, use wiki-style sites, encourage whistleblowers and strengthen 
QA processes as valuable “guardians” of trust. Essentially, have every D&A 
challenge reviewed independently.
6.	Take a 360-degree view: Build your ecosystems, portfolios, and communi-
ties. To drive trust through the organization, you will need to look beyond 
the traditional boundaries of systems, organizational silos, and business cases 
to see the wider ecosystems. Take a portfolio approach, looking at the value 
and the risk that D&A brings to the organization. Create a “meta-model” and 
cross-functional teams to identify and control dependencies between models.
7.	Be innovative—Enable experimentation: Create a model for D&A inno-
vation. Allow D&A teams to push the boundaries of innovation and try 
several paths without excessive fear of failure. Build a data innovation lab,

which allows data scientists and business stakeholders to rapidly test new 
ideas. Consider ROI beyond the specific performance objectives of the D&A 
project. Find ways to incentivize employees for innovation and trusted D&A.
Trust is a central component of successful D&A programs, which ultimately 
inform some of the most important decisions that businesses make. Organizations 
that are unwilling or unable to trust their D&A will fall behind and be considered 
laggards in the application of what is soon to be a ubiquitous agent of change and 
accepted standard of practice. Those that can implement trusted analytics and act 
confidently on their findings will have the greatest advantage in the corporate world.

The Missing Link: 
Experiential Learning
Natalia V. Smirnova and Lorri A. Halverson
Introduction
This chapter is a practical guide for implementation of a collaborative, experien-
tial learning exercise. This program recognizes a connection between the concept 
of intuition and experience, and the importance of building these competencies 
before entering the workplace as well as throughout one’s career. The literature 
surveyed genuinely aided an understanding of the experiential learning concept, 
which then helped to design the experiential learning program.
Practical experience in the form of experiential learning fosters the develop-
ment of intuition and, more specifically, an intuitive leader and a successful

executive. By looking at experiential learning through two lenses, the intuition and 
­management literature as well as the literature about engaged learning and peda-
gogy of experience, it can be shown that experiential learning is the missing link 
in the development of a skilled workforce with a high degree of executive function. 
Specifically, the argument is that experiential learning opportunities, which are set 
up within collaborative arrangements between academia and practitioners, contrib-
ute to the development of three things: core knowledge, skills to apply such knowl-
edge, and intuition. We use the notion of intuition defined by Herbert A. Simon 
(1992) as a recognition of experiences “encapsulated” in ­memory.* This  allows 
us to argue that, as students move into the workplace they gain more expertise 
and strengthen the knowledge base from which they will develop intuition. This 
includes both intuitive judgment and intuitive insight, a distinction established 
by Dörfler and Ackermann (2012). The research on the development of intuition, 
and ultimately its use in executive decision-making, is based on the assumption 
that these decision makers are experts in their professional fields. That is, expertise 
precedes intuition. As such, experiential learning provides a link between the struc-
tured, theoretical knowledge base of the classroom and the messy, “ill-structured” 
problems of the workplace, establishing the basis of expertise. As expertise grows 
and matures, one recognizes more and more cues from past experiences, therefore 
developing deeper intuitive knowledge, intuitive insight, and confidence. These 
ingredients provide the underpinnings of the executive decision-making process 
and, therefore, support the development of the intuitive leaders especially valuable 
in the twenty-first century workplace.
The changing nature of the workplace is documented by many academic 
research papers and popular articles. For example, see Newman and Winston 
(2016), Christensen and Schneider (2010), Tripathi and Sharma (2011), and 
Trilling and Fadel (2009), among others. It is common knowledge that many peo-
ple around the world work remotely, telecommute, and teleconference. Working in 
teams, and particularly in teams of people with diverse sets of skills, backgrounds, 
and cultural competencies, will become even more prevalent in the coming years. 
These labor market changes, as well as the economy’s continued transformation 
from manufacturing to service, global competition, and the need for constant re-
tooling and learning new skills call for alterations in the ways students are prepared 
for future careers.
Considering these changes, experiential learning can bridge classroom knowl-
edge with the workplace by laying a foundation for the development of intuition 
and expertise. There are many examples of experiential learning depicted in theo-
retical and practitioner’s literature. Examples such as apprenticeships and intern-
ships have received much attention. In this chapter, an example of experiential 
learning is described. It is a collaborative program between academic institutions 
and the practitioners aimed at advancing content knowledge through immersion in

real-world projects. Participating students experience the workplace environment, 
in all of its challenges, learn soft skills needed to navigate that environment, and 
establish a base of experiences on which they can build. Supported by qualitative 
evidence from students’ reflections, we are confident that the development of those 
traits resulted from a structured experiential learning program.
The applied research course that we are showcasing in this chapter is an appli-
cation of the experiential learning model, which blends the academic and practi-
tioner’s sides of gaining expertise and intuition. As such, we argue that this course 
could be viewed as the missing link in developing executive leaders. In the next 
section, a survey of the literature about intuition and practical experience illustrates 
the theoretical base for this application. From there, this application is described in 
more detail and the transmission mechanism of the “missing link” is shown. In the 
final section, readers are invited to follow the step-by-step guide for replicating this 
innovative approach and developing their own collaborations.
Intuition and Practical Experience: The Literature
This section summarizes the existing consensus in the scientific community regard-
ing various aspects of experiential learning. The theoretical underpinnings of the 
following features are showcased: intuition and its links to expertise and decision-
making; methods of student engagement outside of the classroom; core skills of the 
contemporary workplace; specificity of economics; and partnership building. These 
features guided us in building our applied economic research course.
Intuition and Its Links to Expertise and Decision-Making
Simon (1992) defines intuition as simply a recognition of the cues stored in the 
memory of an expert. As more experience is gained by an individual, the more 
information is stored in her memory. As a situation presents itself, the cue is pro-
vided, and needed information is retrieved. We use this definition of intuition as a 
basis for our experiential learning application.
Dörfler and Ackermann (2012) argue that two distinguishable forms of intu-
ition exist: intuitive insight and intuitive judgment. In doing so, the authors iden-
tified several dimensions of intuition’s typology. With the intention to connect 
intuition to experiential learning and ultimately executive decision-making, the 
focus is on understanding intuition types that relate to solving real-world problems. 
Dörfler and Ackerman (2012) suggest that intuitive judgment manifests itself in 
“deciding about an alternative or about a direction,” while intuitive insight is con-
cerned with “creating a solution which entails new knowledge.”* We claim that the 
development of both types is important for an executive leader.
*	Dörfler & Ackermann (2012), p. 559.

52  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
When looking at traditional classroom functions including problem sets, case 
studies, research projects, and so on, an argument can be made that this only devel-
ops the student’s intuitive judgment. However, experiential learning opportunities 
contribute to both well-structured and ill-structured projects for students to tackle 
and to build an intuitive insight. We built our applied economic research course to 
combine core knowledge gained in classroom learning with experiences, therefore 
contributing to the advancement of both: intuitive judgment and intuitive insight. 
If such ambitious outcomes are to be realized, the students who experience the 
course will be well-positioned to enter the workforce with the basis for becoming a 
leader in an organization.
The literature in a variety of disciplines distinguishes between two systems of 
cognition: System 1 that is fast, holistic, intuitive; and System 2 that is slower, 
more analytic, and cognitively effortful (Kahneman, 2011). We argue that since 
System 2 functions in an abstract, sequential, and rule-based manner, it can be 
developed through the academic exercises of sense making, mental simulation, 
situation assessment, and problem representation. System 1 uses functions in a 
­domain-specific manner and, therefore, is developed or enhanced through experi-
ence in the work setting or through applied work in general.
The role of intuition in strategic decision-making is explored by Sinclair, Eugene, 
and Hodgkinson (2009). The authors called for the development of programs that 
educated business leaders in the complimentary use of both intuition and analysis. 
They found those programs to be valuable in fostering efficient decision-making 
­processes. In response to their challenges, our pilot program was created focusing on 
core knowledge, application of this knowledge, and evolving intuition, specifically 
paying attention to System 1 development. By evaluating the results of the pilot, we 
rolled out the program with a greater emphasis on leadership skills acquisition.
Betsch (2008) specifies that knowledge acquired through experience is the 
input into intuitive processing. Salas, Rosen, and DiazGranados (2010) state that 
the expertise-based intuition is based on combining the two domains: expertise 
and intuition. Kahneman (2011) argues that expert intuition is a skill and needs 
three things to develop: stable environment, practice, and feedback. These authors 
promote associative learning, which is understood here to be synonymous with 
engaged, applied, experiential learning. This learning, which occurs outside of the 
classroom, is a hands-on, real-world immersion into the workplace environment.
Methods of Student Engagement Outside the Classroom
In addition to compelling evidence from the literature that learning outside of the 
academy develops expert intuition, evidence from best practices of internships, appren-
ticeships, and other methods of engagement of students outside of the classroom was 
examined. As the applied research course application was established, the ideas of Kolb 
(1984) were explored and the contemporary views of them, summarized by Moore 
(2013), was heavily drawn upon. The three pillars of the experiential learning approach 

The Missing Link: Experiential Learning  ◾  53
are in the foundation of our approach. The first pillar is Learning from Experience 
introduced by Dewey (1938). This theory was applied by involving students in the 
professional life of the practitioner. The research assignments that were given dealt not 
only with economic content, but also included workflow schedules, production dead-
lines, staff reassignments, and other naturally occurring workplace events.
The second pillar of the experiential learning approach is Communities of 
Practice introduced by Lave and Wenger (1991) and expanded by Wenger (1998). 
This idea postulates that learning is a function of active participation in the chang-
ing environment of the workplace. With staff researchers already forming a com-
munity of practice, students were organically integrated into it. This arrangement 
allowed them to experience the community of practice and engage in professional 
interactions within it.
The third pillar is Workplace Learning described by Billet (2001), Fenwick 
(2003), and Raelin (2008). This pillar suggests that each workplace has certain 
intrinsic characteristics that are specific to it, and as such, employees adjust to 
them. While the learning that occurred during the program was specific to the 
practitioner’s organizational structure and research agenda, care was taken to guide 
students through reflective exercises at the end of the course. The goal was to help 
them articulate the skills and competencies they acquired during this experience 
and understand which proficiencies are organization-specific and which ones are 
universal.
Core Skills of Contemporary Workplace
What about the core skills, as opposed to intuitive insights, that are being acquired 
in the workplace? Are they different from the ones that can be attained in the 
classroom? Moore (2013) posits that the learning that occurs in the workplace is 
not simply an “application” of the concepts acquired in the classroom. The out-of-
school environment requires different kinds of cognition, and thus the skills that 
are attained at the professional site are completely different from the skills devel-
oped in the academic setting. A portion of the value of practical experience is, then, 
in the additional cognitive abilities being developed; two of them, we argue, are 
expertise and intuition.
The support of new learning goals for the workplace environment in the twenty-
first century is presented in Newman and Winston (2016) and Trilling and Fadel 
(2009). Both books argue that because the dynamics of the workplace call for team-
work, flexibility, and situated learning, the skills that are required in the practical 
world are unlike the skills and competencies attained in the classroom. Trilling and 
Fadel (2009) suggested that there are three groups of skills that are necessary for 
functioning well in the twenty-first century: (1) learning and innovation; (2) digital 
literacy; and (3) career and life skills. These skills are part of a unified, collective 
vision for twenty-first century learning that was developed by the Partnership for 
21st Century Learning (n.d.).

54  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
For learning and innovation skills, the literature specifically mentions critical 
thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration, and creativity 
and innovation. In an experience-based education, the practice of critical thinking 
assumes a form different from the academic setting. Critical thinking at the work-
place advocates action, preparation of well-articulated ideas, and efficient delivery 
of those ideas to others.
For the digital literacy skills, Trilling and Fadel (2009) discussed information 
literacy, media literacy, and information and communication technology (ICT) 
literacy. The increased demand for the ability to access information efficiently and 
effectively, evaluate information critically and competently, and use information 
accurately and creatively. Media literacy is described as the ability of students and 
employees to competently operate in various delivery methods (print, graphics, ani-
mation, audio, video, websites, etc.). The ICT literacy calls for the ability to use 
technology as a tool to research, organize, evaluate, and communicate information, 
as well as use digital technologies appropriately and ethically. By eliminating the 
classroom “walls,” students are exposed to the current technology tools and experi-
ence the challenges and limitations inherent to them.
For career and life skills, the literature points to flexibility and the ability to 
adapt, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural interaction, productiv-
ity and accountability, leadership and responsibility. While those are all inherent to 
the work environment, engagement in real-world projects also develops the concept 
of self and identity, for example, an understanding of what it means to “be” an 
economist.
Moore (2013) argues that under the right conditions, the two forms of knowl-
edge (academic and experiential) could be compatible, complementary, and 
mutually expansive. The potential for the workplace adding value to the school’s 
curriculum and vice versa is a matter of pedagogy, teaching practices, and institu-
tional missions.*
Specificity of Economics as a Field of Study
The cognition, intuition, and core skills acquired in the workplace appear to be 
universal. That is, they can apply to any field of study. To determine if something 
distinct happens in economics, in terms of students’ engagement, the economic 
education literature was reviewed. The seminal paper by Allgood, Walstad, and 
Siegfried (2015) summarized the methods of teaching economics to undergradu-
ate students, and provided an opportunity to assess which methods are proven 
to be most beneficial to students in the academy. For example, cooperative learn-
ing, experiments, classroom and online discussions are all identified as the pedago-
gies that stimulate engaged learning and provide positive outcomes. Even though 
Allgood et al. (2015) do not provide recommendations for the collaboration of 
*	Moore (2013), p. 99.

The Missing Link: Experiential Learning  ◾  55
academic institutions with practitioners in the field, the conclusion that engaged 
learning is the most beneficial to student achievement is encouraging.
In addition to engaged learning, the assessment of innovative structures of cap-
stone courses in economics provided the foundation for our approach. For example, 
Li and Simonson (2016) describe the setup and the outcomes of a senior research 
course in economics in a public university. They concluded that the redesign of 
the course to provide an overview of the scientific research process showed positive 
effects on student learning outcomes and on their satisfaction with the course. The 
model presented in this chapter builds on this idea by involving students in the 
actual scientific research process.
Partnership Building
Last, the literature pertaining to the creation of collaborative partnerships between 
academic institutions and practitioners was surveyed. Fry and Kolb (1979), for 
example, suggest that the experiential learning approach integrates perceptive 
understanding of concepts with practical experience and is to be used in liberal arts 
colleges. In subsequent decades, many partnerships were formed, and the literature 
regarding them is abundant. Reardon (2000) describes the value of a university’s 
community engagements and Ishisaka, Sohng, Farwell, and Uehara (2004) present 
an example of an “engaged” social work education. Gavigan (2010) showcases the 
value of integrating career offices on campus with the academic departments to 
provide meaningful summer internships opportunities for students.
The experiential learning model that is the focus of this paper went even fur-
ther. While the collaboration between the academy and practitioners resembles the 
projects described in the above-cited papers, the scope of students’ work is different. 
The uniqueness of this project is that students were engaged in the practices specific 
to their future professional field (in this case, economics). This expansion allowed 
students to not only contribute to the output of the organization, but to also gain 
an understanding of what it means to be an economist.
With the foregoing research as a base, a new experiential learning application 
was conceived. The main goal of this project was to bridge the two knowledge 
domains in which students operate: the academic classroom and the workplace. 
By using the theoretical underpinnings of intuition development, engaged learn-
ing, and the curriculum of experience, and by applying experiential pedagogy, the 
­university classroom and the professional environment were integrated.
Since the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) is an economic 
think tank, it is focused on providing value-added programs to students studying 
or intending to study economics, as well as those studying related disciplines such 
as business, finance, accounting, or entrepreneurship. Thus, a natural partner from 
academia was the Business School of the University of Sioux Falls. Participating 
students were from diverse courses of study: economics, marketing, accounting, 
and business. During the project, every effort was made to devise opportunities 

56  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
for students to debrief in ways that highlighted the possible synergies between the 
academy and the real world, as well as the development of knowledge, compe-
tencies, skills, and expert intuition relevant to their future careers. It is therefore 
argued that an applied research course in any discipline is a vehicle to provide the 
missing link from core knowledge to expertise and intuition.
The next section ties together the experiential learning partnership model with 
the goal of developing highly effective leaders who can employ intuition in the 
executive arts. Based on the collected qualitative evidence of improved students 
learning outcomes, a suggested process by which similar experiential learning part-
nerships can be built has also been included.
The Experiential Learning Partnership: The Missing Link
The focus of this section is to argue that the integration of academia and the work-
place is beneficial to all parties involved and that those benefits spill over to firms 
seeking students as potential employees with this expanded skill set. Building 
expert knowledge and intuition through experiential learning contributes to the 
development of future leaders of the profession. It benefits the students as well as 
their future employers because they carry with them management experience and 
people skills. Though the case described here relates to economics, there is a high 
degree of confidence that this approach can be replicated in any industry.
The core idea and related applications are based on the education literature that 
postulates that the experiential learning in the workplace is not just the opportu-
nity to “apply” the material learned in the classroom, but it complements the aca-
demic learning by developing life skills and intuition that are highly transferrable 
to any environment.
Figure 4.1 shows that the applied economic research course, described here, 
encompasses the core knowledge gained in the classroom and intuitive insight 
obtained in the office setting. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this experiential

learning opportunity connects young people on a career path with a leadership 
track. The contribution of this approach is the recognition that experiential learn-
ing ­creates the potential for students to become executive leaders.
The progression of students’ skills and intuition acquisition is shown through-
out a career in Figure 4.2. The starting point of the trajectory is an applied research 
course conducted in the form of experiential learning. Upon graduation, using 
intuitive knowledge, intuitive insight, and confidence gained in the course, he or 
she enters a workplace, gaining additional practical experience and operationalizing 
intuition. With experience and intuition in hand, an expert develops into a team 
leader and eventually into an executive. The executive functions serve to create and 
maintain a system of cooperative effort.* The operation of such systems requires the 
highest development of the executive arts.†
To clarify this transmission mechanism, we refer to the classic book of Barnard 
(1945) on the functions of the executive. In this treatise, Barnard argues that 
the development of leadership abilities is of most importance for an executive.

The higher the position of authority, the more general abilities are required. In 
addition to leadership abilities, the intangible types of personal traits are of major 
importance. Those traits, such as manners, speech, intuition, and so on, make 
possible the development of important executive influences in the organization. 
In Figure 4.2, we show the progression of acquiring core knowledge, experience 
(which embodies the application of those skills), and intuition (encompassing 
both: intuitive knowledge and intuitive insight) throughout a career. The con-
tribution here is that a successful trajectory of becoming an executive leader 
starts at the experiential learning partnership model. Throughout this paper, we 
argue that such partnership is a missing link between the educational attainment 
and career aspirations of the next generation of professionals. We fully recog-
nize, however, that this course is laying a foundation for such an alignment. 
The students will need to take matters in their own hands to ensure that the 
­transformation of knowledge, skills, and experiences into an executive function-
ality does materialize.
The experiential learning application is now being conducted between a prac-
titioner, the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), and an academic 
institution, the University of Sioux Falls (USF). AIER and USF piloted a collabo-
ration to seamlessly integrate a university class in applied economic research with 
the ongoing work of an economic think-tank. The students register for the course, 
meet at the specified times, complete the deliverables required by the instructor, 
and are assigned a final grade for the course. At the same time, the practitioners, 
in this case researchers at AIER, section out a piece of their research, introduce the 
students to the research question, provide mentoring to the students throughout 
their research, and offer robust feedback like what would be received if the students 
were the practitioner’s employees.
While the daily work of the students is done under the tutelage of the faculty 
member, there exists an expert researcher who is to guide, support, and further 
challenge the students in this endeavor. To minimize the supervisory burden on 
the practitioner, students are assembled into teams which tackle different projects 
that are within the research agenda of the practitioner. To sustain this collabora-
tion, students engage with their assigned researchers via videoconference during 
­pre-established times in the course, much in the same way business colleagues in 
locations around the globe would meet electronically to discuss a shared project. 
During these meetings, the mentor-researchers provide feedback, answer ques-
tions, and further develop personal relationships important to any team endeavor.
In terms of the students learning outcomes, we identified gains in both hard 
and soft skills. Students expanded hard skills of economic research such as devel-
oping research proposals, designing a research plan, compiling data, and writing a 
complete academic paper. In terms of soft skills, identified in Heckman and Kautz 
(2012) and elaborated by Deming (2015), students reported that through this pro-
gram they learned to be confident, independent thinkers. They learned to self-guide

their research progress, and communicate and defend their arguments and results 
to the experts.
The debriefings with students during and after the completion of the course 
were done robustly and with great care. Kahneman (2011) argues that timely 
feedback is essential to the development of expert intuition. During the regularly 
scheduled conversations, the professor has an opportunity to mentor students, cor-
rect courses of action, and help eliminate roadblocks. During the final debriefings 
with practitioners, students receive constructive, corrective feedback confirming 
their perception of the work environment, research processes and products. During 
those conversations and in formal written evaluation forms, students identified 
their confidence in being able to enter and grow in the profession of their choos-
ing. They were enthusiastic about entering the workforce and becoming successful 
practitioners themselves.
Students’ reflections, presented in Table 4.1, support the positive learning out-
comes that we set as goals for this program. To meet the demands of the twenty-
first century, students become knowledgeable, adaptable people who can work with 
others to innovate and thrive in the new economy.

How to Replicate This Approach
Our vision is to build a network of academia-practitioner collaboratives throughout 
the country, and, with the help of technology, throughout the world. While the 
model has been developed, and tested with a focus on economic research, the struc-
ture of the model and ultimately, the positive results, are not limited to that field. 
Practitioners can be pulled from policy think tanks, private industries, national 
nonprofits, and government agencies, to name just a few.
To make it easier for aspirants in these fields and others to replicate this pro-
gram, the implementation has been distilled into a 10-step process. These steps 
reflect the learning from the initial collaboration and subsequent iterations includ-
ing the expansion of the model to a new partner university. Potential collaborators 
can step through the process as it is summarized in Table 4.2.
In the second iteration of this program, another academic institution—Missouri 
University of Science and Technology—joined USF and AIER. This experience 
allowed for the identification of a first-year learning curve. Both, the “new” profes-
sor and the AIER supervisor needed to adjust their expectations about what could 
feasibly be accomplished, what the dynamics of the teams would be, and how to 
solve scheduling and technology related problems. Even though one could theoreti-
cally follow the 10-step guide (Table 4.2), the implementation of each step will take 
time and effort. However, if the academic and the practitioner are prepared to be 
flexible and attuned to each other’s needs, the program will still be a success. The

Professionalism
“I gained a better understanding of the 
professionalism that it takes to excel in the business 
world and the importance of conducting yourself in 
a professional manner at all times.”
“I gained experience working with professionals in 
the workplace.”
“I learned that economic researchers are not just 
anti-social people who lock themselves in offices 
doing work all day. … These researchers are smart, 
intelligent people who are problem solvers, 
statisticians, and people with personality who 
appreciate sarcasm (which I thoroughly enjoyed).”
“AIER has given me an opportunity to partake in an 
economic research environment, my first experience 
outside of the services industry.”

Table 4.2  Experiential Learning Partnership Model—Building  
a New Partnership
Steps
Description
Step 1:
Develop a 
Partnership
The partnership is the bedrock of this model and 
requires a significant infusion of time for both the 
university and the practitioner. It should be 
understood from the start that full implementation of 
this model will cover more than one academic year and 
may require additional investments in technology and 
staff time.
Step 2:
Select or Develop 
the Course
This model for experiential learning needs to relate to a 
class where the students have committed time and are 
invested in the outcome. For the piloted program, with 
its focus on economic research, the course needs to 
include prerequisite courses in microeconomics, 
macroeconomics, and statistics. It is the belief of the 
authors that this model will work successfully in other 
disciplines as well. In those cases, modifications will 
need to be made to ensure students enter the class with 
the requisite knowledge and skill set to complete the 
project to the level required by the practitioner. Without 
those skills, the benefits of the experiential learning 
model break down.
Step 3:
Establish Desired 
Deliverables and 
Outcomes
While the precise learning outcomes and 
deliverables need to be established by the university 
partner, it must meet the requirements of both parties 
and there needs to be clarity around these issues 
before the course begins. In the initial pilot, it was 
established that students would produce an academic 
paper in a format that was ready for publication. 
When the program was expanded, this question 
needed to be addressed by the new university. In this 
case, less emphasis was placed on writing and a 
greater focus was given to the data acquisition, 
analysis, and presentation of results. Both sets of 
outcomes and deliverables functioned well within the 
model and still use experiential learning to link core 
academic knowledge with the ongoing work of the 
practitioner.

Steps
Description
Step 4:
Enroll Students
While this is intuitive to most, there are additional 
considerations that need to be attended to at the 
university level including: registration timeline, the role 
of the course in the students’ degree plan, and 
enrollment management. One challenge worthy of note 
is the inherent mismatch on timelines between a 
university and a practitioner. That is, the enrollment 
process happens very far in advance of the course. 
Given the fluid nature of the projects being proposed by 
the practitioner, students may need to register for the 
course without knowing the exact focus of the research 
or project.
Step 5:
Select a Topic
The selection of the final research topic falls heavily on the 
practitioner. Moreover, to make this process meaningful 
for both partners, it should contribute to the work being 
done by the practitioner. As the topics are developed, 
practitioners need to be aware of staffing strengths and 
limitations. While this process is often an enjoyable 
change for the researchers and other employees who 
provide the mentoring and feedback, it can also be quite 
time consuming and draw them away from other work. 
Practitioners will also need to anticipate potential staff 
changes and how they will fill the resulting void. An 
additional consideration for the practitioner will be 
selecting topics or projects that allow the practitioner 
employees to showcase their interests and passions. It has 
been observed that on the topics where the mentoring 
researchers were highly interested and engaged, the 
students were also more interested and engaged. This all 
requires a high level of flexibility on the part of the 
university faculty member. Specifically, it may be the case 
that the topics and/or project details are not available until 
immediately before the course begins.
Step 6:
Develop a Work 
Plan
A challenge of working within the confines of a semester-
long course is that the work plan will need to 
incorporate the academic calendar as well as time for 
practitioner to provide meaningful feedback. Having 
pre-scheduled touch points between the students and 
their mentor researchers allowed students and 
researchers to plan their schedules to ensure full 
participation.
Table 4.2  (Continued)

The Missing Link: Experiential Learning  ◾  63
Steps
Description
Step 7:
Assign Students to 
Teams
One of the successes of the pilot program was the ability 
to match students together in balanced teams that 
included a mix of quantitative, technical, and writing 
skills. The noticeable imbalance between teams is an 
example of the “ill-structured project” and as such it 
supports the learning goals of this model.
Step 8:
Coordinate 
Program Details
During the semester, the mentoring researchers and the 
students came together via WebEx. These 
videoconferences were important to introduce students 
and mentors, to establish trust, and to provide a forum 
for ideas, questions, and concerns. Coordination 
extended well beyond the setting of dates and times. 
Resources are required on both ends to ensure that the 
proper technology is in place and working. Additional 
coordination is required to track team progress and 
meet assessment requirements.
Step 9:
Assess Program 
Successes and 
Shortcomings
Ultimately, the model exists to produce results. 
Considering that, short-term and longer-term student 
assessments are needed to measure the degree to which 
the experiences of the students are sufficiently 
advancing their level of professional expertise and 
supporting the development of intuition. This has been 
done with open-ended reflection questions, online 
surveys, and structured debriefing sessions immediately 
upon completion of the course. Longer-term follow-up 
methods and measurements are still being developed. 
The feedback from the students will be combined with 
the employer survey data to match the experiences in 
this learning model with the expertise needed in various 
industries.
Step 10:
Modify the 
Program
As the research reflects, the workplace continues to 
change and, as such, ongoing adjustments will need to 
be made to the model. The immediate feedback from 
students allows for adjustments to be made from one 
academic year to the next. Incorporation of longer-term 
feedback will, naturally, positively change the model in 
more subtle ways.
Table 4.2  (Continued)

64  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
students were generally spared from encountering the hiccups around logistics, but 
the professor must be prepared to manage these in a timely manner.
To enact the vision is to scale up in a way that will include potentially 
many more partners in a single collaboration. It is the belief of the authors that 
the work of the practitioners can, and ultimately will, be leveraged across several 
academic institutions and many students. As this collaboration grows, stacking 
the process of joining the group semester-by-semester is highly recommended. 
That is, to minimize the impact of the first-year learning curve mentioned ear-
lier, it is recommended that only one or two new partners be added with each 
new iteration. This will allow the practitioners to work more closely with the 
new institutions and curtail the disruptions for the other partners. This way, 
after the first iteration of the program, in each semester the “new” entrant will 
learn the ropes, while the “experienced” institutions will pull the project for-
ward. We ­recommend, initially, that the teams be comprised of students from 
one university. Only later, when all parties are seasoned participants, the practice 
could be broadened to mix students from different universities to serve on the 
same team. This experience will enhance students’ confidence, ability to resolve 
conflicts, and expert intuition.
Conclusion
As the literature documents, changes in the labor market, combined with global 
competition, require a change in how human capital is developed. As such, by 
breaking down the walls between college classrooms and the institutions that will 
employ college graduates, we expose students to the workplace practices and actively 
engage them in the learning process. The hands-on nature of our project forced stu-
dents to be flexible as they experienced challenges working in groups, adjustments 
to the scope of their projects, or changes in the research staff supporting their work.
It is understood that the skills needed in young graduates today are not likely to 
be the skills that will carry them for their entire careers. Partnerships, such as the 
one described in this chapter, provide opportunities for problem solving, communi-
cation, and collaboration, and develop a foundation for skills that are transferable. 
Such partnerships are to be fostered. Beyond the application of economic theories, 
students gained an understanding of research methodologies, proficiency in digital 
literacy, and advanced skills in data management and analysis.
The contribution of the experiential learning exercise showcased in this chapter 
is twofold. First, is the development of the 10-step guide on how to build a new 
partnership. This guide provides a starting point for new university-practitioner 
partnerships in various fields of study. The second contribution is the illustration of 
the theoretical transmission mechanism from experiential learning through intu-
ition to executive arts. It is the goal of future studies to empirically support such 
a claim. We want to caution, however, that the availability of such experiential 

The Missing Link: Experiential Learning  ◾  65
learning partnerships and the transmission mechanism does not guarantee the con-
version to a successful executive leader for every person. It is up to each individual 
student who goes through the program to take this opportunity and develop it to 
fruition.
The students in university classrooms today are the employees and leaders of 
the next decade. By investing time in developing partnerships between academic 
institutions and practitioners, we are integrating the academy and the workplace, 
broadening the base of experiences on which potential employees will draw, and 
striving to enhance the intuitive decision-making of future executives.

Chapter 5
The Foundations of Trust
Joanna Paliszkiewicz
Introduction
Nowadays, in the era of different crises, the role of trust is very important. Trust 
is difficult to establish and sustain. It is also easy to destroy. Trust is very fragile.
Many researchers and practitioners have explored the significance of trust in 
the organization (Bibb & Kourdi, 2004; Covey, 2009; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; 
Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Paliszkiewicz, 2013; Paliszkiewicz & Koohang, 
2016; Six, 2004; Sprenger, 2004).
According to researchers, building trust is essential to establishing employee loy-
alty (Costigan, Ilter, & Berman, 1998), commitment (Eikeland, 2015; Lewicka &  
Krot, 2015), communication and information exchange (Doney & Canon, 1997; 
Hakanen & Soudunsaari, 2012; Li, Poppo, & Zhou, 2010; Malhotra & Murnighan, 
2002; Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Tyler, 2003; Young & Daniel, 2003), and effective-
ness and organizational performance (Lewis & Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995; 
Nooteboom, 2002; Paliszkiewicz, Gołuchowski, & Koohang, 2015; Paliszkiewicz, 
Koohang, & Horn Nord, 2014; Pangil & Chan, 2014). Trust also mitigates 
uncertainty about partner behavior (Krishnan, Martin, & Noorderhaven, 2006).

70  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
The dynamics of trust enhancement are a very important topic of research (Muethel 
& Bond, 2013).
The aim of this chapter is to present the foundations of trust based on a criti-
cal literature review and to propose future research in this area. In the first part of 
the chapter, the definitions of trust are presented. Next, the types of trust and the 
methods for building trust are described. Finally, the practical implications, con-
clusions, and future directions are proposed.
Trust Definitions
The concept of trust has been researched in various disciplines, such as psychol-
ogy, sociology, economy, management, marketing, ergonomics, human-computer 
interaction, and electronic commerce. However, researchers from different fields 
take different approaches to understand this phenomenon (Yoon, 2014). There is 
a consensus among scholars that trust is difficult to define. It is easier to define 
distrust than trust. However, several efforts to derive a definition of trust from dif-
ferent disciplines have been made. The most common definitions of trust are listed 
in chronological order in Table 5.1.
Trust in the literature has also been defined as a probabilistic evaluation of 
trustworthiness, as a relationship based on ethical norms or as an agent’s attitude 
(Taddeo, 2009). Psychologists underline that trust is a personal trait. Per sociolo-
gists, without trust, you cannot create any relationship and the trust is voluntary. 
In business, trust usually forms as part of a formal contract. In management, 
it is an employee’s loyalty to execute an organization’s goals (Paliszkiewicz & 
Koohang, 2016).
According to Paliszkiewicz (2013), trust is the belief that another party: (1) will 
not act in a way that is harmful to the trusting firm, (2) will act in such a way that it 
is beneficial to the trusting firm, (3) will act reliably, and (4) will behave or respond 
in a predictable and mutually acceptable manner.
Trust can be described as interpersonal and it cannot be compulsory. It appears 
between two individuals and depends on the situation. Trust is dynamic, very easy 
to destroy, and difficult to rebuild. Sometimes it is even impossible to rebuild trust.
Types of Trust
Trust is multidimensional and complex, which is why there are so many proposi-
tions in the literature for different types of trust. The most common types of trust 
are listed in chronological order in Table 5.2.

74  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Institutional-based trust, characteristic-based trust, and process-based trust were 
introduced by Zucker (1986). According to Zucker, institutional-based trust is related 
to formal societal structures depending on the firm—specific or individual attri-
butes and on intermediary attributes. Characteristic-based trust is related to a person. 
Process-based trust is related to expected or past experience, for example, reputation.
Rousseau et al. (1988) described three basic types of trust: calculus-based trust, 
relational trust, and institution-based trust. Calculus-based trust attempts will cal-
culate whether the relationship will pay off. Relational trust increases over time 
through repeated interactions that enable to create an experience and to predict the 
behavior of others in the future. Institution-based trust is related to institutions, 
cultural, and societal norms and with the trustor’s feeling of security related to 
guarantees, regulations, or the legal system.
Lewicki and Bunker (1996) distinguish three levels of trust. The first level is 
calculus-based like in the proposition of Rousseau et al. (1988). The second level is 
called knowledge-based in which trust begins to develop based on previous experi-
ence. The third level of trust is identification-based. At this level, people know each 
other and may predict others’ behaviors.
Conditional and unconditional types of trust are described by Jones and 
George (1998). Conditional trust is based on positive expectations on activities and 
intention. Unconditional trust occurs when individuals abandon the pretense of 
suspending belief. In this situation, this means that the relationship is significant.
Solomon and Flores (2001) classified trust as basic, simple, blind, and authen-
tic. Basic trust is related to the disposition to trust. It can be described as the ability 
to create relationships with others. In simple trust, people do not have suspicions. 
They do not question each other’s trustworthiness. Blind trust means that people 
think that other parties cannot act against them. Authentic trust is the most mature 
type of trust based on previous individual experiences.
According to Bibb and Kourdi (2004), there are four different types of trust: 
self-trust, rational trust, structural trust, and transactional trust. Self-trust is fun-
damental for building trust with other people. If people do not trust themselves, it 
is unlikely that others will trust them. Rational trust is based on previous experi-
ences. Structural trust is the type of trust that people put in entire institutions. 
Transactional trust is specific and appears in a particular context.
Paul and McDaniel (2004) presented four types of trust: calculative, com-
petence, relational, and integrated. Calculative trust is based on the economic 
exchange theory. Competence trust is based on expectations that another party is 
capable of doing what it says (Mayer et al., 1995; Mishra, 1996). Relational trust 
is the extent that one party feels a personal attachment to the other party and 
wants to behave properly (Jarvenpaa, Knoll, & Leidner, 1998; Mayer et al., 1995). 
An integrated type of trust is a combination of different types of trust, which are 
related to each other.
Siegrist et al. (2005) and Ding et al. (2011) described two types of trust. They 
are general trust and specific trust. General trust is presented as trust toward people 

The Foundations of Trust  ◾  75
in general and specific trust refers to trust specifically related to the given referent 
(for example, trust to the company). General trust is also referred to as basic trust 
(Brenkert, 1998; Solomon & Flores, 2001).
Puusa and Tolvanen (2006) classified trust in three levels: individual, group, 
and systems. At the first level, trust is related to interpersonal interactions; at the 
second level, trust is linked with project teams; and at the third level, trust relates 
to the reputation of the organization.
Delhey et al. (2011) distinguished two types of trust: in-group and out-group. 
In-group trust involves a narrow circle of familiar people, such as family, neigh-
bors, and individuals known personally (particularistic trust). Out-group trust con-
cerns with a wider circle of unfamiliar people (for example, people from different 
countries).
Krot and Lewicka (2012) presented horizontal trust (between co-workers), 
­vertical trust (between managers and employees or between employees and manag-
ers), and institutional trust (between employees and organizations).
The Process of Building Trust in Organizations
Trust building can be defined as an interactive process in which people learn how 
to maintain trustworthiness in organizations. Trust is built up gradually and rein-
forced by previous positive experiences (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). It needs time 
to be developed.
According to Bracey (2002), the leader may start building interpersonal trust 
using the following five TRUST principles: be Transparent, be Responsive, Use 
care, be Sincere, be Trustworthy. Galford and Drapeau (2002) presented the 
SEEKER model with the critical elements of trust building: Show that you under-
stand the needs of the person and/or group; Establish the guiding principles of 
how you will operate; Explain the resources you will use in this work; Keep to the 
principles you have elaborated; Engage in constant, honest, two-way communica-
tion; Reinforce through consistent behaviors. According to Mishra and Mishra 
(2008), the main characteristics that help in trust building are reliability, openness, 
competence, and compassion. Sprenger (2004) listed reliability, consistency, pre-
dictability, keeping promises, fairness, loyalty, honesty, discretion, and credibility 
as the important traits in this area. According to Armour (2007), the characteristics 
include humility, integrity, truth, responsiveness, unblemished fair play, support 
and encouragement, and team care.
According to Boutros and Joseph (2007), trust should be carefully built, care-
fully maintained, and steadfastly renovated as needed. The foundation of trust is self-
trust defined as the ability to trust oneself wisely and authentically (Lehrer, 1997). 
By using intuition, people can develop trust in themselves. Intuition has a significant 
role in trust building in business and management (Burke & Miller, 1999; Dane &  
Pratt, 2007; Hayes, Allinson, & Armstrong, 2004; Miles & Sadler-Smith, 2014;

Miller & Ireland, 2005; Parikh, Neubauer, & Lank, 1994; Sadler-Smith & Shefy, 
2004; Salas, Rosen, & Diaz Granados, 2010). Some actions that support and destroy 
trust in organizations are presented in Table 5.3.
The process of trust building is always related to a certain amount of risk. 
According to Six (2007), there are three main factors that make it difficult to build 
trust: the first is the interactive process that involves (at least) two individuals learn-
ing about each other’s trustworthiness; the second is to build up trust gradually and

incrementally, reinforced by previous trusting behavior and previous positive expe-
riences; and the third is that there is no absolute certainty that trust will be hon-
ored. Recovering trust requires three separate actions (Boutros & Joseph, 2007): 
sincere apologies, permitting the affected person to influence you, and fulfilling 
the promise. Distrust affects different areas of the organization, for example, lack 
of communications, unclear policy of the organization, pressure on the workforce, 
and lack of ethics (Shockley-Zalabak, Morreale, & Hackman, 2010). Distrust usu-
ally appears in organizations where the future is insecure, workers are not treated 
fairly, and working conditions are inadequate (Kiefer, 2005; Wong, Wong, Ngo, & 
Lui, 2005). The costs of distrust are related to broken reputations, negative ­attitudes 
toward work, lower organizational performance, and making bad decisions.
Conclusion and Propositions for Future Research
The process of building and maintaining trust is very important in organizations. In 
the literature, we can find a lot of research, which confirms this importance. Trust 
affects many areas of organizational life in a positive way, for example, it stimu-
lates collaboration (Anderson & Narus, 1990; Ganesan, 1994; Jap, 1999; Koohang, 
Paliszkiewicz, & Gołuchowski, 2017; Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Paliszkiewicz, 2013), 
it enables creating relationships (Ganesan, 1994; Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Ring & 
Van de Ven, 1992), it facilitates management coordination among different orga-
nizational units (Doney, Cannon, & Mullen, 1998; McAllister, 1995), and it 
improves the organizational climate (Das & Teng, 1998). The benefits of trust are 
obvious, but methods of building trust and maintaining it still remain a challenge 
to most people in organizations.
The theory described in this chapter requires empirical testing. There is a need 
for research related to how trust is built and re-built. Future research should focus 
on the costs and benefits of building and maintaining trust using people of differ-
ent cultures to measure the level of trust and describe the meaning and importance 
of trust. The methods of measuring trust should be studied. A further challenge to 
the researcher is to study how trust influences intuition and decision-making.

Introduction
Leadership is a multifaceted topic in today’s globalized world (Gandolfi & Stone, 
2016). It has a fundamental role in directing and shaping organizations by provid-
ing a sense of direction, vision, and purpose for all members. New questions and 
challenges in management continue to emerge with regard to effective leadership 
that can influence the organizational culture, knowledge sharing, employees’ posi-
tive attitudes toward their jobs, and create ethical norms (e.g., Barling, Weber, &  
Kelloway, 1996; Charbonneau, Barling, & Kelloway, 2001; Grojean, Resick, 
Dickson, & Smith, 2004; Howell & Avolio, 1993; Mayer, Kuenzi, Greenbaum, 
Bardes, & Salvador, 2009; Schaubroeck et al., 2012).
Leadership is often described as a process of influence toward the accomplish-
ment of objectives of the organization (Bass, 1960; Katz & Kahn, 1966). This view 
of leadership generally focuses on the relationship between a leader and follower, 
but not on what conditions need to be in place for successful leadership.
Koohang, Paliszkiewicz, and Gołuchowski (2017) proposed a research model 
that explored the influence of effective leadership on organizational trust among 
employees, knowledge management processes within organizations, and organi-
zational performance. The results of their study showed that effective leadership 
(i.e., leading organization, leading people, and leading self), increased trust among 
employees, advanced the successful implementation of knowledge management 
processes, and in turn improved organizational performance.
The goal of this chapter is to examine whether effective leadership (leading 
organization, leading people, and leading self) as a predicting variable influences 
the three predictor variables of trust, knowledge management, and organizational 
performance within organizations.
Review of the Literature
Trust
Trust is vital in all spheres of human and professional life. Trust has been a topic 
of research in many areas of science, for example, in psychology, sociology, and 
management. Thus, in the literature, there are different propositions of the defini-
tion of trust.
Psychologists define it as a personal trait (Erikson, 1968; Rotter, 1967) or as a 
feeling, which is very close to love (Gibb, 1978). People vary in terms of how much

and when they are willing to trust (Das & Teng, 2004). Differentiation in the 
­propensity to trust among people can be related to their developmental experiences, 
personality types, and cultural backgrounds (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), 
but it also depends on previous personal experiences and socialization.
Sociologists describe trust as a part of a social structure (e.g., Garfinkel, 1967; 
Lewis & Weigert, 1985a; Shapiro, 1987). Some, such as Lewis and Weigert (1985a) 
insist that trust cannot be considered only as a personality trait because trust is a 
complex and multidimensional phenomenon. Sociologists research trust as a fun-
dament of friendship, families, or nations. According to Sztompka (1999), trust is 
the expectation that other people, groups, or institutions with whom we interact 
will act in ways conducive to our well-being.
Trust is important in professional life (Grudzewski, Hejduk, Sankowska, & 
Wańtuchowicz, 2007). In the context of management, Mayer et al. (1995, p. 712) 
characterize trust as “the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of 
another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular 
action important to the trustor, irrespective of the [trustor’s] ability to monitor or 
control that other party.” Paliszkiewicz (2013) defines trust as the belief and opti-
mistic expectation that another party will act in such a way that it is beneficial to 
the trusting party, and will act reliably and will behave or respond in a predictable 
and mutually acceptable manner. Morgan and Hunt (1994, p. 23) define trust as 
“one party’s confidence in an exchange partner’s reliability and integrity.”
The importance of trust in management has been described in literature. There 
are many aspects in organizations on which trust influences, for example: increase 
team performance (Costa, 2003; Costa, Roe, & Taillieu, 2001; Klimoski & Karol, 
1976); limit transaction costs (Doney et al., 1998; Dore, 1983; Handy, 2005); 
stimulate collaboration among partners (Anderson  & Narus, 1990; Ganesan, 
1994; Jap, 1999; Morgan  & Hunt, 1994; Paliszkiewicz, 2013); facilitate long-
term relationships (Ganesan, 1994; Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Ring & Van de Ven, 
1992); facilitate management coordination among different organizational units 
(Doney et al., 1998; McAllister, 1995); contribute to effective implementation of 
strategies (Doney et al., 1998); facilitate more open communication and sharing 
of ­knowledge (Chowdhury, 2005; Lewis  & Weigert, 1985b; McAllister, 1995; 
Seppanen, Blomqvist, & Sundqvist, 2007); and enhance organizational perfor-
mance (Paliszkiewicz, Koohang, & Horn Nord, 2014; Seppanen et al., 2007).
Knowledge Management
Knowledge management has been a popular research topic for many scholars 
(Davenport & Prusak, 1998; Liebowitz, 2008, 2012, 2016; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 
1995; Sveiby, 1987). The focus of knowledge management is on how an organiza-
tion’s knowledge resources are used to contribute to the success of an organization 
(Holsapple, Hsiao, & Oh, 2016) and provide a sustainable competitive advantage (e.g., 
Davenport & Prusak, 1998; Foss & Pedersen, 2002; Grant, 1996; Spender & Grant, 

86  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
1996; Wang & Noe, 2010). According to a number of researchers, knowledge is a 
critical resource that should be managed strategically (Grant, 1996; Spender, 1996; 
Teece, 1998).
According to Brooking (1999, p. 154) the function of knowledge management 
is “. . . to guard and grow knowledge owned by individuals, and where possible, 
transfer the asset into a form where it can be more readily shared by other employ-
ees in the company.” Also, McInerney (2002) in his definition underlines an effort 
of knowledge management to increase useful knowledge within the organization 
that results in encouragement to communicate, offering opportunities to learn, and 
promoting the sharing of appropriate knowledge artifacts.
Holsapple and Joshi (2004, p. 596) define knowledge management as “. . . an 
entity’s systematic and deliberate efforts to expand, cultivate and apply available 
knowledge in ways that add value to the entity, in the sense of positive results in 
accomplishing its objectives or fulfilling its purpose.”
In the literature, there are many definitions of knowledge management. 
According to Awad and Ghaziri (2004), each definition of knowledge management 
contains several integral parts: using accessible knowledge from outside sources; 
embedding and storing knowledge in business processes, products, and services; 
representing knowledge in databases and documents; promoting knowledge 
growth through the organization’s culture and incentives; transferring and sharing 
knowledge throughout the organization; assessing the value of knowledge assets; 
and impacting knowledge on a regular basis.
Several studies have addressed knowledge management processes. They divide 
knowledge management into several processes, for example:
◾
◾Capturing, distributing, and using knowledge (Davenport, 1994)
◾
◾Creation, capture, and use of knowledge (Bassie, 1997)
◾
◾Creation, extraction, transformation, and storage of knowledge (Horwitch & 
Armacost, 2002)
◾
◾Acquisition, dissemination, and responsiveness (Darroch, 2003)
◾
◾Creating, gathering, organizing, storing, diffusing, using, and exploiting 
knowledge (Chong & Choi, 2005)
◾
◾Creation, accumulation, sharing, utilization, and internalization of knowl-
edge (Lee, Lee, & Kang, 2005)
Paliszkiewicz (2007) has proposed that knowledge management includes five 
processes. They are localization (all activities that indicate where knowledge exists); 
usage of knowledge (creating a set of roles and skills to effectively use knowledge); 
knowledge acquisition and development (the culture of embracing the knowledge 
that is acquired and developed); knowledge codification (the ability to successfully 
and continuously re-use the knowledge that organizations capture); and knowledge 
transfer (transmission of knowledge and use of transmitted knowledge).
Managers set the tone for how employees should perform. Within the frame-
work of knowledge management practices, managers are expected to create a

culture or an organizational climate that sets work norms and values that enable 
knowledge management and transfer of knowledge to produce value-added prod-
ucts and services.
Organizational Performance
Organizational performance is concerned with measures of how well a task is com-
pleted relative to criteria established for organizational effectiveness. It measures the 
progress and development and how well an organization is accomplishing its goals 
and objectives.
Different indicators of organizational performance are documented in the lit-
erature, that is, financial (Parmenter, 2009), quality (De Toni & Tonchia, 2001; 
Gosselin, 2005), reliability (White, 1996), productivity (Sinclair & Zairi, 1995), 
customer satisfaction (Neely, Gregory, & Platts, 2005), time (White, 1996), learn-
ing and growth (Sadler-Smith, Spicer, & Chaston, 2001), and leadership (Lieberson 
and O’Connor, 1972; Thomas, 1988). The most widely used organizational per-
formance indicators in the literature are those outlined by Sink and Tuttle (1989). 
These indicators include effectiveness, efficiency, quality, productivity, quality of 
work life, innovation, and profitability/budget ability.
Leadership
The topic or leadership has interested writers from centuries ranging from the early 
Greek philosophers such as Plato and Socrates to today’s researchers (Gandolfi & 
Stone, 2016). Leadership relates to how a leader chooses to lead and how his or her 
behavior influences an organization.
Leadership can be defined as “the process of interactive influence that occurs 
when, in a given context, some people accept someone as their leader to achieve 
common goals” (Silva, 2016, p. 3).
Winston and Patterson (2006, p. 7) describe leaders as “. . . one or more people 
who selects, equips, trains, and influences one or more follower(s) who have diverse 
gifts, abilities, and skills and focuses the follower(s) to the organization’s mission 
and objectives causing the follower(s) to willingly and enthusiastically expand spiri-
tual, emotional, and physical energy in a concerted coordinated effort to achieve 
the organizational mission and objectives.”
Kouzes and Posner (2007) present five key attributes for effective leadership: 
(1) model the way, (2) inspire a shared vision, (3) challenge the process, (4) enable 
others to act, and (5) encourage the heart.
According to Debowski (2006), the characteristics of good leaders tend to 
reflect four key themes: (1) the capacity to explain and clarify the organization’s 
purpose and priorities, (2) the development of the culture within which workers 
operate, (3) the creation and maintenance of good people practices to facilitate 
effective work, and (4) the encouragement of high performance in the work setting.

88  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Effective leadership within an organization is often viewed as the foundation 
for organizational performance and growth. In organizations that don’t have strong 
leaders, it is more difficult to meet performance expectations.
Purpose
Leadership effectiveness is vital to the success of any organization. Effective leader-
ship contributes to employees’ positive attitudes; employees’ positive work climate; 
employees’ willingness to share information; and the employees’ accomplishment 
of positive team performance (cf. Paliszkiewicz, Gołuchowski, & Koohang, 2015). 
Koohang et al. (2017) proposed a research model that explored leadership effec-
tiveness influence on organizational trust, knowledge management processes 
within organizations, and organizational performance. The findings of their study 
implied that effective leadership (i.e., leading organization, leading people, and 
leading self) contributed to increased trust among employees, advanced the suc-
cessful implementation of knowledge management processes, and in sequence 
improved organizational performance. In the present study, we attempt to exam-
ine whether effective leadership as a predicting variable influences the three pre-
dictor variables of trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance 
within organizations. Both the predicting and the predictor variables are defined 
by certain characteristics, that is, effective leadership has fifteen characteristics 
grouped into three constructs. Trust includes ten characteristics. Knowledge man-
agement has five characteristics and organizational performance includes seven 
characteristics.
Fifteen leadership characteristics were outlined in a study by Paliszkiewicz 
et al. (2015). Koohang et al. (2017, p. 526) grouped these characteristics into three 
leadership constructs: leading organization, leading people, and leading self. The 
leadership: leading organization encompasses the characteristics that assure organi-
zational advancement. The definitions of these characteristics are presented below.
Leadership: Leading Organization
1.	Change: Change is required, inevitable and continuous in any organizations. 
Organizational change requires sound leadership.
2.	Innovation: Innovation moves an organization forward. Leading innovation 
is the ability of a leader to lead innovation within an organization.
3.	Influence: A leader has the ability to influence and be flexible.
4.	Diversity and Inclusion: A leader has the ability to value individual differ-
ences. A leader respects and appreciates diversity and inclusion (Koohang 
et al., 2017).
The leadership: Leading people consists of the characteristics that enhance produc-
tivity among employees. The definitions of these characteristics are presented.

Trust, Knowledge Management, and Organizational Performance  ◾  89
Leadership: Leading People
1.	Motivation: Motivating employees brings about productivity. A leader’s task 
is to motivate and bring out the best in employees.
2.	Listening: A leader has the ability to be a good listener. A good listener will 
put employees at ease and make them comfortable.
3.	Empowerment: A leader has the ability to empower others to do their jobs. 
Empowering creates autonomy and responsibility; therefore, employees can 
participate in decision-making within organizations.
4.	Interpersonal Communication: A leader has the ability to communicate effec-
tively. He or she is interpersonal savvy.
5.	Building Relationships: A leader has the ability to build and sustain relation-
ships among employees.
6.	Conflict: A leader is not afraid of conflicts. A leader’s attitude toward conflict 
must be positive. A leader does not avoid conflict and considers conflict as an 
opportunity to improve a situation (Koohang et al., 2017).
The leadership: Leading self holds the characteristics that augment the development 
of a leader. The definitions of these characteristics are presented below.
Leadership: Leading Self
1.	Values/Principles: A leader must be grounded in values and principles. He or 
she makes decisions and solve problems based on his/her values and principles.
2.	Self-Awareness: A leader has the ability to be self-aware. A leader must be 
conscious and mindful of everyone within an organization.
3.	Feedback: A leader is comfortable to seek feedback from employees. A leader 
uses the feedback for self-improvement.
4.	Managing Time: A leader has the ability to effectively manage time.
5.	Learning: A leader continuously seeks the opportunity to learn. A leader seeks 
new knowledge, modify existing knowledge, and apply what he/she learns to 
situations for improvement (Koohang et al., 2017).
Ten characteristics of trust were selected from Paliszkiewicz et  al. (2015) and 
Koohang et al. (2017). These characteristics are ability/competence, benevolence, 
communication, congruency, consistency, dependability, integrity, openness, reli-
ability, and transparency. The definitions of these characteristics are as follows:
1.	Ability/Competence: One’s demonstration of ability and competence (knowl-
edge, skills, aptitude, qualification) lead to improved trust.
2.	Benevolence: One’s expression of compassion and empathy.
3.	Communication: One’s ability to effectively and constantly communicate 
(verbal, nonverbal, written, and visual).

90  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
4.	Congruency: Displaying the attitude and enthusiasm of partnership and asso-
ciation among people.
5.	Consistency: One’s demonstration of consistency in performing various tasks.
6.	Dependability: Exhibiting dedication, truthfulness, responsibility, and 
trustworthiness.
7.	Integrity: Displaying honesty and exhibiting moral and ethical principles.
8.	Openness: Showing acceptance and broad-mindedness.
9.	Reliability: Exhibiting the ability to be depended on in performing tasks.
10.	Transparency: One’s ability to be transparent—not to hide or block informa-
tion that is needed to perform tasks (cf. Paliszkiewicz et al., 2015).
The five knowledge management characteristics were chosen from Paliszkiewicz 
(2007). These characteristics include localization, usage of knowledge, knowledge 
acquisition and development, knowledge codification, and knowledge transfer. The 
definitions of these characteristics are presented as follows:
1.	Localization: Includes all activities that indicate where knowledge exists.
2.	Usage of Knowledge : Creating a set of roles and skills to effectively  
use knowledge.
3.	Knowledge Acquisition and Development: The culture of embracing  
the knowledge that is acquired and developed.
4.	Knowledge Codification: The ability to successfully and continuously re-use  
the knowledge that organizations capture.
5.	Knowledge Transfer: Transmission of knowledge and use of the transmitted 
knowledge.
The seven organizational performance characteristics were chosen from Sink 
and Tuttle (1989). These characteristics include effectiveness, efficiency, productiv-
ity, quality, quality of work life, innovation, and profitability. The definitions of 
these characteristics are presented as follows:
1.	Effectiveness: An output measure—the ratio of the expected output to the 
actual output
2.	Efficiency: An input measure—the ratio of the expected input to the actual 
input.
3.	Quality: Quality is the key to success of every organization. The quality is 
checked mainly at three levels input, output, and throughput or process qual-
ity. It can include actual input/output versus the expected accuracy, timeli-
ness, and so on.
4.	Productivity: Ratio of output to input.
5.	Quality of Work Life: Employee attitudes to work.
6.	Innovation: Measures the organization’s success in creating change
7.	Profitability/Budget Ability: An outcome to input ratio (Sink & Tuttle, 1989).

Trust, Knowledge Management, and Organizational Performance  ◾  91
As stated earlier, we attempt to find out which of the predictor variables (trust, 
knowledge management, and organizational performance) are most influential in 
predicting each of the leadership variables (leading organization, leading people, 
and leading self). Therefore, the following research questions (RQ) are stated:
RQ1: Which of the three predictor variables (trust, knowledge management, and 
organizational performance) are most influential in predicting leadership: 
leading organization?
RQ2: Which of the three predictor variables (trust, knowledge management, and 
organizational performance) are most influential in predicting leadership: 
leading people?
RQ3: Which of the three predictor variables (trust, knowledge management, and 
organizational performance) are most influential in predicting leadership: 
­leading self?
Methodology
The Instrument
The survey instrument was originally developed by Paliszkiewicz et al. (2015) with 
four constructs—leadership, trust, knowledge management, and organizational 
performance. Koohang et al. (2017) refined the leadership construct of the instru-
ment to include three separate constructs: leading organization, leading people, and 
leading self. The refined instrument, therefore, includes six constructs: (1) leader-
ship: leading organization, (2) leadership: leading people, (3) leadership: leading self,  
(4) trust, (5) knowledge management, and (6) organizational performance. The 
items for each construct are shown in Table 6.1.
Participants
The instrument was administered face-to-face to 116 subjects from various compa-
nies in Poland. The subjects were from all three levels of management: Senior/Top 
Level Management (52.6%), Middle Level Management (32.8%), and Supervisory/
Lower Level Management (14.7%). They were male (77%) and female (23%), work-
ing in both private (26%) and public (74%) companies. All subjects were over the 
age of 25. The subjects were assured confidentiality and anonymity.
Data Analysis
For each research question, we used multiple regression analysis (the Enter 
method, where all independent variables enter the model one at a time) to deter-
mine which of the independent variables can best predict the dependent variable.

The independent variables (predictor variables) were IV_1 = trust, IV_2 = knowl-
edge management, and IV_3 = organizational performance (for all three RQs). 
The  dependent variables (predicting variables) were DV_1 = leadership: lead-
ing organization (for RQ1), DV_2 = ­leadership: leading people (for RQ2), and  
DV_3 = leadership: leading self (for RQ3).
The multiple regression analysis produces a coefficient table to interpret the 
results for each research question. Prior to interpreting the results in the coefficient 
table, the test of multicollinearity is performed to examine the tolerance level and 
the variance inflation factor (VIF). The presence of multicollinearity constraints 
the size of R shows overlapping information and escalates the regression coeffi-
cients, thus prediction can be unstable (Stevens, 2001). To confirm the nonex-
istence of multicollinearity among the IVs, the tolerance level values for all IVs 
should be above .1, and the (VIF) values for all IVs should not be greater than 10.  
Once the nonexistence of multicollinearity is established, we proceed to interpret 
(1) the model summary, (2) the ANOVA, and (3) the coefficients table.
The model summary includes multiple correlations (R), squared multiple correla-
tions (R2), and adjusted squared multiple correlations (R2
adj). The model summary point 
to how well the independent variables predict the dependent variable (Stevens, 2001).
The ANOVA table shows the F test and the corresponding level of significance. 
If the F test is significant, then the relationship between the dependent variable and 
the independent variables is linear, therefore, the model significantly predicts the 
dependent variable (Stevens, 2001).
The coefficients table includes the beta weights, t and p values for the indepen-
dent variables, which are examined to determine the predictor variables that are 
most influential in predicting the dependent variable (Stevens, 2001).
Results
RQ1: Which of the three predictor variables (trust, knowledge management, and organi-
zational performance) are most influential in predicting leadership: leading organization?
The test of multicollinearity confirmed the nonexistence of multicollinearity 
among the IVs. The tolerance level values for all IVs were above .1, and the VIF  
values for all IVs were greater than 10. The values were as follows: IV_1 = trust 
(TL = .474, VIF = 2.108), IV_2 = knowledge management (TL = .555, VIF =1.802), 
and IV_3 = organizational performance (TL = .519, VIF =1.926). Once the non-
existence of multicollinearity was established, we then interpreted (1) the model 
summary, (2) the ANOVA, and (3) the coefficients table.
The model summary revealed the results of multiple correlation (R = .759), 
squared multiple correlation (R2 = .575), and the adjusted squared multiple correla-
tion (R2
adj = .564). These results indicated that the three independent variables of 
trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance can soundly pre-
dict the dependent variable of leadership: leading organization.

Trust, Knowledge Management, and Organizational Performance  ◾  95
The results of the ANOVA showed a significant difference (F3,112 = 50.585,  
p = .000) indicating that the relationship between the dependent variable of leader-
ship: leading organization and the three independent variables of trust, knowledge 
management, and organizational performance are linear; therefore, the model sig-
nificantly predicts the dependent variable of leadership: leading organization.
Table 6.2 shows the coefficients. The beta weights for the three independent 
variables of trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance are 
examined to determine the predictor variables that are most influential in pre-
dicting the dependent variable of leadership: leading organization. As can be seen, 
trust and knowledge management were the two predictor variables that were 
most influential in predicting leadership: leading organization.
The results of descriptive statistics are leadership: leading organization 
(Mean = 5.9461, STDV = .83001), trust (Mean = 6.1140, STDV = .70112), knowl-
edge management (Mean = 6.1362, STDV = .71291), and organizational perfor-
mance (Mean = 5.9754, STDV = .71844). The correlations are shown in Table 6.3.
RQ2: Which of the three predictor variables (trust, knowledge management, and 
organizational performance) are most influential in predicting leadership: leading people?
The test of multicollinearity confirmed the nonexistence of multicollinearity 
among the IVs. The tolerance level values for all IVs were above .1, and the VIF 
values for all IVs were greater than 10. The values were as follows: IV_1 = trust  
(TL = .474, VIF = 2.108), IV_2 = knowledge management (TL = .555, VIF =1.802), 
and IV_3 = organizational performance (TL = .519, VIF =1.926). Once the non-
existence of multicollinearity was established, we then interpreted (1) the model 
summary, (2) the ANOVA, and (3) the coefficients table.
The model summary revealed the results of multiple correlation (R = .737),

of trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance can soundly  
predict the dependent variable of leadership: leading people.
The results of the ANOVA showed a significant difference (F3,112 = 44.320, 
p = .000) indicating that the relationship between the dependent variable of lead-
ership: leading people and the three independent variables of trust, knowledge 
management, and organizational performance are linear, therefore, the model sig-
nificantly predicts the dependent variable of leadership: leading people.
Table 6.4 shows the coefficients. The beta weights for the three independent 
variables of trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance are 
examined to determine the predictor variables that are most influential in predicting 
the dependent variable of leadership: leading organization. As can be seen, trust, 
knowledge management, and organizational performance were the three predic-
tor variables that were most influential in predicting leadership: leading people.
The results of descriptive statistics are leadership: leading people (Mean = 
6.4586, STDV = .63247), trust (Mean = 6.1140, STDV = .70112), knowledge

RQ3: Which of the three predictor variables (trust, knowledge management, and 
organizational performance) are most influential in predicting leadership: leading self?
The test of multicollinearity confirmed the nonexistence of multicollinearity 
among the IVs. The tolerance level values for all IVs were above .1, and the VIF  
values for all IVs were greater than 10. The values were as follows: IV_1 = trust 
(TL = .474, VIF = 2.108), IV_2 = knowledge management (TL = .555, VIF =1.802), 
and IV_3 = organizational performance (TL = .519, VIF =1.926). Once the non-
existence of multicollinearity was established, we then interpreted (1) the model 
summary, (2) the ANOVA, and (3) the coefficients table.
The model summary revealed the results of multiple correlation (R = .769), 
squared multiple correlation (R2 = .591), and the adjusted squared multiple correla-
tion (R2
adj = .580). These results indicated that the three independent variables of 
trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance can soundly pre-
dict the dependent variable of leadership: leading self.
The results of the ANOVA showed a significant difference (F3,112 = 53.936, 
p = .000) indicating that the relationship between the dependent variable of leader-
ship: leading self and the three independent variables of trust, knowledge manage-
ment, and organizational performance are linear, therefore, the model significantly 
predicts the dependent variable of leadership: leading self.
Table 6.6 shows the coefficients. The beta weights for the three independent 
variables of trust, knowledge management, and organizational performance are 
examined to determine the predictor variables that are most influential in pre-
dicting the dependent variable of leadership: leading organization. As can be seen, 
trust and knowledge management were the two predictor variables that were 
most influential in predicting leadership: leading self.
The results of descriptive statistics are leadership: leading people (Mean = 
6.2522, STDV = .67847), trust (Mean = 6.1140, STDV = .70112), knowledge 
management (Mean = 6.1362, STDV = .71291), and organizational performance 
(Mean = 5.9754, STDV = .71844). The correlations are shown in Table 6.7.

Discussion
Koohang et al. (2017) proposed a research model that explored the leadership effec-
tiveness influence on organizational trust among employees, knowledge manage-
ment processes within organizations, and organizational performance. The findings 
of their study implied that effective leadership (i.e., leading organization, leading 
people, and leading self) in general, contributed to increased trust among employ-
ees, advanced the successful implementation of knowledge management processes, 
and in turn improved organizational performance.
The present study aimed to examine the influence of each leadership effective-
ness (leading organization, leading people, and leading self) as a predicting variable 
on the three predictor variables of trust, knowledge management, and organiza-
tional performance within organizations. The leading organization encompasses 
the characteristics of a leader that assure organizational advancement. The leading 
people consists of the characteristics of a leader that enhance productivity among 
employees. The leading self holds the characteristics that augment the development 
of a leader.

100  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
The findings for leadership: Leading organization indicated that trust and 
knowledge management were the two predictor variables that were most influential 
in predicting leadership: Leading organization. In other words, the leading organi-
zation characteristics of a leader (i.e., change, innovation, influence, and diversity/ 
inclusion) that collectively assure organizational advancement influence/predict 
(1) trust that ensures safe and satisfying relationships among people, and (2) knowl-
edge management that secures effective and efficient handling of information and 
resources within organizations.
The findings for leadership: Leading people indicated that trust, knowledge 
management, and organizational performance were the three predictor variables 
that were most influential in predicting leadership: Leading people. In other words, 
the leading people characteristics of a leader (i.e., motivation, empowerment, lis-
tening, interpersonal communication, building relationship, and conflict) that col-
lectively enhance productivity among employees influence/predict (1) trust that 
ensures safe and satisfying relationships among people, (2) knowledge management 
that secures effective and efficient handling of information and resources within 
organizations, and (3) organizational performance that is a tangible result/output 
(performance) of an organization as compared to its intended output.
The findings for leadership: Leading self indicated that trust and knowledge 
management were the two predictor variables that were most influential in pre-
dicting leadership: Leading self. In other words, the leading self characteristics 
(i.e., values/ principles, self-awareness, feedback, managing time, and learning) 
that augment development of a leader influence/predict (1) trust that ensures 
safe and satisfying relationships among people, and (2) knowledge management 
that secures effective and efficient handling of information and resources within 
organizations.
The findings of this study, in general, imply that effective leadership is the 
foundation of elevated trust, the successful implementation of knowledge man-
agement processes, and ultimately, enhanced organizational performance. In this 
chapter, we refer to effective leadership as characteristics that a leader must possess 
in leading organization, leading people, and leading self. These characteristics are 
not inherited, but learned and acquired by continuous leadership mentoring and 
development programs. Therefore, we recommend that leadership development 
programs include ongoing activities for employees on all the characteristics inher-
ent to leading organization, leading people, and leading self.
In leading organization, the leadership development programs should include 
activities for leaders to learn
◾
◾To be unconditionally open to change and innovation
◾
◾To positively influence and set a vision so it can be translated into realistic 
business strategies and expected outcomes
◾
◾To be respectful of diversity that brings about innovation and inclusion that 
guarantees the right conditions for everyone

Trust, Knowledge Management, and Organizational Performance  ◾  101
In leading people, the leadership development programs should include activi-
ties for leaders to learn
◾
◾To continuously motivate employees to bring out the best in people
◾
◾To listen and empower people to do their jobs
◾
◾To demonstrate excellent interpersonal communication skills that become 
vital in bringing people together to work effectively
◾
◾To build and sustain relationships with subordinates; conflict resolution must 
be a part of development programs.
In leading self, the leadership development programs should include activities 
for leaders to learn
◾
◾To make decisions based on their values and principles
◾
◾To understand their strengths and weaknesses and how to be willing to 
improve
◾
◾To continuously seek feedback from others, to manage their time effectively, 
and always seek the opportunity to learn
Additionally, the development programs should include leadership develop-
ment best practices such as 360-degree feedback, executive coaching, mentoring, 
networks, job assignments, and action learning.
Conclusion
Trust is vital because the presence of trust within organizations shape interpersonal 
relationships (Arrow, 1974), it develops and improves relationships (McLain & 
Hackman, 1999), and it is the foundation of any relationship that encourages and 
inspires decision-making within organizations (Porras, 2004). Knowledge man-
agement is vital because it is used to solve problems and make decisions within 
organizations (Davenport & Prusak, 1998). It influences performance and effi-
ciencies within the organization (Drucker, 2000). The knowledge management 
processes “. . . expand, cultivate and apply available knowledge in ways that 
add value to the entity . . .” (Holsapple & Joshi, 2004, p. 596). Trust has been 
shown to have a positive link with knowledge management (Chenhall & Smith, 
2003; Ferres, Connell, & Travaglione, 2005; Paliszkiewicz & Koohang, 2013; 
Paliszkiewicz, Koohang, Gołuchowski, & Nord, 2014) and organizational perfor-
mance (Paliszkiewicz et al., 2014; Paliszkiewicz & Koohang, 2013). Ultimately, it 
is effective leadership that plays a vital role in the increased trust among people, 
the successful knowledge management processes, and the enhanced organiza-
tional performance. The leadership development programs and the leadership best 
practices must be a natural part of the organizational culture that values ongoing

learning. Furthermore, these programs must be supported by all levels of leader-
ship within organizations.
This study has limitations. A convenient sample was used with subjects partici-
pating in the study from only one geographic area in a country in Eastern Europe. 
To increase the generalizability of the results, we recommend that this study be 
expanded to include population samples from different countries and wider geo-
graphic areas.

Trust and Knowledge 
Sharing: The Example 
of Higher Education 
in Poland

Introduction
The potential of knowledge sharing in academia is greatly emphasized in the litera-
ture (Chua, 2003; Fullwood et al., 2013; Iqbal et al., 2011; Świgoń, 2015; Tippins, 
2003). It is considered to be one of the factors for improving the quality, competi-
tiveness, and effectiveness of realizing research tasks and success in an increasingly 
competitive environment (Alavi & Leidner, 1999; Syed-Ikhsan & Rowland, 2004;

Van den Hooff & De Ridder, 2004; Yang, 2007), and for building higher learning 
­education institutions (Leja, 2013). The most recent literature indicates that knowl-
edge sharing is dependent on organizational conditions. It is often said that a specific 
sine qua noncondition of knowledge sharing is trust. Moreover, trust increases the 
possibilities of building competitive advantage (Barney & Hansen, 1994; Ciancutti 
& Stending, 2001), raising the organization’s effectiveness (Handy, 1995), reducing 
transactional costs, reacting to changes appearing in turbulent surroundings, and 
coordinating the organization (Shapiro, 1987). These phenomena may be investi-
gated using the example of evaluating trust and knowledge sharing at the level of the 
organization as exemplified by higher education institutions in Poland. Knowledge 
about the level of sharing knowledge and trust in academia is important, as it may 
contribute to an efficient functioning of an educational institution and raising the 
quality of its offered services (Świgoń, 2015). A lack of this knowledge may lead to 
impeding the process of knowledge sharing and even losing valuable and difficult 
to achieve resources of the organization.
The aim of this chapter is to indicate the conditions of the level of knowledge 
sharing and the levels of trust. The choice of academia as the object of research is 
justified by the fact that knowledge sharing constitutes an important factor in these 
conditions, which enables, among others, the promotion of vocational skills and 
competencies of academic instructors (Huo, 2013; Semradova & Hubáčková, 2014).
This chapter presents the results of empirical research conducted during the 
period of January–February 2016. To obtain empirical data, a research tool was 
used in the form of a questionnaire directed to scholars employed at scientific and 
didactic posts. A total of 60 persons were examined.
This chapter is composed of three parts. The first presents the essence of 
trust and knowledge sharing. The second presents the existing research related 
to knowledge sharing and trust. The third and last part shows the results of the 
empirical research.
Theoretical Background
Trust
Trust is “an expression of confidence between parties in an exchange of some kind; 
confidence that they will not be harmed or put at risk by the actions of the other 
party or confidence that no party to the exchange will exploit the other’s vulner-
ability” (Jones & George, 1998). It is considered the glue and lubricant of social 
capital (Anderson & Jack, 2002), the core of relationships (Mishra & Morrissey, 
2000), since it leads to behaviors, which enable coping with risk and uncertainty 
connected with interaction. Trust constitutes a positive factor of collaboration; 
it concerns the expectations and predictability of behaviors of the trustee on the 
part of the trustor. It refers to both the convictions and the decisions and actions 

Trust and Knowledge Sharing  ◾  109
(Dietz & Den Hartog, 2006). According to the opinion of Denise Rousseau et al., 
trust extends “from a calculated weighing of perceived gains and losses to an emo-
tional response based on interpersonal attachment and identification” (Rousseau, 
Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). In turn, Jo Paliszkiewicz interprets trust as the 
“bridge between past experiences and anticipated future” (Paliszkiewicz, 2011).
In the management literature, it points out the impact of trust on an orga-
nization’s flexibility (Bibb & Kourdi, 2004), competitive advantage (Barney & 
Hanson, 1994; Ciancutti & Steding, 2001), development (Adler, 2001), collab-
oration (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), interaction and maintaining rela-
tions (Busacca & Castaldo, 2005), achieving business goals (Darrough, 2008), 
knowledge sharing (Gilbert & Tang, 1998), reduction of transactional costs and 
implementing changes in the organization (Hoey & Nault, 2002), employees’ 
involvement (Busacca & Castaldo, 2005; Livet & Reynaud, 1998), and produc-
tiveness (Kramer & Cook, 2004), knowledge management (Castelfranchi, 2004), 
organizational learning (Bibb & Kourdi, 2004), free flow of information (Beccerra 
& Gupta, 1991), and organizational innovativeness (Sankowska, 2011).
Knowledge Sharing
Knowledge sharing is defined as a process through which knowledge possessed by 
an individual is transformed into a form which may be understood, acquired, and 
used by other individuals (Ipe, 2003). Knowledge sharing is a process that consid-
ers trial and error actions, feedback, constant adaptation of all the participants of 
this process, exploitation of existing knowledge to transfer and apply it for a better, 
faster, or less costly execution of a specific task compared to a situation in which 
knowledge sharing does not exist (Christensen, 2007).
From management’s point of view, collective action consists of knowledge 
exchange within teams and organizational units, and organizations are at the core 
of knowledge sharing. The principal aim of knowledge sharing is to make use of 
available knowledge to improve the effectiveness of a given group of employees as 
well as to improve coordination of other processes in each organization (Alavi & 
Leidner, 1999; Salisbury, 2003).
Main Conditions of Trust and Knowledge Sharing
In the literature, it is acknowledged that trust is one of the most important ele-
ments of knowledge sharing (Davenport & Prusak, 1998). First, trust increases 
the probability that the members of the organization will willingly share knowl-
edge and its use. This is important for building relations between members of the 
organization and the scope of sharing knowledge (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 
2003). Second, trust eliminates the fears and suspicions that knowledge sharing is  
not mutually beneficial (Martin, 2004). Trust enables people to assess whether 

110  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
the benefits of sharing knowledge will be at least the same for each party (Luhmann, 
1988), and at the same time this may reduce transaction costs (Nooteboom, 2003, 
p. 103). People trust others based on the condition that others will behave in a spe-
cific way (Mayer et al., 1995). Third, the conviction about the quality of knowledge 
and the competencies and credibility of both parties to knowledge sharing plays an 
important role in trust (Quigley, Tesluk, Locke, & Bartol, 2007). This increases 
the inclination to share personal knowledge (Chowdhury, 2005). Trust not only 
increases the volume of information that people share (Szulanski et al., 2004), but 
it also facilitates making decisions by simplifying the collection of information and 
its interpretation (McEvily et al., 2003). Moreover, trust is considered a factor that 
makes interactions between members of working parties and sharing knowledge 
possible (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998).
As already mentioned, trust is considered to be one of the factors of knowledge 
sharing. In numerous research studies, it has been pointed out that it influences 
relations (Casimir et al., 2012), beliefs, and convictions of employees that the orga-
nization cares for their welfare (Renzl, 2008) and also stimulates employees to 
share knowledge of specific initiatives (Quigley et al., 2007). It also contributes 
to acceptance of new knowledge (Castelfranchi, 2004). Trust is considered as an 
individual factor of knowledge sharing, which means that trust and readiness to 
build relations with another person translates to readiness to share knowledge with 
others.
Method
The “web surveys” technique was applied. Higher education institutions with their 
seats in the territory of Poland were chosen as the object of research. The choice of 
an institution of higher education as the organization type was intentional and it 
resulted from the fact that on the one hand they play a specific role in knowledge 
sharing, while on the other hand they are trust organizations.
Research using the method of a diagnostic survey was carried out in the period 
between January and February 2016. To this aim, a survey questionnaire was used, 
which was placed on an Internet platform. The respondents within the realized 
research were academics experienced in working at a higher education institution, 
who had deep and expert knowledge related to problems of trust and knowledge 
sharing. They received electronic mail in their in-boxes, which was an invitation 
to participate in the research. The survey questionnaire was composed of seven 
questions. The respondents constituted a supplement. The respondents evaluated 
the situation present in an organizational unit, in which they are employed. On 
a 5-point scale, where “1” means “this sentence is totally false,” and “5” means 
“this statement fully reflects the situation,” they evaluated the atmosphere of 
trust present in the organization as well as knowledge sharing. The questionnaire 
was anonymous, which contributed to the return of a fully filled out sheet. Sixty 

Trust and Knowledge Sharing  ◾  111
questionnaires in total were received for the analysis. It was assumed that such 
sampling would be guaranteed by participation in the research of respondents who 
possessed a scope of knowledge about the studied phenomenon.
Among the institutions participating in the research, the clearly predomi-
nant ones had a dominant share of public ownership (48 academic institutions, 
which constituted 35.8% of the population), whereas private schools constituted 
3.16% of the whole population of private higher education institutions in Poland 
(12  ­academic institutions). Sixty academics participated in the research. In the 
­dominating part, 23 respondents held the academic title of professor. The same 
­number was constituted by associate professors (23 persons). Whereas, the remain-
ing group of respondents were doctoral students (7 persons) and assistant lecturers 
(7 persons). In the examined sample, men dominated and constituted 58.3% of 
the examined population—35 people, whereas there were 25 women. The biggest 
group of the examined persons were 34–40 years of age and from 41 to 50. The 
structure and number of the examined population did not allow for the drawing 
of generalized conclusions; however, it did constitute interesting material, which 
illustrated the analyzed processes. Taking this into consideration, the focus was on 
the opinions of all the examined population in the results’ presentation. Only a part 
of the research results is presented in this chapter.
Analysis and Results
The problematic aspects of knowledge sharing in higher education institutions have 
been raised in numerous publications. However, the existing research has focused 
on identifying the barriers to sharing (Davenport & Cronin, 2000; Fullwood et al., 
2013; Tippins, 2003; Wang & Noe, 2010) and the conditions for the effective shar-
ing of knowledge (Kożuch & Lenart-Gansiniec, 2016). The aim of this research 
was to specify the level of knowledge sharing and trust. Realization of the aims was  
conducted in two stages: (1) identification of the level of knowledge sharing; and 
(2) identification of the level of trust.
It was assumed that an appropriate level of knowledge sharing may be depen-
dent on several necessary conditions. Basing on literature review, the most impor-
tant ones were specified and evaluated (Table 7.1).
The results obtained in the empirical research indicated that in the evaluated 
academic institutions the processes connected with knowledge are undervalued, 
especially those related to knowledge sharing. The respondents pointed out that 
the most important processes of the course of knowledge sharing in organiza-
tions are those connected with searching for information or the ability to locate 
persons who possess a specific type of knowledge. The low appraisal of the impor-
tance of the processes connected with a lack of the occurrence of rivalry between 
the employees, treating knowledge sharing as a priority and a strategic issue, the 
employees’ knowledge of the systems and procedures of knowledge sharing, skills

possessed by the employees in the scope of conducting discussions and dialogue, 
but also analyzing and discussing progress, results, and mistakes of the employ-
ees. One may attempt to state that, possibly, the causes are aspects that include 
a lack of assigned places for meetings and discussions and no time for sharing 
knowledge, as indicated by the respondents. A confirmation of such affairs are 
also the observations made by other researchers who analyzed the situation of 
knowledge sharing in the academic world in Poland (Białas & Wojnarowska, 
2013; Świgoń, 2015). Similar barriers, based on literature analysis, have been 
indicated by Leja (2013).
It is worth emphasizing that knowledge is the academic institution’s principal 
resource, whereas learning is a process that runs unceasingly. It should be under-
lined that the obtained answers enabled an evaluation of the level of knowledge 
sharing. The respondents were aware of the significance of learning, however, 
despite this they pointed out that individual actions are significant and not the col-
lective ones. The lack of being interested in collaborating with others was indicated 
here. The motives and stimuli for collective learning were not observed.
In the case of knowledge sharing—it is not perceived as something impor-
tant for the organization. The employees share knowledge in a spontaneous and 
unstructured way. There are specified procedures here. Low activity in the scope of 
knowledge sharing, skills only in the scope of identifying knowledge sources, or a 
lack of procedures may be a basis for ascertaining an unsatisfactory level of knowl-
edge sharing. Even further, such actions may cause losing and obsoleting of the 
resources in the organization’s possession, elongation of the knowledge manage-
ment process, and organizational learning (Friesl, Sackmann, & Kremser, 2011).
The starting point in this part of the chapter is the assumption that knowl-
edge sharing requires organizational trust. It is important to state here that trust 
is a complex and subjective notion. It manifests itself in various actions of the 
employees and managerial staff: starting from acting, through delegating authority 
or entitlements, independency of the employees, their participation in manage-
ment or establishing cooperation, and ending with teamwork. Its level is depen-
dent on many factors, among others the employees’ experience, management style, 
readiness to cooperate, or a given person’s predisposition (Stocki, Prokopowicz, & 
Żmuda, 2008). Its level is important in so far as it contributes to the readiness to 
cooperate (Shaw & Gaines, 1989), sharing knowledge (Gilbert & Tang, 1998), 
communication (Tschannen-Moran, 2001), and the employees’ openness and read-
iness to accept changes (Czajkowska, 2008). What is important is that when there 
is a low level of trust or even a lack of trust, the employees’ or managing staff’s 
mistrust may contribute to a lack of involvement and fear of taking initiatives con-
nected with knowledge (Zeffane & Connell, 2003).
The connections between the level of trust and knowledge are multidimen-
sional. In the literature, it is pointed out that it has an impact on knowledge 
management (Kelloway & Barling, 2000), organizational learning (Loon Hoe, 
2007), including knowledge flow (Beccerra & Gupta, 1999) and communicating 

Trust and Knowledge Sharing  ◾  115
(Kohn, Maier, & Thalmann, 2008). Consequently, with the growth of the level of 
trust, the level of knowledge sharing increases (Sankowska, 2011). This dependency 
results from a will to cooperate, interact, or co-create, and participate.
Taking into consideration the connection between trust and the processes 
related to knowledge, for the needs of this chapter evaluation by the respondents of 
the level of trust in higher education institutions was important since the level of 
trust influences knowledge sharing (Table 7.2).

The results of research in the scope of the level of trust in higher education insti-
tutions indicated that the respondents emphasized encouraging the employees by 
the management to participate in decision-making and the impact of kindness on 
the results of an individual’s actions. In contrast, the aspect connected with a posi-
tive bond of the employees with their direct superiors received the lowest evaluation 
result. On the one hand, the employees note the significance of mutual kindness and 
on the other hand, the low value of a positive bond with superiors. Such evaluation 
of the respondents points to their conviction about difficulties with trusting others. 
In addition, it should be emphasized that the trust level received a low (26 respon-
dents) and moderate (34 respondents) evaluation result. None of the respondents 
stated that the level of trust in their academic world was at a very high level. The 
obtained research results correspond with the results of research by Świgoń (2015). 
The author emphasized here the issue of the specifics of working in a higher educa-
tion institution’s organizational units and the fact of work individualization and 
aversion to collective work. The reason for this is the evaluation performed by the 
management was based almost exclusively on scientific publications. To sum up, the

level of trust was evaluated by the respondents as low or moderate. Considering the 
results of the research, the condition of organizational learning in the environments 
where the respondents functioned, did not confirm the regularity that there is a con-
nection between trust and knowledge sharing as its part.
Discussion and Conclusion
The conducted research enabled the assessment of the level of knowledge sharing 
and trust related to the academic staff of higher education institutions having their 
seats in Poland. A few conclusions may be drawn on its basis.
1.	The respondents assess the level of knowledge sharing in their workplace as 
low. They do not treat knowledge sharing as a priority; however, they did 
ascertain the importance of the processes connected with searching for 
information or the ability to locate people who possess a specific kind of 
knowledge. The obtained results correspond with the observations of other 
researchers of academia in Poland (Białas & Wojnarowska, 2013; Leja, 2013; 
Świgoń, 2015). Despite the awareness that knowledge sharing is important 
and it constitutes the basis for creating new ideas and developing new pos-
sibilities, it is not perceived by the respondents as important for them, their 
collaborators, and their working environment.
2.	The level of trust was assessed by the respondents as low or moderate. They 
see the reason for this in weak ties between the employees and their direct 
superiors. Such assessment of the persons taking part in the research points 
to a conviction of the respondents about the existence of difficulty in placing 
one’s confidence in others. The obtained results correspond with the research 
results by Świgoń (2015). The dominating individualization of work or rivalry 
contribute to avoiding knowledge sharing.
3.	The deliberations presented in this chapter do not exhaust the problematic 
aspects raised. The conducted research may not constitute the basis for gener-
alization related to a larger population. Nonetheless, the obtained results may 
justify the need for conducting further research, particularly on the problem-
atic aspects of the impact of trust on knowledge sharing or the reasons for 
decreasing trust in academic working environments. Considering the above, 
knowledge about this may be valuable and it may constitute a premise for 
undertaking further research on knowledge sharing and trust.

Introduction
Companies strive to create good relationships with their stakeholders through a 
variety of means. Building the stakeholders’ trust toward the companies and their 
products is one of the most important activities if they aim to properly function in 
the market and make a profit. One of the methods of building such trust includes 
socially responsible actions. However, the activities need to be in accordance with 
certain standards in order to actually build trust.
One of the challenges faced by a socially responsible company is the ability 
to build trust toward the company’s environment (the brand or the product) in 
social reports (reporting on nonfinancial data). These reports play an important 
informative role for the stakeholders as well as orient the relations that the stake-
holders shape with the organization. For the stakeholders, social reports fulfill a 
role that is similar to the role that financial reports fulfill for investors. Currently, 
nonfinancial data is increasingly more often reported in a single document along 
with the financial results. The reports also provide the organization managers 
with important knowledge allowing them to find the reference to the activities 
they perform.
Building and maintenance of trust in corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
reports is an area of reporting skills, good practices, procedures, and methods that 
may constitute a valuable subject for scientific research. The conducted literature 
research has proven that the undertaken analyses did not focus on the mechanisms 
associated with building trust in the reports; therefore, it was deemed valuable to 
conduct pilot studies on this subject.
In this chapter, an attempt has been to examine the methods of stakeholder 
trust development in selected reports created by companies associated with the 
energy industry. Here, trust is understood and analyzed as a relation based on three 
basic foundations: benevolence, integrity and predictability, and competence.
Building trust in the reports takes place by means of the natural language. In 
this study it is assumed, in accordance with the weak version of the Sapir-Whorf 
hypothesis, that language is not neutral and that a mere analysis of the report lan-
guage allows, to a certain extent, an evaluation of the trust creation mechanisms  
(cf. Burgess, 2017). The language is reviewed from the discursive point of view and 
using discourse analysis methods. Discourse analysis is treated here as an eclectic 
method of text examination, which takes into account the context as well as the 
situation in which the given message was created. The socio-linguistic analyses are 
complemented with other studies necessary to create a proper description of the

context and the economical background. Furthermore, the analysis is augmented 
with an assessment of the method of communication with the stakeholders, the 
context of the given company’s functioning, and other necessary elements.
Study of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reports
The examined corporate social responsibility reports are prepared in accordance 
with standardized reporting method guidelines. The advantages of such standard-
ization of social reports include the ability to quantify the quantitative data, the 
standardization of quality data, and the comparability of the results.
There are many international standards and norms associated with reporting 
on nonfinancial data as well as guidelines facilitating the execution of the reporting 
process available for organizations. The most important publications on this subject 
include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines that contain rules and mea-
sures enabling the creation of a reporting system and the preparation of a report with 
quantified and comparable economic, environmental, and social results. Although 
the GRI guidelines are currently one of the most popular social reporting standards, 
they do not constitute the only source of knowledge on nonfinancial data report-
ing. The ISO norms such as: ISO 26000 (2017) (concerning the social responsibility 
of organizations CSR), ISO 14000 (2017) (concerning proenvironmental activities), 
ISO 14067 (2017) (concerning the carbon footprint), the SA8000 standard (2016), 
the OECD guidelines (2017), and a variety of industry guidelines (i.e., for the fuel, 
automotive, clothing, or finance industries) compose a wide range of documents sup-
porting the preparation of nonfinancial reports.
The conducted literature research confirms that the social reports were studied, 
so far, that is, in the management sciences from the resource theory perspective 
referencing to the employee area as well as the organization’s intellectual capital 
(Pedrini, 2007; Sułkowski, & Fijałkowska, 2013), in the context of communication 
with the stakeholders (Pasetti, Tenucii, Cinquini, & Frey, 2009; Knox, Maklan, & 
French, 2005), or in the context of tools for expanding the financial information 
reported by the companies to their stakeholders (Crisan & Zbuchea, 2015; Guthrie, 
Cuganesan, & Ward, 2007). Research on nonfinancial reporting was also con-
ducted from the perspective of the stakeholder theory as well as company legit-
imacy (Harte & Owen, 1991; Oliveira, Rodrigues, & Craig, 2010; Vourvachis, 
Woodward, Woodward, & Patten, 2010).
The analysis of the literature on nonfinancial reporting did not prove that any 
study was undertaken in relation to the tools of trust building in the reporting 
process. Due to this fact, a theoretical and analytical model has been created to 
study the linguistic aspects of trust building in social reports and to analyze them 
in terms of the presentation of the CSR areas deemed in the ISO 26000 norm as a 
key for a socially responsible organization.
The ISO 26000 norm distinguishes seven main areas of socially responsi-
ble activities, which should be covered in corporate social responsibility reports. 

124  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
The areas are as follows: organizational governance, labor practices, human rights, 
fair operating practices, consumer issues, community involvement and develop-
ment, and environment. For the purposes of this chapter, the definitions of the 
CSR areas are taken from the ISO 26000 norm.
According to the ISO 26000 norm, organizational governance is a system by 
which the company makes and implements decisions in pursuit of its objectives. 
This includes both formal governance mechanisms based on the defined structures 
and processes, and informal ones resulting from the organization’s culture and 
adopted values. Properly defined organizational governance enables the company 
to integrate social responsibility with the functioning throughout the organization 
and its relationships. It is a means of increasing the organization’s ability to act in 
a socially responsible manner in relation to other core subjects/areas. An effective 
organizational governance system enables an effective inclusion of the social respon-
sibility principles into the process of decision-making and decision implementation.
In the ISO 26000 norm, the labor practices area is associated with labor law 
practices where the company is regarded as an organization contributing to the 
improvement of the standards of living by means of ensuring safe employment and 
decent work. The company may undertake socially responsible activities through 
the realization of transparent employment practices, guaranteeing decent work 
conditions and social protection, ensuring employee development (e.g., through 
training), as well as through leading a social dialogue.
A socially responsible company is also obliged to respect human rights, accord-
ing to the International Bill of Human Rights, also within the area of its influence. 
A socially responsible company should therefore exercise due diligence to identify, 
prevent, and address actual or potential human rights impacts resulting from the 
company’s activities or the activities of other subjects the organization has relation-
ships with.
Fair operating practices concern ethical conduct in the organization’s deal-
ings with other organizations (relationships with government agencies, business 
partners, suppliers, contractors, competition, and nongovernment organizations 
of which they are members). The issues of the social responsibility area described 
as “fair operating practices” include the activities associated with anti-corruption, 
responsible involvement in the public sphere, fair competition, promotion of social 
responsibility within the chain of values, and respect for property rights.
Activities associated with social responsibility undertaken within the area of con-
sumer issues are fair marketing practices, protection of the consumer’s health and 
safety, sustainable consumption, complaint and dispute resolution, consumer data pro-
tection and privacy, access to products and services, and education and catering for the 
needs of consumers that are vulnerable or in a disadvantaged social situation.
The ISO 26000 norm defines community involvement and development as a 
proactive attitude toward the local community with an aim to prevent and resolve 
social problems and foster partnerships with local organizations and stakehold-
ers. A socially responsible company can, therefore, participate in and support civic

institutions and support the civil participation processes in the determination of 
priorities related to social investments and activities aiming to develop the local 
community.
The subject of environment concerns the organization’s activities limiting the neg-
ative impact of its presence on the natural environment. They may be associated with, 
among others, resource use, localization of the organization’s activity, pollution emis-
sions, waste production, and the influence of the organization on the natural habitat.
The manner of the reporting on the organization’s activity in the seven above-
mentioned areas influences the process of building trust toward it, as it depicts 
how the organization understands its corporate social responsibility. Therefore, the 
analysis of CSR reports discern how organizations build trust toward themselves by 
undertaking selected CSR activities.
Theoretical Model of Trust Building in Social Reports
In order to develop the theoretical model of trust building in the reports as well as 
the tools used to study it, the authors used the trust concept presented/developed by 
Paliszkiewicz (in Chapter 5 in this book). The theoretical model takes into account 
the trust measures treated also as its foundations. Each foundation has been charac-
terized using a list of selected features. The model is presented in Table 8.1.
According to the established theoretical model, one of the trust foundations is 
benevolence, which includes features such as the indication of interest, recognition 
of individual needs, and accessibility.
Indicating interest in CSR reports has been evaluated on three levels:  
(1) enumeration of the company stakeholders and provision of information on the 
manners of communication with them; (2) enabling the stakeholders to comment 
on the report; and (3) response to the raised remarks, engaging in the dialogue. 
Obviously, the dialogue itself can take different forms.
The recognition of individual needs should be based on consulting the par-
ticular elements of the report with an appropriate stakeholder group. The reports 
should therefore document such consultations as their quality influences building 
trust in stakeholders and report readers.
In the model it was assumed that accessibility is emphasized by two activities. 
The first one is associated with the selection of an appropriate genre in relation to 
the content as well as with the method of its presentation—whether the appropriate 
graphic, text, and multimedia form was selected.
The second activity is associated with the language complexity level. The level 
of the complexity of the language indicates that the creators of the report intend to 
be understood and through writing in a given, accessible manner they demonstrate 
respect toward the readers. The level of language complexity is evaluated according 
to the lists and solutions created for a given language. There are no universal solu-
tions due to, among others, the type of the given language (e.g., measures prepared

for the isolation and positional English language are not appropriate for the inflected 
Polish language—cf. Majewicz, 1989). Therefore, when studying reports prepared 
in the Polish language, it is suggested to utilize the model created by the Plain 
Language Laboratory (PL: Pracownia Prostego Języka) at the University of Wroclaw 
(cf. Broda, Maziarz, Piekot, & Radziszewski, 2010; Piekot, Zarzeczny, & Moron, 
2015). All models, regardless of the language for which they were created, are used 
to increase (or evaluate) the readability and comprehensibility of the text (cf. Piekot 
et al., 2015). A comprehensible text/report is one “that provides the average citizen 
with quick access to the information contained within it.” A model that combines 
the evaluation of the text difficulty and its comprehensibility allows not only to 
indicate the text difficulty level but also to determine the preferred education of 
the reader of the given text. Therefore, when evaluating the text difficulty level, the 
Gunning text readability index was used (FOG = 0,4*[(LW/LZ) + 100*(LWT/LW)] 
where LW is the number of words within the text, LWT—number of words with 
more than 4 syllables (Broda et al., 2010), LZ—number of sentences, and the text 
comprehensibility tables which depend on the education and which were prepared 
by Broda et al. (2010) on the basis of the various Polish language corpora study. Data 
for the Gunning text readability index was obtained by means of feeding the report 
text into specially prepared software calculating the number of sentences, number 
of words within the sentences, and the number of syllables within a word. When 
speaking of the report text, we refer to the data depicted in the form of a written text. 
Any infographics, tables, charts, and so on, have been omitted. Furthermore, any 
statements presented in a form of a movie have not been analyzed.
Integrity (and predictability) is an important feature, on the foundation of 
which trust can be built. The study of integrity in social reports is based on the 
evaluation of the presentation of the organization’s values and ethical behavior as 
well as on the consistency of actions and the realism of the declarations.
In their reports, companies usually declare the values and ethical behavior with 
which they align their business activity. If a company, aside from the declarations, 
has other documents related to its values (e.g., a code of ethics), it indicates a higher 
level of its maturity which, in turn, should induce increased trust. The confirmation

that the declared values are in alignment with the described activities signifies an 
even higher maturity level.
Action consistency and declaration realism is another important integrity mea-
sure. If the declarations uttered in the CEO’s letter are in accordance with the 
actual activities described in the report, this indicates a high level of the activities’ 
compliance with the declarations and it therefore is a basis for trust building.
In the reports, competence can be indicated using a variety of methods. In the 
established theoretical model it was assumed that knowledge and activity profes-
sionalism are its most important discriminants. The level of knowledge was assessed 
on the basis of the organization’s activity description, the method of its storage 
within the organization as well as the methods of its sharing. On the other hand, 
professionalism is understood as both good company operation (financial reports, 
profit, etc.) and properly prepared communication.
Methodology and Study Methods
Overall Study Description
In order to conduct the study on good practices of trust building in social reports, 
an analytical tool that evaluates the manner of trust building (and its particular 
dimensions) has been created on the basis of the developed theoretical model of the 
analysis of the linguistic aspects of building trust in such reports. Each of the three 
trust foundations has been allocated with features proclaiming the creation of the 
given trust dimension and the intensity of the given feature was assessed on the 
basis of measures characteristic for corporate social responsibility reports. A weight 
reflecting its influence on building trust in social reports was assigned to each feature 
(see Table 8.2). It was assumed that each foundation has the same weight.
Each of the reports has also been evaluated in terms of the dominating area 
of socially responsible activity (areas distinguished on the basis of the ISO 26000 
norm). The particular reporting areas are determined as equally important, there-
fore the domination of a particular one indicates the activities deemed by the com-
pany as especially significant.
The results of the study on the methods of building trust have been compared 
with the analysis of the dominant reporting areas indicating the relationships 
between the activity area deemed as most important by the company and the strat-
egy of trust building.

the limits of the established scale. In terms of interest indication, 1 point was granted 
for the enumeration of the stakeholders accompanied by the information on the com-
munication means employed by the company in reference to them. One point was 
also granted for assurance that the stakeholders have the ability to comment on the 
report and for the response to their remarks (entering a dialogue). The recognition 
of individual needs means consulting the given report elements with an appropri-
ate stakeholder group. One point was granted for the consultations of the particular 
elements with the stakeholder groups. The accessibility feature has been assessed by 
means of the appropriate indicators presence as well as their scale. The selection of the 
genre and form (multimedia, infographics, etc.) that is proper for the content—1 point 
and 1 point for the low level of language complexity according to the FOG index.
The analysis of integrity was divided into two main stages: the analysis of the 
organization’s values and ethical behavior, and the analysis of the activity consis-
tency and declaration realism. The analysis of the organization’s values and ethical 
behavior was assessed on a scale of 0–3. One point was granted to an organization 
that declares, in the report, the values it follows in its business activity. Another point 
was granted if aside from this declaration, the company possesses other documents 
concerning the values, for example, code of ethics. The third point was granted if 
the declared values are in accordance with the described activities (if there is a rela-
tionship between the declared values and the activities). The analysis of the activity 
consistency is based on the comparison of the declarations found in the chairperson’s 
letter with the actual activities covered in the report (full compliance was awarded 
with 2 points, partial compliance with 1 point).
The analysis of competence was conducted taking into account two fea-
tures: knowledge and professionalism. Knowledge was evaluated in regard to the 
descriptions of the company’s activities, what can be of interest for the particular 
stakeholder groups, and whether the information is available in the report. The 
company’s activity description was assessed using a 0–2 scale (1 point was granted 
for the description presence and the second point for the content value, readability, 
and preparation related to the particular stakeholder groups).
Professionalism was assessed on the substantive matter of operating a business 
and its transparency. Making the financial reports, as well as other documents 
associated with operating a business, available was rewarded with 1 point. Making 
a profit or achieving a financial success (given the various macro- and microeco-
nomic conditions in the particular industries, the indicators may differ) was worth 
2 points.
Areas of Socially Responsible Activities
The ISO norm distinguishes seven areas of reporting (described in Chapter 9). 
The study of the areas’ description method in the reports indicates the develop-
ment direction of the company’s image as a socially responsible organization.  

132  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
The analysis of these areas determines how the company understands its respon-
sibility and what tasks are identified as the most important to a socially respon-
sible organization. The assessment of the most significant areas (from the company 
perspective) as well as of the information on the indicators reported in the given 
area (according to the GRI4 guideline) determines the organization’s credibility. 
Indication of the report’s dominating area(s) permits, in turn, to compare these 
areas with the company’s activity scope (known from other documents and the 
company’s functioning in the real world). This is significant due to the fact that 
there are organizations that treat CSR as a form of green washing of behavior that 
is not responsible in the field of core business activity.
Analysis of Trust in Selected CSR Reports
In order to verify the developed theoretical model as well as the analytical tool, 
pilot studies were conducted. The study material consisted of CSR reports pub-
lished in 2016 (covering 2015 or joint reports for 2014 and 2015) created by five 
energy companies that participated in the Social Reports (2017) competition (PL: 
Raporty Społeczne) and whose reports are available on the http://raportyspoleczne.
pl/ website, that is, Enea SA, Energa SA, EDF Polska, Tauron Polska Energia SA, 
and PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna.
Each of the reports has been analyzed and evaluated in terms of the report 
creation standards as well as the methods of building trust in business, based 
on the three trust foundations assumed in the theoretical model (Paliszkiewicz, 
2013). Due to space limitations, this chapter describes the analysis of a single 
report—created by Enea SA; however, it also contains the remaining companies’ 
results.
Benevolence of Trust in a Selected Company’s Report
In the Enea SA 2015 report, 1 point has been granted in terms of interest indi-
cation. The report contains the stakeholder information—“The map of Enea 
Group stakeholders” (PL: Mapa interesariuszy Grupy Enea) complemented by the 
information on the communication channels between the given group and the 
management as well as between the stakeholders themselves (although it is worth 
mentioning that the communication channels also include elements where one-
sided management-stakeholders communication is dominant, e.g., annual report). 
The creators of the CSR report did not foresee the possibility of an open discus-
sion on the content of the report. A contact regarding the report is possible only 
through the Public Relations and Communication Department of the Corporate 
Social Responsibility Office (PL: Departament Public Relations i Komunikacji przy 
Biurze Społecznej Odpowiedzialności Biznesu)—the company email address is avail-
able. Moreover, the customers may contact the company via Facebook (Energia+),

where the company employees are engaged in discussions, although none of the 
posts were associated with the CSR report.
The recognition of individual needs is based, in the analyzed report, mainly on 
consulting the given areas of the report with the respective stakeholder groups. The 
report mentions that the key corporate values were established in agreement with the 
employees: “In collaboration with our staff, we have developed four key corporate 
values on which we base our business” (PL: Wspólnie z naszymi pracownikami 
opracowaliśmy cztery kluczowe wartości korporacyjne, na których opieramy naszą 
działalność ). Furthermore, the originator and initiator of the Noble Box project, 
pr. Jacek Stryczka, was also invited into the discussion on ethical matters. What is 
more, the company conducts periodic customer satisfaction surveys (both individual 
and business-oriented). The company declares that the customer’s opinions translate 
into actual changes and company actions. The report does not mention any declara-
tions associated with the consultations of other report elements with the stakehold-
ers. Therefore, the individual that needs identifications was awarded with 0,5 points.
The Enea Group’s accessibility has been assessed for 1 point. In the first 
stage—the selection of an appropriate genre for the content and the method of its 
presentation—the attention was brought to the introduction of multimedia ele-
ments, infographics, tables, and charts. The report begins with a schematic anima-
tion accompanied by a short text information. The combination of these elements 
shows, in a simple way, what the Enea Group activity focuses on and what are its most 
important values. The report introduction page also features a short documentary 
on the creation of a modern coal power plant. The important sections are marked 
with both text and icons. Also, the report recipient has access to interactive data 
displayed in tables and charts (the reader can choose the presentation form) where 
they can change the time. However, the report creators allow only five factors to 
be used in this form. Furthermore, the report features several films, infograph-
ics, graphs, charts, and tables. These elements facilitate the reception and analysis 
of the covered content. The more important report elements (including means of 
contact with particular departments) have been highlighted with a light blue text 
background. A guiding idea has been assigned to each section and it is visible on the 
main banner. The company was awarded with 0,75 points for this element.
The text complexity level has been determined using the Gunning text readabil-
ity index, which is equal to 17,5 for the Enea report. For this element, the company 
was granted 0,25 points.
Analysis of Integrity in a Selected Company’s Report
In the Enea SA CSR report, a separate Ethical Standards subsection under the 
Enea Group section was devoted to the company’s values. Following the consulta-
tions, the most important values determined by various stakeholder groups were: 
integrity, competence, responsibility, and safety. The values also appear in the pre-
sentation in the beginning of the report. Furthermore, the company has created 

134  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
the Enea Capital Group Code of Ethics and each new employee undergoes training 
on company values. There are also e-learning courses available on the intranet. The 
organization has established a code of ethics commission that can be contacted via 
email or through a special contact form.
The report highlights the activities aiming to improve both the safety of the 
employees during their work (through a series of various measures resulting from 
the law regulations and additional activities), the safety of the energy delivery to 
the customers and the broadly understood energy security. The remaining values: 
integrity, competence, and responsibility are not emphasized in such a direct man-
ner; however, their importance can be observed in, for example, the declarations 
associated with the employees’ engagement in education (competence sharing) or 
the high complexity level of the newly build batteries (and their service), and so 
on. Therefore, after an analysis of the organization values and ethical behavior, the 
company was granted 3 points.
Action consistency and declaration realism was assessed for 1,5 points. In 
the letter opening the report, the Enea Group CEO declares that the company is 
responsible for “both (. . .) the Employees, local communities, the quality of life 
of millions of Customers and the energy security of the country” (PL: zarówno za 
(. . .) Pracowników i społeczności lokalne, jakość życia milionów Klientów, jak i za 
bezpieczeństwo ­energetyczne kraju). The actions associated with the country’s energy 
security, according to the chairperson, include the construction of a power unit in the 
Kozienice power plant. Furthermore, staff development is a priority, however, the let-
ter does not feature any examples of such actions. On the other hand, it does feature 
the employees’ activities for the benefit of the local environment. The comparison of 
the letter declarations with the entire report indicates the fulfilment of their majority.
Analysis of Competence in a Selected Company’s Report
The knowledge indicator associated with the company’s activity description in the 
Enea report was assessed for 2 points. The description in the report is complete and 
accompanied by multimedia material as well as infographics explaining the opera-
tion of the most important systems in the Enea Group.
Professionalism was assessed for 2 points.
Trust in Analyzed Reports of Companies in the 
Energy Industry
A similar analysis of corporate social responsibility reports was conducted in ­relation 
to the remaining four companies from the energy industry. Table 8.3 summarizes 
the numerical results of the analyses of all the organizations.
Tauron and PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna utilize the corporate social respon-
sibility report best in terms of building trust. Both companies prefer simple com-
munication—the language complexity level is much lower than in the remaining

reports. Both companies used clear forms in order to communicate complicated 
financial data (as well as other details), that is, infographics, films, multimedia, 
and various charts. What is more, both companies achieved the highest indices of 
knowledge and professionalism. In turn, these features—constituting the benevo-
lence and competence trust foundations—were decisive in terms of the predomi-
nance of their reports. All of the analyzed reports had a high integrity index.
Analysis of CSR Areas in Reports of Selected  
Polish Energy Companies
The CSR reports are evaluated in relation to seven areas distinguished in the ISO 
26000 norm. These include: organizational governance, labor practices, human 
rights, fair operating practices, consumer issues, community involvement and 
development, and environment. For the purpose of this study, an evaluation of the 
most broadly described area was conducted. This has been completed by means 
of verification of the number of GRI4 indicators reported in the given area. None 
of the companies was obliged to report on the given area in accordance with all 
indicators.
Analysis of a Selected Company’s Report
“Environment” was the dominant area in the report created by the Enea Group 
(Table 8.4). The company reported a total of 13 indicators associated with ecol-
ogy and the influence of the organization’s activities on the natural environ-
ment. The highest number of indicators reported in the “environment” area may 
result from the characteristics of the energy industry, which is largely based on 
the utilization of natural resources and where the energy production and distri-
bution processes are associated with a high impact on the environment. Another

widely reported area covered by the Enea Group CSR report was “organizational 
governance” (9 indicators). In the years 2014–2015, the group has completed the 
“Corporate Governance—Enea Capital Group Management Plan” project (PL: 
Ład korporacyjny—Plan Zarządzania Grupą Kapitałową Enea), which aimed to 
simplify the decision-making processes, shorten the information flow, and concen-
trate on the Group’s core activity.
Four indicators that are present in the report occur in the following areas: labor 
practices, fair operating practices, and consumer issues. The amount of information 
on key group stakeholders: employees, contractors, and customers seems to be low, 
given the fact that the Group’s strategic objectives presented in the report refer to 
building long-lasting relationships with the customers and the optimal use of the 
organization’s potential. A higher number of indicators (6) was present in activi-
ties related to the cooperation with the community. The report did not feature any 
indicators related to the “human rights” area.
Analysis of CSR Areas in Reports of Analyzed Energy  
Industry Companies
The analysis of the nonfinancial reports created by the Enea Group, as well as the 
remaining energy companies, proves that the activities associated with the com-
pany’s influence on the environment constitute the most widely reported area in 
most of the discussed cases (Table 8.5). In the reports of three out of five analyzed 
companies, the “environment” area was described with 13 indicators (the highest

number of indicators in comparison to the other areas). The remaining two companies 
(PGE and Tauron) reported 11 and 18 indicators in this area, which also signifies 
a large interest in this field of social responsibility. The number of indicators was 
lower by one in comparison to the number of indicators in the areas most broadly 
reported by the analyzed companies (for PGE it was “labor practices” with 11 indi-
cators; for Tauron it was “consumer issues” with 18 indicators).
The studied companies also deemed labor practices, organizational governance, 
and consumer issues as significant areas of social responsibility (areas with a high 
number of indicators). The lowest number of indicators was associated with human 
rights and fair operating practices.
Conclusion
In this chapter, the theoretical model was presented as well as the tool for the 
analysis of the methods of trust building in the reports. To verify the proposed 
approach, social reports created by selected companies from the energy industry 
were analyzed. The undertaken study indicates the way in which the enterprise may 
build the stakeholder’s trust toward it using the communication method known 
as the social responsibility report. The form of the report has been reviewed as an 
element that not only communicates the company’s activity but may also be used 
to build trust.
The analysis of the language features of the corporate social responsibility 
reports and the nonlingual conditions of the company’s functioning in the eco-
nomic space, including the analysis of the dominant reporting areas, permitted us 
to distinguish the mechanisms used to build trust toward the company. The con-
ducted pilot study shows that the study tool proposed by the authors of this chap-
ter enables the evaluation of the corporate social responsibility reports in terms of 
trust building. Furthermore, evidence shows that elements such as the complexity 
level of the language used in the communication with stakeholders, the indication 
of ethical principles employed by the company, consistency or compliance of the 
declarations with real actions are considered significant elements of building such 
trust through the CSR reports, similar to clear information on the organization’s 
financial results.
The conducted study and the presented report analysis results should be consid-
ered as pilot studies. The subsequent step includes the verification of the developed 
analytical tool on the basis of the discussions with the project authors as well as 
consultants in the field of social responsibility. The conclusions resulting from the 
study should serve as outlines for further studies on the tools associated with build-
ing trust toward an organization.

Introduction and Aims of the Chapter
Nowadays, marketing communication experts face the difficult challenge of how 
to attract the attention of customers. Conventional marketing communication is 
in a crisis (Saucet, 2015). Advertising expenses in past years have been rising in 
European Union (EU) countries (see IAB Europe Report, 2016).
With regard to the decreasing tendency of classical marketing forms, the cre-
ative approach (with originality as the main component) is becoming necessary. 
It doesn’t only attract attention, but also helps to create a positive attitude toward 
a presented product or service, acceptance and memorability of a message, which 
helps to establish trust. The aim of this chapter is to explain these facts. At the same 
time, we want to illustrate the significant differences by using original research 
results and analyze the intersections between the two different groups of genera-
tions. Our results are also applicable in the marketing practice. The research dem-
onstrates who and what Generations X and Y trust, how the various advertising 
types placed in different media are evaluated, and whether the creative execution 
can have an impact on credibility.
Review of the Literature
Trust in Marketing Communication
Marketing communication is aimed at the stimulation and regulation of the needs 
that are fulfilled by the means of purchase of the product or service (Pavlů, 2013). 
Trust should become the key entity of all communication measures and compo-
nents of the communication mix.
Nevertheless, within the well-known models of marketing communication, 
the element of trust is included merely in the so-called model of “balloon effect” 
proposed by Lutz, MacKenzie, and Belch (1983), where trust represents one of 
the main components of “central elaboration of the advertising message” (in the 
Elaboration Likelihood Model, by Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)—where these fac-
tors are present: credibility of the source, ads, and concrete advertising—that 
is, a realization. In this regard, the credibility of advertising means whether the 
target group of people perceives the advertised product or brand as credible and 
believable.
The perceived congruence between the advertising message and the product (or 
brand) perception from the consumer perspective, determined mainly by his previ-
ous experience, is thus crucial for the credibility of advertising or another form of 
marketing communication. Therefore, the perceived credibility is the part of the 
process of creating and forming the attitude toward advertising based on rational 
analysis, which represents the central way of attitude formation. At the same time, 
it is supposed (compared with Světlík, 2012) that the receiver of the message also 
evaluates the credibility of the company producing the goods, communications 

Trust and Marketing  ◾  145
medium, and previous and current advertising activities of the source. In the so-
called peripheral elaboration of the advertising message, is trust included only 
implicitly?
Regarding the complexity of trust in marketing and communications, the 
model synthesizing all its essential and important components would be desir-
able for a better understanding. Various authors have conceptualized such a 
model. Garbarino and Johnson (1999) have stated that the integrative model 
of trust in marketing communication will vary by customer type (and thus, 
in continuum from transactional to highly relational bonds). Doney, Cannon, 
and Mullen (1998) confirmed that the integrative model must respect national 
cultures. Social norms and values influence the trust building in the context of 
business. The trust building between the seller and customer is essential and 
useful for both sides because trust can lower transaction costs, facilitate inter-
organizational relationships, and enhance relationships. Advertising, however, 
generally does not have a very good reputation among consumers. In 1974, in 
a research study by Haller (1974), 75% of respondents believed that invalid or 
misleading statements came from half of all advertising. However, even current 
conventional marketing communication is in crisis (see Saucet, 2015). There is 
an increase in resistance to advertising, negative attitudes, and efforts to avoid 
it. Smith (2006, p. 21) from Yankelovich Partners Inc. (realized in 2004) stated 
that 60% of the U.S. population had more negative opinions on advertising and 
marketing than a few years before.
The absence of trust in advertising is reflected in the degree of skepticism on 
the truth and the overall content of advertising messages. Intercultural differences 
have been observed in this area—Diehl, Mueller, and Terlutter (2007) compared 
the sample from Germany and the United States, whereby it was proven that, in 
general, U.S. customers are less skeptical toward ads than German customers. The 
level of trust also varies depending on the advertising medium. Research by Soh, 
Reid, and King (2007) proved that Internet advertising is the least reliable compared 
with TV, radio, or print ads. The most trusted were magazines. The level of trust in 
advertising placed in different media is also influenced by the customers’ income. 
The respondents with higher incomes trust magazines more, and trust the Internet 
less. While respondents with less income, trust ads on TV more and trust magazines 
less, and Internet ads are the second-most important for them (compared with TV) 
(Soh et al., 2007). The trust is also impacted by ­education—those who are more 
educated, trust significantly less advertising in media. To enhance the credibility of 
the message, the creators of advertising also support their arguments in favor of the 
promoted product or service by referencing scientific research. The perceived believ-
ability of such ads was examined by Beltramini and Evans (1984). Their research 
has shown that consumers are more likely to trust ads presenting results of scientific 
research, although executed within small research samples. Moreover, believability 
was not influenced by the information if the presented research was executed by an 
independent institution, or the advertiser himself, or by an expert. Quantitative data 

146  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
was perceived as more believable than qualitative data. The believability of informa-
tion may not always declare the effectiveness of advertising. Information on social 
anti-smoking campaigns—about the harmful effects of cigarette smoke—is believed 
by respondents, but studies show that such campaigns are still ineffective (Calvert, 
Gallopel-Morvan, Sauneron, & Oullier, 2010). When an audience receives rational 
or truthful information, there still may be a negative response. Research by Mehta 
(2000) confirmed that the advertising is effective if the target audience likes it, and 
at the same time believes in it, finding benefit for current products and services. 
Trust can also be increased by partial elements of marketing communication such as 
the font type (Brunner-Sperdin, Ploner, & Schorn, 2014), the colors of ads (Lee & 
Rao, 2010), and also eye contact of the person on the cover, recently proven in the 
research of Aviva, Tal, and Wansink (2014).
Although trust is important in all areas of marketing communication, the key 
areas where trust is essential, is the banking sector. The trust of ordinary clients 
in banks depends on the concrete bank institution as well as on global aspects, 
such as world financial and economic crises. As in other areas, in banking there 
are efforts by researchers (see e.g., Cho, Huh, & Faber, 2014) to identify the essen-
tial factors that support or build the trust of bank clients. According to Delina 
and Svocáková (2013), there also exists a relationship between the trust to Slovak 
and to world banks. Conversely, the length of commercial relationships does not 
affect the level of trust. Experiences of clients are a valuable source of information 
that helps to build the credibility of an institution. This is one of the reasons why 
this type of information gets the attention of marketers. This trend is followed by 
attempts to assess the credibility of the institutions by an independent assessor. In 
Slovakia, there is an independent certification company Research Center of Customer 
Views. It works by evaluating the response of consumers and business partners in 
the company.
One of the ways to enhance the credibility of marketing communications is the 
use of a suitably chosen celebrity, whose function in marketing is to communicate 
as the referrer. This subject is discussed in the next section of this chapter.
Celebrities in Advertising and Their Credibility
Today, endorsements by celebrities are an established element in brand and product 
communication. The most famous definition of a celebrity endorser is a definition 
by McCracken (1989): a celebrity endorser is a person who “. . .enjoys a public fame 
and such a fame is used in a way that he/she appears in advertisements for a pro-
moted product” (p. 310).
Various authors dealing with celebrity endorsements (e.g., Shimp, 2007) apply 
the premise that efficiency of this promotional form is influenced by two basic attri-
butes: credibility and attractiveness. Subsequently, two models were created: the 
source credibility model and the attractiveness model. Both elements were under-
stood as independent ones, with some measure competing of attitude variations 

Trust and Marketing  ◾  147
toward the relationship between an endorser and its audience. The source cred-
ibility model or theory is the oldest attempt to explain how celebrity endorsement 
functions. The core postulate of the model is the dependency of successful com-
munication on source quality. The source credibility model is based on research in 
social psychology.
The essence of credibility from the point of its role in the endorsement process 
is an assumption that recipients would rather accept a message that they can trust 
(Tellis, 2000). Credibility consists of two sub attributes: trustworthiness and exper-
tise. Trustworthiness is linked to reliability, integrity, and trustfulness of a com-
municator, “. . . it is an ability of a source to transfer honest, objective utterances” 
(Tellis, 2000, p. 256). The endorser’s trustworthiness depends to a great measure 
on how the audience decodes his/her motivation for brand promotion. A celebrity 
gains the trustworthiness of the audience via his/her life—primarily professional 
(on screen, in a sports game, etc.), but secondarily also a private one (or at least 
its aspects that are shown to the public via the media). Both such sides of life are 
interconnected and strongly influence one another. In general, celebrities taking on 
the role of endorsers must present themselves as the ones who do not manipulate 
the audience and are utterly objective and honest. The overall effectiveness of the 
celebrity endorsement process (Tellis, 2000) then lies in whether the recipients’ 
trust toward a celebrity can overcome prejudice rooted in the fact that a celebrity 
endorser gets paid or they start to believe that he/she also uses the products/brands 
endorsed (Ohanian, 1991 and others).
A second credibility attribute is expertise or professionalism. The attribute is 
related to knowledge, experience, or the abilities of the endorser that have a link to 
the promoted brand. There is a capability of the source to communicate valid and 
unbiased statements. Shimp (2007) emphasizes that professionalism is not an absolute 
phenomenon, but rather depends on a subjective perceptive ability of the audience.
If the audience evaluates a celebrity endorser as a credible one, there is a high 
probability that the advertising message will be positively accepted. The process is 
labeled internalization—acquisition and acceptance of the communicated idea and 
its integration in the recipient’s existing value system and his/her attitudes (Světlík, 
2012). Internalization happens when the recipient acquires the presented attitude 
toward the promoted brand and accepts it as his/her own.
An important factor that is necessary to consider in relation to celebrity 
endorsers is the question of celebrity saturation. Some authors believe this fac-
tor to be the key (e.g., Um, 2008) for effective communication. We understand 
saturation as a level of celebrity involvement in an ad. At times—it is especially 
true with extremely popular celebrities—a celebrity can be involved in the pro-
motion of too many brands. In such a case, we can talk of multiple endorse-
ments and ­overexposure of his/her marketing and communication potential 
that leads to attenuation of the link to the promoted brand. Another form of 
multiple endorsements is the promotion of one brand/product by several celebri-
ties (underexposure). The first case includes sharing one celebrity among more 

148  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
brands. This practice raises a question as to how this impacts audience perception 
of a brand and the endorser. Research has demonstrated that (Mowen & Brown 
as cited in Um, 2008; Tripp, Jensen, & Carlson, 1994) celebrity overexposure has 
negative consequences on the celebrities and commercials in which they appear 
on the one hand, but also negatively influence the assessment of the brand and 
shopping intention on the other hand. Another important factor is whether the 
endorsed brands/products appear in the same or similar product segment or they 
belong to completely different segments. Tripp et al. (1994) mention that endors-
ing more than three brands has a negative impact on celebrity endorsement credi-
bility, which is true for more famous as well as for less famous celebrities. This has 
a negative impact on the endorser’s credibility. The trustworthiness of a celebrity 
decreases together with his/her high involvement in a commercial, as recipients 
may link such an attempt with dishonesty not only to the promoted brand but 
also to his/her audience. Secondarily, negative qualities can be also transferred to 
the brand/product.
Creativity in Advertising and Trust
Creativity in advertising is one of the aspects that helps to attract the attention of 
the recipient (see research by Wilson, Baack, & Till, 2011) and to develop a posi-
tive attitude toward advertising, and secondary to the presented service, product or 
idea. Some sources, for example, Wells, Burnett, and Moriarty (1965), Sankaran 
(2013) state that “. . .creativity of advertising can be counter-productive and there 
may occur so called effect of the vampire creativity” (p. 2). In case advertising is 
not useful and applicable we cannot identify it as being creative. It can be origi-
nal, but not creative. So, the assumption of “vampire creativity” is incorrect. Only 
“vampire originality” can be considered. Toward that argument it must be argued 
that it violates the current definition of creativity—if we follow the valid defini-
tions (Rothenberg & Hausman, 1976; Szabo & Szabová, 2014; Szobiová, 2004; 
Wąsiński, 2005), so we could consider that creative ads are only those which are 
characterized simultaneously by originality and utility (suitability and application). 
Among respondents, the novelty and utility of creative advertising affected the atti-
tude toward the advertised brand, while its utility affected the trust in the brand 
positively (see Sheinin, Varki, & Ashley, 2011).
Bellman, Robinson, Wooley, and Varan (2017) proved in their research that 
perceived creativity of advertising increased the probability of acceptance of the 
advertised message. Ang, Lee, and Leong (2008), have stated that new and mean-
ingful advertising with which viewers can “connect” can produce higher data recov-
ery and more favorable attitudes toward advertising compared with advertising 
that does not dispose these qualities. Similar results were reached by Reinartz and 
Saffert (2013) who realized their research in Germany. The research significantly 
proved that creative texts reached a higher level of consumer attention, leading to a 
more positive view of the brand.

Trust and Marketing  ◾  149
Consumer surveys carried out in 2003 within the V4 countries reported on 
advertising requirements (by Taylor Nelson Sofres SK, reported by Šimek  & 
Jakubéczyová, 2003). Results proved that besides truthfulness, informative value, 
and the competence to attract attention, triggering interest is also necessary in 
order to be credible, humorous, and original (see Figure 9.1). Novelty and original-
ity of the approach are therefore conditions for the ultimate success of advertising 
communication.
From all forms of marketing and communications (see e.g., Štrbová, 2012; 
Tomczyk, 2010), only some suggest creativity by its very nature. By using spe-
cific elements of the environment and by its essentially unrepeatable character 
(always use what the current environment offers and allows), ambient advertis-
ing fulfills the attribute of originality as the main principle that is fundamen-
tal for creativity. Ambient advertising communication uses nontraditional or 
nonstandard alternative media, so-called ad hoc, that is used only once, for 
certain purposes; for example, the advertising on public transportation buses, 
hairdresser salons, and many others (see e.g., Wojciechowski, 2014, 2016). This

type of communication adequately addresses the target groups and it is not likely 
that recipients will become oversaturated by this communication form (Lehnert, 
Till, & Carlson, 2013) whereas it is unrepeatable. Jurca, Romonţi-Maniu, and 
Zaharie (2013) compared the effectiveness of ads located in the nontraditional 
and unconventional medium (such as an ambient medium). Moreover, the per-
ceived credibility of an unconventional medium was significantly higher com-
pared with a traditional medium. Similar findings were reported by Maniu and 
Zaharie (2014). For these reasons, the next section is devoted to ambient mar-
keting communication.
Guerilla Marketing, Ambient Advertising, and Credibility
Jay Conrad Levinson used the term and thesis of guerilla marketing as we know 
it now in his book published in 1984. He defined guerilla marketing as unusual, 
unconventional methods of marketing with a low budget and “going after the con-
ventional goals of profits, sales and growth but doing it by using unconventional 
means, such as expanding offerings during gloomy economic days to inspire cus-
tomers to increase the size of each purchase” (Levinson, 2003, p. 4). To compare, 
we can also present a definition by Ives (2004) who defined guerrilla marketing 
as “A broad range of advertising methods that strives to strike when people least 
expect it. Though publicity stunts have been turning heads for ever, mainstream 
marketers are increasingly turning to guerrilla tactics as consumers prove more 
difficult to reach with traditional advertising” (p. 23). Guerilla marketing belongs 
to unconventional forms of marketing, the aim of which is to address and attract 
potential clients and at the same time to maintain a low budget.
Guerilla marketing (see Figure 9.2) is based on unconventional ways of pro-
moting products, services, and ideas. Therefore, it is considered to be a nonstan-
dard form of marketing. It is a form of promotion that cannot be avoided by even 
the largest opponent of advertisements. According to Světlík (2012) and Szyszka 
(2013), these forms can affect everyone, everywhere (also in campaigns of cultural 
institutions [Walotek-Ściańska, 2015] or NGOs) and using, for example, word-of-
mouth marketing, social media marketing, viral marketing, ambient marketing, 
and public relations (for more details, see Ďurková, 2011 or Gajdka, 2012).
Therefore, Hutter and Hoffmann (2011) present benefits that have their 
basis in a beneficial relationship of costs for promotion and resultant effects. 
To achieve this target, the marketing campaigns primarily focus on so-called 
“Surprise Effect” in their first phase, which they achieve by creating a new and 
unconventional idea (Franková, 2011). This idea must be communicated to the 
target group. This phase is followed by the next phase, called the “Diffusion 
Effect” in which the aim is to stimulate consumers and/or media to spread the 
message further. Another effect, called the “Low Cost Effect” means that the 
increasing Surprise Effect is aggregated by several persons in the target group, 
which finally decreases relative costs.

Trust and Marketing  ◾  151
Several types of guerilla marketing and tools of ambient marketing exist in dif-
ferent symbiotic correlations (Solík, 2014). Ambient marketing tools also point to 
the level of their similarity, which is expressed by the way of their placement, imple-
mentation, time characteristics, cost, material design, and technological support 
(Pavlů, 2009; Mago, 2015; Štrbová, 2012). Therefore, we can speak about a certain 
coherence thanks to which these techniques can be assigned to ambient forms.

Ambient Advertising
Ambient marketing is a term that is mainly and most often connected with  
nonstandard, imaginative, and innovative marketing. Despite the problem with its 
definition, it usually includes activities from fields which have nothing in common 
(Wilczek & Fertak, 2004). According to Luxton and Drummond (2000), the term 
ambient was used in the context of marketing communication in 1996 for the first 
time by the British company Concord Advertising.
At the beginning, marketers started to use places that had never been considered 
as places for advertising, such as floors, fuel dispenser nozzles, fountains, rubbish bins, 
benches (street furniture), interior doors of public toilets, shopping carts, large surfaces 
of buildings, and so on. However, the selected localization should be associated with a 
message of the advertisement, so use of an untraditional place was not purposeless. It 
assigns them specific new meanings in a significantly unconventional way.
Hatalska (2002) writes: “ambient media . . . include all non-standard activities 
performed by classical media and other communication channels” (p. 7). Jurca 
and Plăiaş (2013) characterize this form as follows: “ambient advertising refers to a 
creative form of out-of-home advertising that conveys direct and contextual mes-
sages by using and often altering existing elements of the environment in a way that 
surprises the target audience” (p. 1769). Advertisements are placed in unusual areas 
directly in the social environment of a target group, where they live, work, and play 
(Krautsack, 2008). According to Barnes (1999), a characteristic feature of ambient 
advertisement is to surprise a consumer by confrontation with incongruent sugges-
tions on an unusual background. The only certain fact is that ambient marketing 
is based on unconventional, new, and surprising ideas and uses unconventional 
placement (Derbaix & Vanhamme, 2000; Meyer & Niepel, 1994; Pavel & Cătoiu, 
2009; Lee  & Dacko, 2011; Luxton  & Drummond, 2000; Shankar  & Horton, 
1999). Surprise is a result of the difference between perception and expectation.
Moreover, we also observe a significant decrease of consumers’ confidence toward 
advertising a communication message. According to a survey conducted by Nielsen 
(2013) in 56 selected markets around the world, the greatest potential in sales uses 
buzz marketing as a form of advertising (Hughes, 2008). Almost 84% of respondents 
decided that the most important sources of information are recommendations and 
references from other consumers when deciding on a purchase.
Ambient advertising is a certain form of creative thinking (Csikszentmihalyi, 
1996; Fichnová, 2013). It needs creativity, and so it unintentionally becomes a pio-
neer for new trends (Ogonowska, 2014). At the same time, the life of a specific 
ambient advertisement does not last forever. This kind of advertisement with a 
specific communication message can be effective only for a short period.
However, ambient marketing has a much greater potential to affect a possible 
recipient than any other form of advertisement not only because it is different, but 
mainly because it directly addresses the recipient. This is another advantage of this 
form of marketing.

Generations X and Y and Their Specific Characteristics
When specifying certain common characteristics among age cohorts, we can rely 
on the findings of psychologists. As some research suggests, in every new genera-
tion there occur certain specifics related to the era, in which the individual grows 
and his personality is therefore undoubtedly influenced by wide social, techno-
logical, cultural, or political aspects. Some refer to this trend as a secular trend 
(e.g., Mingroni, 2004; Rösler, 1990), or the acceleration of mental development. 
Others refer to specific generations (e.g., Jandourek, 2001). The term generation 
refers to the group in which individuals of the same or similar age are ideologically 
and spiritually connected and their so-called “horizon of vision” is determined 
by similar historical destiny (Mannheim, 1952). Social, political, cultural as well 
as changes in the development of science and technology are specific for differ-
ent periods and provide a framework in which individuals of a given generation 
develop and form.
The evident advancement of technology, digitalization, and advanced penetra-
tion of computers, the Internet, and other conveniences of the present world are 
hence becoming one of the factors forming individuals and society. McLuhan’s 
(1991, p. xxi) statement that: “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape 
us” fittingly describes this state. A McLuhan follower, media analyst Postman 
(1999), advocates the thesis saying that every new kind of media in history 
(script, letterpress, telegraph, photography, radio, television) has changed the 
structure of ­discourse in society. However, as many authors have insinuated (e.g., 
Gołuchowski & Losa-Jonczyk, 2013; Mistrík, 2004; Vybíral, 2005), technologies 
do not only characterize culture, but they also influence and shape communities as 
well as individuals and their behavior.
Prensky (2001) described youths as “digital natives” and those, who were born 
and raised in the predigital era as “digital immigrants.” Members of the “digital 
natives” generation have their own ways of learning as well as preferred cognitive 
styles (there exist objections against this approach, e.g., Bennett & Maton, 2010). 
Whether we will refer to this generation with Prenskys’ term “digital natives” 
(2001) or rather spread the label “Net-generation” (Leung, 2004; Tapscott, 2009) 
or “Millenials” (Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005), we do not indicate the demographic 
demarcation, but more likely the complexity of the demographic cohort, its values, 
life experiences, and life style.
These terms designate the first generation that grew up surrounded by tech-
nology such as personal computers, video games, and the Internet. The first to 
define specifics for each generation was Howe and Strauss (1997) in the publication 
The Fourth Turning in which Generation Ys are characterized as Millennials, and 
according to these authors it is bordered by the years 1982–2004, whereas Leung 
(2004) present this group as young people born between 1977 and 1997. The exact 
time demarcation of this generation has not been unified thus far and opinions of 
various authors differ—from the beginning in 1977 (Bakewell & Mitchell, 2003), 

154  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
to 1982 (McCrindle, 2006). Similarly, the upper borderline varies from 1990 
(Horváthová, 2012) to 2004 (Howe & Strauss, 1997). The same ­situation occurs 
when defining Generation X. For the purposes of this chapter, we will follow the 
definition of generations given by Howe and Strauss (1997). Considering the fact 
that in every country there can be various characteristics of generations regarding 
the current socioeconomic, political, and technological changes, this is not an ideal 
concept. However, it also helps to identify the generation in the wider geopolitical 
­context and in view of globalization trends in culture, business, finance, or market-
ing communications.
The questions of Generation Y and its specifics are often being presented, 
whereas there exists little empirical research. Researchers such as Ball, Beard, and 
Newland (2007) support the focus of this generation on new technologies, which 
was manifested in their research as a decline in an interest in the classical types of 
books along with a 146% increase in an interest in using electronic full textbooks 
and journals. Similar findings were introduced by Beard and Dale (2008) and 
Gálik (2010). In view of these changes and the specifics of Generation Y ­compared 
with Generation X we can also consider their specific preferences with respect to 
the media (this area was examined in the Slovak population, e.g., by Rábeková, 
2008). Various media preferences among different generations will likely impact 
the preferred type of marketing communication. These preferences may not be 
sufficiently predictable, as demonstrated in our previous research (Fichnová & 
Wojciechowski, 2016) where the expected preference of digital communication 
has proved to be perceived as worse than ambient communication.
Like the preference of the media, preferred types of patterns (idols) may be dif-
ferentiated per generation segments (Vrabec & Petranová, 2013), which can then 
be important information when deciding which famous person to engage in the 
content of marketing communications.
Research
Research questions (RQs): Based on the abovementioned facts, we conceived sev-
eral research questions, and we divided them into several groups as follows:
1.	Trust in Publicly Known Figures
RQ1: Which publicly known figures in Slovakia are credible for the represen-
tatives of Generation X?
RQ2: Which publicly known figures in Slovakia are credible for the represen-
tatives of Generation Y?
RQ3: What reasons have led respondents to their choice?
2.	Creativity of Ads and Their Credibility
RQ4: Is there relationship between the degree of creative realization of adver-
tising and its perceived credibility?

Methodology
Methods of Data Collection and Procedure
For data collection, we prepared our own combined type of questionnaire. Questions 
were aimed to identify the name of the public figure evaluated by the respondent 
as credible and the reasons that led the respondent to his choice. The questionnaire 
also contained the questions in which the interviewed people valued various types 
of ads (print ads used in the daily press and magazines, outdoor ads/billboards/
ambient ads, audiovisual spots, videos on social networks). Every ad was valued 
on the 5-point Likert type scale. These ads were designed to present different levels 
of creativity (creativity was set by experts according to the modified version of the 
evaluation scale of ads by Smith, MacKenzie, Yang, Buchholz, & Darley, 2017). The 
questionnaire was presented to the respondents in the classic print version. Another 
group of respondents was examined with an electronic version of the questionnaire, 
using a panel brought by Survio service (http://www.survio.com/sk/).
Methods of Data Analysis
The data obtained from the questionnaires were analyzed using several procedures. 
The open-type questions were processed by content analysis—within the modified 
version according to Scherer (2004) as the quantified content analysis. To analyze 
the frequency of important words, in some items of the questionnaire we used a 
tool that is available online https://www.online-utility.org/ (Adamovic, 2006). To 
evaluate the responses, we used descriptive statistics as well as methods of induc-
tive statistics: Q correlations, t tests (double-paired and unpaired tests) with the 
Bonferroni correction and chi-square.
Research Sample
The sample consisted of a total of 177 respondents aged 18–54 (average age 33.33 
years) with a balanced representation of gender, regions of Slovakia, and repre-
sentation of respondents with different levels of educational attainment, while the 
percentage copied the demographic variables in this factor in Slovakia (data from 
the Slovak Statistics Bureau). Regarding research objectives, the research sample 
was divided into two cohorts. The first one consisted of respondents belonging 
to Generation X (born between the years 1961–1981). Regarding the different 
opinions to limit the age scale of this generation we used the criteria of How and 
Strauss (1997), who obviously came first with the generation concept. The total 
number of respondents was 75, the average age was 45.31 (sd = 6.81; mod = 39;  
med = 43). We applied the same procedure for Generation Y (born between the 
years 1982–2004). The total number of respondents was 102, the average age was 
27.53 (sd = 2.82; mod = 20; med = 21).

Results and Discussion
Trust of Generation X in Public Figures
A summary of the responses is provided in Table 9.1. Only 14 respondents (18.7%) 
did not have or did not mention any public figure that they could trust. A cer-
tain skepticism is reflected in the answers, I do not know whether any public fig-
ure can be trusted, I do not trust anybody, or I trust only myself. Two respondents 
(2.6%) reported more than one answer. Respondents representing Generation X in 
Slovakia reported up to 24% of the responses were politicians.
The most reported was Slovak President Andrej Kiska (38.9% all in the poli-
tician category). Respondents of Generation X mentioned the name of Russian 
President Vladimir Putin three times. Actors and spiritual persons were reported 
by respondents in the same frequency (11 times in both cases, that is, 14% of the 
total number of Generation X respondents). The most frequently reported was the 
actor Milan Lasica (5), the most reported spiritual persons were Pope Francis (3) 
and Dalai Lama (3).
Singers, presenters, or scientists were reported four times each. The Generation X 
respondents did not name any writers, but instead a recently deceased visual art-
ist, architect, designer, and university teacher of Czech origin was named. He was 
well known as the creator of glass objects, furniture, and the main administra-
tor of the Prague castle during the reign of Václav Havel. From these results, it 
is difficult to determine the most suitable candidate to take advantage of well-
known personalities (public figures) in marketing communications in the role of 
an endorser (recommender).
Frequent use of sportsmen (especially Peter Sagan) only reached a low per-
centage of representatives from Generation X. On the other hand, there was a 
high potential for political communications, as politicians were most frequently 
reported by this cohort as credible personalities. Regarding the low number of 
preferred figures, the generalization of the obtained results was not possible. 
Generation X is not homogenous in these preferences, but some trends, as we 
presented above, are obvious.
Trust of Generation Y in Public Figures
Based on the quantitative analysis (when the unit of analysis was a specific response 
to an item in the questionnaire), we found that the Generation Y sample could be 
divided into three smaller groups that were not equally numerous, but reflected 
their views on the credibility of public figures. A summary of the results is pre-
sented in Table 9.2.
In the first group of “distrusting” respondents (36 answers in total, relative quan-
tity—further “RQ” 35.3%) there were either no answers to the question (6.86%) 
or a distrust in public figures (16.67%). Part of the respondents (5.9%) stated

pretending. The question is whether this results in some personal disappointments 
and its generalizations, transposed opinion, the general incredulity, or other factors.
The second group could be called “standard trusting” (59.8%), where the 
respondents claimed only one public figure.
This subgroup was larger than the first “distrusting” subgroup. This differ-
ence was statistically significant. The representatives of Generation Y in Slovakia 
trust mostly the Slovak presenters—editors (19.6%). The presenter Adela Banášová 
received the highest number of votes (10.78%), followed by Zlatica Puškárová 
with 4 votes. The secondmost trusted subgroup were politicians (14.7%). The 
most trustful among the politicians was the president of Slovakia, Andrej Kiska 
(5); Parliament members Igor Matovič (2) and Marián Kotleba (2); and former 
U.S. President Barack Obama (2). The next most numerous group of public figures 
trusted by respondents were musicians (11) and sportsmen (10), whereby musicians 
were more often foreign and sportsmen more often of Slovak origin.
The last, the least numerous group, consisted of respondents indicating more 
than one trustworthy public figure. Answers included two to three public figures 
from the same public sphere (e.g., politics), or from different spheres. It is worth 
noting that in only three cases, did Generation Y respondents mention the name of 
a writer. They did not mention any scientists or visual artists.
Comparison of Trust of Generations X and Y in Public Figures
According to analysis of data provided in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 and their compari-
son (Table 9.3), there are obvious elementary differences in which public figures 
are trusted by Generations X and Y in Slovakia. Generation X respondents are 
willing to trust politicians (almost one-quarter of them), while the Generation Y 
respondents trust TV presenters and editors (19.6%) and politicians (14.7%) as 
well. Another difference appeared in the frequency of voting for spiritual personali-
ties. Generation X mentioned them more often than Generation Y.

The numerous group for Generation Y presented singers and musicians (10.8%), 
but in Generation X there were only 5.3% respondents. Generation Y respondents 
did not mention any scientists or artists, but among the Generation X respondents 
such answers appeared, however in small quantities (5.3% and 1.3%). In total, 
Generation Y respondents were less willing to trust public figures than Generation 
X respondents. Up to 35.3% representatives of Generation Y did not trust public 
figures because no suitable figure exists for them. The same answer was given by 
only 18.7% Generation X respondents. We subject the results of quantified content 
analysis to statistic comparison and based on this comparison we can state that the 
surveyed groups of respondents significantly differentiate in numbers of how many 
representatives of individual groups do not trust famous personalities—represen-
tatives of Generation Y prove to be less trusting. This finding can be attributed 
to their focus on personalities from the entertainment industry (musicians from 
abroad, or speakers of entertainment programs) who are usually mentioned by the 
media only because of scandals.
Reasons for Trust in Selected Public Figures 
Stated by Both Generations X and Y
Both generations identically stated those reasons that are mainly focused on either 
real or dedicated attributes of famous personalities. Generation X mentioned attri-
butes evaluating personality dimensions: honesty, integrity, fairness, incorruptness, 
modesty, humbleness, justness. Generation Y also mentioned attributes of a person-
ality or his/her features, but they were more of the emotional and social type: like-
ability, kindness, spontaneity, pleasantness, friendliness, humanity, and tactfulness. 
They also mentioned wisdom, sensibleness, erudition, and education. Besides the 
attributes, both generations also mentioned activities done by celebrities for which 
the generations considered them to be credible. Generation X mentioned: he/she 
makes surveys, fulfills promises, helps, acts. Generation Y most often mentioned 
that a celebrity is credible because he/she is involved in charity activities, helps 
people and children, takes care of other people, makes things with passion, are 
willing, and had never lied. This generation included the fact that such personality 
“records his/her life and publishes his/her videos” among relevant activities. Both 
generations also derived credibility from the status of a famous personality; for 
example, they state that a famous person is a representative of something, or a head 
of something, he/she knows something, manages something, he/she has a position, 
age, he/she is a good sportsman, writer, he/she has achieved something, and is suc-
cessful. Similarly, both generations relied on their internal feelings—Generation X 
stated: I have such feeling of him/her, He/she acts on me like that, and Nice facial 
features. Generation Y stated: I like him/her, He/she does not mislead, He/she acts on 
me like that, He/she performs in public like that, His/her voice is interesting, and His/
her opinions are good. Generation X also stated: He/she can motivate me. Besides the 

Trust and Marketing  ◾  163
categories mentioned above, Generation Y also had another category which could 
be called a nonscandalous way of life. They considered a famous personality to be 
credible if he/she is decent, without any scandals or with a minimum number of 
scandals, or without a big scandal.
Creativity of Advertising—Ads and Their Trust
The research was also designed to explain possible relationships between the mea-
surement of creative advertising and their perceived credibility. Rate of creativity 
in ads was evaluated through a modified scoring scale by Smith et al. (2007). We 
used criteria as follows: originality, flexibility, synthesis, elaboration, artistic value, 
ad-to-consumer relevance, and brand-to-consumer relevance. Every criterion was 
evaluated on a scale of 1 to 6. The final score showed the creativity level of each of the 
eight ads. The mentioned authors present preliminary norms, so it was possible to 
objectively identify which ads could be considered creative and which ads were below 
the average. For further analysis, we chose two ads. Those were the ones that were 
characterized by extreme values for the dimensions: highly creative–low creative. For 
highly creative advertising, we chose C (ambient advertising using fountains) and as 
a low creative ad, we chose G (billboards). Next, based on a questionnaire (described 
in the “Methods” section) we investigated the level of perceived credibility of ads by 
the two groups (the average assumed credibility of all ads, particularly the average 
values as well as other statistical indicators). Contingency Tables 9.4 and 9.5 pres-
ent the response rate of the respondents—in assessing the credibility of creative and 
uncreative advertising. The respondents were not familiar with the categorization of 
ads, so their evaluations were based solely on their own judgment.
Results confirmed a significant relationship between the level of creativity of 
advertising and its credibility in both groups. The more interesting the advertising 
for its creativity, the larger the tendency of spreading the message and trust of the 
advertising. In this concrete case, creative advertising was identified as the ambient 
advertising sample.
It is obvious that this kind of advertising is more effective to recipients in gain-
ing their trust. By analyzing the results more precisely, we can conclude that despite 
some expected greater conservatism of the older generation, our results suggest that 
highly creative ambient advertising was considered as one the most trusted advertis-
ing mediums by Generation X.
On the contrary, Generation Y representatives evaluated it as “lukewarm” (2.63), 
although its credibility was ranked in third place out of eight ads. The low value 
isn’t a reflection of untrustworthiness of that ad (or ads of this type), but rather a 
manifestation of the critical approach to advertising and marketing communica-
tion by all representatives of the younger generation in general. They were also 
more reserved in their choice of trustworthy well-known personalities, while sev-
eral respondents answered that they didn’t trust media-covered personalities at all. 
Nevertheless, the best rankings were given to media-famous domestic YouTubers.

Based on these paradox findings we can assume, that well-known personality or 
celebrity endorsers in combination with creative execution of ads are factors with a 
positive influence on the credibility of advertising.
Limitations of Research
First, basic limitation lies in the sample size included in research. For financial and 
organizational reasons, it was not possible to include a greater number of respon-
dents and respondents from other countries. At the same time, classification into 
cohorts by generation brings pitfalls, relating to the fact that in different countries 
there are specific conditions of individual development based on cultural, political, 
economic, and other conditions. Therefore, the age definition of generations can 
be different in various countries. Also, the specifics of these factors create unique 
and nontransferable modification of specific symptoms with representatives of 
generations.
Conclusion
We identified the differences in preferences of two groups—Generation X and 
a younger Generation Y. Although results of the research have some limitations 
(particularly in the size of sample), we believe we identified at least some trends. 
Research was triangulated as we connected qualitative and quantitative techniques. 
We discovered the following:
◾
◾Generation X respondents often trust politicians, respondents of Generation 
Y trust Slovak guests—politicians together with TV news personas were only 
in second place.
◾
◾In general, Generation Y respondents can believe well-known personalities 
less than Generation X respondents.
◾
◾Both generations have similar reasons for trusting well-known personalities.
◾◾One more category connected with perception of well-known personali-
ties by Generation Y needs to be considered, and it is “nonscandalousness.” A 
trustworthy well-known personality is someone, who, besides having attributes 
as being “polite,” has “no scandals” or “minimum scandals,” or “no past scandals.”
◾
◾Attributes of celebrity endorsers are strongly connected with their credibility 
as perceived by the target group. We should also mention the attractiveness 
of a celebrity is another important component of their presence in adver-
tising. There are three subcategories that can be distinguished within the 
attractiveness dimension: physical attractiveness, respect, and similarity. As 
pointed out in previous research (Mikuláš & Světlík, 2016), there is another 
aspect of successful communication using celebrity endorsement, which is an 

166  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
execution of the ad itself, or the way a celebrity is acting for the product or 
brand.
◾
◾Generation Y respondents were more critical in the evaluation of ads than 
respondents of Generation X.
◾
◾Generation X respondents perceived ambient advertising as the best; 
Generation Y respondents preferred YouTube videos.
◾
◾Both generations perceive billboards as the least trustful form of 
advertising.
◾
◾Trust is significantly connected with creativity of advertising.
When building trust, it is appropriate to consider the conceptualization of 
trust by target groups and integrate it into the marketing message; for example, the 
observed absence of scandals for building trust among Generation Y, or emphasis 
on politeness with Generation X. When planning a media selection, marketers 
should prefer different communication media than traditional billboards. Besides 
the use of videos, we can point to ambient advertising, having the potential to be 
significantly supportive in building trust thanks to its creativity. In the future, it 
would be helpful to extend the implementation of research in other countries to 
identify specifics of generations influenced by current geopolitical and cultural 
situations as well as to give recommendations for improved communication on a 
global scale. Inspiring challenge for future research will lie in the focus on the gen-
eration older than Generation X and on the generation younger than Generation 
Y (Generation Z). Even after indicated attempts, the topic of trust and credibility 
will not be exhausted and we believe that it will address more and more attention 
of experts in marketing communications and other fields as well.

Introduction
In social media, trust and its analysis are crucial, especially in this age of Big 
Data (Calefato, Lanubile, & Novielli, 2015; Niedermeier, Wang, & Zhang, 2016; 
Wendy Chan, 2015). Both insecurity and the variability of choices make trust a 
significant condition for cooperation within each society, including a virtual one. 
However, the increasing specialization of roles, functions, and professions make 
such cooperation essential, and also place this cooperation as another source of 
insecurity (Sobocińska, 2009). Therefore, trust becomes an instrument that 
facilitates both the evaluation and selection from a wide variety of possibilities  
(cf. Sztompka, 2007), as well as reduces insecurity.
The issue of trust in social media is complex, not only due to the factors men-
tioned above, but also because of attitudes toward truth in media coverage in the 
modern world (which includes the social media world). Aside from the trend con-
sidering truth as a basic evaluating criterion, there is a strong trend that recognizes 
post-truth as a dominant feature of the present. According to the basic meaning 
presented in the Oxford Dictionary, post-truth is defined as “relating to or denot-
ing circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public 
opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief” (Oxford Dictionaries, 2016). 
The notion accents that the beliefs of people today, including social media users, 
are fueled by emotive opinions and arguments rather than facts. For instance, the 
concept was used to capture the gut instinct, anti-establishment politics that swept 
Donald Trump and Brexit supporters to victory. In both campaigns, social media 
played a significant role.
Trust is understood and defined in various ways (Paliszkiewicz, 2013; 
Paliszkiewicz, Gołuchowski, & Koohang, 2015; Taddeo, 2009; Tejpal, Garg, & 
Sachdeva, 2013). The difficulties associated with the creation of universal trust defi-
nitions result from the complexity of the trust phenomena and, in consequence, 
from the research interdisciplinary (Kim, Ferrin, & RaghavRao, 2009). The issue 
of trust has been the subject of research conducted within the fields of sociology, 
political sciences, philosophy, psychology, economy, management sciences, and 
media sciences (Curtis, Herbst, & Gumkovska, 2010; Gauchat, 2012; Muethel & 
Bond, 2013; Murphy, 2006; Park, 2015; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998; 
Ward, Mamerow, & Meyer, 2014). This is confirmed by the analyses of numerous 
works on this topic.
In the early scientific studies on trust, its definitions concentrated mainly 
on its psychological aspects. It was only later that the notion was considered in 
a broader context, aiming to create a universal definition. However, the mul-
titude and dissimilarity of both trust definitions and the measurement models 
hampered the development of a common approach to the various authors’ work 
results, thus making these results difficult to compare. Currently, the trend to 
particularize this notion is visible again. It is analyzed, for instance, in the con-
text of the virtual environment, in the context of trust toward new fields, for 

Social Media and Trust  ◾  175
example, technologies or institutions as well as in terms of trust in social media 
(Paliszkiewicz & Koohang, 2016).
Trust, trust models, and trust management systems have been researched more 
in recent years, but in the field of social media analysis, the lack of its unambigu-
ous definition is still visible. It is necessary to capture the knowledge of trust as a 
foundation of an automatic analysis.
Satisfactory answers have not been found, not only to epistemological questions 
focusing on the research on trust in social media, but also to methodological ones. 
The research methods that should be utilized to obtain a better empirical experi-
ence of trust (Calnan & Rowe, 2006) or the methods of trust management are not 
established, yet. The generally accepted methodology of trust measurement, which 
could constitute a foundation of the analytical framework for building and diagno-
sis the trust in social media, seems necessary.
The aim of this chapter is to capture the characteristics of trust in social media 
through the development of trust ontology in the social media context. This seems 
to be a step that needs to be taken in terms of the abovementioned social media 
trust measurement. The development of ontology creates a foundation for the ana-
lytical framework aiming to build and diagnose trust in social media presented in 
this chapter.
Trust in Social Media and Trust-
Based Knowledge Analysis
Social Media
Social media revolutionized communication in today’s world by creating a new 
communication area—the Internet (also known as cyberspace or virtual reality) 
(Hadzialic, 2016; Hynan, Murray, & Goldbart, 2014; Tench & Jones, 2015). This 
permits an almost simultaneous communication between nearly unlimited institu-
tions online which are territorially dispersed. Therefore, social media constitutes a 
platform of mutual contact of global network users situated anywhere in the world. 
Such platforms enable the exchange of thoughts, sharing experiences, concurrent 
sharing of users’ information to a group of people (e.g., their location or emotional 
state), and allow pictures and sharing to the user’s list of friends. They create an 
area where one can create their own image, seek social support, organize social 
events, or undertake political activity. For instance, due to quick communications 
from anonymous users from different countries (Anonymous) are able to organize 
protest movements.
The world of social media has also been penetrated by institutions and com-
panies that use it as a means of sharing information and contacting their clients 
(Ngai, Moon, Lam, Chin, & Tao, 2015). Company profiles and known brands are 
often added to the user’s friend lists due to their interest in the companies’ products. 

176  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Many individuals treat the information obtained from social media—portals or 
blogs—as more important than the ones available in the traditional means of com-
munication. In this way, social media has resulted in sharing opinions, knowl-
edge, and public or private discussions. Several types of discourses have emerged 
and ­created many implications on the private, institutional, social, and political 
activities. They have an impact on communication, as well as on the work in many 
institutions and companies. Medialization through social media has created new, 
innovative forms of online interaction and contribution and has opened up new 
perspectives for knowledge acquisition and sharing as well as participation in the 
decision-making processes (Bharati, Zhang, & Chaudhury, 2015).
The notion of social media encompasses forms of communications such as 
blogs, microblogs, wikis, social networking sites, and content sharing sites (for 
further info see: Paliszkiewicz & Koohang, 2016). The benefit to businesses that 
have access to a communication platform for a targeted audience has been broadly 
described in many publications. It is often suggested that social media offers signifi-
cant benefits for corporate communication. The benefit of social networking using 
a variety of social media enable discourse, knowledge distribution, and creation of 
ideas without being in close proximity physically. As a means of communication, its 
use can reduce the impact of the disability. For example, a visually impaired indi-
vidual may use social media, for example, Facebook or LinkedIn, to communicate 
with friends and people working within the same area of scientific research.
Trust as a Relation
The relationship between partners communicating by social media is based on trust 
(de Laat, 2005). It involves the engagement of at least two parties participating in 
the relationship: the trusting party (the trustor) and the trusted party (the trustee). 
The characteristics of social media include the fact that each of the participants 
(parties) of the communication process can, in a certain moment, act as a trustor, 
and as a trustee in the next one (or inversely). In social media, the trustor signals 
their credibility first through the creation of a post in the social media sphere—thus 
becoming the trustee/potential trustee (see Figure 10.1). Credibility and other trust 
foundation elements are signaled by various means in a message being subject to a 
credibility assessment.

The foundations of the relationship, where the sender’s credibility is significant 
and which is built on trust (i.e., foundations that may be difficult to capture at 
times), are shaped by the final level of the message recipient’s trust toward this mes-
sage and its sender. Such trust comes to life between the partners of the peculiar 
relationship, created between the message sender and message recipient. It can be 
metaphorically stated that the sender “sells” the content and the readers, through its 
acceptance and acquisition (by making it “theirs”) become the buyers. The signals 
contained in the text and its context are decoded by the individual who endows the 
sender with trust. In the last stage, based on the signals and other circumstances 
(psychological tendency to trust), the person credits the trustee with a certain 
amount of trust (Doligalski, 2009).
In summary, the approach toward trust presented in the literature shows that it 
is treated as, among others, a collection of determined expectations toward the part-
ner, a consent to remain in a co-dependence or dependence state, a trustee’s belief 
that their expectations regarding the delivery of certain values from the trustor are 
met (and that they will not be at the risk of additional costs) (Doligalski, 2009), or a 
peculiar relationship between the partners in the communication process.
What seems especially interesting is the approach toward trust as a relation-
ship because it allows understanding the characteristic features that accompany the 
creation of the trust. Trust as a relationship between communication partners has 
many features, which are characterized in Table 10.1.

178  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Trust is a complex phenomenon and interesting studies are associated with its 
foundations. They are referred to as trust elements (Daniel & McAllister, 1995), 
trust dimensions (Erdem & Özen-Aytemur, 2014; Paliszkiewicz, 2013; Tan & Lim, 
2009), trust sources (Zejda, 2010), or trust components (Kramer & Tyler, 1996). In 
the associated literature, the term “trust dimensions” is used interchangeably with 
other notions in the analyses which vary in terms of the level of detail.
Trust Components
Trust is a result of both, cognitive/epistemological processes, related to knowledge 
acquisition, and psychological ones, where a significant role is allocated to founda-
tions and emotions (affective/emotional aspects). Bestowal of trust is, therefore, 
a complex evaluation of various characteristics constituting trust (including the 
evaluation of the relationship partner), conducted by one of the parties. The evalu-
ation is not unchangeable as there are many processes associated with trust such as 
trust development, trust preservation, loss of trust, trust re-build/re-development, 
and so on.
Throughout the years of trust studies, the researchers have not reached an agree-
ment regarding which of the trust features (dimensions, components, elements), 
numerously presented in the literature, are the most significant. The diversity of 
the research results available in the literature in this field is great. It includes theo-
retical models and empirical research where the researchers propose as many as  
10 dimensions (McCole, 2002), but there are also research works assuming only 
two components: affect-based trust/goodwill-based trust and cognition-based 
trust/knowledge-based trust (Korsgaard, Schweiger, & Sapienza, 1995; Lewis & 
Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998; 
Wicks, Berman, & Jones, 1999; Young & Daniel, 2003). The distinction of these 
components is especially popular among the researchers concerned with trust 
measurement. Most scientists assume that trust includes both of the elements 
(McAllister, 1995), however, some of them claim that it is essentially an affect-
based reaction (Atkinson & Butcher, 2003; Korsgaard et al., 1995). Undoubtedly, 
visibility is the influence of the beliefs related to the relationships between knowl-
edge/cognition and the affective/emotive side (or between the cognitive and psy-
chological processes) on the shape of these notions. For instance, the influence of 
emotions on the cognitive processes is visible.
Affect-based trust is associated with the emotive side of the relationship 
between partners. Flores and Solomon (1998) claim that trust based on the affec-
tion/emotions has an entirely different character than trust based on rational 
premises. It is emphasized that this form of trust requires a common interest, 
open communication, integrity, the experience of positive interactions, good 
intentions, attention to the relationship upholding (Lencioni, 2012), and that 
it requires more time to emerge (Gulati & Sytch, 2008; Pučėtaitė, Lamsa, & 
Novelskaite, 2010).

Social Media and Trust  ◾  179
Cognition-based trust is related to the trusting party’s knowledge of the party 
endowed with trust. Knowledge takes the shape of a conviction resulting from, 
above all, a certain experience acquired in the course of the relationship with the 
partner. Many researchers, when distinguishing the so-called cognitive trust (see 
e.g., Tyler & Kramer, 1996), find support in the forecasts and calculations associ-
ated with the likelihood of the occurrence of the second party’s given behavior. 
This approach toward trust implies that the premises of trust toward the other 
party include the knowledge on the similarity of moral and ethical beliefs of 
the parties, the acquaintance of their hitherto actions, as well as the knowledge 
that both parties acted in a credible, competent and responsible way. Due to 
this knowledge, the parties may also expect a similar behavior in the future. 
This makes the cognitive trust to be supported by rational premises. Cognition-
based trust relies on the perception of credibility, which is mostly conditioned by 
the evaluation of the second party’s competence, kindness, and integrity (Mayer, 
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995).
The distinction of all factors influencing the process of trust shaping in the 
social media is highly difficult. Trust is developed by both honest individuals and 
manipulators. It is possible to learn how to build trust, therefore the analyses of 
reports, studies of documents and statements available in the social media, permit-
ting capturing good practices, are justifiable.
Developing Trust in Social Media
Trust in interpersonal and inter-organizational relationships is a resource that usu-
ally enhances with the development of contacts and diminishes with their lack. 
However, this relationship is not developed automatically. The development of trust 
depends on many factors associated with both sides of the relationship. From the 
perspective of the individuals who attribute a large significance to trust, including 
the managers in organizations utilizing social media to communicate both within 
the company and with its environment, the ability to “direct” the trust develop-
ment process is of great importance. It involves the creation of appropriate circum-
stances for trust stimulation and the systematic monitoring of its level as well as 
possible updates of the knowledge of the relationship partners and the planned 
actions. Therefore, members of the organizations who are managing social media 
communication should be aware that mature trust requires time and a transition 
through several intermediate stages. What may be of use in this aspect is a tool for 
trust monitoring and shaping.
What is worth noticing and including both in the trust development process 
and in the trust analyses is the fact that trust building must be gradual and should 
be based on the delivery of new evidence to strengthen trust. Initial trust is devel-
oped on the overall trust manifesting in the way which each of the partners treats 
other individuals. However, full trust with which a partner can be endowed in the 
communication relationship is a process requiring time and the acquisition of new 

180  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
knowledge on the media communication partners. The research shows that a con-
viction, which is an effect of the second party’s credibility evaluation resulting from 
rational or emotive premises, is needed prior to and aside from the overall trust. A 
conviction build in this way induces the decision to engage in the relationship and 
undertake further effort aiming to strengthen the initial trust or even enhance it. 
The decision and its subsequent actions may also result from rational or emotive 
premises.
When it comes to organizations, the trust management term is also used 
(Paliszkiewicz, 2013). Trust management is defined as an activity based on the cre-
ation of systems and methods which enable both parties to evaluate the trust level 
and make decisions whether to engage in the potential transaction and to estimate 
the level of the risk associated with it. Trust management is a more voluminous 
notion than trust development, as it also involves other aspects. It includes the 
activities associated with trust, whereas trust building is focused on only one of the 
trust management processes.
In the trust management process, the organizations not only build (develop) 
trust using social media but also struggle with other, day-to-day issues such as 
trust erosion, trust re-build, the coexistence of trust, and distrust or trust trans-
fer. All of these notions should remain within the range of the organization’s 
management of trust, developed using the social media. Therefore, this allows 
the creation and analysis of the conditions (processes, principles) in which trust 
develops and occurs.
Levels of Trust Maturity
The researchers identified five maturity levels associated with trust and dependent 
on the quality and phase of relationship development. The characteristics of these 
levels are presented in Table 10.2.
For instance, the development of knowledge-based trust, according to Lewicki 
and Tomlinson (2003), constituting a more permanent category of trust, requires 
actions, including knowledge acquisition and experience gaining, due to the fact 
that the previous experience and the knowledge gathered on the partner (especially 
the predictability of their behavior) are in its foundations. The creation of this kind 
of trust requires also a necessary factor of a positive contact history confirming the 
partner’s credibility. This type of trust is developed in the course of effective com-
munication between the parties as it deepens the mutual acquaintance and under-
standing between them. The relationships in social media may be based on this 
kind of trust, as they are related to partners knowing each other for a certain period 
of time. It is built on the experience of a successful cooperation and the verification 
of mutual expectations.
It is worth noting that Lewicki and Tomlinson (2003) deemed ­identification- 
based trust as the highest level of trust, with its foundation defined as an emo-
tional bond that generates mutual loyalty. This bond emerges due to the parties’ 

Social Media and Trust  ◾  181
very good knowledge of each other as well as the ability to represent each other’s 
interests. This trust relationship is symmetric. Control and security are necessary 
for consequence of this level of trust maturity. Such a high level of trust may occur 
in organizations and in the social media only in specific cases—in very well inte-
grated, small teams.

Analytical Model of Trust in Social Media
When managing trust, the managers responsible for the communication and 
knowledge management perform at least two key tasks:
1.	A diagnosis of trust in the community that the organization is interested 
in/the determination of the level of the maturity of the trust toward the 
organization
2.	Evaluation of the “quality” of the trust-based knowledge created in the group
During the analysis of the discourse in social media, there is a need to iden-
tify the type of trust granted by the partners fulfilling the roles of the trustor or 
the trustee as well as to evaluate the various types of the trust-based knowledge. 
Moreover, there is a need to evaluate trust itself due to the fact that in a group 
utilizing social media as a means of communication and for trust-based knowledge 
creation, trust may be on a different maturity level. Therefore, there is a need for a 
tool to diagnose the existing trust as well as a tool used to evaluate the knowledge 
delivered by the participants of the discourse in the social media. A robust under-
standing and trust analysis, especially automatic, is permitted by a good ontology 
of trust in social media.
Trust Ontology in Social Media
The literature features numerous definitions of this notion. The broadly accepted 
definition of ontology is a subject of an ongoing discussion. The definition formu-
lated by Gruber in 1993 is considered the most commonly known. According to 
this definition, “An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptu-
alization” (Gruber, 1993), the conceptualization is an abstract, simplified represen-
tation of the world which is desired to be presented for a specific purpose. “Explicit 
specification” emphasizes the role that notions and relationships occurring in the 
abstract reality model as well as their limitations, should be assigned with unam-
biguous names and definitions. “Formal specification” of ontology indicates that 
the definition of the terms and notions should be created in a formal language with 
well-known logic-based properties. Shared conceptualization means that ontology 
may be used by many agents; humans and applications.
According to W3C, it is assumed that “An ontology defines the terms used to 
describe and represent an area of knowledge. Ontologies are used by people, data-
bases, and applications that need to share domain information (…). Ontologies 
include computer-usable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and the 
relationships among them (note that here and throughout this document, defi-
nition is not used in the technical sense understood by logicians). They encode 
knowledge in a domain. In this way, they make that knowledge reusable.” (W3C 
Recommendation, 2004).

Social Media and Trust  ◾  183
The methodology of ontology creation has been presented in numerous research 
works (i.e., Casellas, 2011; Corcho, Fernandez-Lopez, & Gomez-Perez, 2006; 
Gomez-Perez, Fernandez-Lopez, & Corcho, 2004).
Trust Ontology Assumptions
When creating an ontology, it is necessary to determine its objectives and accept 
the assumptions it needs to be fulfilled. It is worth mentioning that a trust-based 
relationship between the partners in social media includes the involvement of at 
least two parties participating in the relationship: the trusting party (trustor) and 
the trusted party (trustee). The subject literature distinguishes two approaches to 
the issue of the determination of the roles associated with the creation of a trust-
based relationship.
The first approach, derived from psychology, assumes that trust is deeply rooted 
in the personality of the trustor and its strength is dependent on the individual 
psychosocial development (Rotter, 1967). This trust is sometimes referred to as 
affective trust. This approach assumes that trust depends mostly on the trustor. It 
emphasizes that trust, while being on the trustor’s side, results from the person’s 
readiness to trust other people.
The second approach is based on the assumption that trust is dependent on the 
trusted subject. The subject does not imply a person—it may be a brand, a technol-
ogy, or an institutional system. Trust is a positive expectation related to the motives 
of the second party associated with the evaluation of one’s own risk level (Lewicki & 
Bunker, 1996). According to this approach, trust mostly depends on the relation-
ship partner’s ability to develop credibility (Laeequddin, Sahay, Sahay, & Waheed, 
2010). Usually, the trusted party’s trust is considered.
It seems that a more complex epistemological approach toward trust is needed 
for its development and analysis in the social media: a trust ontology taking into 
account not only the attitudes of the relationship partners but also the trust subject 
and context. What needs to be examined is the trustor—trust subject—trustee 
relationship in the given time as well as the trust decision-making process set in the 
particular case. This is confirmed by the results of numerous studies proving that 
trust consists of many dimensions. It contains not only the mental and emotional 
component/aspect but also the cognitive one. In such works, trust is understood as 
a certainty, a conviction or a conviction collection, a hope or the confidence in the 
future behavior of the other party.

Medium
The conducted research shows that trust in social media depends on the social 
media platform hosting the discourse. Therefore, the ontology should also take into 
account the characteristics of this medium. The foundation of this characteristic 
constitutes in the description of social media (i.e., presented by Paliszkiewicz & 
Koohang, 2016).
Trust Sender Role
Self-knowledge, that is, the knowledge of the trusting subject of itself should 
be captured in trust ontology. It is important to take into consideration the fol-
lowing dimensions describing the trusting person: whom do they trust, how

much do they trust, and why do they trust, including the emotional component  
(benevolence) and the cognitive component (the past behavior and its 
­consequences, learning).
The willingness to trust (to grant trust) and its opposite, that is, distrust, are 
considered personality traits. The psychological perspective—the willingness to 
trust others shows that trust is a degree to which “one is willing to ascribe good 
intentions to and have confidence in the words and actions of other people. This 
willingness will in turn affect the way in which one behaves toward others” (Cook & 
Wall, 1980).
The willingness to trust others is also associated with the positive convictions 
of oneself. Persons declaring self-confidence are characterized as not only highly 
agential, that is, having the ability to deal with important life problems, but also 
as open-minded and trusting due to which they obtain the assistance and sup-
port from the people in their closest circle. They are also optimistic toward their 
future, seldom experience depression, sadness, and loneliness, and enjoy life more. 
Furthermore, they are more likely to learn new things. However, the role of the 
trusting party is not reserved for people only. In the media in general, the role 
is fulfilled by the message sender, but also by the social group (journalists), the 
organization (e.g., the newspaper editorial office), or even the Internet platform 
designed and ran by people. Recent studies show that a significant portion of social 
media traffic is generated by social bots.
Actors
The role is not always fulfilled by a human being—it can also be fulfilled by 
an organization, a company, or an institution (as an entity designed and ran by 
people). Trust may contribute to control action reduction between sides of media 
discourse in the same way as it can reduce uncertainty accompanying mutual 
business relations. It is based on a subjective, gradable likelihood of the occur-
rence of behavior and actions conducted by the other party in the particular 
situation. The level of trust is, therefore, a criterion deciding on the choice from a 
multitude of possibilities not only in the economic but also in media activity. In a 
situation where an action verifying the message needs to be taken, despite the risk, 
trust becomes the basic strategy of handling the uncertainty and the inability to 
control the future. Trust constitutes the belief in the given actions or properties of 
the trusted subject, it is a “bet taken in terms of uncertain, future actions of other 
people” (Sztompka, 2007, p. 69). The acceptance of the assumption indicates the 
expectations and convictions on a certain subject and the implementation of the 
convictions through actions. According to the quoted author, instead of passively 
awaiting what fate will bring, a person bases their convictions on the level of trust 
he or she has toward the other party. As a result, he or she undertakes actions 
based on trust, whose consequences are uncertain and impossible to predict.

186  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Situation and Trust Subject
Trust depends on, not only the features of the trust relationship parties, but also 
on its subject, the content of the message and the situation in which the message 
is conveyed. Due to this fact, in many author’s studies, trust is treated as a both 
situational and interpersonal variable. The subject of trust may include the sender’s 
intentions (benevolence), the message sender’s competencies, the compliance of 
actions with the declarations (integrity) and the products of the communication 
process: opinions, arguments, and narration.
Trust Relationship
The trust relationship is also treated as a separate entity when it is equipped with 
certain features. Their occurrence and intensity, and not only the relationship par-
ties’ features, are worth distinguishing and analyzing in the social media com-
munication processes. In the associated literature, they are often attributed to the 
partners/trust parties.
The Prototypical Model
The outlined analysis of trust development and the aforementioned ontology con-
stitute the foundations for the creation of the tool supporting the diagnosis of trust 
in relationships between partners who communicate via social media. The creation 
of the prototypical, analytical tool was based on the model developed by Lewicki 
and Tomlinson (2003) who indicated the actions one can undertake to build trust. 
The quality of the realization of these actions should be the subject of the diagnosis. 
The prototypical model of the tool is presented in Tables 10.3 and 10.4 and focuses 
on two levels of trust maturity: knowledge-based trust (the third maturity level) 
and identification-based trust (the highest level of trust maturity). These levels were 
characterized earlier in this chapter.
The first of the discussed trust levels—knowledge-based trust—can be diag-
nosed through the analysis of the communication experiences gathered in the 
course of the social media platform use. This provides foundations for gathering 
of knowledge on the media discourse partners, for example, determining the pre-
dictability of their behavior. This kind of analysis also requires the access to the 
positive/negative contact history occurring in the given time period, which would 
confirm the partner’s credibility. This type of trust can be diagnosed when there is 
a permanent, effective communication between the parties.
The second of the presented trust levels—identification-based trust—is possible 
to obtain through the utilization of the analysis of the discourse participants’ senti-
ment, as this level of trust is based on the emotional bond between the discourse 
partners. In their posts, the social media users refer not only to the discourse subject 

Social Media and Trust  ◾  187
but also voice their positive or negative opinions on the partners. These statements 
can, therefore, be used as the indicators of trust with which they endow their com-
munication partners.
What seems to be helpful in the development of the trust analysis tool is the 
approach to trust as a peculiar process, proposed by Dietz and Den Hartog (2006). 
The authors distinguished three phases: belief, decision, and action. The adaptation 
of this model for the purpose of the analysis of the trust granted to the partner(s) of 
the trust relationship allows the assumption of three phases of the decision-making 
process.
The starting points (the first phase) of trust creation consists of the subjec-
tive judgment as well as the conviction related to the other party and the mutual

relationship which assumes that the partner’s actions will have positive conse-
quences. In the case of an unfamiliar person, it is replaced by the overall trust—a 
trust toward a group of people that includes the particular person. On the other 
hand, in the case of a known individual, the trust can be calculated as the personal 
trust toward the given person.
The next phase, according to Dietz and Den Hartog (2006), focuses on the 
decision of whether to trust the relationship partner. According to many authors, 
it is located between the expectations associated with the credibility and the ones 
resulting from the previous actions (Huff & Kelley, 2003). The decision indicates 
that the trustor considers the trustee as credible on a certain level and intends 
to engage in the relationship, undertaking a given risk of the trustee’s potentially 
harmful actions, determining their occurrence probability as rather low (Dietz & 
Den Hartog, 2006).

Social Media and Trust  ◾  189
The last phase distinguished by Dietz and Den Hartog (2006)—the actions of 
the trustor directed at the partner—separates/joins the trust from/with the associ-
ated actions. The actions include control acts that the trustor may undertake (or 
not) in order to verify the evaluated message of the person who was assigned with 
a particular trust level. The verification delivers additional knowledge which may 
influence the earlier decision on the trust level. In the case of trust built by means 
of social media, the trust development process may include activities such as under-
taking control actions that verify the analyzed opinion or argument through the 
search for other statements.
Conclusion
Social media is an important platform for the discourse which is participated in by, 
not only the individual social media users, but also the employees and organization 
associates. The objective of the discourse led by an organization is the acquisition 
and creation of credible knowledge used for innovations and decision-making. The 
development and analysis of trust in social media, in this particular context, is 
important in terms of creating and acquiring knowledge used by organizations for 
the purpose of decision-making.
This chapter presents the trust development and analysis concept utilizing the 
social media trust ontology and the outline of the tool that supported the manager 
in the diagnosis of trust within a group cooperating by means of the social media. 
The manager is interested in a group due to the interest in their trust toward the 
organization and the interest in the creation and acquisition of trust-based knowl-
edge. It is assumed that in the case of trust built by means of social media, the 
entries on the users’ activity, constituting the process of trust development, are at 
hand and their analysis allows the diagnosis of trust and in consequence, the evalu-
ation of the quality of the knowledge (opinions, arguments, and narration) created 
with a group.
The ontology as well as the analytical tool presented in this chapter are prototyp-
ical and were verified using a relatively small group of journalism and information 
technology students of the University of Economics in Katowice. The verification 
has revealed the need to improve the developed tool and to develop a software tool 
(dashboard) for the analysis and presentation of the analysis results associated with 
the trust within a group utilizing social media to communicate, resolve problems, 
and create credible knowledge.
The deliberations conducted on trust demonstrated that many conceptually 
unresolved issues still occur. The created ontology allows the determination of the 
method of its understanding and generates a foundation for the development of 
trust analysis tools for the purpose of individuals dealing with communication and 
knowledge management within an organization. It seems that the main research

issues associated with trust in social media, which still requires further study, 
includes the following:
◾
◾The character of social media trust in the aspect of its components, features 
(dimensions), and types
◾
◾The level of trust, especially its optimal level, for communication in social 
media
◾
◾Factors influencing trust developed by means of social media platforms, that 
is, creating and destroying factors
◾
◾The diagnosis of factors influencing the shaping of trust levels in social 
media
◾
◾The impact of the coexistence of trust and distrust between communication 
partners in social media
◾
◾The influence of new technologies (i.e., social bots) on the shaping of trust in 
social media
◾
◾Methods of measurement and automated analysis of trust in social media
Aiming to resolve these issues, further works of the authors will concentrate on 
the development of the methods of trust measurement in social media as well as on 
the construction of a tool for the automatic analysis of social media trust.

Part 1—Why You Should Do Analytics
Introduction
Analytics has been a frequent topic in major media outlets over the past several years. 
Many practitioners and academics alike argue that there is nothing new about the 
various technologies. In fact, many of them may have been around for some time. 
However, the new media attention has caught the attention of business executives, 
civic leaders, and stakeholders from nearly every corner of the globe. Everyone wants 
to be better at what they do, and analytics is offering an opportunity for many orga-
nizations to do just that. Building on a seemingly simple question, “What is analyt-
ics?” we ultimately seek to answer the question, “Why should you do analytics?”
What Is Analytics?
There has been a rousing debate within the analytics community over the past five 
or so years. As quantitative analytical techniques have garnered increased media 
attention and public interest in recent times, disciplines such as operations research, 
optimization, computer science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathe-
matics, statistics, engineering (and on, and on, and on) have endeavored to pivot 
into advanced analytics. That is, everyone that has done anything analytical has 
attempted to articulate how their work fits into the field of analytics, and, recipro-
cally, how analytics fits into their field.
The term “analytics community” may be taking a bit of license, as there is not 
a single established definition of analytics, yet. And, perhaps there will never be. 
However, there are some well-established players in the field that have articulated their 
own definition, and exploring these could be useful to putting the pieces together. At 
least for the sake of the discussion at hand, a definition of analytics will be helpful in 
building up a tool set for leveraging advanced analytics in decision-making.
Here are four definitions worth introducing:
1.	Analytics is an encompassing and multidimensional field that uses math-
ematics, statistics, predictive modeling and machine-learning techniques to 
find meaningful patterns and knowledge in recorded data—SAS (2017).*
2.	Analytics is defined as the scientific process of transforming data into insight 
for making better decisions—INFORMS (2017).†

3.	Analytics is about asking questions from data and getting answers. It’s what 
Aristotle and the ancient Greeks called “inquiry,” and its two parts are 
the question being asked and the method of reasoning used to answer the 
­question—Elder Research (2016).*
4.	Advanced Analytics is a grouping of analytic techniques used to predict 
future outcomes—IBM (2014).†
These four definitions are from a diverse set of practitioners in advanced analyt-
ics, and each are undisputed leaders in the field. Consider these facts in establishing 
credibility for these sources:
◾
◾The SAS Institute has been a leader in analytic software development for over 
40 years, with installations in over 90 of the Fortune 100, and 90% of the 
Fortune 500 companies. They lead the marketplace with nearly one-third of 
the software revenue in advanced and predictive analytics, owning more than 
twice the market share of their closest competitor.
◾
◾The Institute for Operations Research and Management Science (INFORMS) 
is the leading professional society for Analytics Professionals and Operations 
Researchers. They publish 14 scholarly journals that describe the latest O.R. 
and analytics methods and applications; organize conferences for academics 
and professionals; and provide analytics certification and continuing educa-
tion to assist members and others in furthering their careers.
◾
◾Elder Research is an experienced consultancy specializing in data science and 
text analytics solutions. They provide analytics consulting support through-
out the journey—from training and mentoring, to creating stand-alone ana-
lytic solutions, to helping build the capacity to develop solutions in-house. 
They solve business problems as well as data problems.
◾
◾IBM has been in the computing and technology business for over 100 years. 
They have assembled a broad portfolio of analytic capability with acquisitions 
such as SPSS and Cognos. They are a mainstay in the field and offer a variety 
of technical solutions.
When reading through the various summaries of advanced analytics, there 
are some obvious themes. By tearing apart each of these definitions, we will see 
that there are three fundamental components to a general definition of analyt-
ics. The first observation is that each of the four definitions eludes to some out-
come or answer. By inference, the natural precedent for outcomes and answers is 
asking a question. Therein lies the first of the three fundamental components in

200  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
analytics: a question. Analytics is an interrogative process wherein the practitioner is  
seeking to answer some question—more on that moving forward. With a ques-
tion as the first fundamental component, the [previously referenced] answer or 
outcome is the second fundamental component. A key characteristic referenced in 
several of the definitions—also explained in more detail moving forward—is that 
the outcomes and answers in analytics are structurally related to, and derived from 
a set of underlying data. The first two parts being question and answer, the third 
fundamental component is that the outcome or answer must be derived from the 
available data sources, using some quantitatively technical process of inductive or 
deductive reasoning.
In summary, consider the following definition of analytics moving forward:
Analytics is an effective, comprehensive process of implementing a quantitative, 
technical, and data-driven approach to identify useful outcomes or answers to well-
defined questions (Figure 11.1).
Importance of Analytics
Given the definition(s) of analytics given above, there is likely some natural intu-
ition about why to undertake an analytics project, and such intuition is valuable. 
However, for the sake of clarity, it is worth fleshing out these concepts. To better 
understand, it might help to start with a more specific question, then scale back a 
bit. Here goes: Not just why do analytics, but why do analytics now?
The truth is that analytics has been around for a long time, but something 
has changed in the world, enabling a whole new host of analytic capabilities. 
Technology has gotten cheaper—significantly, exponentially, orders of magni-
tude cheaper. This has allowed everyone and everything to generate, collect, store, 
transport, and analyze data like never before. The facts and figures change too 
rapidly to have any permanence, but suffice it to say: available data has grown sig-
nificantly, and the ability to analyze that data has grown significantly as well. This 
has resulted in a paradigm shift—a word often overused by consultants, but likely

an understatement in this context—in the way questions are being asked, and 
­outcomes and answers are being generated and delivered.
The result is that you should do analytics…because you can. There is more data 
available today than ever before. The quantitative, technical approaches that exist are 
more sophisticated, reliable, and efficient than ever before. Any analysis can be done 
faster, more accurately, and with more precision. Beyond simply coming up with 
outcomes and answers, results can be verified by subject matter experts, statistically 
validated, and returned to decision makers in shorter and shorter amounts of time. 
Most importantly, all of this can be done in a scalable, extensible, and repeatable way.
Part 2—How You Should Do Analytics (Process)
Introduction
It is not only important to understand what analytics is and why to do it, but also 
equally important is how to do it. While there is no singular prescription for how to 
successfully complete analytics projects, there is a wide body of experience that can 
help inform the process. Discussion of three major analytics process frameworks 
will help inform a more general analytics process. Some attention to the various 
steps of the generalized will help ensure your success.
Analytics Process Frameworks
In the same way, there is healthy discussion about how to define analytics, there also 
exists a good amount of discussion about how to do analytics. The single-most impor-
tant aspect to completing analytics projects successfully is the fact that analytics is a 
process. Below there will be extensive discussion about various steps within an ana-
lytics process, but the key takeaway must be that each step is critically important to 
success. When conducting analytics projects, it becomes obvious that practitioners, 
stakeholders, and others engaged in the process will likely have an affinity for one step 
or another. In addition, a natural breadth of scope, sophistication, and scale exist for 
each step such that each step will not require the same attention for each project. For 
example, asking the right business question may not ever be as complicated as evalu-
ating model performance. However, that simply does not mean that asking the right 
business question is less important. Each analytics project will require a different 
balance of skills and attention, and just as one practitioner may advocate the impor-
tance of one step on a project, there will undoubtedly exist a different practitioner 
on a different project that will make a compelling argument for an entirely different 
distribution of resources. This does not make one practitioner right and one wrong; it 
simply highlights the fact that each project offers its own challenges, its own benefits, 
and each practitioner may be in tune with the variability of demands.
Another problem understanding the effort and scope of the different steps in 
an analytics processes is the unequal attention these skills receive in education and 

202  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
training. Recent numbers suggest there are hundreds of educational programs in ana-
lytics. Many exist formally at the collegiate level, but the rapid growth of the analytics 
marketplace has put advanced analytical skills in high demand, creating an emergent 
need for less-formal training as well. Unconventional training curricula have appeared 
in the form of boot camps, shorter-form programs focusing on the fundamental quan-
titative and technical concepts of analytics. While the quality of such programs can be 
at a very high level, programs still make choices about how much emphasis to place on 
each step. This unavoidably sets a tone for how much time or effort each step will take 
in practice, and are thus unable to effectively convey the high variability that exists in 
practice. Each step in the analytics process is critical to success in analytics projects, but 
there is no general recipe that will work for every endeavor. Projects will require more 
attention during one step over another, based on unique characteristics of the project.
Borrowing from some of the sources used above, there are three analytic pro-
cess frameworks useful in building out a generic process. Not surprisingly, there is 
tremendous overlap in each of the frameworks presented. But, there does not exist 
a simple one-to-one mapping. For this reason, each framework will be presented in 
summary, and then the generalized framework will be built out from there.
The SAS® Analytical Life Cycle
SAS takes an approach to analytics with an emphasis on action—they call it analyt-
ics in action (Figure 11.2). The process consists of three fundamental concepts: data, 
discovery, and deployment. As Figure 11.2 shows, discovery and deployment are com-
prised of a series of seven distinct steps, all of which are supported underneath by data. 
Across all the education and training referenced above, a tremendous amount of effort 
goes in to teaching analytic discovery. That makes a lot of sense, as a lot of the technical

skills gap exists in that domain. And, to be clear, an analytic project will never be 
successful without a ­meaningful, ­data-driven insight—­discovery is inextricable from 
analytics. However, the ­visualization depicting the SAS analytic framework highlights 
an earlier point that successful analytics projects require an analytics process comprised 
of something beyond ­analytic discovery.
The CRISP-DM Process: Cross-Industry 
Standard for Data Mining
A second popular methodology was developed in the mid-1990s. Commonly known 
by the acronym CRISP-DM, the Cross-Industry Standard for Data Mining has 
emerged as a popular method for engaging in analytics projects, not just data mining 
specifically. Originally developed by SPSS, Inc. (a software ­company later acquired by 
IBM), the CRISP-DM process places significant emphasis on ­business understanding 
and data understanding. Figure 11.3 ­illustrates the ­iterative, ­back-and-forth process

output to feed back into the business ­understanding. The use of these feedback loops 
is an important part of each ­analytics process.

Job Task Analysis (JTA)
A third framework for consideration was developed by the Institute for Operations 
Research and Management Science (INFORMS). In 2010, INFORMS partnered 
with Capgemini to evaluate the analytics marketplace, and their potential role within 
it. One of the findings from that study indicated there was a need for analytics cer-
tification. After assembling a team of experts in the field; from academia and prac-
tice, private and public sector, multiple industries, and multiple fields of practice; 
INFORMS created the Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) designation. A part 
of this development process was identifying necessary skills an analytics practitioner 
must possess to ensure success undertaking analytics projects. INFORMS developed 
the Job Task Analysis (JTA) to highlight the different phases of an analytics project, 
eventually becoming their steps in an analytics life cycle (Figure 11.4). Beginning 
with Business Problem Framing and culminating in Life Cycle Management, the 
process shares many similarities with the other two frameworks presented above.

stands out is a co-linearity that exists between each framework. That is, all three 
approaches approximately begin in the same place, end in the same place, and fol-
low the same general trajectory along the way. Integrating these three frameworks 
into one singular step-by-step process will help flesh out a more generalized frame-
work. Employing such a framework in analytics projects will help maximize the 
likelihood of success. While each of the following concepts originates from one of 
the three frameworks, each will be discussed on its own merits and will not be tied 
to a source (Figure 11.5).
Business Problem Framing 
Fundamentally, analytics problems are business problems. Regardless of your orga-
nization’s objective, be it finance, retail, national security, community service, or 
something altogether different from anything else, at its core, there is some purpose 
and objective to its existence. For the purposes of analytics, the business problem 
is the problem you want to address. The first step in an analytics project, is to fully 
understand what that problem is. It is all too common to begin an analytics proj-
ect and realize at some point further into the project that a tremendous amount 
of effort was being expended to solve the wrong problem. Therefore, putting in 
more up-front work to determine what that problem is and very narrowly define its 
unique characteristics, is critically important.
There are several popular ways to accomplish the goal. One common pro-
cess is to undertake a five why root cause analysis. Many times, the first pass 
at a business problem fails to truly address the underlying issues. For example, 
if your organization wants to improve customer retention, a five why analysis 
will encourage you to go a step further: why do you want to improve customer

retention? “Well,” you might say, “that’s obvious. We’re losing a ton of money 
on customers that leave and go to another provider.” The five why analysis will 
refocus your problem to “losing a ton of money.” So, what initially sounded like 
a customer retention issue may be a financial problem. Is the root cause of the 
financial issue that customers are leaving? Or is it that the wrong customers are 
leaving? Perhaps the high-margin customers are leaving, but the low-margin cus-
tomers are staying. If high-margin customers are leaving, and low-margin cus-
tomers are staying, it may be more than just “customers are leaving” and it may 
be a broader revenue management issue. Following this same process, you may 
say “why is there a revenue management issue?” You may find that there is an 
outdated enterprise revenue management solution. “Why is the revenue man-
agement solution outdated?” Perhaps the current enterprise data management 
solution does not offer revenue management, or maybe the capability they offer 
requires special IT systems that your organization does not currently possess. If 
some of that nuance is unclear, you may need to abstract the problem to your own 
business scenario, but in this exercise, what began as a customer retention issue 
may be an IT issue. Viewing the problem through this slightly different lens may 
open minds to the real problem, and that is where you want to focus your analyt-
ics resources. For the sake of thoroughness, in the example discussed above, you 
might consider investing in an analytic solution to help optimize pricing and 
revenue management.
Data Understanding
Since there are several different ways to think about data, Data Understanding can 
mean a lot of different things to different people. The IT manager may think about 
Data Understanding in terms of what type of data storage solution is in place? Is it 
a relational database, is it column store, graph, or key store? A database administra-
tor may think more about the characteristics of its structure. How many columns 
are there? How many records? Is there an effective method of reduplicating, such as 
primary keys? A data scientist may be interested in completeness of data, whether it 
is continuous or discrete, or whether any entity resolution has taken place. A final 
consideration may be the stakeholder themselves. Where is the data coming from? 
Are the sources reliable? Are these the only data available? Are they the only data 
necessary?
Simply put, these questions are important in the success of an analytics project. 
Each role described above plays a vital part in making the analytics project success-
ful. It is critical to have a complete and comprehensive understanding of the data, 
where they are from, how they are stored, and what information is contained in 
those data. In addition to understanding these data, documenting this informa-
tion along the way can help avoid confusion later in the process. Understanding 
which data sources are available, how they are being used, where they are from, 

Advanced Analytics in Decision-Making  ◾  207
and any known issues will help in subsequent processes, such as model building 
and deployment.
Analytics Problem Framing
In addition to understanding the business problem, it is important to translate that 
business problem into an analytics problem. The definitions of analytics discussed 
above each suggest that analytics is not just one tool, but a variety of tools. One 
analysis by Andy Fast and John Elder of Elder Research, identify ten different lev-
els of analytics.* Beginning with Standard and Ad Hoc Reporting, continuing to 
statistical analysis and learning, optimization, ensembles, and causal modeling (not 
exhaustive), they are very intentional about what they include on their list of ana-
lytics, and it does not exclude some of the more basic analyses. Each discrete level 
of analytics they mention may have a nearly boundless list of tools and capabilities 
with which it is associated. To be successful in an analytics project, it is impor-
tant to identify from the innumerable which specific techniques will help solve the 
business problem. This is the process of analytics problem framing—how do you 
translate the business problem you are addressing into a problem that can be solved 
by one or more analytics solutions.
Data Preparation
Much of the data used in analytics projects are what data scientists refer to as 
found data. Except in rare cases, data are almost always collected for a different 
reason than your analytics project. Consider payroll data, academic transcripts, 
voltage or current readings on a power transmission line. While this data may be 
useful during your analytics project to help you answer your question or address 
your business problem, the truth is that these data were collected for their own 
reasons, and the analytics practitioner is merely repurposing them for her pur-
poses. With that in mind, it is very common to find data in a less than desirable 
format for conducting analytics. Some data is stored as the wrong type (e.g., string 
versus numeric), other data are incomplete (e.g., optional data fields, like birth-
day), other data are stored in the wrong storage architecture (e.g., social media 
networks may be in a graph database). Part of the analytics process is cleaning, 
organizing, and preparing the data to be used for an analytics project. Certain 
analytical techniques may require something like an analytic base table (ABT), a 
very wide data format where each record represents a unique entity and every pos-
sible predictor and target variable for each entity are listed as columns. Preparing 
data may also involve moving and merging data to get them into the best place

for optimal analysis. Transporting large data sets across a network, or performing 
complicated data merges (i.e., bringing two or more tables together as one), may 
be network or computationally intensive. Putting data in the right location and 
performing basic data processing tasks, so-called preprocessing, can dramatically 
improve the time it takes to do analytics.
Explore
One of the characteristics frequently cited as common among talented analytics 
practitioners is their common sense of curiosity. In many ways, having a curious 
mind is more of a personality characteristic, and less of a best practice. However, 
it is always important to play in the data, a term commonly used to describe the 
exploratory process of interacting with data sets. There are a variety of ways to 
explore data sets, but many involve some type of light prototyping.
For example, a first look at a new data set may involve running various sta-
tistical tests to look for any obvious correlations. Summary statistics, including 
information about the distribution of the data may give insight into general trends 
or patterns of interest. Analytics practitioners may also choose to run data through 
one or more visualization capabilities to see if there are any readily observable char-
acteristics (e.g., are data clustered tightly, or more uniformly distributed). Doing a 
first pass with the naked eye can help direct you to a set of analytics that may be 
particularly useful for the type and characteristics of the data in mind. Similarly, it 
may be helpful to create some rudimentary statistical models to determine whether 
any patterns emerge. By running a few simple algorithms, you can start to deter-
mine whether there are any natural patterns. As much as this may help find useful 
ways to analyze the data, it may just as easily find techniques that will not be useful. 
Data analysis in this process can be thought more in terms of divergent thinking, 
rather than in convergent thinking.
Methodology
Once this data has been explored, it is time to determine which specific methodolo-
gies will be employed. Unlike before, where there was some light prototyping and 
exploratory research, here the goal is to engage in more convergent thinking, rather 
than divergent. After trying out various analytics approaches, this is the part of the 
process where you start to focus on which specific analytics methodology will help 
solve the business problem.
A cautionary note about methodology or model selection: it can be tempting 
to use the most advanced, sophisticated approach available. There is a false equiva-
lency between complexity and performance, and, in fact, in many situations the 
opposite is true. Complex analytic solutions certainly have their place, but fre-
quently what accuracy or precision in output you gain with complexity, you lose 
intuition and ability to clarify. There are many good cases of technical success, but 

Advanced Analytics in Decision-Making  ◾  209
with business failure. The reasons for this are myriad, but many times it simply 
revolves around the stakeholder’s ability to implement the change. More complex 
models are inherently more difficult for stewards of company resources to under-
stand, and will adversely affect likelihood of analytic adoption.
Model Building
There are several different ways to build the models necessary to solve your analytic 
problem. There is no shortage of opinion about which tools are best for various ana-
lytic techniques. In truth, many of these are overstated, as a good practitioner can 
generally accomplish the task with more than one tool. True agnostics are equally 
overstating their case. The truth lies somewhere in between.
A frequent conversation had in analytics shops throughout the marketplace is 
whether to choose a licensed (read: expensive) or open-source (free). The debate 
about these two paradigms is not quite as straightforward as both solutions can 
be part of a viable analytics strategy. For many analytics projects, an open-source 
tool can facilitate rapid prototype development. Work completed in the exploration 
stage discussed above is ripe for open-source technologies. A capable practitioner 
can download an open-source analytics software package, connect to some data, 
and begin building a modeling solution in as little as a few hours! But, as discussed 
in several concepts above (e.g., SAS Analytics in Action), and will be discussed 
further below, model development is on one piece of the puzzle. Exclusive focus on 
model building neglects major concerns related to productionalization.
There is another important discussion point about licensed versus open-source 
software. It is a common mistake to confuse purchase price with total cost. Clearly, 
going to a website and downloading the latest version of Python may, in fact, have 
zero monetary cost. However, this distorts an all-too-common reality that using 
open-source software tools frequently takes much more time to develop. Further, 
the resources used to develop with those open-source analytic tools are often paid 
a premium for their skills. Simply put, licensed software is designed to be user-
friendly, and more approachable. A separate problem affecting the open-source eco-
system is their lack of enterprise support and deployment capability. Frequently, the 
money saved on licensing fees for analytics software are offset by the added costs of 
development time, developer compensation, and what can be significant additional 
resources to deploy the solution. This will be discussed again below, but it is worth 
mentioning here when you make decisions about which technology you use to 
build the analytics solution.
Evaluation
There are three important concepts in evaluation: verification, validation, and model 
performance. Verification is the technical process to determine whether the model 
you built does what you designed it to do. Validation is a process used to determine 

210  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
whether you have chosen the correct modeling technique. Last, model performance 
is a set of technical approaches to determine how well your model performs.
Model Deployment
Model deployment is the stage of this process that receives the least amount of 
discussion in current literature. Without deployment, even the most successful 
analytics solution to your business scenario is not creating an impact. Creating 
the modeling approach and solving the hard problems can only contribute to 
your organization’s performance when you use the model to help make a busi-
ness decision. For this reason, it is critical to have a deployment strategy from the 
beginning. Before pulling together data, going through modeling approaches, 
and building a model, it is imperative that you think through how the analytic 
result will be used. You must use an analytic solution that you can deploy into 
your operational environment. In many scenarios, that means deploying your 
analytic solution within some type of IT infrastructure. For example, if you build 
a credit scoring model, you need to have those results available to the enterprise 
system when a user submits their application for credit. That process can be auto-
mated, or built in to the logic of the application and approval system, or it can be 
manual, where the results of the analytic output may be available to a loan officer 
or underwriter. Regardless how you serve up this analytic result, the reality is 
that unless you have those results available for use during the business process, 
the analytic will not be able to have an impact on your business problem. Another 
common use of analytics is to provide the insight back to decision makers, either 
through a dashboard or report of some type. Again, the best, most interesting 
insight will be useless if a decision maker does not have access to the information 
at the time they need to make the decision. This highlights again the need to con-
sider deployment when building a model. While open-source analytics solutions 
appear inexpensive because their free price tag, deploying those open-source ana-
lytic results into your business process may prove much more challenging than 
appears at first glance. Deployment is a key differentiator for licensed software 
solutions, as many good analytics software platforms have given deployment the 
right amount of attention.
Act
Once the modeling solution is built and deployed, the business needs to act on that 
information in real time. At the point of decision, the business process needs to act 
on the analytics solution on an ongoing basis. It is not uncommon to see analytics 
projects find and build the right solution, deploy that solution, and then at some 
point in stop working. Key business processes may be reverted to an old way of 
doing business without the analytics practitioner ever knowing. Without continued 
attention and vigilance, analytics may be built, they may be deployed, but some 

Advanced Analytics in Decision-Making  ◾  211
business process may change external to the analytics solution and the organization 
is no longer acting on that information it needs to.
Evaluate
An important part of the analytics process is to conduct periodic reviews of the 
continued validity of the analytics solution. By evaluating the business life cycle of 
an analytic solution, you are constantly reassessing to determine if circumstance 
have changed to warrant changes or modifications to your modeling approach or 
analytics solution. It is surprising to see how frequently a business process changes 
rendering analytics result less relevant. Many times, the analytics solution will 
remain in deployment, decisions continue to be made based on the analytic insight, 
but the analytic is no longer answering the right business question. In these circum-
stances, your analytics solution may be working against you. If this happens, it is 
time to go back to the earlier steps to re-engage with your business problem and 
reframe your analytics solution.
Model Life Cycle Management
Separate from the business life cycle of analytics solutions, analytic models have 
their own life cycle. For example, predictive models are used to help identify 
whether some event will happen in the future. Ostensibly, successful predictions 
of those outcomes will give your organization the ability to change its behavior—
to make more or less of something happening. By changing the business process 
to effectuate the change you want, you can materially change the environment 
about which you are predicting. An example of this is when you take some action 
to improve cross-selling performance. Supposing you run some analytics to build 
a recommendation engine for your website. When a buyer is interested in buy-
ing product A, you mention to them that buyers who historically have bought 
product A have frequently also bought product B. If after a year of making this 
recommendation, you continue to recommend product B every time someone 
buys product A, you may fail to account for the fact that users are buying product 
A and B at the same time because you are recommending it to them. While this 
is not necessarily a bad thing, you would still want to know whether their interest 
in product B was of their own choosing or was based on your recommendation. 
When you use models to make business decisions, there is a life cycle need to 
continuously re-evaluate the business scenario at hand. Similarly, by not properly 
considering life cycle management of your analytics solutions, you may not catch 
changes in the underlying patterns of behavior. One common description of this 
is not being aware of “unknown unknowns.” If you are trying to predict power 
consumption over the next several years, and you base these predictions on his-
torical data, if a major change in technology occurs, you will need to re-evaluate 
your modeling approach to account for the new technological change.

This chapter provides a foundation for understanding analytics, how to use them, 
what analytics processes and frameworks can be used, and better comprehending 
the steps in the analytics process. Analytics, coupled with intuition based on expe-
riential learning, is a powerful combination for management decision-making. The 
years ahead look bright for this emerging field.

Machine learning is a collection of techniques designed to detect hidden patterns in 
data and construct or learn models for predicting the outcome of future data. These 
predictions can be used to make decisions about the system generating the data in 
the face of uncertainty. In the traditional paradigm, the work flow is data to model 
to decisions, and the decisions are essentially solely influenced by the data. This 
type of purely data-driven prediction system relies on the assumption that all prop-
erties of the system are captured by the collected data. In some applications, this 
assumption can hold. However, when data is sparse, when it is difficult to collect

an adequate data set, or when the data is too complex to model, the traditional 
machine-learning paradigm can produce suboptimal results.
In this chapter, we will propose adding insights, intuition, or prior knowledge 
about a system into the modeling process. Figure 12.1 illustrates our philosophy 
regarding the proper approach to predictive modeling and other forms of machine 
learning. The fundamental idea is that machine learning must be done in the con-
text of the problem being explored, and this inherently mandates the inclusion of 
this additional knowledge that traditionally is not included in machine-learning 
discussions. This “contextual integrity” provides a framework for solving a pre-
dictive analysis with all the appropriate knowledge included (Gibson, Scherer, 
Gibson, & Smith, 2016).
Contextual understanding and insight into systems can come in many forms 
and from numerous sources. Generally, insight about a system is provided by 
domain experts or from a system analysis. A practitioner wishes to incorporate 
the prior knowledge about a system into the model so that it captures physical 
properties of the system and/or constraints of the system. Understanding of system 
properties and constraints are combined with an understanding of the design or 
operation decisions to be made to formulate a computational decision problem. It 
is only at the point when a decision problem has been formulated, that machine 
learning is brought to bear on the available data. We assert that the insight acquired 
during system modeling and problem formulation should be expressed in the form 
of prior probabilities on the parameters of interest in the decision problem. Using 
this type of information will produce models that more closely represent the system 
being studied. An analyst may know, for example, that a Markov transition matrix

has a special structure, such as lower-diagonal, and can then use this knowledge 
to better structure the machine-learning process. A naïve learning algorithm may 
not recognize such a structure and produce incorrect and/or inefficient predictive 
models.
Prior knowledge can also influence the modeling process. Machine-learning 
models can often make assumptions about the process or the data. For example, 
some models assume that the data follow a Gaussian distribution. If this assump-
tion does not hold, the learned model can underperform or completely breakdown, 
providing erroneous predictions leading to poor decisions. Alternatively, a state-
based model’s (dynamic or discrete) initial conditions, generated by human experts, 
may be critical to the transient response of predictive machine-learning models. 
An understanding of the system, therefore, is crucial before modeling can begin. 
Different assumptions can lead to wildly different outcomes in terms of model 
selection or accuracy. Generally, it is best to back up an assumption with insights or 
details about the system or process being modeled.
We will discuss a mathematical formulation for incorporating insights, intu-
ition, or prior knowledge into the modeling process using informative prior distri-
butions. Then, we use this framework to consider three cases—from the disparate 
domains of medicine, manufacturing, and consumer credit—that share the char-
acteristic that prior information is both knowable and useable.
Mathematical Framework for Intuition
One area of machine learning is focused on learning parametric models that explain 
the behavior of the data. These types of parametric models often make assump-
tions about how the data interact with an outcome or the distributions generating 
the data. We propose Bayesian statistical analysis as one method for incorporating 
intuition and prior knowledge into parametric models.
Bayesian methods rely on Bayes Theorem that relates the conditional prob-
ability of events given some idea about how likely that event is to occur. We will 
describe Bayes Theorem using an example with two events A and B. Let the prob-
ability that event A will occur be P A)
(
, and likewise let P B)
(
 be the probability 
event B will occur. These probabilities can be referred to as marginal probabilities, 
prior probabilities, or unconditional probabilities. A conditional probability is the 
probability that an event will occur, given that another event has occurred. In our 
simple example, one conditional probability is the probability that A will occur 
given that B has already happened, and this probability is denoted as (
|
)
P A B . The 
conditional probability of A given B is related to the conditional probability of  
B given A through Bayes theorem

In Bayesian statistics, all parameters are treated as random variables. In a ­general 
setting, let θ represent the set of model parameters and let X  represent the collected 
data. A purely data-driven model attempts to learn parameter estimates (ˆθ) by max-

P X θ  is often referred to as the likelihood of the observed data given the param-

maximizes the posterior distribution ( |

 is excluded from MAP 
estimation because this probability is fixed and does not influence the parameter 
estimates.
In Bayesian estimation, the prior distribution on the model parameters is 
typically noninformative, meaning that it assigns equal weight to all possibili-
ties. Priors are chosen by the practitioners, researchers, or modelers; therefore, the 
practitioners can influence the estimation by the selection of a prior distribution 
or the parameters for that distribution. Noninformative priors are used when there 
is a desire for the data to be the only factor driving estimation, and these priors 
prevent any bias or influence being injected into the estimation by the practitioner. 
Furthermore, noninformative priors allow for easy selection of prior distributions 
and hyperparameters, the parameters of the prior distribution, as these choices 
have little effect on the posterior so long as they remain noninformative. Note that 
MAP estimation using noninformative priors is equivalent to maximum likeli-
hood estimation.
The cartoon in Figure 12.2 illustrates a principal aspect of the Bayesian per-
spective. The frequentist statistician knows that the probability of the detector 
lying is low (1/36) and therefore concludes that when the detector says the Sun has 
exploded then it is likely to have done so. The Bayesian statistician knows the prior 
that the Sun has exploded in each day is 10−13 or less (our Sun won’t explode but 
will instead become a red giant star) and therefore concludes it is exceedingly likely 
that the detector is lying, as the posterior probability of the Sun having exploded 
given the detector result is still around 10−13.
On the other hand, informative priors can be used to convey intuition about a 
system to the estimation process that is not readily available in the collected data. 

Data, Insights, Models, and Decisions  ◾  217
Informative priors are often avoided for two reasons in Bayesian analysis. The first 
is the previously discussed researcher influence that can affect the analysis. The 
second is the lack of a consistent methodology for constructing informative priors 
that is widely accepted over types of models and fields of study. It is reasonable to 
assume that two different researchers could construct very different prior distribu-
tions, given the same prior data or set of assumptions.

Informative Priors
In this section, we give a brief overview of the use of informative priors in research 
and literature. Several of these ideas will be discussed in detail in the following 
examples.
The use of informative versus noninformative priors has been widely debated. 
Jaynes (1985), who outlines the historical debate up to 1985 and favors the use of 
informative priors, presents the following example of how prior knowledge is used 
in every-day inference: A medical diagnostician would not make a diagnosis using 
only the patient’s current condition or symptoms and ignore the patient’s medical 
history. Jaynes concludes by showing how the use of highly informative priors on 
seasonal parameters for monthly economic data improves forecasting.
Thomas, Witte, and Greenland (2007) argue for the use of informative priors in 
epidemiological studies using hierarchical models in their paper, which is subtitled 
“Who’s afraid of informative priors?” They state that letting the data “speak for 
themselves” assumes that the collected data are a good representation of the sys-
tem being modeled and correct. Further, they state that data by itself is not useful 
without assumptions about the model and the inclusion of prior information. They 
assert the need to balance data with prior assumptions and information, which 
directly aligns with our argument for the need to model systems with intuition 
and in context. Zero-numerator problems involve probabilities, such as a transition 
matrix for a Markov model, that do not occur in the training data but are possible. 
If using a maximum likelihood estimator during training, their exclusion from the 
training data causes the probability estimate to be 0, even though the true prob-
ability is greater than 0. Winkler, Smith, and Fryback (2002) study the role of 
informative priors in zero-numerator problems, where an event is possible but the 
probability of the event occurring could be estimated to be zero if the event is not 
present in the collected data.
Similarly, Lord and Miranda-Moreno (2008) demonstrate that low sample 
means for Poisson-gamma models and small sample sizes can affect posterior dis-
tributions when vague or noninformative priors are used. Using a nonvague prior 
decreases the chances of poor parameter estimation. Jang, Lee, and Kim (2010) 
propose a power prior for zero-inflated regression problems.
Informative priors have been used in several types of models. Angelopoulus 
and Cussens (2005) use informative priors in classification and regression trees. 
Coleman and Block (2006) use informative priors in the estimation of parameters 
for nonlinear systems. Mukherjee and Speed (2008) study informative priors in 
network inference.
While previous studies have demonstrated that good informative priors can 
improve parameter estimation and the predictive ability of models, there is no 
well-established methodology for converting prior knowledge into prior distribu-
tions. Guikema (2007) compares five methods for constructing prior distributions 
for failure probability estimation in reliability analysis: the method of moments,

maximum likelihood estimation, maximum entropy estimation, noninformative 
prepriors, and confidence/credible interval matching. He demonstrates that the 
assumptions on the prior greatly affect the posterior. He concludes that if the data 
used in constructing the prior accurately reflects the data collected later, maximum 
likelihood estimation gives a posterior with the minimum variance, but maximum 
entropy estimation is the most robust to differences between the prior data and the 
observed data. In another study, Yu and Abdel-Aty (2013) compare four methods 
for constructing informative priors: two-stage Bayesian updating, maximum likeli-
hood estimation, the method of moments, and expert experience. Each of these has 
strengths and weaknesses, but the authors conclude that the two-stage Bayesian 
updating procedure is superior for the data and model used by the authors.
Raina, Ng, and Koller (2006, June) propose the use of transfer learning for con-
structing informative priors for text classification. Vanpaemel (2011) uses hierarchi-
cal methods for constructing informative priors, and Washington and Oh (2006) 
outline a methodology for building informative priors from experts’ opinions on 
ranking railroad countermeasures.
Rare Disease Priors Example
Microcephaly is a rare birth defect where the brain develops abnormally. Depending 
on the source, the probability of being born with microcephaly can range from 12 
in every 10,000 live births* to 1 in every 666,666 individuals in the United States†. 
If the mother contracts the Zika virus in the first trimester of a pregnancy, the risk 
that the child is born with microcephaly can increase to between 1% and 13%‡. 
In this example, we will demonstrate how insight and prior knowledge can be har-
nessed to estimate the probability of being born with a rare disease.
For each person, there are only two possible outcomes: they are either born 
with the defect or without the defect. Let Y  be the random variable indicating the 
presence of the birth defect, where 
1
Y =  if a person is born with microcephaly and 
0
Y =  if they are born without the defect. For any individual, let θ be the true but 
unknown probability that

Our goal is to find a parameter estimate for θ; we use ˆθ to indicate our estimate 
of θ. A practical use for this estimate is predicting the number of births with the 
defect in each year or within a given geographic location. This prediction could affect

To use this model for prediction and decisions, we first need the estimate of θ. 
One way to estimate this quantity is to collect data a sample from the birthing 
population. In the binomial model, the sample size will equate to N  and the num-
ber of births with microcephaly in the sample will be X . The maximum likelihood 
estimate for the probability is

We know this is not the case because there are in fact instances of births with 
microcephaly. To overcome this zero-numerator problem, we will use the Bayesian 
technique to estimate the probability.

Even if there are no instances of microcephaly in our sample, the MAP estimate 
for θ will always be greater than 0 because both hyperparameters in the beta prior 
must be greater than 0.
Selecting the hyperparameters in the prior distribution can be difficult, and 
this is where insight into the system plays a large role. If very little information is 
known about the system, a uniform prior is often the optimal choice in Bayesian 
estimation. A uniform prior for this example puts equal weight on all value between 
0 and 1. For a binomial distribution, a uniform beta prior has

a strong belief that θ is small, we can set

a should be than b is also quite difficult.
In our microcephaly example, we have prior studies that suggest θ is somewhere 
between 1.5

hyperparameters. Let

uncertainty in this belief. We can set our prior belief to the mean of the beta prior

FSHMM Example
Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features from a larger 
set of collected features (Blum & Langley, 1997; Dash & Liu, 1997; Guyon & 
Elissee, 2003). Feature selection can improve the predictive ability of models by 
removing redundant and unnecessary noisy features. By selecting a subset of data 
streams instead of the set of all possible data streams, the required data storage and 

222  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
processing times of algorithms is reduced. Furthermore, feature selection can help 
with reducing the cost of system design by limiting the number and types of sensors 
that must be used to collect data. Generally, feature selection methods evaluate a 
feature subset using some measure of predictive accuracy and some notion of model 
complexity.
These general feature selection techniques unknowingly assume that all data 
streams have the same cost. Cost is not limited to financial cost and, depending on 
the application, could refer to the difficulty in acquiring the data, time to acquire 
the data, or the accuracy of the data. In real-world applications, data streams can 
have wildly varying costs. Consider the problem of predicting cutting tool wear in 
rotary machines such as CNC lathes. Tool wear cannot be directly assessed during 
the cutting process without stopping the process, which would cause the company 
to incur production delays and, in some cases, degrade the final quality of the 
product. Sensors can be installed on the rotary machines to collect data, and the 
collected data can be used to train machine-learning algorithms for predicting tool 
wear. There are several possible sensors that can be used to collect the data includ-
ing force, vibration, and acoustic emissions. There can be significant differences in 
the price of these types of sensors. Force sensors can be on the order of $50,000, 
while vibration sensors are closer to $1,000. A general feature selection technique 
would not consider the difference in price when selecting a relevant feature subset, 
but the difference in price is certainly a concern when constructing a tool life pre-
diction system for commercial use.
Informative priors can be used to incorporate cost into the feature selection pro-
cess. Adams, Beling, and Cogill (2016) developed a feature selection method specific 
to hidden Markov models (HMMs) and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) 
that considers cost. HMMs (Rabiner, 1989) are probabilistic models for time series 
data with two random variables. The state variable is modeled as a Markov chain 
and is usually unobservable. At each time instance, the state is accompanied by an 
emission that is observable. The emission random variable has a distribution that is 
dependent on the state variable. HSMMs (Yu, 2010) are extensions of HMMs that 
assume a duration or sojourn time for each state.
The feature saliency HMM (FSHMM) proposed by Adams et al. assumes that 
the emissions, represented by Y , come from a mixture distribution that is depen-
dent on the state, represented by X . The mixture distribution is composed of a 
state-dependent Gaussian distribution and a state-independent Gaussian distribu-
tion, and it assumes that each of the L features is independent

q ylt ε τ , has a mean ε and variance

σ , which are both independent of the state 
variable. The feature saliency lρ  is the mixture weight and represents the probability 
an observation from the l th features belongs to the state-dependent distribution. 
The idea behind FSHMM is that relevant features should be more likely to come 
from the state-dependent distribution, and thus 
lρ  can be interpreted as the prob-
ability that the l th feature is relevant.
In FSHMM, all model parameters are treated as a random variable. Priors 
are placed on each parameter and the MAP estimates are calculated using the 
­expectation-maximization algorithm (Gauvain & Lee, 1994). Cost is conveyed to 
the feature selection process through an informative prior on the feature saliencies. 
A truncated exponential prior with support on [0, 1] is used

where Z is the normalization constant and k is the rate parameter. A large value 
for the rate parameter pushes the prior distribution toward 0 and thus conveys that 
more evidence is needed from the data to conclude that the feature is relevant. The 
cost of each feature is used to select the rate parameter where features with higher 
costs are assigned higher rates.
Figure 12.3 displays three standard exponential distributions with rates equal 
to 5, 10, and 25. Note that these plots are standard exponentials and not the trun-
cated exponentials used in the FSHMM formulation. As the rate increases, most of 
the density is pushed toward zero. The expected value of an exponential distribu-
tion is the inverse of the rate parameter. Therefore, as the rate parameter increases, 
the expected value decreases. The expectations of the three plotted distributions are 
0.2, 0.1, and 0.04.
To demonstrate this method, FSHMM is applied to tool wear data (Adams 
et al., 2016). Six independent sensors are used to collect data: force in three direc-
tions and vibration in three directions. It is assumed that each force sensor costs 
$2400 and that each vibration sensor costs $1200. Root mean squared error, the 
sum of log energies, and maximum energy are extracted from each sensor’s data 
stream and used as features. Half of the assumed cost of each sensor is used as the 
rate parameter for each feature saliency prior distribution.
Several numerical experiments are conducted using this example. The MAP 
formulation of FSHMM is contrasted with a maximum likelihood formulation, 
which does not use priors and does not consider the cost of each sensor when select-
ing features. Full models that use all 18 features are compared with reduced models 
where three features corresponding to a single sensor are removed from the feature 
set. These experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the reduced models is not 

224  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
significantly different from the accuracy of the full model, indicating that the feature 
set can be reduced. Further, the accuracy of the ML formulation is not significantly 
different from that of the MAP formulation. However, MAP outperforms ML in 
terms of cost. The ML formulation routinely removes a vibration sensor, while the 
MAP formulation removes a force sensor. Given that there is no significant differ-
ence between the accuracy of the models, the model with lowest cost should be 
preferred. The total cost of sensors using the results from the MAP formulation is 
$8400 while the total cost of the sensors using the ML formulation is $9600.
This example demonstrates how prior information that is not readily available in 
the collected data can and should be incorporated into the design of a system. Without 
this insight, an accurate and possible sufficient system could be designed. However, 
incorporating the prior knowledge about cost leads to a more profitable design.
Markov Model Example
In this example, we deviate from the informative prior framework for incorporating 
insight into modeling. We address how insight can be applied to the structure of a 
model, and how it can drive model building.
Data-driven modeling has become very popular in the last decade. Neural 
networks and deep-learning techniques have been shown to be extremely powerful

in problems such as supervised classification of images. We often think of these 
types of models as “black boxes” because their inner workings are not interpre-
table, and they can be characterized strictly as inputs, a black box, and outputs 
(see Figure 12.4). Neither the number of layers in a deep neural network nor the 
number of nodes in each layer provide insight into the problem or system being 
modeled. In some part, the popularity of neural networks and deep learning can 
be attributed to their black-box nature. Users do not necessarily have to have 
a deep theoretical understanding of the model, and software packages such as 
Tensor Flow allow for users to implement deep learning with almost no theoreti-
cal knowledge.
However, some view their black box nature as a drawback. Companies or 
sponsors can be reticent to utilize purely data-driven models without some link 
to the physical nature of the problem. Further, without the interpretability of 
the inner workings of these models, it can often be difficult to understand why 
a model predicted one outcome over another. In some fields, this interpretability 
is crucial to decision-making. In credit scoring, there needs to be justification for 
why a loan is denied. Typically, logistic regression models are used to predict the 
probability of defaulting on a loan because the model allows for the outcome to 
be traced back to a single or set of explanatory variables that most influenced the 
prediction. A neural network does not offer this ability, and therefore is not a very 
popular model for this task even though a deep neural network might give supe-
rior predictive accuracy.
Utilizing purely data-driven models without insight into a system can lead 
to poor assumptions and outcomes. We demonstrate this idea using an example 
of  Markov models in credit scoring. Parts of this example are condensed from  
(Ho, Thomas, Pomroy, & Scherer, 2004).
A Markov model is based on the assumption that all information needed to 
predict the future is contained in the knowledge about the present and that the past 
does not matter. Mathematically, knowledge about the past, present, and future can 
be represented by a state. A discrete Markov chain assumes that there is a state space

Higher-order Markov chains incorporate more information from the past into

Markov chains are used to model a variety of systems, and often the Markov

test can be used to verify that transition between states are, in fact, Markovian.

of fit test can also be performed, which compares the observed counts with the

expected counts, to assess the Markovian nature of the entire transition matrix. 
In many applications in the literature, the Markov assumption is made without 
performing this test. This can lead to poor models that underperform and do not 
appropriately approximate the system.
In (Ho et al., 2004), the authors present an example for modeling credit scores 
with a Markov chain. First, a 10-state stationary first-order Markov chain is esti-
mated from the data. Both tests show that the estimated transition matrix is not 
Markovian. A reduced model, which groups the 10 states into 3 states, also fails 
these tests. If these tests were not performed, most practitioners would have blindly 
made the Markov assumption and moved on to modeling the system. It is difficult 
to estimate the problems that could be caused by using these models in practice, 
but it is safe to say that making assumptions about models that are false could be 
disastrous. One only needs to look at the financial crisis of 2008, where housing 
defaults were assumed to be independent when they were not, to see how dangerous 
this can be (Saunders & Allen, 2010).
If one takes a step back and thinks about the credit scoring problem, is it rea-
sonable to assume that a person’s future credit state is only dependent on their cur-
rent state and is completely independent of their credit state history? A person with 
historically good credit could be in a bad credit state due to an unforeseen circum-
stance and could be trying very hard to change that state. Further, is it reasonable 
to assume that transition probabilities do not change over time? A person’s behavior 
could certainly change over time.
The example in Ho et al. (2004) goes on to show that a higher-order model, 
which segments states in a specific fashion, does pass the Markovian test. This 
aligns with insight into the problem because it does seem logical that a person’s 
credit history and current credit state would affect their future credit state.
This conclusion also sheds light on another problem often faced when using 
Markov models, how do you decide on an appropriate state space and how do you 
map collected data into this state space. Tool wear is another problem often mod-
eled with a Markov chain. The wear on a tool can be measured in a continuous 
space and must be mapped into a discrete space to use a discrete Markov model. 
The problem is, given M  states (we will discuss selecting the number of states 
shortly), how do we pick the boundaries between wear states? One very simple 
method is to select boundaries so that each state has an equal range in the continu-
ous space. While this method may seem logical, it could not align with the physics 
of the problem. Generally, the first stage of tool wear is a break-in period where the 
change in wear is very high over a short period. Next, the tool enters a period of low 
wear and can remain in this state for several time periods. At the end of the tool’s 
life, it enters a failure state where the wear rapidly increases over a short period. 
Figure 12.5 displays a generic wear curve with the break-in, steady-state, and failure 
regions indicated. Evenly distributed wear boundaries might not capture this type 
of behavior. For example, a state’s boundaries might be placed such that the transi-
tion between the break-in stage and the steady-state stage occurs in the middle of 

228  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
the state. This type of insight into the physics of the problem can lead to a better 
method for selecting state boundaries.
In the previous paragraph, we made the statement “given M  states.” Many 
problem formulations presented in the literature on Markov chain applications 
begin with a similar statement. The number of states is not always readily available. 
In the credit scoring example, the presented data suggests 10 states; however, the 
optimal model segments these states into subgroups. In some problems, the data 
would suggest a very large or even infinite state space (the continuous tool wear data 
could suggest an infinite state space). Several approaches have been presented in the 
literature for selecting the optimal number of states given a data set, but the state 
boundaries must be defined. These methods often evaluate the trade-off between 
model accuracy and model complexity. In our experience, only insight into the 
data, the problem at hand, and the goal of the decision system can lead to adequate 
solutions for selecting the number of states and the state boundaries. Even then, 
these are only models and representations of reality. There is no correct or optimal 
answer to any of these questions. There is only a practitioner’s best guess guided by 
insights and intuition.
Conclusion
In this chapter, we have highlighted the need for additional knowledge that 
needs to be part of the machine-learning paradigm. We have coined this 
approach as machine learning in context; that is, the framework of the problem 
must include, in addition to the data and a constructed predictive model, the 
insights from the problem domain that effect the decision for which the model 
was constructed. We’ve illustrated this with multiple examples that highlight 
the difficulties that can occur without the proper consideration of the machine-
learning context.

While thinking about this chapter, conversations have started to replay in my mind 
relating to fundraising/philanthropy and data science, in which I have grouped 
into three categories. One set of dialogue revolves around a survey of this “Third 
Sector,” discovering its various verticals, constituents, and processes. Another group 
of conversations, the crux of this chapter, dives more deeply into the application of 
data science in philanthropy from data management to data analysis to data com-
munication. Finally, more recent dialogues cover the art of dealing with audiences 
neither versed nor immersed in data science. On a grander scale, talks also swirl in 
my head relating to the implications of local, regional, national, and global changes 
on evolving charities, as well as their relationship to their donors, with regard to 
everything from the ethics of privacy to diversity and inclusion, both within the 
charities and with donors themselves. And since I can only think of these ideas as 
conversations, the following fictitious dialogues detail the business, science, and art 
of philanthropy in conversational form. Of course, the names have been changed 
to protect the innocent . . . and not so innocent.
The Business of Fundraising: Under the Hood 
of the “Third Sector” (as Inspired by 
The Office Fan Fiction)
Jim:	
Good morning, Michael! There’s a stack of mail for you, mainly from 
charities for rabies education and treatment.
Michael:	 What? What sorcery is this? How do they know about my passion for 
rabies?!?
Jim:	
Only if you consider things like marketing and good data science as 
magic. One possibility could be that one or more of these organizations 
bought an acquisition list with your name in it as people with potential 
interest in their causes. Another possibility could be someone donating 
in your name to one of these organizations in honor of your fun run for 
rabies. Folks at these organizations with good data management could 
simply pull up all their honorees and send you educational material, to 
see if the honorees respond to these targeted communications with a gift.
Michael:	 Hmmm, I’m intrigued. It sounds like these nonprofits run like businesses!
Jim:	
Well, you can draw a lot of analogy between the world of commerce into 
the philanthropy sector. For instance, there are what can be considered 
“vertical markets” that make up this sector, as nonprofit organizations 
have missions that meet various goals. For instance, not-for-profit pri-
mary and secondary schools, as well as technical/trade schools, colleges, 
universities, and other educational institutions comprise the philanthropy 
sector’s “education vertical.” Hospitals, medical research centers, and 
other health-related 501(c)(3) organizations fall under the “healthcare 

Flipping the Script  ◾  233
vertical.” Oh, by the way, all nonprofit, public charities, as well as private 
foundations, are designated by the IRS as 501(c)(3) organizations.
Michael:	 Okay . . . . [Looks into the camera in bewilderment.]
Jim:	
I’m just getting started! Places of worship like churches, synagogues, 
mosques, and temples, as well as para-religious organizations, make up 
the “­religion/spirituality” vertical. There’s also a “membership” vertical. 
These can be physical places that folks can go like museums, galler-
ies, and performing arts centers, but they can also be cause-related like 
political organizations, environment-related organizations, and organi-
zations related to social justice or social services. But, of course, these 
are somewhat arbitrary categories. Think of a big university that has 
a medical center, an art gallery, a performance center, and an athletic 
complex/stadium on top of its various research centers and academic 
departments. Or how about religiously affiliated schools. There is defi-
nitely intermingling among the verticals.
Michael:	 But Jim! I’m all about the people! What about the people?!?
Jim:	
Ah, so you want to know about the stakeholders?
Michael:	 Yes . . . . And the potatoes too.
Jim:	
[Looks into the camera in bemusement and ignores the remark.] I think 
people within the philanthropy sector can be divided into how or what 
they give. One group I’d categorize as the “givers of attendance or time.” 
This group would consist of alums or parents of alums for educational 
institutions, as well as fundraising event participants or volunteers, 
patrons, grateful patients, or congregants . . . basically anyone who’s 
willing to spend time to help a particular nonprofit organization.
Michael:	 So, like me, setting up that fun-run for rabies!
Jim:	
Yes . . . . And the second group of “givers” is a nonprofit organization’s 
donors, the “givers of wealth.” Be it in the form of cash, checks, stocks, 
estate or trust, or even property, a nonprofit’s donor base has various 
“price points” or gift ranges. The highest level of giving for any non-
profit is called the “principal gift,” followed by the “major gift,” although 
sometimes it’s just simply “principal/major gift.” A smaller gift in terms 
of dollar amount may be considered an “annual gift.” There are no set 
rules in terms of what makes a principal gift, a major gift, or an annual 
gift. One nonprofit’s “large-ish” annual gift may be another nonprofit’s 
major, if not, even principal, gift.
Michael:	 Wow, so where does the money come from?
Jim:	
Well, donors can directly give to their charity or charities of choice if 
you consider that as one “source of revenue.” For major and/or prin-
cipal gifts, folks can also give more indirectly via private foundations 
or donor-advised funds. Another source comes from those who have 
left part or all their wealth to a nonprofit in their wills or estate plans. 
Usually for smaller, annual gifts, donors can choose to be “sustainers” 

234  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
by making more frequent, repeated gifts, be it yearly, bi-annually, quar-
terly, or even monthly. As an aside, donors can make gifts that are either 
“unrestricted” or “restricted” to a certain area within a nonprofit like 
for a specific research topic, or to a certain position like for an endowed 
professorship. They can also make gifts in honor of someone or others 
who is/are living or in tribute or in memory of someone or others who 
have passed on . . . . [Begins to turn his attention away from Michael.]
Michael:	 But what about us?!?
Jim:	
There is no “us.” [Makes air quotes.]
Michael:	 No, I mean, the first two groups, the participants and the donors, are 
like our customers or clients . . . . So, what about us? [Makes circular, 
encompassing motion.]
Jim:	
Oh, I see! Well, the staff within a nonprofit, I guess we . . . . No, I mean, 
they would be considered the “givers of vocation,” basically folks who 
have made careers related to a nonprofit cause or mission. Wow, Michael,  
I actually think you’re catching on!
Michael:	 I want to start a nonprofit now! Where and how do we start?
Jim:	
[Sidebars to a conference room and deadpans into the camera.] There is 
no “we.” [Goes back to conversing with Michael.]
Well, if you want to know about the process or the “pipeline.” We 
sort of talked about this at the beginning. First, you must make “first 
contact,” that is, getting information about a nonprofit’s potential cus-
tomers/clients, hopefully potential donors but potential participants who 
may also end up being donors. To get information on potential donors, 
or “donor prospects,” for first contact, nonprofit staff will usually have 
to do proactive research, called prospect identification, for principal or 
major gift prospects, as well as buy acquisition lists for potential annual 
donors and sustainers. The next step in the pipeline is the process of cul-
tivation. Sometimes, usually for small or annual gift donors, mass mail-
ing, emails, or even social media messaging are good ways to cultivate 
donors at these gift ranges. However, for major and principal gift levels, 
fundraisers within a nonprofit may write personal notes, call or even visit 
their prospects. With the help of researchers to find information about 
these potential donors, fundraisers would then be able to ask for the right 
amount and for the right reasons. Finally, when fundraisers can “convert” 
prospects into donors, they maintain or steward their relationships with 
their donors by keeping them up-to-date about how the impact of their 
gifts . . . as well as to gauge if or when they’d like to give again . . . Hey, 
Michael, where are you going?
Michael:	 I’m going to start cultivating my principal gift contacts now for our non-
profit! You can text me all your research for us! [Runs out of the office 
and toward the elevator.]
Jim:	
[Stands up and screams.] BUT THERE IS NO US!

The Science of Fundraising: Symbiosis between 
Philanthropy and Data Science (as Inspired by 
Star Trek: The Next Generation Fan Fiction)
Will:	
So, Deanna, tell me again why we’re back toward the beginning of Earth’s 
twenty-first century to study, of all things, fundraising, for this mission?
Deanna:	 I think this is a pivotal moment in Earth’s history where something as 
“nonscientific” as philanthropy and something as technical as data sci-
ence can work so well together as to be symbiotic.
Will:	
Being assigned as a gift officer for this mission, I’ve learned a lot about 
the relational/people aspects of fundraising. I just don’t see how data sci-
ence fits here.
Deanna:	 It’s a good thing that I’m your fundraising data scientist on this mission, 
Commander.
Will:	
Imzadi.
Deanna:	 Oh, please, Will. Stay focused! So, you want to know how data science 
contributes to fundraising? The first step is to understand what exactly 
data science is.
Will:	
Okay, let’s do this!
Deanna:	 If we take data to mean any sort of information that can be stored, data 
science is the empirical way in which information can be managed, ana-
lyzed and communicated.
Will:	
Sounds simple enough.
Deanna:	 Yes, we can easily define these three aspects or pillars of data science: data 
management, data analysis, and data communication. However, each of 
these aspects or pillars can be seen as a specialty within data science that 
individuals can concentrate on as their career. For instance, if we look 
back into Earth’s twentieth century, data management at that time was 
all the rage, as people in this field concentrated on ways to get faster 
and faster retrieval of more and more diverse types of data. During that 
time, data management was better known as database administration or 
report building. As data management evolved, the term “business intel-
ligence” came into vogue as these database-dependent reports became 
more insightful. When all was said and done, however, at that time, 
database administrators/data managers were most concerned about how 
to move and manipulate their data from location to location as quickly 
as possible. You can see that by another term that was also in vogue at 
the time called “ETL,” which stands for “Extract, Transform, Load.”
Will:	
Okay, great. Now how do the other two pillars of data science come  
into play?
Deanna:	 Well, as the volume, variety, and velocity of data increased at a faster and 
faster rate, people began to wonder about the data’s accuracy or, to use 

236  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
another “v” term, “veracity.” People also began to wonder, not just how 
true the data had to be but also how to use all the data available to them 
in their vast and, oftentimes, expensive databases.
Will:	
And this is where data analysis comes in?
Deanna:	 I do believe you’re not just another handsome face, Commander.
Will:	
Compliments will get you everywhere, Counselor, but, please, go on.
Deanna:	 As Earth moved into the twenty-first century, people needed to justify 
the data’s value for storage. People weren’t satisfied with business intel-
ligence reports that gave aggregated results like means, medians, and 
modes anymore. They wanted more sophisticated analyses. They also 
wanted things to be more visual and more interactive.
Will:	
Ah, so the phrase “sophisticated analyses” means . . . .
Deanna:	 . . . Means, not just providing summary statistics, but analyses that 
are descriptive or predictive or prescriptive in nature. Here, we have 
morphed mere data analysis into yet another term in vogue: analytics. 
More specifically, “descriptive analytics” take historical data beyond just 
summarizing them as measures of central tendencies. More sophisti-
cated descriptive analyses began recognizing underlying factors/compo-
nents or segments within your data.
If you think of data as information being displayed as a matrix of 
rows and columns, where each row represents an individual and each 
column usually represents a variable, that is, information related to the 
individual. Factor analyses and component analyses can describe how 
variables are related to each other in such as way where one factor or 
component can represent multiple variables. You can imagine, then, 
where data made up of hundreds or even thousands of variables can be 
reduced to a much smaller, and hopefully more manageable, number of 
factors or components.
One great example is the conversion of text into quantitative data for 
“text analytics” to take place. More and more nonprofits are capturing 
open responses online as constituents describe their amazing (or not so 
amazing) experiences with the nonprofits as open-responses during their 
event registration or gift donation process or as constituents write on 
different social media platforms. Data scientists can then break down 
these texts into many “tokens.” Be they single words or word phrases, 
these tokens become dichotomous variables of  “0s” and “1s” where fac-
tor and component analysis can undercover various “themes” to a group 
of responses. Other factor/component analytic techniques may be able 
to deduce a response’s ultimate “sentiment” as either positive or negative.
Whereas factor/component analysis summatively describe the col-
umns or variables in your data, the rows of your data can be summa-
rized or reduced similarly through techniques collectively known as 
“cluster analysis.” Because rows in a spreadsheet of data usually represent 

Flipping the Script  ◾  237
individuals, cluster analysis can group individuals with similar char-
acteristics into different segments or clusters. Again, in this way, data 
containing hundreds or thousands of individuals can be reduced or 
summarized into a more manageable number of segments or clusters.
Will:	
Just to reiterate, that factor/component analysis, as well as cluster analy-
sis, are data reduction techniques aimed at describing large amounts of 
data. And I think I can understand why these descriptive analytics tech-
niques are important. Factor analysis and component analysis may point 
toward commonalities like some underlying construct among multiple 
variables, while cluster analysis can group individuals into segments or 
clusters and provide information about the variables used to group these 
individuals. Both are generating insight into your data by uncovering 
patterns that would otherwise be hidden within the massive amount of 
information. But, like our time-traveling mission, we’re still just dealing 
with the past.
Deanna:	 Ah, yes, Commander. And this is where we talk about predictive ana-
lytics, tools, and methods that take historical data and try to predict or 
forecast the future based on the past. One such example is time-series 
analysis used in this century’s economic market indices, where past mar-
ket performances are used to predict future market performance at dif-
ferent moments into the future, be it a month from now, 1 year, 5 or  
10 years.
When you have some sort of outcome you want to predict, there are 
many techniques in what’s called regression modeling for you to use, 
depending on what your data and your outcome look like. For instance, 
if you’re trying to predict earnings of companies with company-related 
variables, you can use what’s called multiple regression, which basically 
creates a mathematical model where predicted company earnings are on 
one side of an equation and a set of company-related variables used to 
generate these predicted company earnings are on the other side of the 
equation.
But there are so many variations to regression modeling. Say your 
outcome variable happens to be a dichotomous one, like whether you’re 
a paying customer or not. Then you would use a regression technique 
called logistic regression, where the mathematical model is geared 
toward predicting a binary or dichotomous variable. There is what’s 
called a multinomial logistic regression, when you want to predict for 
an outcome variable with more than 2 categories. You can even have a 
multivariate model where you’re predicting for more than one outcome 
variable.
Will:	
Fascinating!
Deanna:	 There’s a bit of nuance here. While time-series analysis is used to fore-
cast future events, regression models can be used both for prediction 

238  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
and for classification. Oftentimes, regression model results provide the 
likelihood that an event or a behavior will occur at the individual level. 
However, regression model results may also provide the likelihood that 
an individual will belong to a membership group.
And this is just a few of the many techniques for predictive analytics! 
From improvements on regression models to more “generalized linear 
models” and even more advanced classification techniques like support 
vector machines, predictive analytics create algorithms based on past 
data, so that predicted outcomes can be calculated when new data are 
entered.
Will:	
Ah, but what if the outcomes, the data themselves, and/or the conditions 
change over time?
Deanna:	 Yes, this is where prescriptive analytics come into play. Okay, so descrip-
tive analytics provide insight to past performance based on historical 
data, while predictive analytics provide insight on future opportuni-
ties. Prescriptive analytics take both descriptive and predictive analyt-
ics results into simulations and scenarios. Thus, prescriptive analytics 
provide insight for business decisions under various conditions, showing 
the optimal performance to various “what-ifs.”
Will:	
Having been around other fundraisers during this mission, though, I 
can tell you that, whatever insights descriptive, predictive, and prescrip-
tive analytics provide, most of us will need a less “analytics” way for 
these insights to be given to us.
Deanna:	 Absolutely. I think that’s why “data communication” is just as important 
of an aspect to data science as data management and data analysis. This 
is where storytelling becomes vital. A great data communicator must 
take all the insights gleaned from analytics into a digestible form for 
those who are not data-scientists without diluting the message, so that 
the call for action may be equally impactful across all audiences. There 
is a tragic lesson learned about one of Earth’s earliest space explorations 
involving the space shuttle Challenger.
Will:	
I remember that from my twentieth century Earth history briefing prior 
to our mission. It had something to do with “O-rings” malfunctioning 
at low temperatures, correct?
Deanna:	 Yes, exactly. However, the way the data were presented to decision mak-
ers in the space shuttle launch was mired in technicality, such that the 
recommendation by engineers NOT to launch the Challenger was over-
ridden by the project managers who would have sided with delaying the 
launch if the information was presented more clearly. Of course, this is 
an oversimplification of a tragic loss of life in the name of space explora-
tion. However, this points toward the need for clear and impactful data 
communication.

Flipping the Script  ◾  239
I think that’s why the current technological advances of Earth’s 
twenty-first century have allowed for “data visualization” as a field where 
pictorial representations of data are conveyed through “infographics.” 
But along with presenting clear stories through pictorial representation, 
data communicators must be great storytellers as well. I think that’s why 
there’s a shift from people calling themselves “consultants” in the last 
twentieth century to calling themselves “analysts” in the early twenty-
first century. When all are said and done, evidence-based decision-
making must be based on evidence-based storytelling.
Will:	
So far, I can see how data science can benefit the corporate world. But 
I don’t have to be Betazoid to know that you can also tell me how data 
science helps the philanthropy sector.
Deanna:	 Quite right, Commander. For one thing, when a nonprofit organization 
experiences growth, be it in event participants, in donations or in staff, 
the organization will also have more data. Here, given that nonprofit 
resources are usually much more limited than their corporate counter-
parts, you’re more pressed to ask the question about the utility of your 
stored data in terms of how much value can be extracted.
And just as companies, have their “shares of market” within their sec-
tor, nonprofits have their “shares of pocket” within their verticals. And 
while many nonprofits share similar admirable missions, they sadly have 
to compete for donors’ limited pocket shares as revenue. Thus, finding 
potential constituents who will most likely participate, volunteer, and/or 
give becomes paramount.
And this is where data science becomes most utilitarian. The organi-
zations that can most easily extract, transform, and load stored data . . . . 
the organizations that can generate the most insightful descriptive, pre-
dictive, and prescriptive analytics . . . . and the organizations that can 
most effectively communicate their insights to their decision makers 
and even constituents . . . . these would then become the most successful 
nonprofit organizations.
Will:	
Let’s get into the thick of the nebula. How would we use data science 
along the “philanthropic pipeline?”
Deanna:	 If we go to the very beginning of the fundraising process, we have to ask 
ourselves: “What are our goals here? What are we trying to do?” One of 
the buzzwords in philanthropy at this stage is “acquisition,” that is, the 
conversions of individuals not associated with a nonprofit versus ones 
that are. More traditionally, organizations in need of new constituents, 
be they customers for a for-profit group or event participants, volunteers, 
and donors for a nonprofit organization, may rely on an outside vendor 
and aggregate level data, to generate acquisition lists of potential con-
stituents. However, this could be rather expensive for a nonprofit.

240  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Instead, a nonprofit may be able to select for initially “cold” 
­individuals who became constituents to the nonprofit, perhaps folks 
who were acquired through an outside vendor in the past and/or indi-
viduals who have little to no relationship with other individuals in the 
database. Descriptive analysis can be simply looking at group mean dif-
ferences between these individuals and individuals who are most loyal 
or engaged with the organization. In a more sophisticated fashion, we 
can use one or more cluster analytic technique, to see how well these 
individuals cluster or segment together from the rest of the database. 
Using predictive analytics, a regression model can be generated with 
these “cold converts” as the outcome. In both instances, we’re neither 
classifying nor predicting for any individual. Instead, we would actu-
ally consider the variables that contribute to the cluster solution or that 
comprise the regression model, to see the most important factors that 
distinguish this group of individuals from the rest of the database. With 
this insight, more targeted communications can be sent to individuals 
outside the nonprofit’s database who are most like those “cold converts.”
Will:	
That’s great, Counselor. BUT what my fundraiser colleagues and I 
would be most interested in is potential donors or donor prospects at the 
top of the giving tier. Can data science help with finding these folks?
Deanna:	 Ah, that’s the next stage of the philanthropic process is “prospect iden-
tification.” Traditionally, this process solely relied on nonprofit staff 
specialized in “proactive research,” to gather publicly available wealth 
information, upon which, total wealth, as well as individual “giving 
capacity,” can be estimated. The problem lies in the fact that proac-
tive researchers cannot provide wealth and giving capacity estimates for 
everyone in the database. Thus, the goal for data science at this stage is to 
provide proactive researchers only a fraction of the database of unrated 
individuals who could potentially have high wealth and giving capacity.
Similar to the data science techniques at the acquisition stage, business 
rules can be coded into a nonprofit’s database, so that unrated individuals 
that share characteristics similar to high wealth/giving capacity individu-
als because of some descriptive analytics can be identified automatically 
and regularly. Predictive models can also be built using individuals with 
known wealth or giving capacities at and above a certain threshold as the 
outcome. Such models can then provide probability scores for all individ-
uals in the database, to identify high wealth/giving capacity “suspects.” 
The nuance at this stage is that there might be different types of high 
wealth/giving capacity individuals; some sort of cluster analysis may be 
required before any predictive analytics can be applied. And given a clear, 
succinct way to communicate descriptive and predictive analytics results, 
proactive researchers would hopefully be pointed into the right directions 
toward high wealth/giving capacity individuals.

Flipping the Script  ◾  241
Will:	
Hmm, and I’m assuming these techniques aren’t relegated to find those with 
high wealth or giving capacity like principal and major gift donors, right?
Deanna:	 That’s right; it really depends on how characteristically different your 
outcome group is from the rest of the general population in your data-
base. Oftentimes, nonprofits with any sort of degree of data science 
capabilities will develop predictive analytics for even “leadership” level 
for annual gift donors, or the highest levels of giving before being con-
sidered a major gift. Predicting for planned gifts, or gifts left by donors 
in their trusts or wills, is also another area where data science techniques 
are being used beyond just estimating wealth and giving capacity at the 
principal and major gift levels.
Will:	
Interesting. I’m just thinking about predictive modeling for a minute here. 
If your models are based on past and current donors, are you confounding 
the donors’ affinity for your organization with their actual giving?
Deanna:	 Yes, but I think this is where the end justifies the means. Does it matter 
how you identify donor prospects for your researchers and ultimately 
your fundraisers? With that said, you can create separate affinity models, 
to identify constituents with the potential of having great love for your 
organization, where these individuals could become great advocates, vol-
unteers and/or event participants for your organization. For nonprofits, 
however, the best resource is usually financial, in terms of fulfilling their 
respective missions.
Will:	
But there’s still a relationship component to this, right?
Deanna:	 Of course, and here, data science can help too! One of the best predic-
tors, if not THE best predictor, of future giving to any nonprofit orga-
nization is past giving. Beyond having sustainers, or individuals who 
have automated making monthly donations to a nonprofit, one of the 
best ways to increase the chance of donors making repeat gifts would be 
to maintain and “steward” the relationship between a nonprofit and its 
donors. Obviously, beyond actual fundraising, another major function 
for fundraisers and other gift officers or staff members is donor steward-
ship by keeping regular contact with donors and keeping donors inter-
ested in the organization’s mission and direction. But then, the question 
is “Do all individuals have an equal chance of making repeat gifts?” 
Again, similar to acquisition, prospect identification, wealth estimation, 
giving propensity, and engagement/affinity, data science techniques can 
be used, to predict and identify first gift donors who are highly likely to 
give repeat gifts.
Will:	
Hmm, I can see how if someone hears us talking about using data sci-
ence for fundraising, she or he would feel a bit “creeped out.” This would 
seem to be the epitome of being impersonal to the point of leaving poten-
tial constituents feeling like, to use an ancient American anachronism, 
“widgets” in a system.

242  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Deanna:	 Understandably, if a nonprofit’s constituents only experience the organi-
zation’s facts, figures, and “the bottom line,” then they’d feel as if they 
were in some sort of well-oiled Ferengi profit-making scheme. That’s 
where the staff within a nonprofit must keep both the organization’s 
mission and its people in mind. Some, such as gift officers like yourself 
and others, must keep good relationships with our donors through visits, 
phone calls, personal mail, or even simpler bulk, direct mail, or e-blasts. 
For data science staff such as myself, keeping a nonprofit’s constituency 
in mind translates into treating everyone’s data with the utmost care and 
respect, not seeing “widgets,” but rather, seeing the people behind their 
data.
Will:	
Well said, Counselor. Thank you for the superb overview of the science 
of fundraising. How about we grab some drinks? The beverages in this 
century are much superior to even the synthehol on our ship.
Deanna:	 Thanks, Commander, but I’ve got a date with Data.
Will:	
I hope we’re just talking about what you’d find in a fundraising organi-
zation’s database!
The Art of Fundraising: Embracing  
Past and Progress (as Inspired by 
Recent Alternative Facts)
Me:	
Good morning, sir.
Don:	
Good morning. Say, you’re from CHINE-na, right? You must be pretty 
good with numbers . . . so why aren’t you working in the stock market 
or a hedge fund or even a tech startup where they need people like you?
Me:	
Technically, I was born in Hong Kong when it was still a British colony. 
I was actually a citizen of the British Commonwealth until I was natu-
ralized as an American citizen when I was in high school.
As for being good with numbers, thank you. I actually don’t think 
I’m that good; just ask my friends when I try to figure out how to split 
our restaurant bills! However, if we’re talking about data science, I posi-
tively think that anyone, no matter from what country they were born, 
who has a knack for wrangling and making sense of messy, disparate, 
and alternative information, to find hidden truths, and then be able 
to build convincing AND evidence-based stories to address complex 
inquiries . . . I think people with these skill sets are what make data 
science great!
As for being a data scientist in the philanthropy sector, I think one 
major reason for me is that the challenges faced by data scientists in 
nonprofits are very similar to those faced by data scientists in for-profit 

Flipping the Script  ◾  243
corporations. Beyond all the technical similarities in database technol-
ogy, statistical methodology, and visualization rules of thumb, I think 
data scientists in philanthropy and in the corporate world must convince 
“the old guard” or “conventional wisdom.”
Traditionally, for example, fundraisers often rely on current donors’ 
leads for prospects in what survey researchers would call “snowball sam-
pling.” While this can still be the case today, competition for donors’ 
attention and eventual share of pocket unfortunately has made tradi-
tional ways of prospect identification less effective. As another example 
of tradition or convention, proactive researchers used to read through 
newspaper, business, and trade magazines in hopes of finding prospects 
sympathetic to their organizations’ causes. In both cases, you’re dealing 
with a small number of individuals to which other nonprofits may want 
or already have access.
What if you can provide that list of donor prospects on a regular basis 
for proactive researchers to confirm wealth and giving capacity or else 
for fundraisers directly to start building those relationships? With data 
science, you can do just that! When you have a database of thousands or 
even millions of individuals with information that other organizations 
may not even have, so many possibilities exist! You can set up busi-
ness rules within your database to extract prospects who look similar 
to different characteristics within your current donor population. You 
can even create models that predict for these individuals within your 
database.
The point is that data science can direct proactive researchers and 
fundraisers in a more efficient manner toward donor prospects rather 
than simply chasing down word-of-mouth leads or reacting to news or 
business journal articles.
Don:	
Hmm, you mentioned something about having my information in your 
database. Yeah, I don’t like that. I don’t want people to know so much 
about me and tell it to the world.
Me:	
Well, sir, I’m sorry you feel that way, but you do raise a great point about 
the ethics that all fundraising staff, from the fundraisers themselves to 
fundraising data scientists, share. One of the utmost important ethics 
for any fundraising staff is confidentiality of information. We often take 
“anonymous gifts” where donors do not provide their information at 
all. While that’s not so good for fundraising data scientists in terms of 
not having any donor characteristics connected to these gifts, we have 
to abide by that. [Unfortunately, that also usually means these truly 
anonymous donors cannot reap the tax benefits of charitable giving.] In 
most cases, we do have donor information attached to their gifts, and, 
while it’s their choice to remain publicly anonymous or not, we provide 
the utmost confidentiality.

244  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Personally, one of the first steps in preparing data is to “anonymize” 
the records, so that full names and address information are not retrieved. 
I would only have their unique key ID variable (and obviously, that is 
neither their social security nor credit card number). Instead, I might 
retrieve titles and salutations as proxies for profession, marital status, 
and perhaps even legacy. As for address, I might create variables to indi-
cate whether the address is a residential home, a business address, an 
apartment, or a suite. By comparing a zip code in the address to census 
and other government data, I can even attach any zip-level data to indi-
vidual records.
Unfortunately, once I have a list of IDs representing donor prospects 
through data science processes, I do have to pick randomly a few IDs to 
find the individuals represented to verify the accuracy of the data sci-
ence efforts. Eventually, both proactive researchers and fundraisers must 
know these donor names to estimate wealth and giving capacity and to 
build relationships. However, along the entire process, constituent infor-
mation remains confidential, known only to staff members who require 
the information to move forward the nonprofit’s mission (i.e., business 
purposes).
One more thing about ethics. On the organization level, “transpar-
ency” is another well-guarded and upheld principle. The best nonprofits 
have, or should have, an audit trail in terms of where gifts originated, 
how they came into the organizations, and finally how and where the 
gifts were spent. This is mainly due a well-oiled, internal gift processing 
team. Associated with transparency is data integrity. Here, donors ben-
efit from easily accessible giving history for tax purposes. Data integrity 
is also crucial for data science, to prevent the worst-case scenario of “gar-
bage in, garbage out.”
Don:	
Ah, yes, integrity. That’s how I want to be known. Let’s get rid of all the 
dishonest people, all the garbage. Let’s get rid of all . . . .
Me:	
Before you finish that thought, I want to point out that, just as the meth-
ods of fundraising have evolved over time, so have the constituents of the 
philanthropy sector. Beyond the fact that our constituents have followed 
the changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of this country, nonprofits 
have also begun to reach outside of their locales to neighboring states, 
to other regions of the country, and even to other countries around the 
world. Combined, what makes the most sense would be to have diverse 
and inclusive staff members who are able to interact with a more diverse 
and inclusive constituency.
Donors have also evolved in such a way that many now see their 
philanthropy as “investment for the greater good.” With that perspec-
tive, donors have become much more analytical and empirical, using 
evidence and metrics of success and fiscal responsibility by nonprofits 

Flipping the Script  ◾  245
as drivers in their decision to give. In order, to meet this demand, staff 
across all aspects of fundraising need to diversify their skill sets, becom-
ing more analytical/empirical themselves. Conversely, fundraising data 
scientists must also be more diverse and inclusive, be it in background 
(e.g., country of origin) or in skillset (i.e., language nuance to under-
stand text analytics results) . . . Sir, are you alright?
Don:	
Yeah . . . . Just trying to fit all of this in 140 characters.
Me:	
. . . Right, good luck with that, sir . . . [finds the nearest wall to rest a 
weary forehead]

We are in a revolution and a renaissance in data analytics. While computer ­scientists 
have been working on solutions to complex data analytics problems for decades, 
three factors have converged to enable this revolution:
Factor 1: The ability to collect massive amounts of data. With the abil-
ity to collect more data from applications, the Internet, and connected 
devices, organizations have made it possible to access more data than was 
ever imagined. Advances in medical devices, connected machinery, and 
data from massive textual repositories means that there is more informa-
tion than ever before. There is a sense of urgency in being able to take 
advantage of this treasure trove of data to make new discoveries and trans-
form industries.
Factor 2: The availability of inexpensive compute and storage. The advent of 
the cloud with inexpensive compute and storage services have meant that it 
is possible to analyze huge amounts of complex data at a reasonable price. In 
the past, analysts were forced to pick subsets of data sets for analysis because 
of costs and other computing limitations. New storage techniques such as 
NoSQL and Hadoop have emerged to allow companies to affordably store 
and manage vast amounts of data.
Factor 3: New analytics techniques and tools have emerged. These tools can 
abstract the complexity from the tasks of understanding data. Advances in 
predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cogni-
tive computing are promising to change how we work and live. Advanced 
analytics were once a prevue of a small group of specially trained mathemati-
cians and scientists. Now, new analytics tools are abstracting complex algo-
rithms into a framework that is easier for business analyst to use.
Understanding the Wide Range of Options
The reality is that with all the data analytics technological advancements, there 
are more and more ways that computer scientists can use techniques and tools to 
advance the way computers can use data for learning and transforming processes 
and tasks. Many of the resulting solutions will transform industries, the way we 
work, and the type of solutions to problems that could never be solved. In this

chapter, we will provide an overview of what we mean by Big Data and then put 
this in perspective with cognitive computing, AI, and machine learning.
What Is Cognitive Computing?
Cognitive computing has some distinct differences from traditional computing 
­solutions and traditional analytics approaches. Let’s start with a definition: Cognitive 
computing and the techniques of AI is an approach that enables humans to col-
laborate with machines. It enables data to be analyzed in context based on a variety 
of data including text, images, voice, sensors, and video. Cognitive computing is a 
form of AI in that it uses the ability to have computers perform tasks that would have 
traditionally be performed by humans. A cognitive system is designed based on three 
capabilities:
◾
◾A cognitive system learns based on the data ingested. Through the learning 
process, the system makes inferences about the area being analyzed.
◾
◾A cognitive system requires a model or a representation of a domain. The 
model must understand the context of the data being used.
◾
◾A cognitive system must be able to generate hypotheses. To make sense of the 
data, a system is required to come up with an assumption or explanation of 
an expected outcome.
The elements of a cognitive system have a common requirement: That enough 
data be ingested, analyzed, and tested to determine whether assumptions can be 
supported. Therefore, one of the benefits of a cognitive system is that a bias must 
be supported by data. If a system is fed enough of the right data, it is possible to 
determine whether a hypothesis holds up to scrutiny.
The value of a cognitive approach to computing is that the solution design is deter-
mined by the patterns within the data, rather than by predetermined logic. But in a 
cognitive system, it is not just data in isolation. A cognitive computing system requires 
the knowledge of content experts to curate the data and provide insights into the right 
data sources. Therefore, a cognitive system only works when there is collaboration 
between human experts and data that supports the way they put their data to work.
What does it mean to create a cognitive application? It’s not that much different 
from creating any application in many ways. You have to start with understanding 
the objective. For example, you might want an application that will help consumers 
plan a trip or you want an application that helps anticipate and avoid security prob-
lems in software. However, unlike a traditional application development process 
that is designed to answer specific predetermined questions, a cognitive application 
is intended to go deeper and explore context. In a cognitive application, the intent 
is to look at the relationships between data elements by creating a specific domain 
related to the area of focus.

250  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
By defining a narrow domain, you can then begin to determine which data 
sources are the most important. This data is then put into a corpus—a machine— 
readable representation of the complete record of a topic. But that is only the begin-
ning of the process. What makes a cognitive system powerful is that the data is 
not static. The system learns from the interactions with both experts and users. 
Through an initial testing process, experts determine whether this corpus provides 
the right context to come up with answers and solutions. If the context is wrong, it 
is likely that there needs to be new and different data provided. The power of the 
cognitive system comes from its ability to iterate on the data. Over time, the system 
learns and changes based on the interactions between machine and human.
The advantage of a cognitive approach to solution development is that it begins 
with data rather than assumptions about business logic. Through machine-learning 
approaches and the collaboration between humans and machines, the cognitive 
system can evolve as the business changes. A fast-changing world requires that 
organizations understand the hidden patterns and anomalies in data so that orga-
nizations are prepared for shifts in customer needs.
Cognitive computing is not a single technology. Rather, it is a combination 
of a variety of algorithms and techniques intended to help practitioners make 
sense of the enormous amount of information they have—both structured and 
unstructured to make better decisions. It has long been the dream of researchers 
and computer scientists to find techniques to transform data into knowledge. The 
path to achieve success has been fraught with failures and missteps. Many horror 
movies were made depicting the ability of humans to create artificially intelligent 
constructs that would take over the tasks of humans. However, despite many false 
starts we are finally entering an era where cognitive computing and advanced ana-
lytics is becoming a reality.
The Complexity of Learning
While it is easy to get right into the concepts behind cognitive computing and machine 
learning, it is important to understand why translating human learning into a system-
atic approach is complicated. Think about how humans learn. Take the example of the 
five-year-old girl who has been given her first two-wheel bicycle. While she has been 
very comfortable riding a tricycle, learning to ride a two-wheel bicycle is another mat-
ter. First, the child has to ingest a lot of information relating to riding a bike. What 
are the dynamics of balancing with the two wheels? How fast does the child have to 
peddle to move forward without falling over? Eventually the child understands that 
she has to balance on the frame of the bike in the right way so that it doesn’t fall over. 
She has to navigate different surfaces. There are different techniques needed to navi-
gate a bumpy dirt path versus a well-paved road. After a while she can intuit how to 
navigate without assistance. Riding a bike becomes second nature. How does the child 
navigate on pavement versus grass or an unpaved dirt path? How does the weather 

Looking toward the Future with Cognitive Computing  ◾  251
affect her ability to ride? Is it windy or rainy? The child needs some assistance at first to 
understand what it feels like to stay upright on a bike. However, even with some coach-
ing, the child will have to learn by trial and error. Learning is actually complicated, 
involving training, experimentation, and constant learning.
Training from Data
Humans have a built-in capability to learn and change. Training a system based on 
Big Data is much more complicated. Therefore, the question is how do you train a 
system to gain the same intuition about executing a task? It is clearly not easy. But 
we are entering an era where we can use advanced analytics approaches to allow us 
to gain an understanding in context.
Collaboration between Humans and Machines
A cognitive system is a technology approach that enables humans to collaborate with 
machines to gain insights and take actions in context. One of the principles of cogni-
tive computing is the availability of enough data that can be analyzed at the right level 
of performance. Only a few years ago, it would be prohibitively expensive to store and 
apply advanced computational analysis to the data. With the advent of much more 
powerful processors and cloud computing combined with the dramatic drop in costs 
for both compute and storage, advanced analytics has made huge advances.
Now that we have the platforms to support this new generation of analytics, we 
need to understand the steps required to turn data into knowledge. How do you 
turn information into knowledge in the real world? The key to the practical applica-
tion of cognitive computing is to focus on specific domains. To gain insights from 
data means that you have to understand the context.
Trying to understand the patterns and anomalies from data requires that you 
focus. Therefore, you need to focus on a single domain—such as retail, energy 
production, insurance, or healthcare. By focusing on a domain, it will be possible 
to gain an understanding of the foundational data for that field based on best prac-
tices and patterns.
The Relationship between Big Data 
and Cognitive Systems
Creating a cognitive system is predicated on domain knowledge, best practices 
combined with massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. We call this 
Big Data for lack of a more precise term. When we talk about the requirements of 
data as it applies to cognitive computing as having the following four foundational 
characteristics.

252  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
Volume
Volume is the most obvious characteristic of Big Data. However, volume can vary 
depending on the nature of that data. For example, there may be a massive volume 
of data from sensors in an industrial machine but the data itself is quite simple. In 
contrast, the data that comes from a medical image is massive and it is complicated. 
Unstructured data that comes from thousands of pages of text such as clinical trials 
or medical journals is quite complex because it has to be translated into a form that 
a machine can understand.
Variety
To make sense of data in context with the domain being addressed and the prob-
lem being solved requires a lot of different types of data. There is highly structured 
data that you would find in a database. There is semi-structured data that would be 
found in data generated by sensors, industrial equipment or images. There is also 
unstructured data that is generated by documents. While we call this unstructured 
data, it does have internal structure that can be understood—but accessing and 
interpreting that data is complicated.
Velocity
Velocity refers to the speed of moving data form one location to where it needs to 
be ingested and stored. The need for speed will vary depending on the nature of the 
use case. For example, when there is a massive amount of unstructured data from 
social media sources may require high speed to both move and analyze the contents 
of the data. In other situations, speed is less important such as when you are ingest-
ing incremental updates to data to continue the learning process.
Veracity
Veracity can often be the most important issue related to Big Data, because if the 
data isn’t reliable it will provide erroneous results. This is not black and white. For 
example, you may want to ingest a massive amount of unstructured data to begin 
to test a hypothesis. Some of the data will be very important but other elements of 
data may be noise. The irony of Big Data is that the results and answers will come 
from a small amount of data where patterns or anomalies are found.
The Architecture of Big Data
Big Data cannot live in isolation. There is a framework of services including the scal-
able and adaptable physical infrastructure that is often highly distributed and typically 

Looking toward the Future with Cognitive Computing  ◾  253
cloud based. As with any mission critical system, the entire system must be managed 
in a secure manner. There have to be a supporting software infrastructure that allows 
data to be ingested (from internal and external sources) and integrated, managed, ana-
lyzed, and governed. In this chapter, we will not discuss the details of how these ele-
ments are architecturally managed. Rather, we will give you a sense of the types of data 
needed and the types of operational databases needed to support cognitive computing. 
In this next section, we will address the roles of both structured and unstructured data.
The Role of Structured Data
While most of the discussion around cognitive computing often centers on unstruc-
tured textual data, it is equally important to understand the role that structured 
or semi-structured data plays. Traditionally, structured data has a defined length 
and format and its semantics are defined in metadata, schemas, and glossaries. 
Cognitive solutions often need structured data to create the context between the 
unstructured elements and how they impact the analysis. For example, you may be 
collecting a massive amount of unstructured data about a specific disease. However, 
you also need companion structured data that gives you demographic data into the 
type of patients who contract this disease and outcomes.
The Value of Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data is critical for a cognitive solution. Semi-structured data is 
typically machine-generated data from devices such as sensors, smart meters, and 
medical devices. Unlike structured data, semi-structured data is not transactional. 
Rather, this semi-structured data does not have explicit formats and so its interpre-
tation has to be gleaned from applying machine-learning algorithms that translate 
this data into understandable content. For example, sensor data from a manufac-
turing machine can provide an early alert system if the machine is overheating.
The Role of Unstructured Data
As the name implies, unstructured data does not have a formal transactional struc-
ture. Rather, unstructured data does not follow specific formats like a database 
would. In addition, the unstructured data does not have explicit metadata, schemas 
or glossaries. Making sense of unstructured data therefore requires that the context 
and semantics must be discovered and extracted through different processes includ-
ing Natural Language Processing, machine-learning algorithms, or text analytics.
Unstructured data is the heart cognitive computing for several reasons. First, 
as much as 80% of the world’s data is unstructured. Second, huge amounts of 

254  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
knowledge and information about a field is encased in documents, customer 
­support systems, images, website content—just to name a few. While we call these 
data sources unstructured, the reality is that every data element has an innate struc-
ture that can be discovered. The following are some examples of the database tools 
that are foundational to understanding unstructured data:
◾
◾There are a variety of tools such as Key-Value Pairs databases that provide 
pointers to the meaning of data.
◾
◾Document databases manage repositories of unstructured data so meaning 
can be understood.
◾
◾Columnar databases manage data efficiently by storing data in columns 
rather than rows. The data is stored in memory so that information retrieval 
is much faster for text.
◾
◾Graph databases. This database format uses a graph structure with nodes and 
edges to manage and represent data. It is widely used because it is designed 
to determine relationships between data without the joining function used in 
relational databases.
In this next section, we will discuss how we take this variety of data and lever-
age it to support the emerging cognitive computing systems. With the combination 
of Big Data and domain-specific cognitive computing and machine-learning algo-
rithms, we can begin to build systems that help us reach conclusions and transform 
industries.
The Elements of a Cognitive System
A cognitive system is designed to solve practical problems by continuously adapt-
ing based on data and experience. Traditionally, businesses have used computer 
programming to solve problems by beginning with translating processes into a set 
of steps that can be executed. Once the program is written, data is fed into this 
model providing answers. This approach has been used for decades and is especially 
useful when business approaches were relatively stable and where there was a limit 
to how much data an affordable system could store and compute. However, over 
time, the approach of building complex system based on aging assumptions has 
become problematic. Today, organizations are finding that business models that 
worked well for decades are now being challenged. Emerging companies are creat-
ing new innovative business models that are challenging incumbents in almost 
every industry. This means that application logic must be changed in real time for 
organizations to be able to compete.
The emerging model for creating business value is predicated on the ability to 
create new logic based on emerging business models. The only practical way to 

Looking toward the Future with Cognitive Computing  ◾  255
plan for the unknown is to lead with the data. Therefore, rather than writing logic, 
emerging applications will be designed based on what the data tells us. This makes 
sense when you leverage unstructured data that provides insights into best practices 
and patterns. This model-based approach enables organizations to be able to change 
by applying advanced analytics to business practice. This approach of leading with 
data combined with best practices is the wave of the future and the foundation for 
a cognitive approach to computing. The three most important stages include the 
ability to learn, to model, and to generate the hypothesis.
Learning
Learning is the foundation of cognitive computing just as it is for human knowl-
edge acquisition. But to learn, it is critical to be able to understand the context 
between data elements. A very simple example explains what this means. Imagine 
that you are walking down the street and you see a tree where all the leaves have 
turned brown and have begun falling. If this takes place during the month of 
November and you live in a climate where there are four distinct seasons, you will 
assume that this is normal and the tree is healthy. However, if the same situation 
takes place during the middle of the summer, you will know that the tree is prob-
ably diseased. The same set of conditions will take on entirely different meanings 
based on context of the data. In this case, the domain is the environment of the 
local area that would include information about the seasons, weather conditions, 
horticulture, and the like.
In a cognitive system, there is a requirement to make inferences about the 
data. However, to get to the point where you can make an inference about what 
the data means requires that the data be focused on a specific domain such as 
one topic or issue. For example, the focus might be on traffic management or on 
a specific disease. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the organization doing the 
analysis to collect as much information as possible that is specific to the topic 
area. If the topic area is too broad, it will be difficult to collect enough informa-
tion to support the type of advanced analytics or learning to solve a problem. 
The domain needs to have enough complexity that it is worth the investment. If 
there is sparse data, it is likely that the human will be able to review the data and 
come up with a quick answer. On the other hand, there are situations in medi-
cal diagnosis where there is so much information that a human cannot possibly 
understand and absorb all the data in context to make informed decisions. For 
example, a doctor may see a patient that has a set of symptoms that don’t match 
a known cause. There might be skin irritation combined with a fever and sud-
den weight gain. While each symptom might indicate a specific condition, the 
doctor might never have seen this combination of symptoms. However, there 
may be information published in a medical journal three years ago that provides  

256  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
a diagnosis that matches these symptoms. This situation requires a probabilistic 
type of analysis. In a probabilistic system, there might be a variety of answers to 
a problem depending on the circumstances and context. Most importantly, there 
needs to be a significant degree of confidence based on the information that has 
been collected. In contrast, a deterministic system will return a single answer 
based on the evidence collected.
Modeling
The model is the centerpiece of a cognitive system. The model is not a single ele-
ment. The model is a representation of the domain that is being analyzed to dis-
cover insights, and predict outcomes. Modeling begins by defining a corpus. The 
corpus is the body of knowledge to continuously update the model based on both 
ingesting new data and feedback from knowledge experts.
In addition, the model requires a set of assumptions and algorithms that gen-
erate and score hypotheses to answer questions, solve problems, or discover new 
insights.
The Hypothesis
Before you can come up with answers and patterns from data, you need to focus on 
your hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable assertion from evidence that can explain 
an observed phenomenon or relationship between elements within a domain. The 
hypothesis must have supporting evidence or knowledge that explains the causal 
relationship. In essence, a hypothesis has to be able to predict an experimental 
outcome. In cognitive computing, it is necessary to find evidence to either support 
or refute the hypothesis. Are the leaves falling from the tree because it is diseased? 
The collected data is analyzed and tested. The result of that analysis is given a score 
based on the level of confidence. When dealing with unstructured data it can be 
difficult to prove a hypothesis. There may be several hypotheses that need to be 
evaluated and scored in parallel. To get a level of confidence in an outcome, this 
will require a continuous machine-learning process. For example, you will begin 
by creating your hypothesis, identifying the data sources and ingesting them. The 
resulting knowledge base of ingested data is called a corpus. Once data is ingested 
the evidence and the hypothesis is scored, the results are presented to subject matter 
experts who provide feedback. Is this an acceptable answer? Does it make sense? 
If the initial result is positive, more data is ingested and training begins. Training 
of data is the process of insuring that the hypothesis is provable and generalizable. 
The result of this learning process is the creation of a model that can be applied to 
solve similar problems.

Machine Learning
To achieve the ability to transform applications without reprogramming requires 
continuous learning. At the heart of this process is to apply the ability to acquire, 
manage and learn from data by applying machine-learning algorithms. Machine-
learning algorithms are programs that are designed to look for patterns in data 
and make recommendations for actions based on findings. Patterns are the most 
critical element because they indicate a similar structure or value. For example, a 
human face has patterns indicating eyes, noses, and so on. With enough data, it is 
possible to distinguish first a human face from an animal and with even more data 
it is possible to determine a specific individual’s face. Cognitive computing systems 
use machine-learning algorithms based on inferential statistics that is the basis for 
being able to predict outcomes.
There isn’t one type of algorithm that is used in a cognitive system. Rather, 
depending on the nature of the problem being addressed. In this next section, we 
will discuss the primary learning approaches that can be applied to cognitive com-
puting including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised 
learning.
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a technique that teaches a system to detect or match pat-
terns in data based on examples encountered during training with sample data. 
Supervised learning is a process used where you already have an idea of what you 
are looking for based on an existing pattern. This can also be thought of as learning 
by example. The power of this type of machine-learning process is that the system 
uses new data based on the example to improve its performance on pattern match-
ing tasks. Within the area of supervised learning, the job of the algorithm is to 
create a mapping between the input and output.
Typically, with supervised learning, the analyst starts out with very noisy data 
that includes a lot of extraneous details that aren’t needed for the analysis. Over time 
with training, the learning process is optimized based on weeding out biases and 
assumptions. Often supervised learning is used to solve classification (to satisfy con-
straints) or regression (used to fill in expected values) problems. For example, super-
vised learning could be used in a travel application to determine the right vacation for 
a specific client where the goal is to learn enough about what the traveler wants based 
on potential vacation locations. The algorithm determines the patterns of travelers’ 
preferences. A regression algorithm is designed to determine the value of a continu-
ous variable such as price. If a customer is using an application designed to help them 
purchase a specific car, a regression algorithm will help match the details of the car 
with the pricing variables. The desired outcome is the car at the desired price.

Reinforcement Learning
Supervised learning is widely used in machine learning and cognitive computing. 
Reinforcement learning is a special case of supervised learning where the system 
gets feedback on its performance to help determine the best outcome. While super-
vised learning systems are trained with an explicit set of training data, reinforce-
ment learning involves the system taking actions based on trial and error. Therefore, 
sequences of successful decisions result in reinforcement to help the developer gen-
erate an approach that can be generalized to solve a problem in a domain. For 
example, reinforcement learning is widely used in robotics or in self-driving cars. 
So, when the car takes an action based on data that results in the car driving into a 
wall, the system (thankfully) learns to take other actions with better results.
Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses inferential statistical modeling algorithms to discover 
patterns in data. Unsupervised learning is used when you don’t understand the 
patterns in the data but are trying to see what might be hidden within the data. 
The data is used to discover which relationships among data elements or structures 
are important through such attributes as the frequency of occurrence, the context 
of where that data appears, and the proximity of the data. For example, in drug 
discovery it is important to understand whether there is a relationship between 
a disease-causing molecule and a data structure that seems to have an impact on 
the disease molecule. Is the disease molecule changed when a certain treatment is 
applied? Does the data indicate that the pattern can be repeated? In a discipline like 
drug discovery, you can’t predetermine where a pattern exists until you experiment 
with different hypotheses. Other areas where unsupervised learning is important 
include vision or image analysis.
Cognitive Computing in Practice
Although we are early in the evolution of cognitive computing, we are already begin-
ning to see how this approach to computing is changing businesses. Traditionally, 
businesses have relied on the experience of experts and their ability to keep up with 
changes in technology and business to keep ahead of the competition. How do you 
translate huge amounts of human knowledge into a system that allows organiza-
tions to analyze data to support decision-making? How is it possible to allow the 
data to help you anticipate changes so that it is possible to take the right action at 
the right time to change outcomes?
The inexperienced resident in a hospital visits a patient with symptoms of a 
condition that he has never seen before, nor has he read it in any of his books. 

Looking toward the Future with Cognitive Computing  ◾  259
He knows that something is wrong but what? He goes to various databases and 
information sources and still can’t find the solution. Just in time, a physician with 
more than 30 years of experience enters the patient’s room and is able to determine 
what disease the patient has within five minutes. The difference is the internal 
knowledge base of the experienced doctor. If you could capture the data that is 
inside this physician’s head and add in other data sources and the context of his 
experience, it would be possible for the new resident to have solved the problem. 
This is the promise of a cognitive system.
Getting away from the standard way we approach problem solving to a cogni-
tive approach supported by machine learning takes time. First, as we discussed ear-
lier, it requires that a system be constructed, data be added, and a system be trained 
based on the domain and knowledge.
The steps to design a cognitive system require at least seven stages:
1.	Defining the objective. This means that the organization has to determine 
what type of problem they are trying to solve. Perhaps the organization wants to 
build a travel application that ensures that a traveler can find the optimal vaca-
tion, make the reservations, and build long term loyalty to the travel company.
2.	Defining the domain. There are thousands of potential domains ranging 
from medicine, to financial services, to insurance, to retail and travel. A suc-
cessful domain will have the availability of a lot of data from a variety of 
sources that can be combined in different ways to solve problems that are 
almost impossible to achieve manually.
3.	Understanding the intended users. Who will benefit from the cognitive 
system? If there are only a few users, then the system will have limited appli-
cability. However, there are domains that have a large pool of users who can 
benefit. For example, in retail there are huge numbers of customers who are 
unable to find the products they want when they want them. Retailers are 
threatened by new business models that are forcing change. A cognitive sys-
tem that targets the right buyers can change the fortunes of an industry.
4.	Defining the questions. What are the questions you would expect users to 
ask? How can you set up a system that helps provide the insights your users 
need to take the right action? In a medical situation, you would want the 
inexperienced resident to be able to ask questions about the symptoms of a 
disease and explore potential answers. Some answers could be hidden in a 
journal article written five years ago that the resident would never have seen. 
There may have been a patient last week with the same symptoms who was 
successfully treated. Not only do you have to ask the right questions but you 
should have enough understanding of the context of that question to antici-
pate the next action. Asking questions and getting answers from a variety of 
sources can be the difference between success and failure.
5.	Acquire the relevant data sources. You can design the best system but if the 
data isn’t good or if there isn’t enough of the data, you will fail. Therefore, one 

260  ◾  Intuition, Trust, and Analytics
of the most important characteristics of a cognitive system is to have enough 
trained data that the system continues to learn and change.
6.	Create and refine the corpus of data. Once you have the right data you have 
to continue to add to that data over time. Just as humans learn with time, 
data, and experience, so does a cognitive machine-learning system. There 
must be a collaboration between the data and interpretation by subject mat-
ter experts.
7.	Training and testing. Creating an effective cognitive system requires model-
ing, development, analysis, training, and testing. You need to be able to mea-
sure responses to questions to determine how accurate your answers are. After 
creating a system that provides accurate answers you will begin to establish 
ground truth—a set of data that is the gold standard for accuracy. This pro-
cess is ongoing and iterative if the knowledge base changes and grows. Any 
domain worthy of an investment in a cognitive system will continually create 
new data.
The Future of Cognitive Computing
We have only begun to scratch the surface of what will be possible when we apply 
a cognitive computing approach to the data we already own. Today, there is a lot 
of trial and error in converting what we understand as humans into systems that 
learn and support our actions. In the future, cognitive computing will be a set of 
enablers that allow systems to understand when an error occurs and then repair 
itself. Cognitive capabilities will be part of any technology that we deploy. We will 
begin creating packaged solutions including pretrained data sets that can quickly 
allow us to ask the right questions and get the right answers. At the same time, 
we will use the sophisticated machine-learning algorithms and tools to create new 
solutions to problems that we never thought could be understood.
