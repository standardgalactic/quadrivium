Introduction
S
o you’re going to England. Great! But what parts of England do you
want to visit? The country stretches from the English Channel in 
the south to the Scottish border in the north, and from Wales and the
Irish Sea in the west to the North Sea in the east. England isn’t a huge
country — you can drive its length in a day — but it’s packed with sight-
seeing possibilities.
I have a hunch that London is on your itinerary, but what other cities,
regions, or specific attractions do you want to see? The walled city of
York? Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare? Are
you interested in nightclubbing at a seaside resort, like Brighton, or
strolling through an elegant 18th-century spa town, like Bath? Are there
specific landscapes you want to see, such as the Yorkshire moors or the
cliffs of Cornwall? What castles, cathedrals, stately homes, and gardens
do you want to visit? And how about other historic sites? Do you want to
visit Roman ruins, spend all day in the Tower of London, or walk around
the field where the Normans and the Saxons fought the Battle of
Hastings in 1066? England promises so much to see, do, and enjoy that
you may find planning a trip here a real challenge.
But don’t worry, lucky traveler — in this book, I help you assemble your
perfect itinerary from England’s sightseeing riches. With a bit of plan-
ning and some useful information under your belt, you may find taking
that trip to England much easier than you thought.
About This Book
This book serves as a selective guide to England. By definition, England
is the southern part of Great Britain, excluding Wales. Wales and
Scotland, although part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, don’t appear in this book.
My goal throughout this book is to give you a good selection of the coun-
try’s highlights, which means I exclude places that other, more exhaus-
tive guidebooks routinely include. Birmingham, Manchester, and Bristol
are important cities, but from the perspective of a first-time visitor to
England, they don’t have much to offer. England has so much worth
seeing that you don’t need to waste your time with the second-rate, the
overrated, or the boring.
Use this book as a reference guide. You can, of course, start at the first
page and read all the way through to the end. Or, if you’ve already been
to England and know the basics of international travel, you can easily
flip to the specific part you need or home in on one specific chapter.

Please be advised that travel information can change at any time — this
is especially true of prices. I suggest that you write or call ahead for con-
firmation when making your travel plans. The author, editors, and pub-
lisher can’t be held responsible for readers’ experiences while traveling.
Your safety is important, however, so I encourage you to stay alert and
be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses,
and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
I recently tried to extract some information from a guidebook and felt
that I needed training in hieroglyphics to interpret all the different sym-
bols. I’m happy to report that user-friendly England For Dummies isn’t
like that. I keep the symbols and abbreviations to a minimum.
I do use the following credit card abbreviations to indicate which cards
hotels, restaurants, and attractions accept:
 AE (American Express)
 DC (Diners Club)
 MC (MasterCard)
 V (Visa)
All local, U.K. telephone numbers in this book begin with a zero, fol-
lowed by a city or area code. A slash divides the zero and city or area
code from the local number. For information about calling U.K. numbers
from either within or outside the United Kingdom, see the Appendix.
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. In addi-
tion to giving you exact prices, I use a system of dollar signs ($) to show
a range of costs for hotels or restaurants. The dollar signs for hotels cor-
respond to rack rates (nondiscounted, standard rates) and reflect a
hotel’s low to high rates for a double room. For restaurants, the dollar
signs denote the average cost of dinner for one person, including appe-
tizer, main course, dessert, one nonalcoholic drink, tax, and tip (usually
10 percent, unless the bill already includes a service charge). The scale
for hotels goes up to five $ signs; the priciest restaurants get four $
signs. Check out the following table to decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$200 and under
$25 and under
$$
$201–$300
$26–$50
$$$
$301–$400
$51–$75
$$$$
$401–$500
$75 and up
$$$$$
$501 and up
England For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2

I always give prices in this book first in British pounds sterling (£), fol-
lowed by U.S. dollars ($) rounded off to the nearest dollar over $10 and
to the nearest quarter under $10. Although the exchange rate fluctuates
daily, this book uses £1 = $2.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that I plot on a map, the
listing information gives you a page reference to the map. If a hotel,
restaurant, or attraction falls outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-
way area, this book may not include it on a map.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you, dear reader,
and your needs as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore England and wants expert advice on how to maximize your
time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to England and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about England or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on the places
that can give you the best or most original experience in England.
If you fit any of these criteria, England For Dummies, 4th Edition, gives
you the information that you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
I break this book down into eight parts. The first two parts deal with trip
planning and organization. They provide information, advice, and sug-
gestions that can help you map out a wonderful vacation. I devote the
other parts of the book to London and specific regions of the country.
For each region, I list the best towns and cities to visit, with hotel and
restaurant choices, and the top attractions, including castles, stately
homes, and gardens.
Part I: Introducing England
This first part introduces England and gives you some excellent reasons
for going there. This section gives you an overview of the best England
has to offer and helps you get the big picture. These chapters provide
background information on the history, architecture, and dining scene in
England; recommend books and movies to enhance your trip; help you
to decide when to visit and what to see; and provide sample one- and
two-week itineraries.
Introduction 3

Part II: Planning Your Trip to England
This part helps take some of the wrinkles out of the trip-planning stage. I
give you sound advice on planning a realistic budget and talk about your
options for airlines and airfares, how package tours can save you big
bucks, and what kinds of guided tours you can join. This part helps you
to decide what form of transportation (train, bus, or rental car) to use to
get around the country, and it explains what kind of accommodations
you can expect for your money. I provide tips for England-bound travel-
ers with special needs and interests: families, seniors, travelers with dis-
abilities, and gay and lesbian travelers. I also deal with some pretrip
loose ends, from passports to medical insurance.
Part III: London and Environs
All you need to know about England’s greatest city makes up this part.
You find detailed information on London’s airports and thumbnail
descriptions of the city’s diverse neighborhoods. Also, I help you get
around like a Londoner on the Underground, on the bus, or in a taxi.
London’s best hotels and an appetizing survey of London’s best restau-
rants are included in this chapter. I also cover the top attractions in and
around this exciting city, plus shopping and nightlife. Making side trips
from London is easy, and I provide details on several possible destina-
tions: Greenwich, Hampton Court Palace, Kew Gardens, Windsor Castle,
Oxford, Blenheim Palace, and Cambridge.
Part IV: The Southeast
In this part, I outline the highlights of Kent and Sussex, counties close 
to London that border the English Channel. I also recommend over
night destinations, such as Canterbury, with its ancient cathedral; the
swinging seaside resort of Brighton; and the cobblestoned town of Rye. 
I devote a chapter to Kent’s greatest castles, stately homes, and 
gardens — including Knole, Hever Castle, Sissinghurst Castle Gardens,
Dover Castle, and Leeds Castle.
Part V: The West Country
This part explores the West Country counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire,
Devon, and Cornwall. Winchester is Hampshire’s most historic city.
Neighboring Wiltshire is the home of Salisbury, with its towering cathe-
dral, and that great prehistoric monument Stonehenge. In Devon, you
find the unique moorland landscape of Dartmoor National Park;
Torquay, a laid-back seaside resort; and Plymouth, where the Pilgrims
set sail for the New World. Clovelly, on Devon’s northern coast, is a
uniquely charming town with one steep main street that plunges down a
cliffside to a picturesque harbor. Vacationers often flock to mysterious
Cornwall, which includes Land’s End in England’s southwestern most
corner. With its mild climate; colorful seaside towns, such as Penzance
and St. Ives; and ancient sites, such as Tintagel, associated with the
legend of King Arthur, Cornwall is one of England most enticing counties.
England For Dummies, 4th Edition 
4

Part VI: England’s Heartland
I devote this part to central England. You may know Stratford-upon-
Avon in Warwickshire as the home of William Shakespeare, and nearby
Warwick Castle is one of the country’s most popular attractions. Such 
an amazing collection of 18th-century buildings fills beautiful Bath that
UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organiza-
tion) designated the city a World Heritage Site. Wells, close to Bath in
neighboring Somerset, is England’s smallest cathedral city, and one of
the prettiest. The Cotswolds region, with its picture-perfect villages built
of honey-colored stone, is one of England’s premier touring destinations.
Cheltenham and Cirencester make good bases for exploring the Cotswolds.
Part VII: Way Up North
Yorkshire and the Lake District are highly scenic areas close to England’s
northern border with Scotland. York is one of the most beautiful and his-
toric cities in the North; Scarborough is a Yorkshire resort town on the
North Sea; and amazing Castle Howard lies between them. North York
Moors National Park and the Yorkshire Dales National Park protect
Yorkshire’s distinctive landscape of heather-covered moors, gentle
dales, and rugged coastline. The Lake District, in Cumbria, is a spectacu-
larly beautiful region of mountains and lakes, all within Lake District
National Park. You can stay on Lake Windermere, England’s largest lake,
or in nearby Grasmere or Keswick.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens allows me to focus a little more attention on the extra-
special places and sights I want you to know about. My “tens” include
ten famous writers and how you can visit where they lived and worked,
ten great English gardens, ten magnificent churches and cathedrals, and
ten famous royals and the events that characterized their reign.
You can also find two other elements in this book. Near the back, I
include an A-to-Z appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing plenty
of handy information, such as how the telephone system works and
what numbers to call in an emergency. You also find a list of toll-free tele-
phone numbers and Web sites for airlines, rental car agencies, and hotel
chains serving England, plus Web sites where you can find additional
information on specific cities or areas. Finally, I include a tear-out Cheat
Sheet at the front of this book that can help you with unfamiliar British
words.
Icons Used in This Book
In this book’s margins, you’ll find six different icons: little pictures that
clue you in on some important trip-planning matters and a few things
that are just for fun.
Introduction 5

This icon points out my report on the most newsworthy scandals — I
mean stories — about people and places. I throw in these tidbits about
English personalities and places just for the fun of it.
I’m not cheap, but I love to save money, and I suspect you do, too. Keep
an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving tips
and/or great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best the destination has to offer in all 
categories: hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that welcome children or people traveling with kids.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Where to Go from Here
To England, of course! How you use this book is up to you. You can start
from the beginning and read straight through, or you can start anywhere
in between and extract information as you want or need it. Throughout
the book, I hope you think of me as your guide or companion on this
journey to England. However you use the book, I want you to have a
great time.

Part I
Introducing England

In this part . . .
T
his part helps to get you going. If you’ve never been to
England, you need advice and information to start plan-
ning your trip. And if you’ve been to England before, you may
want to refresh your knowledge and look for some new places
to visit.
Chapter 1 gives you a brief overview that ﬁlls you in on the
best England has to offer, from the edge-of-your-seat excite-
ment of London to the sleepy splendor of ancient villages. I
give you a roundup of the greatest gardens, the coolest cas-
tles, the stateliest of stately homes, the most historically
charismatic towns and cities, the most beautiful churches
and cathedrals, and the most romantic landscapes.
Chapter 2 digs deeper into the culture and history of England
in a way that can only add to your enjoyment of what you see
and experience once you’re there. I give you a brief outline of
the main events in English history, right up to the latest royal
scandals. I cover the dining and drinking scene, from haute
restaurants to historic pubs where you can enjoy a pint of ale
with the locals. I outline England’s main architectural trends.
And, ﬁnally, I recommend some books and movies that you
may want to check out.
Chapter 3 offers more-speciﬁc information to help you plan
when and where you want to go. I present a general overview
of the main areas I cover in the book and include a calendar
of events and a description of the seasons.
In Chapter 4, I suggest two possible itineraries: one for visi-
tors who have one week in England and the second for 
visitors with two weeks. I also include itineraries for families,
gardening enthusiasts, and history buffs. Even if you don’t
use them, the itineraries may give you some ideas for your
own trip and how to budget your time.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of England
In This Chapter
 Discovering London and England’s most fascinating towns and villages
 Exploring England’s unrivaled collection of castles, palaces, cathedrals, 
and churches
 Experiencing the great historic landmarks of England
 Enjoying glorious gardens and the English countryside
 Going shopping in London and beyond
E
ngland claims a special place in the hearts and minds of many
people. English speakers (and readers) in the United States, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand often feel a kinship with the land of their
mother tongue. England shares many cultural ties and hundreds of place
names with those countries. So for some people, a trip to England is like
going home. The country’s great age, and the sheer weight of its history,
can induce a sense of awe and wonder. England is a land of ancient
cities, royal palaces, massive cathedrals, and legendary sites. You can
see the layers of its long history everywhere you look. And travelers can
enjoy the country in so many different ways. Mighty castles, stately
homes, glorious gardens, and picturesque villages enhance the country-
side’s natural beauty. The cooking is unique, and so is the English pub.
This chapter serves as an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best —
the best of the best — that England has to offer. In the categories that I
outline, you can find some of the things that make traveling in England
so much fun and so endlessly fascinating. I discuss each of these places
in detail later in this book; you can find them in their indicated chapters,
marked with the Best of the Best icon that accompanies this paragraph.
The Best of Legendary London
London is one of the world’s great cities, and I give it plenty of coverage
in this book because almost every visitor to England heads here first.

London is exciting, historic, cultured, cutting-edge, and romantic. See
Chapters 11 and 12 for more about these highlights:
 London is where you can visit truly world-class museums. The
British Museum, the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the Tate
Britain, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and the Natural History
Museum — to name the best known — display a mind-boggling
array of artwork and unique treasures.
 The Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham
Palace are just three of the famous historic places you can visit.
Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, Green Park, and St. James’s
Park form a vast network of green space shared by Londoners and
visitors to the capital of the United Kingdom.
 London’s dining scene is phenomenal, and the entertainment
choices — theater, music, dance, opera, film — are almost limitless.
The shopping opportunities are endless, too.
The Best Cities, Towns, and Villages
England isn’t that large, so you can base yourself in London and take day
trips to many historic cities and towns in other parts of the country. Or
you can make them part of an itinerary that showcases the country’s
best cities.
 One of the most elegant of English cities is the former spa town of
Bath, with its amazing Georgian crescents (row houses built in a
long curving line) and 18th-century architecture (see Chapter 20).
 Oxford and Cambridge are famous university towns where cen-
turies-old colleges cluster around quadrangles (see Chapter 13).
 For some laid-back fun beside the seaside, you can visit 
Brighton, on the south coast (see Chapter 14), or head up north 
to Scarborough, on the North Sea in Yorkshire (see Chapter 21).
Cornwall (see Chapter 18) has several picturesque towns, many of
them former fishing villages with colorful histories of smuggling
and pirates: Penzance is the largest, but you also find St. Ives, an
artists’ colony with a beautiful beach; Mousehole; and Fowey.
 Rye, in Sussex, is one of the best preserved and most attractive
towns in England, full of Elizabethan homes and buildings (see
Chapter 14).
 York, two hours north of London by train, is still surrounded by its
medieval walls; has narrow, medieval lanes; and is home to York
Minster, one of the largest churches in the world (see Chapter 21).
 The scenic Cotswolds region is dotted with charming, honey-colored
stone villages — Broadway, Bourton-on-the-Water, Chipping
Part I: Introducing England 
10

Campden, and Cirencester — that all grew rich on wool during the
Middle Ages (see Chapter 20).
 In the Lake District, a scenically splendid area in northwest England,
you find picturesque villages, such as Grasmere, and lakeside towns,
such as Keswick, in stunning countryside (see Chapter 22).
The Best Castles, Palaces, and Stately Homes
Step into one of England’s castles, palaces, or stately homes, and all you
can do is marvel at the way people used to live. Some people, I should
say, because these enormous estates belonged to an elite minority with
royal connections or private fortunes. Usually set amid spectacular
grounds, these places are treasure troves of history and art, packed with
rare paintings and beautiful furniture.
 In London, you can visit Buckingham Palace, the queen’s official
residence, and Kensington Palace, once the home of Princess
Diana. Henry VIII’s Hampton Court Palace is a short train ride from
London, as is 900-year-old Windsor Castle, another official resi-
dence of Queen Elizabeth II. Chapter 12 has more about Buckingham
and Kensington palaces, and Chapter 13 has the details about
Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle.
 Knole, which has 365 rooms (some with their original 17th-century
furnishings), and moated Hever Castle, birthplace of Anne Boleyn,
are just two of the many castles and stately homes you can visit in
Kent (see Chapter 15).
 One of the most dramatically sited castles in England is St. Michael’s
Mount, on its own rocky island in Mount’s Bay, Penzance (see
Chapter 18). Castle Drogo (see Chapter 17), in nearby Dartmoor
National Park, is the last private castle to be built in England (it was
completed in 1930).
 Blenheim Palace (see Chapter 13), near Oxford, was the palatial
childhood home of Winston Churchill, who later moved to Chartwell,
a house in Kent that is filled with Churchill memorabilia (see
Chapter 15).
 Farther north, just a few miles from Stratford-upon-Avon, is mighty
Warwick Castle, surrounded by thick stone walls and towers. 
The wax artisans at Madame Tussauds have “peopled” the castle
with its former owners and some of their famous guests (see
Chapter 19).
 Castle Howard, in Yorkshire, is one of the most beautiful stately
homes in England, an enormous domed wonder set amidst 
landscaped grounds with classically inspired buildings (see
Chapter 21).
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of England 11

The Best Cathedrals and Churches
England’s mighty cathedrals, still in use 800 plus years after they were
built, dominate the heart of England’s cities. Their stupendous size never
fails to impress, and some of their architectural details are stunning. I
include several of my favorite cathedrals and churches in this book:
 English monarchs have been crowned in London’s Westminster
Abbey since the time of William the Conqueror. St. Paul’s
Cathedral is the masterpiece of Sir Christopher Wren, who rebuilt
London after the Great Fire of 1666 (see Chapter 12).
 Chaucer’s pilgrims in The Canterbury Tales were headed toward
Canterbury Cathedral, and tourists still flock there in droves (see
Chapter 14).
 The west front of Exeter Cathedral is remarkable for its rows of
sculptured saints and kings, the largest surviving array of 14th-
century sculpture in England (see Chapter 17).
 Massive York Minster, the largest Gothic building in northern
Europe, contains more medieval stained glass than any other 
cathedral in England (see Chapter 21).
 Wells, England’s smallest cathedral town, is dominated by beau-
tiful Wells Cathedral with its unique transverse arches (see
Chapter 20).
The Best Historic Places
England markets its history big time, and with good reason: Its recorded
history stretches back some 2,000 years, to a time when Latin-speaking
Roman soldiers built forts, roads, and temples from Kent to Northumber-
land. But England was inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans
arrived. No soap opera can beat the stories associated with England’s
most famous historic sites. The great historical landmarks of England
stir the imagination because they’ve witnessed so much — from glorious
triumphs to bloody tragedies.
 When you visit the Tower of London, you walk on a piece of
ground where the great dramas and terrors of a turbulent kingdom
were played out, where Elizabeth I was held captive while still a
princess, and where Sir Thomas More and Anne Boleyn were
beheaded (see Chapter 12).
 In southern England, at a place called Battle, you can walk around
the battlefield where in 1066 William of Normandy defeated Harold,
the Saxon king of England. The battle changed the course of English
history (see Chapter 14).
 Long-vanished peoples erected mysterious monuments that still fill
the country. The most famous is Stonehenge, a massive stone circle
Part I: Introducing England 
12

on the plains of Wiltshire (see Chapter 16). In Cornwall, you can visit
other tantalizing prehistoric sites, including Chysauster, the remains
of an Iron Age village (see Chapter 18). In northern England, up in the
Lake District, Castlerigg Stone Circle, near Keswick, is another enig-
matic reminder of early human presence in England (see Chapter 22).
The Best Gardens
In England, gardening has been raised to an art form. Chalk it up to a
temperate climate (especially in the southeast and southwest) that can
support all kinds of rare and exotic plant species, including azaleas and
rhododendrons. I include several great English gardens in this book
because gardens are a growing (pardon the pun) interest for visitors
from around the globe. The gardens usually surround a stately home or
castle that you can also visit.
 Perhaps the most famous garden in England is at Sissinghurst
Castle, in Kent (see Chapter 15). The plantings there, and at equally
beautiful Hidcote Manor, in Gloucestershire, form living “rooms” of
shape, color, scent, and texture (see Chapter 20).
 Stourhead, in Wiltshire, was laid out in 1741 and is one of the
oldest landscape gardens in England (see Chapter 16).
 In Cornwall, Cotehele and Lanhydrock are estates known for their
superb riverside gardens. Cornwall is also the site of England’s
newest garden, a massive world-environment learning center called
the Eden Project (see Chapter 18).
 You can find immaculately landscaped grounds, where every 
shrub and blade of grass is clipped to perfection, at Hever Castle,
in Kent (see Chapter 15); Warwick Castle, near Stratford-upon-
Avon (see Chapter 19); and Castle Howard, up north in Yorkshire
(see Chapter 21).
 Closer to London, you find historic gardens at Hampton Court
Palace and the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see Chapter 13).
The Best Romantic Landscapes
England has been settled for thousands of years, and truly wild places
are rare in this densely populated country where over 46 million people
inhabit 50,357 square miles of land. Yet travelers always comment on the
countryside’s beauty, a domesticated blend of farms, enclosed fields,
and small villages that seem to snooze under a blanket of history. The
way humans have interacted with the environment for thousands of
years — leaving behind grand monuments, such as Stonehenge, humble
country churches, thatched cottages, and hedgerows — contributes to
the enduring charm of the English countryside. Many visitors respond to
the sense of human continuity evoked by the following landscapes:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of England 13

 If you explore Cornwall, you encounter rocky coastal headlands,
windswept moors, and Celtic crosses left by Irish missionaries 14
centuries ago (see Chapter 18).
 Touring the Cotswolds, you see picturesque villages of honey-
colored stone that date back to the Middle Ages interspersed with
lightly forested valleys and high open fields where sheep graze as
they’ve done for a thousand years (see Chapter 20).
 Luckily, the country’s wildest and most unique landscapes are pro-
tected as national parks, limiting commercial development and
opening the countryside to walkers, thus preserving the regions’
essential character. Places like Dartmoor National Park in Devon
(see Chapter 17), North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales national
parks in Yorkshire (see Chapter 21), and Lake District National
Park in semi-remote Cumbria (see Chapter 22) are all great places
for you to experience the most romantic landscapes of England.
The Best Shopping
London is one of the world’s greatest shopping cities, and my credit cards
aren’t doing all the talking. From mighty Harrods to the super-chic bou-
tiques of Bond Street, from the 200-year-old shops on Jermyn Street to the
wonderland of bookstores on Charing Cross Road, London offers a seem-
ingly endless array of goods and goodies. Custom-made shirts, hand-tooled
leather shoes, high-quality woolens — in London, you can still find such
things. You can hunt for an old engraving, paw through bric-a-brac at an
outdoor market stall, or wander through the London silver vaults in your
quest for a Georgian soup ladle. Go to Chapter 12 for the shopping details.
Nowhere else in the country can match London’s abundance of shop-
ping opportunities. Outside the capital, however, small shops and one-
of-a-kind places draw the shopper’s eye:
 Antiquarian bookstores abound in Cambridge and Oxford (see
Chapter 13).
 Exeter is a good place to look for silver (see Chapter 17).
 The Cotswolds has more antique stores than anywhere else in
England (see Chapter 20).
 Many areas of the country feature locally made handicrafts. Look
for pottery in Devon, Cornwall, and the Lake District (see
Chapters 17, 18, and 22, respectively).
You may also stumble across some treasure at a rural car-boot (trunk)
sale or jumble (rummage) sale. At these informal sales in schools or
church buildings or parking lots, you can buy secondhand odds and
ends. And of course, every major historic attraction in England — from
Sissinghurst Castle Garden in Kent to Castle Howard in Yorkshire — has
a gift shop.

In This Chapter
 Running through the main events in England’s history

 Diving into English food and beer
 Discovering books and movies about England
T
his chapter helps you find out more about England and deepens
your experience of the country. I distill the essence of England’s
complicated and tumultuous past so that you can get a clear, quick
sense of the major eras. Then I highlight the main architectural trends,
whet your appetite with a primer on English food and drink, and recom-
mend some excellent books and movies about England.
The Main Events: A Brief History of England
England’s history is an inexhaustible subject. Huge tomes have been
written on individual monarchs, colorful personalities, architectural
styles, and historical eras. But in this section, I’m going to be as brief 
as a bikini and give you a history of England that covers only the bare
essentials:
 Prehistory: Beginning about 5,000 years ago, a Neolithic civilization
was cutting and hauling megaton slabs of stone over dozens of
miles and erecting them in elaborate geometric configurations.
Stonehenge is the most famous example of their work. (See Chapter
16 for details on Stonehenge.)
 The Romans arrive: When the Romans conquered England in A.D.
43, they suppressed or subdued the local Celtic tribes. The leg-
endary Queen Boudicca (or Boadicea) was a Celtic warrior queen
who fought back the invading Romans. (You can see a statue of her
on Westminster Bridge in London.) The Romans brought their
building and engineering skills to England, and you can see the

remains of Roman walls, roads, forts, temples, villas, and baths
throughout the country — most notably in Bath. (See Chapter 20
for more about Bath.)
 Northern invaders: With the Roman Empire’s breakup in A.D. 410,
Jutes, Angles, and Saxons from northern Europe invaded England
and formed small kingdoms. For the next 600 years or so, the
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fought off Viking raiders. In the north,
Eboracum, a Roman settlement, became Jorvik, a Viking city, and
eventually York. (See Chapter 21 for more about York.)
 William the Conqueror: The next major transitional period in
England started in 1066, when William of Normandy fought and
killed Harold, the Anglo-Saxon king of England, at the Battle of
Hastings (the site of today’s town of Battle, which you can read
about in Chapter 14). William and his French nobles took over the
land and built castles — Windsor Castle (see Chapter 13) and the
Tower of London (see Chapter 12) are two examples — and cathe-
drals that still stand today. Every monarch up to the present day
claims descent from William the Conqueror.
 Magna Carta: King John, a Plantagenet, signed the Magna Carta in
1215, granting more rights to the nobles. What about the common
man and woman? As serfs and vassals in a closed, hierarchical,
class-ridden society, their lot wasn’t an easy one. Geoffrey Chaucer
(1342–1400) was the first writer to give us some recognizable por-
traits of folks who lived during the medieval period, in The
Canterbury Tales. (For more about Canterbury, see Chapter 14.)
 Hundred Years’ War: At home and abroad, war and bloodshed tore
England apart for more than 300 years. The Hundred Years’ War
between France and England began in 1337. During this same
period, in the War of the Roses, the Houses of York and Lancaster
fought for the right of succession to the English crown.
 Tudor and Elizabethan England: Henry VIII, the Tudor king famous
for taking six wives, brought about the next great shift in what had
been Catholic England. In 1534, he dissolved all the monasteries
and became head of the Church of England. His daughter, Elizabeth
I, ruled during a period of relative peace, power, and prosperity.
The Elizabethan period was England’s Golden Age, the time when
Shakespeare’s plays were being performed at the Globe Theatre in
London.
 Civil war: In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I of
England, uniting the crowns of England and Scotland. But conflicts
between monarchs and nobles were endless. Charles I, seeking
absolute power, dissolved Parliament in 1629. He was beheaded in
1649 after Oliver Cromwell led a bitter civil war between Royalists
and Parliamentarians. Cromwell’s armies destroyed churches and
royalist strongholds throughout the country. Cromwell was ele-
vated to Lord Protectorate of the Realm, but by 1660 a new king,
Part I: Introducing England 
16

Charles II, was on the throne. This time, however, his powers were
limited.
 Fire and plague: London, which had been growing steadily, was
devastated by two back-to-back catastrophes: the Great Plague of
1665 and the Great Fire of 1666.
 The Victorian Empire: England reached its zenith of power and
prestige during the reign of Victoria (1837–1901), who ruled over 
an empire so vast that “the sun never set” on it. The Industrial
Revolution spawned another major change during this period,
moving England away from its agrarian past and into a mechanized
future. Charles Dickens and other social reformers exposed the
wretched working conditions in Victorian England, where children
as young as 6 had to labor in mines and factories. The late Victorian
age was the time of Sherlock Holmes, a fictional detective created
by Arthur Conan Doyle, and Jack the Ripper, a real-life serial killer
who terrorized London’s East End.
 England in the World Wars: England suffered terrible losses 
during World War I (1914–1918) but emerged victorious. During
World War II, from the fall of France in 1940 until the United States
entered the war in 1941, England stood alone against Hitler. Winston
Churchill was the country’s prime minister during the war years.
With strictly rationed food, mandatory blackouts, and terrible
bombing raids that destroyed cities and killed tens of thousands 
of civilians, life in wartime England had a profound effect on its 
citizens. Shortages continued for many years afterward.
 The welfare state: Another major societal shift occurred in 1945
when the Labour Party began to dismantle the empire and intro-
duced the welfare state. Under the National Health System, every
citizen in the United Kingdom can receive free healthcare and pen-
sion benefits. It wasn’t until Margaret Thatcher and the Tory Party
came into power during the 1980s that England began privatizing
formerly state-run agencies, such as the railroad (with what some
say are disastrous results).
 Queen Elizabeth II: Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne in
1952. The fairy-tale wedding of her son Prince Charles to Lady
Diana Spencer was the last high point for the House of Windsor.
Charles and Diana’s subsequent divorce seemed to unleash a flood-
gate of royal scandals, with the result that the popularity of the
British monarchy reached an all-time low. In 2002, the queen cele-
brated her 50th anniversary on the throne. But the queen is no
longer the richest woman in England: J. K. Rowling, the author of
the Harry Potter books, now holds that title.
 New Labour: In 2001, Tony Blair was elected to a second term 
as prime minister, and New Labour, with its centrist approach, 
was firmly in control of the government. However, in the 2005 elec-
tions, the party lost one-third of its seats as voters expressed their
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into England 17

discontent with Blair’s continuing support of the war in Iraq. Blair
stepped down as prime minister in June 2007, and was succeeded
by Gordon Brown.
 Terrorist bombings: In July 2005, a day after exultant Londoners
learned that their city would host the 2012 Olympic Summer
Games, terrorists detonated bombs in the London Underground
and on a double-decker bus, killing 54 people and wounding hun-
dreds more. Londoners stood together and carried on, showing the
world that they would not be cowed by acts of violence.

Recent royal events
In 2005, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, finally married his long-time mis-
tress, Camilla Parker-Bowles, in a ceremony that his mother, Queen Elizabeth, did not
attend. The wedding was somewhat anti-climactic because Charles had been involved
with Camilla throughout his entire marriage to Princess Diana. On the first anniver-
sary of his marriage to Camilla, Charles got to read in The Times that 56 percent of
Britons did not wish to see his new wife become queen. She will, though, unless the
governments of England and 15 Commonwealth nations change the law. In the mean-
time, the pre-queen is addressed as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
As Elizabeth enters her twilight years (she turned 81 in 2007), some Britons wonder if
the centuries-old British monarchy should end with her — especially with the unpopu-
lar Charles next in line for the throne. Just 37 percent of Britons think that Charles
should succeed his mother, according to a 2007 poll. In fact, the poll found that 39 per-
cent would prefer that Charles’s eldest son, Prince William, leapfrog his father for the
crown. Poor Charles just can’t seem to do anything that will win him the respect
enjoyed by his mother. In 2007, Charles was accused by some members of Parliament
of overstepping the traditional bounds imposed on the royal family to not interfere in
political matters. Soon after, Charles had to read how his second son, Prince Harry, 21,
partied with lap dancers as he and his class at Sandhurst military college finished
training. In comparison, Prince William, tall and blond like his late mother, Diana, stays
out of trouble, and is quiet and well-mannered. The only semi-bad press William
received in 2007 was when he broke off his four-year relationship with Kate Middleton,
presumably because her blood wasn’t blue enough. Though her parents are self-made
millionaires, Kate’s mother had once worked as a flight attendant, a fact that just didn’t
fly in royal circles.
William and Harry co-hosted the hugely successful Concert for Diana at Wembley
Stadium in London on July 1, 2007 (what would have been Diana’s 47th birthday), an
event Prince Charles did not attend. The queen, meanwhile, was involved in a PR scuf-
fle when the BBC showed a film clip of her purportedly storming out of a sitting with
photographer Annie Leibowitz after Leibowitz asked Her Maj to remove her crown. It
turned out that the BBC had manipulated the film footage to suit its story and was
forced to apologize. Right after that, Prince Philip, the queen’s husband, denied reports
that he had ever called Diana a “harlot” and a “trollop.” Stay tuned . . . .

Building Blocks: An Overview 
of English Architecture
You can determine the period in which a building was constructed (or
reconstructed) by its architectural and decorative details. In a country
like England, where the age of buildings can span a thousand-year period
(a few Anglo-Saxon churches are even older than that), many different
styles evolved. The architectural periods are often named for the
monarch or royal family reigning at the time. You can enhance your
enjoyment of England’s abundance of historic buildings if you know a
few key features of the different styles. The following list is a brief primer
in English architectural history, from Norman to Victorian times:
 Norman (1066–1189): Round arches, barrel vaults, and highly deco-
rated archways characterize this period’s Romanesque style.
 Early English Gothic (1189–1272): The squat, bulky buildings of the
Norman period gave way to the taller, lighter buildings constructed
in this style.
 Decorated Gothic (1272–1377): Buildings in this style have large
windows, tracery (ornamental work with branching lines), and
heavily decorated gables and arches.
 Perpendicular Gothic (1377–1483): Large buttresses (exterior side
supports) allowed churches to have larger windows than ever
before. Tracery was more elaborate than in previous Gothic build-
ings; the four-centered arch appeared; and architects perfected fan
vaulting (a decorative form of vaulting in which the structural ribs
spread upward and outward along the ceiling like the rays of a fan).
 Tudor (1485–1553): During this period, buildings evolved from
Gothic to Renaissance styles. Large houses and palaces were 
built with a new material: brick. England has many half-timbered
Tudor and Elizabethan domestic and commercial buildings. This
method of construction used brick and plaster between visible
wooden timbers.
 Elizabethan (1553–1603): The Renaissance brought a revival of
classical features, such as columns, cornices (prominent rooflines
with brackets and other details), and pediments (a decorative trian-
gular feature over doorways and windows). The many large houses
and palaces of this period were built in an E or H shape and con-
tained long galleries, grand staircases, and carved chimneys.
 Jacobean (1603–1625): In England, Inigo Jones adopted the sym-
metrical, classically inspired Palladian style that arrived from Italy,
but he used it in a freer and more fanciful way. Buildings in this
style incorporate elements from ancient Greek and Roman architec-
ture. Columns and pilasters, round-arch arcades, and flat roofs with
openwork parapets became common.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into England 19

 Stuart (1625–1688): Elegant classical features, such as columns,
cornices, and pediments, are typical of this period, in which Sir
Christopher Wren was the preeminent architect.
 Queen Anne (1689–1714): Buildings from the English baroque
period mix heavy ornamentation with classical simplicity.
 Georgian and Regency (1714–1830): During these periods, elegant
terraced houses were built; many examples survive in Brighton and
Bath. Form and proportion were important elements; interior deco-
ration inspired by Chinese motifs became fashionable.
 Victorian (1830–1901): A whole range of antique styles emerged —
everything from Gothic and Greek Revival to pseudo-Egyptian and
Elizabethan. Hundreds of English churches were renovated during
the Victorian era.
 Modern, Postmodern, and Contemporary Architecture
(1946–present): Massive destruction in World War II bombing 
raids meant rebuilding whole sections of London and other cities
throughout England. International Modernism, adapted from
European models, resulted in sleeker and simpler facades. The
most iconic building from the modernist era is Royal Festival Hall,
built on London’s South Bank for the Festival of Britain in 1951.
Gargantuan and ungainly Postmodern office buildings went up in
The City (London’s financial center) during the 1980s, borrowing
architectural styles and elements from earlier and more gracefully
coherent epochs. In the past decade, designer buildings by designer
architects have popped up on the London skyline, most notably
“the Gherkin,” a pickle-shaped City office tower, and the new London
City Hall, a rounded glass building on the South Bank near Tower
Bridge, both by Lord Norman Foster.
Dining English Style from 
Traditional to Modern
Once upon a time, you could always count on getting lousy meals in
England. English “home cooking” — dull, insular, and uninspired — was
the joke of Europe. That began to change in the 1980s, with the influx of
new cooking trends that favored foods from France and Italy. Since then,
London has become a major food capital, and the rest of the country has
raised its food consciousness considerably. London is certainly the easi-
est place to find restaurants serving inventive Modern British cuisine,
but you also encounter the new cooking style in smaller towns and even
in some pubs. And don’t forget that spicy Indian cooking is England’s
second “national” cuisine. You find thousands of Indian and other ethnic
restaurants throughout the country.
Part I: Introducing England 
20

But traditionalists have nothing to worry about. You can still get your
hands on all those wonderful Old English faves — eggs, kippers, beans,
and fried tomatoes for breakfast; bubble and squeak; roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding; meat pies; fish and chips; cottage pie; sticky toffee
pudding; and trifle. (See the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a
glossary of English food terms.) When traditional, non-fancy English
dishes are done well, they’re super satisfying and delicious. If you travel
around the country, look for local and regional specialties, such as
sausage, lamb, cheese, and desserts.
While you’re in England, you can also look forward to the world of after-
noon tea. In the West Country, you get a cream tea, which consists of
tea; homemade scones; strawberry jam; and thick, rich, clotted cream
from Devon or Cornwall. (You put the cream on your scones, not in your
tea, and then top it all with the jam.) Elsewhere, you may find whipped
cream in place of the clotted cream. You can have teas as simple or as
fancy as you want.
Visiting the Local Pub
The pub (short for public house) is an English institution. England is
awash with historic pubs, where you can sit all evening with a pint of
ale, bitter, stout, or cider and soak up the local color (but not the smoke,
since smoking is no longer allowed in pubs). No matter how tiny the vil-
lage or town, you always find at least one pub. In London and larger
towns, you can do a pub crawl, walking (upright) from pub to pub and
sampling the diverse brews on tap. Although you can get a hard drink at
both bars and pubs, when you’re in a pub, you’re better off confining
yourself to beer.
Parliament has instituted the strict hours that most pubs adhere to:
Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon
to 10:30 p.m. Americans, take note: In a pub, you never tip the bartender;
the best you can do is offer to buy him or her a drink, an acceptable
practice in England. Ten minutes before closing, a bell rings, signaling
that the time has come to order your last round.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into England 21
Smoke-free England
On July 1, 2007, England went smokeless. Smokers are no longer allowed to light up
in restaurants, pubs, or any public place. For non-smokers, the legislation is literally a
breath of fresh air.

Background Check: Finding England 
in Books and Movies
It’s always fun to whet your appetite for a place by reading about it or
watching a movie filmed on location. When it comes to reading about
England or seeing it on the screen, you have almost endless possibilities.
Here are a few suggestions.
Books
Has any country produced as many great and enduring writers as
England? It’s impossible in a brief survey to even scratch the surface. 
In Chapter 23, I provide a quick rundown of the works and workplaces
Part I: Introducing England 
22
A beer primer: Are you bitter or stout?
Most of the pubs in London and throughout the United Kingdom are “tied” to a par-
ticular brewery and sell only that brewery’s beers (you see the name of the brewery
on the sign outside). Independent pubs can sell more brands than a tied pub. Either
way, you still have to choose from what may seem like a bewildering variety. The col-
orful names of individual brews don’t provide much help — you can only wonder what
Pigswill, Dogs Bollocks, Hobgoblin, Old Thumper, Pommies Revenge, or Boondoggle
taste like. Depending on all sorts of factors — the water, the hops, the fermentation
technique, and so on — the brewery crafts the taste of any beer, whether on draught
or in a bottle. You can get a few U.S. and international brands, but imports are more
expensive than the homegrown products.
When ordering beer in a pub, specify the type, the brand, and the amount (pint or half-
pint) you want. Feel free to ask the bartender to recommend something based on your
taste preferences. Just remember that pubs serve most English beer at room tem-
perature. The following brief descriptions of beer may come in handy in a pub:
 Ale: Not as strong as bitter, ale has a slightly sweeter taste. You can order light or
pale ale in a bottle; export ale is a stronger variety.
 Bitter: What most locals drink. It’s a clear, yellowish, traditional beer with a strong
flavor of hops. Real ale is a bitter that’s still fermenting (alive) when it arrives from
the brewery; the pub pumps and serves it immediately.
 Lager: When chilled, lager is probably the closest you can come to an American-
style beer. You can get lager in bottles or on draught.
 Shandy: Equal parts bitter and lemonade (sometimes limeade or ginger beer), it’s
for those who like a sweet beverage that only sort of tastes like beer.
 Stout: A dark, rich, creamy version of ale. Guinness is the most popular brand. A
black and tan is half lager and half stout.

associated with Jane Austen; Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë;
Charles Dickens; Henry James and E.F. Benson; Beatrix Potter; Vita
Sackville-West; William Shakespeare; and William Wordsworth.
The wonderful thing about England — at least, if you love literature — 
is that you can visit the homes of many great poets and novelists, 
and see with your own eyes the towns, cities, and landscapes that
inspired them.
Here are some additional suggestions for English novels:
 If you’re going to visit Dorset or Devon, you may want to read a
novel or two by Thomas Hardy, who set his works in the fictional
county of Wessex. Hardy’s best-known works are Tess of the
D’Urbervilles, Jude the Obscure, and The Mayor of Casterbridge.
 Daphne du Maurier’s famous romantic novel Rebecca is set in a
great house on the coast of Cornwall.
 The fascinating historical novels of Edward Rutherfurd follow 
the fates of families and fortunes in specific places or regions of
England over thousands of years: Sarum is about Salisbury; London
is about London; The Forest is about life in the New Forest.
 The Cazalet Chronicles, four novels by Elizabeth Jane Howard,
take place in London and on the south coast of England between
the two world wars.
 Alan Hollinghurst’s Booker Prize–winner, The Line of Beauty,
etches a portrait of London during the Thatcher years.
 Zadie Smith’s brilliantly hilarious White Teeth is the story of two
immigrant families in North London.
 Ian McEwan’s best-selling Saturday evokes the life of an upper-
middle-class family in London today. His 2007 novel, On Chesil
Beach, takes place in 1962 and chronicles the disastrous honey-
moon of a sexually mismatched couple.
 Kate Fox’s entertaining pop-psych book Watching the English deals
humorously with the “hidden rules” of English behavior as it relates
to social class and “Englishness.”
 A.A. Gill, a British social critic, skewers his countrymen in The
Angry English, arguing that beneath all that cool English reserve lies
a boiling rage.
Thousands of tomes have been written about the history of England.
One recent and noteworthy offering is Simon Schama’s three-volume
History of Britain, which accompanied a program of the same name on
the BBC History Channel. For popular biographies of historical figures,
try Antonia Fraser’s The Wives of Henry VIII and Cromwell. You can find
many good biographies of Elizabeth I, including Alison Weir’s The Life of
Elizabeth I.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into England 23

Movies
The Brits are great filmmakers and beat Hollywood cold when it comes
to honesty in acting, re-creation of period detail, and human-scale cine-
matic storytelling. If you’ve ever watched British television, you know
how completely different it is from American TV. The characters actually
look like human beings and inhabit recognizable worlds.
When it comes to British film, you have to pick the genre that interests
you. Over the past 30 years or so, television imports from the BBC have
appeared on Masterpiece Theatre, Mystery!, and cable channels in the
United States, and they’ve won legions of fans. Many of these popular
series, from Upstairs, Downstairs and The Forsythe Saga to Absolutely
Fabulous and Queer as Folk, are available on DVD. Masterpiece Theatre
has also shown outstanding historical dramas such as Elizabeth R, with
Glenda Jackson playing Queen Elizabeth I, and The Six Wives of Henry
VIII. In addition, you can find filmed-for-television BBC versions of all the
Shakespeare plays. Your library may have some of these versions on
DVD or video.
If you’re looking for sweeping historic epics filmed for the big screen,
check out Anne of the Thousand Days (with Genevieve Bujold and
Richard Burton), Mary Queen of Scots (with Vanessa Redgrave), A Man
for All Seasons (with Paul Scofield), Lady Jane (with Helena Bonham
Carter), and Becket (with Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole). The recent
Ladies in Lavender with Maggie Smith and Judi Dench was filmed in
Cornwall. Judi Dench played Queen Victoria in the delightful Mrs. Brown,
and Cate Blanchett was a memorable Elizabeth I in Elizabeth. Other
period costume films that I recommend include Women in Love, A Room
with a View, Howard’s End, and the film/TV versions of Jane Austen’s
Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion. Charlotte
Brontë’s Jane Eyre has been adapted several times, starting with the
Laurence Olivier/Merle Oberon Hollywood version of 1939. And don’t
forget that the Harry Potter movies are filmed in England.
For a look at contemporary England, some of the following movies may
appeal to you: Calendar Girls, The Full Monty, Billy Elliott, Closer, Notes on
a Scandal, and The Queen.

S
o when and where do you want to go in England? This chapter tells
you the highlights of each region, and gives you a rundown on the
seasons and the country’s main events so that you can determine the
best destinations and time of year for your visit.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
England For Dummies, 4th Edition, is a selective book, geared to savvy
travelers who want to know more about England’s leading sights. I don’t
cover every city, county, and region — I focus on only the country’s
essential highlights. I want this book to introduce you to the best cities,
castles, cathedrals, gardens, and countryside that England has to offer.
(Wales and Scotland, although part of the United Kingdom, aren’t included
in this book.) To help figure out which regions to visit during your trip,
check out the following thumbnail sketches. For locations, see “The
Regions in Brief” map on p. 27.
Looking at London: From Buckingham 
Palace to the British Museum
The Romans founded London, the capital of the United Kingdom, 2,000
years ago. Today, London is the largest, fastest, and most important city
in England. Over the centuries, this seat of power has accrued an unri-
valed collection of treasures, from historic cathedrals and royal palaces
to matchless museums and parks. London’s top sights include the British
Museum, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey,

the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the National Gallery,
the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Modern, the Victoria & Albert
Museum, the Natural History Museum, Kensington Palace, and
Kensington Gardens. (See Chapters 11 and 12 for details on all these
attractions.)
London can easily consume all your time, but you can make many easy
day trips from the city. In less than an hour, you can reach Hampton
Court Palace, Windsor Palace, Kew Gardens, Greenwich (site of the
Prime Meridian, the line from which the world measures longitude), and
the ancient college towns of Cambridge and Oxford. Close to Oxford,
you can find another exciting destination, Blenheim Palace, one of the
greatest country estates in England. All these day trips are covered in
Chapter 13.
London offers all the delights of a great international city. It has more
than its share of revered monuments and historic sites, but it’s not a city
that dozes in the past. London is both traditional and trendsetting. It’s a
crowded, fast-paced, multiethnic metropolis. If you love art, culture, and
people-watching, you’ll love London.
Exploring Southeast England: Canterbury, 
castles, and historic towns
East and Southeast England include the counties of Kent and Sussex
(see Chapter 14), with their abundance of fascinating castles, famous
gardens, and picturesque towns. Canterbury, in Kent, is one of the most
historic cathedral towns in England. Tourists have been visiting
Canterbury’s magnificent cathedral since before Chaucer wrote The
Canterbury Tales more than 600 years ago.
Many people want to visit the Kentish coastal town of Dover to see the
famous white cliffs. To be honest with you, you probably don’t want to
make Dover a special destination. Dover Castle, with its 1,000 years of
history (the castle was in use right through World War II), is well worth
visiting, but the town of Dover contains little else of interest.
Rye is a Sussex town whose charms are irresistible. More historic build-
ings (the earliest dates to 1250) line the cobblestone streets and time-
warped lanes than in any other town in England. With its fine restaurants
and cozy inns, Rye makes a good base for further exploration of this area
along the Channel coast. If the date 1066 means anything to you, you
may want to visit nearby Battle, where William the Conqueror defeated
King Harold at the Battle of Hastings and thus gained control of England.
Walk around the famous battlefield and explore the ruins of the abbey
William erected to commemorate his victory. You can’t get much closer
to English history than that!
Brighton is a popular resort town on the south coast, within commuting
distance to London (the town makes for an easy day trip). Brighton has

been a seaside destination since the early 19th century, when the prince
regent built the remarkable Royal Pavilion, now the town’s major tourist
attraction. With its long beach, amusement pier, promenades, and late-
night club scene, Brighton remains a favorite weekend getaway spot.
In addition to the preceding towns, I devote a chapter to the castles,
stately homes, and magnificent gardens of Kent (see Chapter 15), which
are all special places that you can visit as day trips from London or as
part of a car tour. The American Astor family purchased, restored, and
lived in Hever Castle, the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, second wife
of Henry VIII. Knole, with 365 rooms and many of its original Elizabethan
furnishings, is the largest and one of the most splendid country homes
in England. Knole was the birthplace of Vita Sackville-West, who later
created, with her husband, Harold Nicholson, the world-famous gardens
at Sissinghurst, now a place of pilgrimage for garden lovers from around
the world. Kings and queens who spent time at Leeds Castle, built more
than 900 years ago, added to the moated castle over the centuries.
Sightseeing at Stonehenge and in the West Country:
Hampshire, Wiltshire, Devon, and Cornwall
Part V of this book, which focuses on the West Country, fills you in on
the feast of sightseeing possibilities in the adjoining counties of Hampshire
and Wiltshire (see Chapter 16), Devon (see Chapter 17), and Cornwall
(see Chapter 18). Winchester, in Hampshire, is a graceful town with an
amazing history (in Anglo-Saxon days, it was more important than
London) and a wonderful cathedral. Jane Austen, who penned the 
“Eng Lit” hits Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, is buried in
Winchester Cathedral; you can also visit her modest home in nearby
Chawton. Bare, brooding Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, west of Hampshire,
is the setting for Stonehenge, the stone circle that’s one of the world’s
most famous ancient monuments. A few miles from this Neolithic wonder
is Salisbury. The soaring spires of its Gothic cathedral dominate this
busy country town.
Thrusting out into the Atlantic, Devon and Cornwall occupy the south-
westernmost corner of England. The cathedral town of Exeter is a good
starting place for a tour of these two counties surrounded by the sea.
Dartmoor National Park lies a few miles west of Exeter. If you want to
explore this open, treeless moorland with its gray stone fences and
tunnel-like lanes winding beneath tall hedgerows, the area around
Chagford is a good place to stay. Devon’s southern coastline boasts
sandy beaches and comfortable, old-fashioned resort towns, such as
Torquay, clustered in a mild-weather zone called the English Riviera. Many
people want to visit Plymouth because in 1620, the Pilgrims set sail from
Plymouth for the New World, but after you see the Mayflower Steps (the
departure point for the Pilgrims), not much else can spark your interest.
Thousands of years ago, Cornwall was a Celtic land known for its tin mines,
and ancient mysteries still cling to its rocky coastline. The brooding
Part I: Introducing England 
28

ruins of Tintagel, a sixth-century seaside castle, have long been associ-
ated with the mysterious legends of King Arthur. You can find the remains
of a Stone Age village, as well as cromlechs, or standing stones, in the
vicinity of St. Ives, a beautiful Cornish seaside town that became famous
as an artists’ colony. South of St. Ives, overlooking the island castle of 
St. Michael’s Mount on Mount’s Bay, is the bustling market town of
Penzance. A five-hour train ride from London, Penzance is the last sta-
tion before windy Land’s End, where you can walk along the headlands
that face the Atlantic. You can best explore the Land’s End Peninsula,
with its tiny, stone-built fishing villages, such as Mousehole (pronounced
Muz-zle) and the lovely town of Fowey (pronounced Foy) farther along
the coastline to the east, by car. Another intriguing spot to visit is the 
village of Clovelly, whose one main street from clifftop to harbor is so
steep that only donkeys can lug provisions up and down. House and
garden lovers will find a rich and fascinating bevy of stately homes and
magnificent gardens to visit in Cornwall and Devon: Trengwainton,
Lanhydrock, the Eden Project, Cotehele, and Castle Drogo, the last
castle (completed in 1930) to be built in England.
Discovering England’s heartland: Stratford-upon-
Avon, the Cotswolds, and Bath
William Shakespeare, whose plays still enchant, grip, amuse, and move
audiences 400 years after his death, was born in Stratford-upon-Avon
(see Chapter 19), a small Warwickshire village. This town, located in 
central England, only 90 minutes northwest of London by train, is one 
of England’s top tourist destinations. If you’re a Shakespeare fan, you
can easily spend a day visiting the various shrines. Consider staying
overnight if you want to see a play performed by the Royal Shakespeare
Company. From Stratford, local train service runs to Warwick, whose 
top attraction is mighty Warwick Castle (see Chapter 19). Behind its
thick stone ramparts, this imposing hilltop fortress features beautiful
Victorian-era living rooms (with wax figures by the artisans at Madame
Tussauds), a creepy dungeon, and beautifully landscaped grounds.
The Cotswolds (see Chapter 20) is a mostly rural area of bare rolling
hills, river valleys, and woodlands south of Stratford-upon-Avon and
west of Oxford. The region is known for its small, beautiful villages built
of honey-colored stone during the prosperous years of the medieval
wool trade. Although they have inevitably lost some of their soul to the
flourishing tourist trade that now supports them, you may still want to
pay Cotswold villages, such as Broadway, Chipping Campden, Bourton-
on-the-Water, and Cirencester, a visit. Tour the villages by car because
public transportation to the small villages is spotty. In these villages,
you can shop for hours (the Cotswolds has more antiques shops than
anywhere else in England) and then relax in an old-fashioned tea shop
for an afternoon cream tea. Hidcote Manor, one of the greatest of English
gardens, is a must for flower lovers visiting this region of England. You
may want to make Cheltenham, a lively county town laid out as a spa 
in the early 19th century, your headquarters in the Cotswolds. You can
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 29

also visit beautiful Bath, the queen of spa towns and a picture of Regency
elegance. Located at the southern edge of the Cotswolds, Bath, with its
superb Georgian terraces and renowned Roman Baths Museum, deserves
at least a full day. Wells, England’s smallest cathedral city, and one of its
most beautiful, is an easy day trip from Bath.
Heading north: Yorkshire and the Lake District
Northern England has a different character (and a different accent)
from softer, greener southern England. The North is where you find the
walled city of York (see Chapter 21), with its Viking heritage, medieval
buildings, and glorious cathedral — the largest Gothic cathedral in
Europe. Crammed with museums, restaurants, and plenty to do day and
night, York is an excellent headquarters for exploring England’s northern
climes. With a car, you can make the easy drive to North York Moors
National Park and Yorkshire Dales National Park, two areas of haunting
beauty where the heather-covered moors and winding river valleys draw
walkers and nature lovers. Emily Brontë’s novel Wuthering Heights or
Charlotte Brontë’s equally beloved Jane Eyre may have formed your
images of bleak, windswept Yorkshire moors. The Brontë homestead in
the village of Haworth is a place of literary pilgrimage year-round. East
of York, in a vast, landscaped park, sits the greatest country house in
Yorkshire: Castle Howard. The television series Brideshead Revisited
used this castle for filming, and visitors can explore its ornate rooms
and gardens year-round. Scarborough, on the Yorkshire coast, is a fun-
loving seaside resort with a wide, curving beach and plenty of gaudy
seaside arcades. You can easily get from Scarborough to Whitby, a
small, attractive fishing village.
Cumbria, the northern county west of Yorkshire, offers some of the
most beautiful and dramatic countryside in England. Here, you find high,
bare hills (or small, bare mountains, if you prefer), numerous lakes, and
villages nestled in the unspoiled countryside that characterizes the Lake
District (see Chapter 22), a national park area. Bowness, one of the
region’s resort centers, sits on 16km-long (10-mile) Lake Windemere,
the largest lake in England. Literature lovers associate the Lake District
with the poet William Wordsworth, whose homes in Grasmere and
Rydal you can visit, and with Beatrix Potter, the author and illustrator of
children’s classics such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Potter’s home in
Near Sawrey, on the north side of Lake Windemere, is open to the
public. Hawkshead, a short distance away, is a charming village con-
structed of the distinctive gray Lakeland stone. Keswick, a few miles
north, is a large, important county town on the shores of Derwentwater.
Like the rest of the Lake District, Derwentwater buzzes with visitors
from Easter to October.
Scheduling Your Time
If you’re flying into England, you have your choice of two major cities:
London and Manchester. Four airports serve London; the majority of
Part I: Introducing England 
30

international flights arrive at Heathrow or Gatwick. From either airport,
you can easily reach London and every other part of England by train.
(Both airports also have car-rental facilities.) Here are some travel times
from London to other parts of England:
 From London, you can reach the northern city of York by fast train
in about two hours. Driving takes twice as long.
 The trip from London to Penzance in southwesterly Cornwall takes
about seven hours by fast train, closer to nine hours if you drive.
 By train, you can get to Oxenholme, in England’s northwesterly
Lake District, from London in about five hours; driving takes at
least eight hours.
 You can make places like Bath, Canterbury, Oxford, Winchester,
and Stratford-upon-Avon an easy day trip from London, none of
them more than two hours away by fast train.
If you want to explore the Lake District, Yorkshire, or the Cotswolds —
areas in northern and northwestern England — you may want to avoid
the congestion of London’s airports and fly into Manchester (only a few
airlines offer this option from the U.S., however). The Manchester air-
port connects to the country’s rail network, so you can hop on a train at
the airport and be on your way to any place in England.
On average, each of England’s top attractions takes about two hours 
to visit, after you’re actually there and inside. Some, such as the Tower
of London or Warwick Castle, take more time, but others, such as
Westminster Abbey, take less. A local museum outside London may take
as little as 15 to 30 minutes to visit. But other variables enter in: whether
you’re taking a guided tour (usually about 60–90 minutes, no matter
where) and if crowds make lines move slowly. Another variable is the dif-
ficulty of allotting a certain amount of time to a great institution, such as
the British Museum, which is loaded with so many treasures you can
easily spend a full day or more there, or to a great English garden that
beguiles you into dawdling.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
How do you decide what time of year to travel to England? This section
presents the pros and cons of each season so that you can choose the
best time for your visit.
Traveling during high and low seasons
Roughly speaking, the high season for travel in England lasts from Easter
to the end of September. The country gets the most crowded and the
prices go sky-high during the peak summer months of June, July, and
August. October to Easter make up the low season, when tourism dwin-
dles, prices drop, and attractions shorten their open hours.
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 31

Part I: Introducing England 
32
During your trip, you probably want to visit London, a destination on
almost every English itinerary. London is popular year-round. In fact,
London is one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations.
In the winter months, generally from October through March, castles,
museums, and tourist offices outside London have shorter hours and
may close certain days of the week. Hours and open days increase
during the crowded months of June, July, and August. During the
summer tourist season in popular cities like Cambridge or York, you 
can choose among three daily walking tours rather than the one that’s
offered in the winter. If you’re a garden lover, time your visit to fall
between Easter and September — peak tourist months, but also peak
garden months. You can visit most castles and palaces year-round, but
in summer, when lines are longest, you may find yourself waiting to get
in and feeling rushed after you do. Long-distance train and bus sched-
ules don’t change much between winter and summer. However, local
public transportation options in outlying regions, such as the Lake
District or the Cotswolds, are curtailed during the less touristy months.
Watching those unpredictable skies
England’s weather is what you might call “changeable.” Except in the
most general terms, you can have real problems predicting just what the
weather will be like in any given season. Remember that England is part of
an island, and the surrounding seas, as well as its northerly location, deter-
mine its weather patterns. In general, however, London and the south of
England remain fairly mild year-round, rarely dipping below freezing or
rising above 80°F (27°C) (at least for extended periods). Table 3-1 gives you
an idea of London’s temperature and rainfall variations. But don’t rely on
these figures too much: In 2001, London and the rest of England experi-
enced the coldest and wettest winter and spring since written records origi-
nated in 1659. But in 2007, London and southern England experienced the
warmest spring on record. And every August from 2003 to 2007, the mer-
cury has soared to the mid-90s for several days and even reached 100°F
(38°C). Summer 2007 also saw heavy rains and flooding in parts of England.

Wherever you end up in England, you may find the weather drizzly, brisk
and windy, still and muggy, dry and hot, clammy, or even glorious. Some
days, you get a combination. But whatever the weather, whatever the
season, England is well worth visiting.

Spring comes earliest to Cornwall and Devon in the southwest, where
camellias, azaleas, and rhododendrons start to bloom in March. North-
ern counties, such as Yorkshire and Cumbria, take longer to warm up.
Anyone who’s spent a winter’s day trying to enjoy a walk on the wind-
swept moors of Yorkshire can tell you to postpone a walking tour there
until spring is well advanced or summer has arrived. The Lake District in
Cumbria tends to be rainy year-round, so expect sudden squalls even in
summer.
Blooming in spring
England is at its greenest, freshest, blooming best in April and May.
Highlights of the season include the following:
 The great English parks and gardens, such as Sissinghurst in Kent
or Hidcote Manor in Gloucestershire, are at their peak of lushness.
Bright yellow fields of rape (a European plant in the mustard
family) brighten the countryside. Daffodils blooming along the
lovely River Cam in Cambridge and throughout the Lake District
form an unforgettable image of an English spring.
 In London, the Chelsea Flower Show is the quintessential spring
event.
 Airfares are lower than in summer.
 The sky stays light well into the evening.
But keep in mind these springtime pitfalls:
 During the half-term school holidays in late February and for three
weeks around Easter, visitors pour into London. As a result, the
major attractions have longer lines (queues in Britspeak), and hotel
rooms may be harder to find. During Easter week, towns and major
attractions outside London get crowded as well.
 The weather is even more unpredictable than usual.
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 33
Weather patterns
According to 18th-century writer Dr. Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), “When two
Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather.” Things haven’t changed much since
then. The unpredictability of the English climate has led to another sound British
maxim: There is no such thing as bad weather — only inappropriate clothing. For an
Englishman (and woman), appropriate foul-weather gear includes a mac (short for
mackintosh, a raincoat), a brolly (umbrella), and Wellingtons (rubber boots).

 Public transportation throughout England is reduced during holi-
day periods.
 Many museums, stores, and restaurants close on Good Friday,
Easter, and Easter Monday.
Shining (and raining) in summer
Notoriously chilly England becomes irresistible under the sun. Unfortu-
nately, many tourists flock to England to enjoy the fine weather, which
can often turn into rain in July and August. The crowds descend to enjoy
the following:
 Everyone moves outdoors to take advantage of the fine weather
with alfresco theaters, concerts, and festivals. Tables sit outside
cafes, pubs, and restaurants all over the country.
 Roses and colorful plants bloom in the great English gardens and in
front of small cottages.
 Summer evenings are deliciously long and often cool, even if the
day has been hot.
 The evening stays light past 10 p.m.
But keep in mind:
 July and August have the highest amount of rainfall for the year in
London and the midsection of England, so skies can stay gray and
cloudy.
 Summer heat waves can drive the mercury into the 80s and even
90s, making July and August hot and muggy. Many businesses and
budget-class hotels in London don’t have air-conditioning.
 Most overseas visitors converge on London and the rest of England
from July to September. Lines for major attractions can be inter-
minably long.
 Hotels are more difficult to come by, especially on weekends, and
high-season rates apply.
 Vacationers pack the beach resorts along the southern coast and
up into Yorkshire.
 Roads in the beautiful Lake District, which receives millions of visi-
tors annually, are clogged in July and August.
Glowing in autumn
Autumn’s golden glow casts a lovely spell over England. This is my
favorite time of year here, and I can think of only one disadvantage to
counteract the many advantages:
Part I: Introducing England 
34

 In Kent, apples and pears ripen in the orchards, and roadside stands
sell fresh produce. Country farms harvest hay. Falling leaves skitter
down ancient streets and through town squares, and the heather
and bracken (a type of fern) on the moors and hillsides turn russet
and gold. There’s a crispness is in the air, and the setting sun gives
old stone buildings and church spires a mellow patina.
 After mid-September, you have fewer tourists to contend with, so
everything feels less crowded, and you may encounter more
natives than visitors.
 With the drop in tourism, hotel rates and airfares may go down 
as well.
 London’s cultural calendar springs to life in the fall.
 Although you may experience rain at this time of year, you’re just
as likely to encounter what Americans call “Indian summer.”
But autumn has one drawback: Like every season in England, autumn
can bring rain.
Welcoming in winter
The English love being cozy, and English winters provide the perfect
time for coziness. Although most overseas visitors to London arrive in
July and August, the highest number of visitors from within the United
Kingdom come to London between January and March. What do they
know that you should know? Consider the points that make winter 
wonderful:
 The season has a cozy feeling. Country inns welcome guests with
crackling fires in ancient stone fireplaces. Game appears on restau-
rant menus. A sprinkling of snow gives a sparkling new charm to
parks, cathedrals, gardens, and old towns.
 London and the rest of England become a bargain in winter.
Businesses consider the country’s off season to run November 1 
to December 12 and December 25 to March 14. Winter off-season
rates for airfares and hotels can sometimes be astonishingly low —
airline package deals don’t get any cheaper (see Chapter 6). At
these times, hotel prices in London and throughout England can
drop by as much as 20 percent.
 Although the winter winds may blow, nothing in London stops — 
in fact, everything gets busier. The arts — theater, opera, concerts,
and gallery shows — stay in full swing.
 London and many other cities and towns throughout England
develop a lovely buzz during the Christmas season: The stores
decorate; lights glow; carolers sing; entertainers perform special
holiday pantomimes; and in London, the giant Norwegian spruce
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 35

goes up in Trafalgar Square. On Christmas Day, the boys’ choir of
King’s College Chapel in Cambridge performs the Festival of Nine
Lessons and Carols, a traditional Christmas service with music 
that broadcasts throughout the world.
Naturally, winter has its downside:
 Although the yuletide holidays are always jolly, they also add up 
to another peak London tourist season from mid-December to
Christmas. You know what that means: bigger crowds and higher
prices.
 The entire country virtually shuts down on December 25 and 
26 and January 1. Stores, museums, and other attractions close,
and public transportation is severely curtailed. On December 26
(Boxing Day, so called because in Victorian times, service workers,
such as postmen, received gift boxes on this day), you can have a
hard time finding any open restaurants.
 Wintertime England may be gray and wet for weeks on end; in mid-
winter, the skies get dark by about 3:30 p.m. The English usually
keep their thermostats set rather low (about 10° F lower than most
Americans). Rather than turn up the heat, the English don their
woollies (long underwear). You should do the same — or prepare
for a chronic case of goose pimples.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
England hums with festivals and special events of all kinds, some hark-
ing back to centuries past. If London is going to take up all or part of
your trip, write or call VisitBritain, the country’s official tourist agency
(see the Appendix at the back of this book for the address and phone
number), and request a copy of its monthly London Planner, which lists
major events, including theater and the performing arts. Do this at least
a month before your departure date. The VisitBritain Web site (www.
visitbritain.com) is another good resource for checking England-
wide events and dates before you go.
For recorded information on weekly London events while in London, 
call VisitBritain’s 24-hour London Line at % 0870/1-LONDON; calls cost
60p ($1.25) per minute. You can’t call the London line from outside the
United Kingdom. To find out what’s going on while you’re traveling
throughout the rest of England, stop in at the tourist information cen-
ters. (I list street addresses, phone numbers, and Web addresses of
these centers throughout this guide and in the Appendix.) You may just
happen upon some unique local event.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Five Great Options
In This Chapter
 Seeing England’s top attractions in one or two weeks
 Visiting England with kids
 Hitting the highlights for garden lovers and history buffs
E
very visitor to England faces the same questions: How can you see
as much as possible in a limited amount of time? How can you sort
out what’s really worth seeing and fit those attractions into a realistic
itinerary? This chapter provides the answers. If you budget your time
wisely and choose your sights carefully, you can enjoy a satisfying and
manageable trip from beginning to end.
The secret to any “successful” trip is to be well organized yet flexible. If
you travel by train in England, for example, you need to be aware of train
schedules. Always call the train information number that I provide (see
Chapter 7) and get exact departure times. But don’t pack your schedule
so tightly that a late train ruins your day. Even with limited time, you can
see more if you organize your days efficiently and use common sense.
Don’t assume, for example, that every museum or sight is open every
day, all day. Take a moment to look at the details for each attraction that
interests you.
This chapter offers five itineraries for people with limited time or special
interests. The daily itineraries are common-sense, limited-time sugges-
tions only. Maybe you prefer to spend all day in the British Museum
rather than the couple of hours that I suggest. Maybe shopping and cafe-
hopping in York appeals to you more than visiting York Minster. Or you
really just want to get outdoors and go walking in the Lake District.
Whatever your preference, go for it! You can enjoy England in countless
ways, depending on your own individual interests. See Chapters 1 and 2
for some preliminary information on the best that England has to offer.

Seeing England’s Highlights in One Week
Spend at least three days of a weeklong trip to England in London. You
may, in fact, want to stay in London for the entire week, making easy 
day trips from the city and returning to your hotel at night (that’s the
premise I use in this itinerary). This saves you the wear and tear of lug-
ging your baggage around. Plus you can often get special rates for a
weeklong stay.
To maximize your sightseeing time, try to book flights that arrive in the
morning and depart in the evening.
To avoid wasting time in lines (queues in Britspeak), try to hit the top
London sights early in the day, preferably right when they open or late
in the afternoon. I mean in particular Buckingham Palace (when it’s open
to the public during Aug and Sept), the Tower of London, Westminster
Abbey, and Madame Tussauds wax museum. Westminster Abbey, to cite
just one example, can receive more than 15,000 visitors a day!
For information on all the London attractions mentioned in this itiner-
ary, see Chapter 12 unless noted otherwise.
Spend part of Day One settling into your London hotel, getting your
bearings, and fighting jet lag. Don’t make it a big day, but make walking
part of your itinerary. Walking gets you into the swing of London and
helps your body adjust to the new time. Start your trip with a visit to
majestic Westminster Abbey, visiting the Royal Tombs and Poets’
Corner. Afterward, because they’re right next door, stroll around Big Ben
and the Houses of Parliament. Unless you queue up to hear a debate or
come in August when Parliament offers guided tours, you can’t get
inside, but you get a great riverside view from Westminster Bridge. On
the opposite side of the Thames sits the British Airways London Eye, a
450-foot-high observation wheel. Reserve in advance for the trip up and
over London; otherwise, you may spend at least a half-hour waiting in
line for a ticket and another hour before your scheduled ride. You’re not
far from the Tate Modern, so if you’re in the mood to look at modern art,
walk along the Thames to London’s newest museum (open until 6 p.m.
Mon–Thurs, until 10 p.m. Fri and Sat). If you’d rather look at 18th- and
19th-century masterpieces of British painting, head over to Tate Britain
in Pimlico instead. Have dinner in the Covent Garden area or on the
Thames (see the listing for R.S. Hispaniola, passenger boat turned quaint
restaurant, in Chapter 11).
Greet Day Two with a walk through Green Park. You’re on your way to
Buckingham Palace to witness the pageantry of the Changing of the
Guard (check beforehand to make certain it’s taking place that day). For
details on touring Buckingham Palace’s State Rooms during August and
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 43

September, see Chapter 12. Reserving tickets so that you know your spe-
cific entry time is a good idea; otherwise, you may have to wait in line
for an hour or more to get in. If you don’t tour the palace itself, visit the
Royal Mews (the stables that surround the palace) or the newly reno-
vated Queen’s Gallery. From Buckingham Palace, you can stroll down
The Mall, through St. James’s Park, passing Clarence House, the home
of the Queen Mother until 2002 and now the official London residence of
the Prince of Wales, and St. James’s Palace.
Next, stop at Trafalgar Square, London’s grandest and certainly most
famous plaza. You can have lunch or tea at the National Gallery’s restau-
rant or in the restaurant in the crypt of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church 
on the square’s east side. Spend your afternoon viewing the National
Gallery’s treasures. Renting one of the self-guided audio tours helps you
to home in on the collection’s most important paintings. You can instead
spend your afternoon in the National Portrait Gallery, next door to the
National Gallery. The fascinating portrait gallery offers a concise but
comprehensive display of famous Brits, from the Tudors to the Spice
Girls. If you haven’t already reserved a seat for a West End show, you
may want to stop by the half-price-ticket booth in nearby Leicester
Square to see what’s available. Have dinner in Soho before the show
(see Chapter 11 for my restaurant recommendations).
On Day Three, arrive as early as you can at the Tower of London, and
immediately hook up with one of the one-hour tours led by the Beefeaters,
the tower guides in the distinctive red coats. Later, you can explore the
precincts on your own, making certain that you allot enough time to 
see the Crown Jewels. From the Tower, head over to nearby St. Paul’s
Cathedral, which you can see in about a half-hour if you’re not on a tour.
The British Museum, your next stop, has enough to keep you occupied
for several days; if you want to see only the highlights, allow yourself a
minimum of two hours. Later in the afternoon, explore Piccadilly Circus,
the teeming epicenter of London’s West End. Regent Street, Piccadilly,
and Jermyn Street offer great shopping.
On Day Four, hop on a train from Waterloo Station, and make the half-
hour trip to Hampton Court Palace. Or, for a much longer but far more
scenic alternative, take a boat. Boats usually depart Westminster Pier at
10 a.m. from April to September for the four-hour journey to the palace;
you can also take the train there and the boat back. Give yourself a mini-
mum of three unhurried hours at Hampton Court. Touring the various
staterooms and apartments with an audio guide can give you a good 
historical perspective. The gardens can easily take up an hour. Have
lunch or tea on the premises, and be back in London in plenty of time 
for dinner and a show. (For information on Hampton Court Palace, see
Chapter 13.)
On Day Five, take an early train from King’s Cross Station, and head up
north to Yorkshire, where you can spend the day in the walled city of
York. The train trip takes two hours, making York a relatively easy day
Part I: Introducing England 
44

trip from London. Or you may want to stay overnight. For an overview 
of York, considered northern England’s most beautiful city, hook up with
a guided walking or bus tour — several options exist. Give yourself at
least an hour to visit spectacular York Minster, the largest Gothic church
in northern Europe. The stained glass is marvelous, and a fascinating
museum lies beneath the church, where excavations have revealed
Roman-era buildings. Two other attractions in York are definitely worth
seeing: The National Railway Museum has royal train cars used by
Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II, and the Jorvik Viking Centre
lets you time-travel back to York in the Viking era. Set aside some time
for wandering down York’s winding medieval lanes. You may also want
to walk along the circuit of amazingly preserved medieval walls. (For
details on visiting York, see Chapter 21.)
For Day Six, take your pick: Cambridge (trains from King’s Cross) or
Oxford (trains from Paddington Station) are both easy-to-reach destina-
tions for day trips from London. If you spent the night in York, you can
take the train to either destination from there. Oxford and Cambridge
are fascinating university towns with medieval colleges built around
quadrangles. (See Chapter 13 for more details on both cities.)
If you opt for Oxford, sign up for the two-hour walking tour that leaves at
11 a.m. and 1 p.m. from the Oxford Information Centre. This tour is the
best way to gain an overall perspective on the town and get into some of
the major colleges, which you may not otherwise get access to. Later,
you can spend an hour in the Ashmolean Museum, famed for its antiqui-
ties, coins, and porcelain and painting collections.
You can also take a two-hour walking tour in Cambridge, or you may
prefer the open-top bus tour. You have to see King’s College Chapel,
one of the most beautiful churches in England, in Cambridge; hearing
the famous boys’ choir sing Evensong (an evening church service in
which part of the liturgy is sung) is an unforgettable experience. Set
aside an hour to tour the Fitzwilliam Museum; its fine and varied col-
lection includes Egyptian, Greek, and Roman antiquities, and some modern
British paintings. “The Backs” — so named because some of the colleges
back onto the River Cam — is a beautiful place for strolling. If you feel
adventurous, you can rent a punt (small boat) and pole yourself down
the Cam; you can also pay to have someone do the punting for you.
Day Seven is your last day in London. Ideally, you booked your return
flight for the evening, so you can have at least a few morning hours for
more sightseeing, shopping, or both. Checkout time is probably no later
than noon, so ask the hotel front desk if the hotel can store your lug-
gage. If you haven’t made it to Harrods department store yet, do that
first, or check out the other shopping options in Knightsbridge. Instead
of shopping, you may want to squeeze in one last museum. Several
major South Kensington museums aren’t far from Harrods, including the
Natural History Museum, with its famous dinosaur exhibits, and the
Victoria & Albert Museum, renowned for its superlative art and design
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 45

collections. Instead of visiting a museum, you can visit Kensington Palace
in Kensington Gardens, but allow yourself at least two hours if you do
so. Following your morning activities, grab a quick lunch or snack and
then make your way to the airport to catch your plane. (See Chapter 11
for detailed information on getting to and from London airports.)
Touring the Best of England in Two Weeks
Lucky you — with two weeks, you can explore so much more of the
country!
For the first week, follow the itinerary in the previous section, “Seeing
England’s Highlights in One Week.” But because you don’t have a plane
to catch, Day Seven for you begins at the National Portrait Gallery, if
you haven’t visited it yet. From the portrait gallery, you can easily walk
to Covent Garden Market, where you find scores of interesting shops.
Covent Garden Piazza, a perfect spot for lunch, is a lively hub filled with
restaurants. Alternatively, spend your seventh morning in one of the
famous South Kensington museums, such as the Natural History Museum
or the Victoria & Albert Museum. From there, you can easily stroll to
Kensington Gardens and visit Kensington Palace, the former home of
Princess Diana. In the evening, go for a traditional English dinner at
Rules, London’s oldest restaurant, or Simpson’s-in-the-Strand. Other
options for the evening include a play or concert, or maybe a stop in a
couple of good pubs. (See Chapter 11 for information on restaurants and
Chapter 12 for attractions and nightlife.)
On Day Eight, hop a train from Paddington Station to Exeter, in Devon.
In Exeter, you can rent a car and drive into nearby Dartmoor National
Park and other parts of the West Country. (Renting a car in Exeter makes
more sense than renting one in London.) Chagford is a good place to
stay overnight. Before you leave Exeter, though, give yourself an hour to
explore beautiful Exeter Cathedral. If you don’t want to rent a car, you
can explore the town on foot and continue by train to Penzance or St. Ives
in Cornwall. (See Chapter 17 for information on Exeter and Chagford.)
Devote Day Nine to Cornwall, the southwestern tip of England. From
Exeter or Chagford, make the fairly short drive to Penzance, where you
need at least two hours to visit the fabulous island castle of St. Michael’s
Mount. If you have a car, you can easily drive from Penzance to Land’s
End, stopping at the picturesque fishing village of Mousehole on the
way. Don’t waste your time with the theme-park attractions at Land’s
End; go for the stupendous views westward out over the Atlantic and
then head on to St. Ives. If you’re without a car, skip Land’s End, and take
the train from Penzance to St. Ives, an artists’ colony that’s become a
seaside resort town. Loaded with charm, good restaurants, and hotels,
St. Ives makes a good place to stay overnight. The town’s big draw is Tate
St. Ives, a museum that exhibits artists who live and work in Cornwall.
Part I: Introducing England 
46

More interesting is the Barbara Hepworth Museum and sculpture garden,
located in and around the great sculptor’s former studio. On a beautiful
summer evening, when the sun lingers late in the sky, you may want to
drive (if you have a car) to Chysauster, a prehistoric site near St. Ives. 
(I describe Cornwall, including Penzance, Land’s End, and St. Ives, in
Chapter 18.)
From St. Ives or Penzance, you can reach Bath on Day Ten in about four
hours by car or train (depending on connections); you may want to
spend the night there. Bath is a wonderfully walkable city, filled with out-
standing examples of Regency-era architecture, including the Royal
Crescent and the Pump Room, a charming place to have your afternoon
tea. Set aside at least two hours for the wonderful Roman Baths
Museum. (Check out Chapter 20 for Bath’s many attractions.)
You need a car for Day Eleven’s tour of the nearby Cotswolds. (If you’ve
been traveling by train until now, you can rent a car in Bath.) You can
visit several lovely villages, all built of mellow, honey-colored Cotswold
stone. Broadway and Bourton-on-the-Water no longer depend on the
wool trade, as they did in the Middle Ages, but now depend on visitors
who come to stroll, shop, and have cream teas. Near Broadway, you can
find Hidcote Manor, one of England’s great gardens. If you’re a garden
lover, don’t miss it; plan on spending at least two hours here. Overnight
in Cheltenham, a small but lively spa town, or Cirencester, a beautiful
Cotswolds market town with a noteworthy church and the Corinium
Museum, full of Roman mosaics and artifacts from the area. Both towns
are full of good restaurants; Cheltenham, because it’s larger, has more
and better hotels. (See Chapter 20 for information on the Cotswolds.)
From Cheltenham or Cirencester, on Day Twelve, drive (or take the train)
northeast to Stratford-upon-Avon, a good place to spend the night. The
trip takes about two hours. In Stratford, you want to spend at least three
hours visiting the Shakespeare sites. If you’re a theater lover, see a pro-
duction at one of the Royal Shakespeare Festival theaters. You want to
reserve tickets in advance if you can; if you don’t, head directly for the
box office before doing anything else. In the afternoon, you may want to
drive or take the local train from Stratford to nearby Warwick Castle.
The castle, nearly 1,000 years old, is one of England’s premier tourist
attractions and can easily keep you occupied for several hours. (For
details on Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Castle, see Chapter 19.)
From Stratford, on Day Thirteen, drive south to Stonehenge, a few miles
outside Salisbury. If you don’t have a car, take the train to Salisbury, and
hop on a local bus to Stonehenge. This great stone circle, believed to be
about 5,000 years old, is the most famous prehistoric site in England.
Afterward, take a couple of hours to wander through Salisbury, with its
magnificent Gothic cathedral. You can spend the night in Salisbury, or
you may want to head back to London. (See Chapter 16 for details on
Salisbury and Stonehenge.)
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 47

On Day Fourteen, return your rental car, and get to the airport. You may
be able to return your car in Salisbury, even if you rented it in Exeter. If
you can, I recommend returning your car in Salisbury and taking a train
(a 90-min. trip) back to London. Otherwise, find out whether you can
drop the car directly at Heathrow or Gatwick, the most likely departure
points for your flight. From Salisbury, just to be on the safe side, give
yourself at least three hours to drive back to London.
Discovering England with Kids
So you want to spend five days in England and bring along your kids? No
problem. Perhaps this trip will be your kids’ introduction to the country
or their first experience of any foreign country. You may know what you
want to see, but where do you take them? I have a few suggestions to
keep both you and your kids excited and entertained.
Much, of course, depends on your children’s ages and their interests.
Activities that toddlers and preteens find enthralling probably bore
teens out of their minds.
Try to get their interest up before you buckle your seat belts for the
transatlantic flight. A visit to your local library can give you some real
treasures in this regard: children’s books set in England (the Harry
Potter series), children’s travel books with maps, and even travel videos
that the whole family can watch. For more tips on traveling with kids,
see Chapter 9.
For this itinerary, I assume that you want to spend at least three of 
your five days entirely in London. Who wouldn’t want to spend several
days in the capital city, jam-packed with sights that kids of all ages can
enjoy? Plus, staying in London and making day trips means that you
don’t have the additional hassle of a car. You can get everywhere on
public transportation.
For information on all the London attractions in this itinerary, see
Chapter 12 unless noted otherwise.
Don’t schedule too much on Day One. Exercise helps ward off jet lag.
After sitting in a plane for several hours, take smaller children to one of
London’s great parks so that they can run and let off steam. Depending
on where your hotel is located, your destination may be Hyde Park,
Kensington Gardens, Green Park, St. James’s Park, or Regent’s Park.
During your stay, you may want to visit them all. If you’re traveling with
a teen, you can introduce yourselves to the city with a stroll through
London’s four royal parks, following the Princess Diana Commemorative
Walk (see Chapter 11).
More focused sightseeing begins on Day Two. Consider a guided bus
tour that helps orient everyone and gives you at least a glimpse of all the
Part I: Introducing England 
48

major sights. Several outfits provide tours on double-decker buses —
always a treat for kids — and Frog Tours uses amphibious vehicles to
show you the main sights on land and from the Thames. More expensive
guided tours may include the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham
Palace, a bit of pageantry that both children and adults find exciting.
After the tour, make the British Airways London Eye your first stop.
This giant, high-tech observation wheel revolves on the South Bank,
beside the Thames, across from the Houses of Parliament. Reserve your
ticket beforehand to avoid waiting in a long line. All ages enjoy the half-
hour “flight.” Afterward, cross Westminster Bridge, and stroll over to
view the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben (hopefully the clock strikes
the hour while you’re in the vicinity). And because it’s close at hand, use
this opportunity to visit Westminster Abbey. Younger children may not
get much out of the place, but you will. Later in the afternoon, take a
ferry ride down the Thames to the Tower of London; you can catch the
ferry at Westminster Pier near the Houses of Parliament. After you get
inside the Tower, hook up with one of the Beefeater tours; the red-
coated custodians of the Tower have plenty of dramatic tales to tell. If
you’re with a child age 10 to 17, you may want to have dinner at the
Hard Rock Cafe in Mayfair (see Chapter 11).
Begin Day Three at the Natural History Museum in South Kensington,
where the dinosaur exhibit, complete with life-size animatronic raptors
and a T-Rex, captures the imaginations of both young and old(er). If your
child’s a budding Einstein, the Science Museum, with its many hands-on,
interactive exhibits, may be a better choice. Afterward, if you have small
children in tow, stroll over to Kensington Gardens for a look at the famous
statue of Peter Pan. The Princess Diana Memorial Playground in the
northwest corner of Kensington Gardens enchants little ones. You can
have lunch in the Orangery of adjacent Kensington Palace or make your
way to Café-in-the-Crypt in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar
Square. If you’re with a teen, you may want to spend the morning or
afternoon in Madame Tussauds wax museum or the London Dungeon
on the South Bank; some of the gorier exhibits are unsuitable for young
children. In the evening, older kids and teens may also enjoy one of the
West End’s razzmatazz musicals.
Make Day Four a day trip to Brighton, on the Sussex coast. The quick
trip takes less than an hour. There, you can visit the Royal Pavilion and
take the kids over to Palace Pier, a spot filled with games and souvenir
stands. If the weather’s warm, rent a deck chair and sit on the beach.
Brighton is a fun place just to stroll around, with plenty to keep you and
the family entertained. (For details on Brighton, see Chapter 14.)
On Day Five, head out to Hampton Court Palace, another quick train
ride of less than an hour. (You can also take a boat, but the trip takes
about four hours.) Hampton Court offers you much to explore, so give
yourself at least four hours. Small children may not get much out of the
visit, but they will probably find the staff members who wear period cos-
tumes intriguing. You can eat on the premises. Save the best part for
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 49

last: The famous maze in the gardens brings out the kid in everyone.
(For information on Hampton Court, see Chapter 13.) Following your
visit to Hampton Court Palace, you can depart from London on a 
flight that leaves later in the evening; however, that may require too
much rushing for most families. A better plan may be to fly out the next
morning.
Strolling through England’s Greenery: 
An Itinerary for Garden Lovers
England is a paradise for gardeners. In London and throughout the coun-
try, you find superb gardens created in a variety of styles. You can reach
many of England’s great gardens by train and taxi, but a car definitely
comes in handy if you’re intent on seeing several gardens in different
parts of the country.
If you want to tour English gardens at their best, you need to travel
between May and August. Although a great garden is interesting at any
time of year, spring to late summer are the peak blooming seasons, when
English gardens are at their best, showing off with a blazing dazzle of
color.
The gardens in England are often part of a stately home, which you 
may also want to visit. Touring a house and its gardens usually takes a
minimum of three hours. If you’re a gardener, you may want to make
these excursions the focal point of your day and plan other activities
accordingly.
If you have one week in England and want to spend part of your time in
London, what gardens can you see? Well, you have many beautiful
options.
Spend Day One strolling around London’s magnificent royal parks (St.
James’s Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens). Former
hunting grounds, they’ve been landscaped over the centuries to accom-
modate millions of visitors each year. Visit the lovely formal gardens
around Kensington Palace in Kensington Gardens. If you plan to spend
part of May in London, you may want to attend the famous Chelsea
Flower Show, which kicks off the gardening season. Reserve tickets in
advance for this yearly event. (See Chapter 12 for information on the
gardens and Chapter 3 for details on the flower show.)
On Day Two, take a half-day to visit the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew,
which include wonderful Victorian-era glass conservatories. You can
reach Kew by Underground or by boat. Charming Kew Palace and an
18th-century Chinese pagoda are part of this once-royal pleasure garden.
(See Chapter 13 for details on visiting Kew.)
Part I: Introducing England 
50

Devote Day Three to the gardens at Hampton Court Palace, Henry VIII’s
extravagant showplace beside the Thames. In addition to viewing formal
plantings in the geometric Tudor style, you can visit the ancient green-
house, see a 300-year-old grapevine, and wind your way through the
famous maze. You may want to time your visit to coincide with the
Hampton Court Flower Show in July. (See Chapter 3 for details on the
flower show and Chapter 13 for information on Hampton Court Palace.)
Reserve Day Four for your visit to Sissinghurst Castle Gardens in 
Kent. Sissinghurst is a major highlight of any garden tour of England.
From London, you can get there by train. Laid out and planted by Vita
Sackville-West and Harold Nicholson in the 1930s, Sissinghurst is one of
the greatest and most romantic gardens in the world. Now a National
Trust property, the gardens are so popular that they use a timed-entry
system at peak periods during the spring and summer. You can find a
restaurant and tea shop on the premises. (See Chapter 15 for informa-
tion on Sissinghurst.)
If you have a car and get an early start, you can combine a visit to
Sissinghurst with a visit to Hever Castle, Anne Boleyn’s childhood home.
Remarkable Italianate gardens, designed for William Waldorf Astor in
1903, surround the moated castle. (See Chapter 15 for details on Hever
Castle.)
If you don’t have a car, you can travel to Hever Castle by train and taxi
on Day Five. If you visit both Sissinghurst and Hever Castles on Day
Four, use Day Five to visit those royal parks you may have missed on
Day One.
Among the hundreds of gardens in England, two more unforgettable
ones await garden lovers. In order to see them as part of your weeklong
trip, however, you need to rent a car.
Spend part of Day Six at Stourhead, located a few miles west of
Salisbury, in Wiltshire. Laid out in 1741, Stourhead is one of the oldest
landscape gardens in England. A lake, a bridge, and classically inspired
buildings serve as focal points in a graceful landscape. (See Chapter 16
for details on Stourhead.)
You may want to spend the night in Salisbury, or continue north to Bath
or one of the Cotswolds towns that I describe in Chapter 20.
Day Seven belongs to Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds. The plantings at
this remarkable garden in Gloucestershire form living “rooms” of shape,
color, scent, and texture. The gardens at Hidcote, begun in 1907, have
influenced gardeners from around the world. Strolling through this mag-
nificent creation, patiently fashioned from inhospitable terrain, is a per-
fect way to end your weeklong garden tour of England. (For information
on Hidcote Manor, see Chapter 20.)
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 51

Visiting England’s Past: An Itinerary 
for History Buffs
Many travelers thrill at the experience of standing in a place where his-
tory was made. England, as you probably know, is loaded with these hal-
lowed spots. In this ancient realm, you can see places that span roughly
5,000 years of human history. My suggested itinerary covers only a frac-
tion of the sites you can visit. Using London as a base for several day
trips, this itinerary is geared for an eight-day stay in England. With this
itinerary, you don’t need a car.
On Day One, you arrive in London, a city that’s hardly lacking in his-
toric monuments. Start off with a trip to the granddaddy of them all, the
900-year-old Tower of London. Join one of the guided tours led by the
Beefeaters, and wander around afterward on your own. Tower Green is
the spot where political prisoners, such as Anne Boleyn and Sir Thomas
More, were beheaded during the reign of Henry VIII. You have to see the
Crown Jewels, housed in a high-security armory.
From the Tower, travel by boat (you find a ferry pier right outside) to
Westminster Pier, the stop for the Houses of Parliament and your next
destination, Westminster Abbey. This ancient Gothic edifice, where
almost every British monarch since William the Conqueror has been
crowned, resonates with history. In the chapels, you find the tombs 
of Queen Elizabeth I; her half-sister, Mary Tudor (“Bloody Mary”); and
her onetime rival, Mary Queen of Scots. Great English statesmen, war
heroes, and writers are commemorated throughout. Have dinner at
Rules, London’s oldest restaurant, to cap off your history-filled day. 
(For details on the sights in this paragraph, see Chapter 12; for the
restaurant Rules, see Chapter 11.)
On Day Two, head over to Buckingham Palace, ideally on a day when
the historic pomp and pageantry of the Changing of the Guard is taking
place (daily from Apr 1 through early June, on alternate days the rest 
of the year). The palace itself, Queen Elizabeth’s official London resi-
dence, is open to the public in August and September. If you can’t get
into the palace, stop in at the Royal Mews, where you can see the amaz-
ing gilded coach in which the queen rides to open Parliament. After your
royal tours, make your way to the Cabinet War Rooms & Churchill
Museum in Westminster. The fascinating underground bunker was the
World War II headquarters for Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his
War Cabinet. The bunker has been preserved exactly as it was during
England’s “darkest hour” in the 1940s. Your last major stop of the day is
St. Paul’s Cathedral, site of the famous fairy-tale wedding of Prince
Charles and Princess Diana in 1981. (See Chapter 12 for information on
all these London attractions.)
Day Three, if you’re up for it, can be your day to compare and contrast a
royal palace and a royal castle. Start the day early at Kensington Palace,
Part I: Introducing England 
52

used by monarchs from William and Mary to Queen Victoria, who was
born there. An audio guide fills you in on the history. On display in the
historical dress collection are gowns worn by Queen Victoria, Queen
Elizabeth, and Princess Diana. (For details on Kensington Palace, see
Chapter 12.) Afterward, travel to Windsor Castle, less than an hour by
train from London. Another one of the queen’s official residences, the
historic castle set in its Great Park is open to visitors most of the year.
The sumptuous interior was redone in the 19th century. (You can find
information on Windsor Castle in Chapter 13.)
Treat yourself to a full-day trip to York, one of England’s most historic
cities, on Day Four. Get an early start, because the train takes two hours
to get there. You can find a wealth of historic attractions in York. Start
your explorations at awe-inspiring York Minster, the largest Gothic
structure in northern Europe. Its enormous windows shimmer with
medieval stained glass. Then head over to Jorvik Viking Centre for a
ride back to York of a thousand years ago, when the city was a Viking
settlement called Jorvik. York is wonderfully walkable, although its
ancient lanes can be confusing. Stroll through the Shambles, a medieval
street where butchers had their shops, and make a full or partial circuit
of the medieval city walls. You can have dinner in York, on the train 
ride back, or in London. (See Chapter 21 for details on York and its
attractions.)
Make another day trip on Day Five, this time to Winchester, the 
ancient Anglo-Saxon capital of Wessex under King Alfred. By train 
from London, the trip takes about one and a half hours. Winchester is 
a small, delightful town and a pleasure to explore. Begin at mighty
Winchester Cathedral, which houses the remains of some of the Anglo-
Saxon kings of England. You also can see the grave of Jane Austen, 
the brilliant author of Pride and Prejudice and other early-19th-century
classics. Making a circuit of the town, passing Winchester College
(founded in 1382) and following the River Itchen, is easy. The famous
King Arthur’s Round Table hangs in Castle Hall, the largest medieval hall
in England after Westminster. Sir Walter Raleigh heard his death sen-
tence in Castle Hall in 1603. In the small City Museum, you can see
Roman mosaics from the period when Winchester was a Roman settle-
ment. You can be back in London in time for dinner at Ye Olde Cheshire
Cheese, the onetime hangout of Dr. Johnson and Charles Dickens. (See
Chapter 16 for information on Winchester; see Chapter 11 for the restau-
rant Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese.)
Day Six is another day trip, this time to Canterbury, about one and a
half hours east of London, in Kent. In terms of England’s religious his-
tory, you can call only a few places more important. More than 700 
years ago, pilgrims began flocking to the shrine of St. Thomas à Becket,
who had been murdered by King Henry II’s henchmen in Canterbury
Cathedral. Becket’s shrine was destroyed during the reign of Henry VIII,
but the site is marked near the high altar. The poet Geoffrey Chaucer
wrote about a group of those Old English–speaking pilgrims in The
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 53

Canterbury Tales, and you may want to step into The Canterbury Tales,
an entertaining museum and exhibition on nearby St. Margaret’s Street,
to renew your acquaintance with or discover more about them.
For a glimpse of how the locals lived 2,000 years ago, when Canterbury
was a Roman settlement called Cantuaria, spend some time in the small
but informative Canterbury Roman Museum. Then make your way to
the ruins of St. Augustine’s Abbey, a Christian site that predates the
cathedral by about 600 years. You can take an audio-guided tour of this
UNESCO World Heritage site, one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon monastic
sites in the country. Nearby is another ancient treasure: St. Martin’s
Church, perhaps the oldest church in England. It was already in exis-
tence when St. Augustine arrived to convert the natives in 597. (You can
find more information on Canterbury and its sights in Chapter 14.)
On Day Seven, go prehistoric and visit Stonehenge, possibly the world’s
most famous ancient monument. Ride a bus from Salisbury, about one
and a half hours west of London by train. The ancient stone circle
retains its mystery even in the face of thousands of daily tourists. Was
the circle used as an astronomical laboratory, as one popular theory
holds? Even the date is uncertain — it’s estimated to be at least 5,000
years old. In Salisbury, before heading back to London, visit beautiful
Salisbury Cathedral, a masterpiece of English Gothic architecture. Its
spire is the tallest in England. (Details on Stonehenge and Salisbury are
in Chapter 16.)
On Day Eight, go into Battle — Battle, Sussex, that is. In this small town
just north of Hastings, you find one of the most historically hallowed
spots on English soil: the battlefield where, in 1066, William of Normandy
fought King Harold for the throne of England. William won and became
known as William the Conqueror. His defeat of Harold spelled the end of
Anglo-Saxon rule and marked the beginning of a new French culture
imposed upon the country. At the 1066 Battle of Hastings Abbey and
Battlefield, you can walk on the battlefield. A clever audio guide that
tells the story from three different perspectives enhances your experi-
ence. William the Conqueror built Battle Abbey, now in ruins, on the
spot where Harold was slain and English history moved into a new
phase. The town of Battle, about 90 minutes south of London by train,
has several good restaurants for lunch or tea. (See Chapter 14 for infor-
mation on Battle.)

In this part . . .
T
his part helps you with the practical details of planning
your trip to England.
In Chapter 5, I get into the nitty-gritty of money. You have to
deal with British money every day of your trip, so this chap-
ter tells you all about pounds and pence. Any traveler who’s
trying to come up with a workable budget needs to have a
general idea of what things currently cost. I also include
useful information on changing your home currency into
pounds and pence and provide plenty of practical info on
using ATMs and credit cards while in England.
In Chapter 6, I go over the transportation options for getting
you to England. I discuss the various types of escorted and
package tours and give you the rundown on which airlines ﬂy
to England, where to ﬁnd special deals, and how to book your
ﬂight online.
After you’re in England, you may want to get out of London
and travel around the rest of the country. In Chapter 7, I tell
you about traveling by train, bus, and car.
Booking your accommodations ahead of time is wise, and
Chapter 8 tells you how to do so. I explain hotel rack rates
and give you some pointers to help you ﬁnd the best room for
the best rate. I list the various hotel options available to you,
from world-famous luxury hotels in London and spectacular
country-house hotels to simple B&Bs. 
In Chapter 9, I offer some speciﬁc information and tips for vis-
itors with special needs or interests: You can ﬁnd advice and
resources for families traveling with children, senior travel-
ers, travelers with disabilities, and gay and lesbian travelers.
Chapter 10 deals with last-minute details. I discuss getting a
passport, buying travel and medical insurance, staying con-
nected by cellphone and Internet, and staying healthy on
your trip.

O
kay, you want to go to England. You’re excited and eager to pack,
but can you really afford it? At this point, a financial reality check is
in order. You may have heard that London is an expensive city, but just
how expensive? And what about destinations outside London? What
does it cost to stay overnight in romantic Cornwall, for example, and
how much do you have to pay for train fare from London? This chapter
helps you answer all these questions and assemble a budget.
Planning Your Budget
Planning a budget for your trip to England isn’t as difficult as you 
may think. To come up with a workable figure, you need to break down
your trip into its various components: airfare, transportation while in
England, hotels, meals, entertainment, and so on. In the following sec-
tions, you can find vital clues on how to create a realistic budget that
works for you.
Lodging
The cost of accommodations takes the biggest bite from your budget.
And you have to pay more for accommodations in London than any-
where else in England. If you book your rooms in advance, especially for
the London part of your trip, you can know this expense before you
leave on vacation.
Chapter 8 discusses what kind of lodgings you can expect for your money
and how to get the best rate. After you get a firm handle on prices and
locations, check out Chapter 11 for my recommendations of top-notch

London B&Bs (bed-and-breakfasts) and hotels in all price ranges and
locations. You can also find good hotels and B&Bs in the regional chap-
ters of the book.
In London, rates vary considerably from B&B to B&B and from hotel to
hotel, so I can’t give you a very reliable average. For the recommenda-
tions in this book, however, the rates for a double room generally fall
between £85 and £100 ($170–$200) for an inexpensive property, between
£101 and £150 ($202–$300) for a moderately priced one, and between
£151 and £200 ($302–$400) for an expensive one. After that, you hit the
stratosphere of £201-plus ($402-plus) for a luxury B&B or hotel. Keep in
mind that all B&Bs and many midrange London hotels include at least a
continental breakfast as part of the room rate, so you can save a few
pounds with a “free” meal each day. Also, these prices are rack rates, the
highest non-discounted rate for a one-night stay. You can often find
much better rates and special deals online.
In other parts of England, the rates for accommodations are more uni-
form and much lower, generally £40 to £45 ($80–$90) per person, per
night. Overall, you pay less for everything after you leave London.
However, you still can find plenty of opportunities to drop a king’s
ransom for a room, especially in some of those truly elegant country-
house hotels.
Check for special deals when you’re outside of London. Many country-
house hotels offer bed, breakfast, and a full dinner at bargain prices.
Throughout England, properties offer special price breaks for stays of
two nights or a full weekend (Fri and Sat night).
Transportation
You can get to London from anywhere in the world by plane, train, or
boat. Transportation costs vary widely, of course, depending on your
point of departure, time of year, and method of travel. You can look over
all your transportation options in Chapter 6, where I also give you tips
on landing a good airline deal to England. After you arrive in London,
yon can take a number of steps to stretch your budget.
I have some good news that can save you a bundle: You may not need to
rent a car in England because you can tour London using public trans-
portation and reach many destinations outside of the city by train.
Special reduced-price transportation passes, Visitor Travelcards (see
Chapter 11), make getting around the city relatively inexpensive (from
£5.10–£6.60/$10–$13 per day for a one-day pass). American and Canadian
travelers can also purchase London Travel Cards before leaving home,
starting at US$15 per day (see Chapter 11).
Trains can take you to many of England’s castles and other destinations.
If you plan to do much traveling in the countryside, consider getting a
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
58

BritRail pass (see Chapter 7 for details). You have to buy these passes,
which offer substantial savings over individual fares, before you arrive 
in England. In England’s smaller towns and cities, you can walk almost
everywhere because the city centers are so compact. Or you can hop on
a bus, as the locals do. Sometimes you may need to take a taxi, which
can get expensive, depending on the distance from the rail stations to
your destinations in the towns.
In some areas, a car makes exploration of the countryside much easier.
However, renting a car can be a very expensive proposition. You may
find a great rate, but gasoline (petrol in Britspeak) costs more than twice
what it does in the States (at press time, petrol in England, which is sold
by the litre, cost about $8 per gallon). See Chapter 7 for more details on
renting a car in England.
Dining
The food in England used to be the butt (or shank) of many a joke, but in
recent years, London has emerged as one of the great food capitals of
the world. You find superb restaurants in the rest of the country, too. 
Of course, eating at the top restaurants, no matter where you are, can
cost you. However, in London and in every town and village throughout
England, you can find countless pubs and restaurants where you can
dine less expensively — and where you can enjoy your meal along 
with the locals. In addition, many of the best restaurants in London 
and elsewhere offer special fixed-price meals that lower the cost of
dining. If you’re on a really tight budget, you can find excellent sandwich
shops all over the city, or you can buy your own take-away food in a
supermarket.
Again, everything costs more in London. If you eat lunch and dinner at
the moderately priced London restaurants recommended in Chapter 11,
you can expect to pay £25 to £40 ($50–$80) per person per day for meals,
not including wine (assuming that your hotel rate includes breakfast).
Outside of London, unless you splurge on really high-class restaurants,
food costs about £20 to £35 ($40–$70) per person per day. In the country-
side, many hotels offer full board — that is, bed, breakfast, and dinner. In
most cases, full board adds up to considerable savings.
If you have breakfast at a cafe rather than your hotel and are content
with coffee and a roll, expect to pay about £5 to £6 ($10–$12) in or out 
of London. Depending on the restaurant, an old-fashioned English break-
fast with eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and tea or coffee can run any-
where from £7 to £12 ($14–$24) in London, about half that outside
London — but remember, your hotel cost nearly always includes break-
fast. Likewise, a simple afternoon tea at a cafe in London sets you back
about £7 to £9 ($14–$18), but a lavish high tea with sandwiches, scones,
clotted cream, and cakes at one of the great London hotels may cost you
£25 ($50) or more. Elsewhere, expect to pay about £6 ($12) for a scrump-
tious cream tea (with scones, jam, and Cornish or Devon clotted cream).

Sightseeing
Your budget for admission fees depends on what you want to see, of
course. But don’t cut costs with your sightseeing. After all, you came all
this way to see the sights, right? Sure, an adult ticket to the Tower of
London is £16 ($32), but do you really want to miss seeing this historic
landmark and the extraordinary Crown Jewels housed there? Keep in
mind that if you’re a senior or a student, you can often get a reduced-
price admission. Plus, many attractions offer reduced family rates for
two adults and two children.
You can get into all the top national museums — the British Museum,
National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, Tate Modern,
Victoria & Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, and Science
Museum — for free. And it costs nothing to stroll through London’s 
great parks or to view Buckingham Palace (okay, from the outside) and
see the Changing of the Guard.
As a general rule, expect to pay about £13 to £18 ($26–$36) for admis-
sion to famous castles and palaces, such as Castle Howard in Yorkshire
and Warwick Castle near Stratford-upon-Avon. Some of the great English
cathedrals, such as Salisbury and York, charge admission fees of £5 to £8
($10–$16) to help pay the enormous cost of upkeep. You rarely pay more
than £8 ($16) for museums and local attractions outside of London.
Unless they’re students with valid identification, those 16 and over usu-
ally have to pay the adult admission charge at attractions.
If your plans call for visiting castles, such as Windsor or Warwick;
palaces, such as Hampton Court or Blenheim; historic properties, such
as Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon; and gardens, such
as Sissinghurst in Kent, you can save money by purchasing a Great
British Heritage Pass. The passes are good for 4 days ($62), 7 days
($86), 15 days ($115), and one month ($154). These passes include
almost all major historic properties in England, and you get 50 percent
off the admission price at the Tower of London. You can order one by
calling RailEurope at % 877-257-2887 in the U.S. (% 800-361-7245 in
Canada), from a travel agent in Australia or New Zealand, or online at
www.raileurope.com. In London, you can buy the Heritage Pass at the
Britain Visitor Centre, 1 Regent St., SW1. For more information, check the
Web site www.britishheritagepass.com.
Shopping and nightlife
Shopping and entertainment are the most flexible parts of your budget.
You don’t have to buy anything at all, and you can take a stroll after
dinner instead of seeing a play or dancing at a club. You know what you
want. Flip through the London shopping options and the London enter-
tainment and nightlife venues in Chapter 12. If anything strikes you as
something you can’t do without, budget accordingly. Keep in mind that a
pint in a pub sets you back about £3.50 ($7), and a London West End thea-
ter ticket can range from £25 to £50 ($50–$100). You may want to budget
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
60

for a theater ticket at Stratford-upon-Avon, too; seats cost between £5 and
£36 ($10–$72). Coastal resort towns, such as Brighton, are big with club-
goers, so you may want to check out the scene while you’re there; club
cover charges rarely cost more than £5 ($10), but drinks are always expen-
sive, about £4 to £6 ($8–$12) for non-premium alcohol.

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Throughout this book, Bargain Alert icons highlight money-saving tips
and great deals. Check out these additional cost-cutting strategies:
 Go in the off season. If you can travel at non-peak times (Oct to
mid-Dec or Jan–Mar), hotel prices can be as much as 20 percent
less than during peak months.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to London. When you ask
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
62

about airfares, find out whether you can get a cheaper rate by
flying on a different day.
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations like London, you can
make just one call to a travel agent or packager to book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing. You pay
much less than if you try to put the trip together yourself (see
Chapter 6 for package-fare deals).
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchen (in England, they call them
self-catering units), and do at least some of your own cooking. You
may not feel like you’re on vacation if you do your own cooking and
wash your own dishes, but you can save money by not eating in
restaurants two or three times a day. Parents traveling with chil-
dren often find this strategy useful.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
programs, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for
discounts on plane tickets and hotel rooms that you book before
you go. When you’re in England, seniors and students with ID usu-
ally get a lower admission rate to attractions.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. At most
top London restaurants, lunches cost you a lot less than dinners,
and the menu often includes many of the dinnertime specialties.
Also, wherever you travel in England, look for fixed-price menus.
 Buy take-out meals at supermarkets and sandwich shops. If you’re
on a tight budget, skip restaurants and head instead to a nearby
supermarket or sandwich shop. Supermarkets in London and
throughout England sell sandwiches and all manner of “take-away”
meals, so you can create your own picnic.
 Travel off-peak, standard class. A train ticket always costs more if
you travel at peak commuter times (before 9:30 a.m.). A first-class
train ticket generally costs about one-third more than a standard
class.
 Walk. London is large, but you can still walk just about anywhere.
And every historic English town or city is compact. A good pair of
walking shoes can save you money on taxis and other local trans-
portation. As a bonus, you get to know the city and its inhabitants
more intimately, and you can explore at a slower pace.
Handling Money
Britain’s unit of currency is the pound sterling (£). Every pound is
divided into 100 pence (p). Coins come in denominations of 1p, 2p, 5p,
10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and £2. Notes are available in £5, £10, £20, and £50
denominations. As with any unfamiliar currency, British pounds and
pence take a bit of getting used to. The coins have different sizes,
shapes, and weights according to value. Each banknote denomination
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 63

has its own color and bears a likeness of the queen. The Bank of England
draws all the currency.
The exchange rate, which fluctuates daily, is the rate you get when you
use your own currency to buy pounds sterling. In general, £1 = $2 (see
Table 5-3). I use this approximate exchange rate for prices in this book.
(If the U.S. price is less than $10, I round it off to the nearest quarter; if
more than $10, to the nearest dollar.)

When you’re about to leave on your trip, check with your bank or look in
the newspaper to find out the current exchange rate. You can also check
currency conversions online at www.xe.com.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine), sometimes called a cashpoint in England.
You can find 24-hour ATMs all over London: outside banks, in large
supermarkets, and in some Underground (Tube) stations. In other
English cities and towns, look for ATMS in local banks on the town’s
main street (often called High Street).
The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-
843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe; look at the back of
your bank card to find out which network you’re on and then call or
check online for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you know
your personal identification number (PIN) and find out your daily with-
drawal limit before you depart. Also, keep in mind that many banks
impose a fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM, and
that fee can be higher for international transactions (up to $5 or more)
than for domestic ones (where they’re rarely more than $1.50). On top of
this fee, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee.
For international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.

Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses. Credit card purchases are translated
from pounds to dollars at a favorable exchange rate. Keep in mind that
when you use your credit card abroad, most banks assess a 2 to 3 per-
cent fee above the 1 percent fee that Visa, MasterCard, and American
Express charge for currency conversion on credit charges. But you 
may still want to go with credit cards when you factor in things like 
exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check exchange rates (and
service fees).
In smaller towns and villages outside London, you may have trouble
paying for B&Bs and restaurants with credit cards. Many B&Bs with one
to three guest rooms operate on a cash-only basis, as do some tearooms.
You can use credit cards to withdraw cash advances at banks or ATMs 
if you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours or didn’t even know you
had one, call the number on the back of your credit card, and ask the
bank to send it to you. If your bank debit card works with one of the
international credit card systems (such as Cirrus), you can use it in
England. Using debit cards in England has one major difference, how-
ever: You can’t get extra cash back.
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when 
you use the card a number of times in a foreign destination, which 
may lead them to block your charges. Even if you don’t call your credit
card company in advance, you can always call the card’s toll-free emer-
gency number if a charge is refused — a good reason to carry the phone
number with you. Basically, just remember to carry more than one card
with you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons,
so having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because every town
and city has 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of
cash as needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged 
an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdraw-
ing money every day, you might be better off with traveler’s checks —
provided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you
want to cash one.
Your traveler’s checks will be issued in your local currency. After you
arrive in England, you need to convert them to pounds and pence. (See
the nearby box, “Changing your currency in England.”)
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 65

$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number don’t have to pay the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can get
Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-
3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for
a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Contact all of your credit card companies the minute you discover that
your wallet has been lost or stolen, and file a report at the nearest police
precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a police
report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies have
an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they

Changing your currency in England
Changing money is a simple and straightforward operation. Just remember that every
time you exchange money, you need to show your passport. By using a currency-
exchange service, called a bureau de change, you can easily change cash or trav-
eler’s checks. These services are available at major London airports, any branch of
major banks (throughout the country), all major rail and Underground stations in
Central London, post offices countrywide, many Tourist Information Centres, and
American Express or Thomas Cook offices. Bureaux de change in airports and rail sta-
tions are generally open daily between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.
Almost every major bank in Central London and in cities throughout England has a 
foreign-currency window where you can exchange traveler’s checks or cash. Week-
day hours for banks are generally 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The big bank names in England
currently include Barclays Bank (% 020/7441-3200), Midland Bank (% 020/7599-3232),
and NatWest (% 020/7395-5500). These companies have branches throughout
England.
Steer clear of bureaux de change that offer good exchange rates but charge a heavy
commission (up to 8 percent). You find them in major tourist sections. (Some are open
24 hrs.) Some hotels also cash traveler’s checks, but they have a much higher com-
mission than a bank or bureau de change. Before exchanging your money, always
check the exchange rate, the commission rate, and additional fees.

may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an emer-
gency credit card in a day or two. Call the following U.K. number that
applies to you:
 American Express: % 01273/696933 or 800-221-7282 in the U.S.
(for cardholders and traveler’s check holders)
 MasterCard: % 01702/362988 or 800-307-7309 in the U.S.
 Visa: % 01604/230230 or 800-847-2911 in the U.S.
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-555-
1212 in the U.S.
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you lose all forms of photo ID, call your 
airline and explain the situation; it may allow you to board the plane if
you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you filed.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 67
Earning their keep: Royal expenses
Buckingham Palace’s accounts revealed that the overall cost to taxpayers of keeping
the monarchy rose 4.7 percent in 2006 to £37.4 million ($74.8 million), or about 62p ($1.25)
per U.K. resident. Travel expenses accounted for a significant part of the rise. One trip
to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and India by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall,
cost £304,000 ($608,000). Prince Andrew spent more than £355,000 ($710,000) on a series
of visits to destinations including Bermuda, Thailand, and Egypt. He spent £33,405
($66,810) to charter a plane for two days to travel between Bangkok and the resorts of
Hua Hin and Phuket, a two-hour flight with scheduled economy-class seats available
for about £80 ($160) round-trip, and he also spent £11,555 ($23,110) to fly from the Isle
of Man to St. Andrews for a meeting of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. British tax-
payers paid £400,000 ($800,000) for wine and spirits for the queen’s cellars, while
£300,000 ($600,000) was spent on a new kitchen for Windsor Castle. The cost of new
security measures at Buckingham Palace came to about £150,000 ($300,000). Utilities 
for the royal properties totaled £2 million ($4 million), with about £1 million ($2 million)
spent on catering and hospitality, including £600,000 ($1,200,000) for garden parties.
Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, was quoted as saying: “Our key aim is not to
try and achieve a low-cost monarchy. What we’re really after is trying to achieve a
high-quality and very efficient monarchy.” Buckingham Palace pointed out that the
royal family had about 2,700 official engagements across the U.K. and overseas in 2006.

Taking Taxes into Account
Allow me to introduce you to Britain’s version of sales tax — the value-
added tax (VAT). Brace yourself: The tax amounts to 17.5 percent. The
VAT is part of the reason prices (particularly in London) are so high. The
tax is added to the total price of consumer goods (the price on the tag
already includes the tax) and to hotel and restaurant bills. The VAT isn’t
a hidden expense, but not all quoted room rates, especially in the luxury
tier, include the tax. Make sure to ask whether your quoted room rate
includes the VAT. (In the hotel listings in this book, I tell you if the rate
doesn’t include the VAT.)
On top of the VAT, a few restaurants add a service charge of 12.5 percent
to 15 percent to your bill. If they include a service charge, the menu must
state this policy (“A 15 percent service charge has been added to your
bill”). This charge amounts to mandatory tipping, so if your credit card
receipt comes back with a space for you to add a tip, put a line through it.
Tipping Like You Mean It
As a general rule, except for tips in restaurants (12.5 percent–15 percent)
and to cab drivers (10 percent), you don’t have to tip a lot in London. 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
68
Getting your VAT back
If you’re not a resident of the European Union, you can get your VAT refunded on pur-
chases made in England (but not the VAT paid at hotels and restaurants). Every store
requires a minimum purchase of at least £50 ($100) to qualify for a VAT refund. The
exact amount varies from store to store. To get the refund, you must get a VAT refund
form from the retailer, and the retailer must complete the form at the time of purchase.
Don’t leave the store without a completed refund form. Present the form — along with
the goods — at the VAT Refunds counter in the airport. After you get the paperwork
stamped, you have two choices:
 You can mail in the papers and receive your refund in a British check (no!) or a
credit card refund (yes!).
 You can go directly to the Cash VAT Refund desk at the airport and get your refund
in cash.
VAT doesn’t apply to goods shipped out of the country, no matter how much you spend.
You can avoid VAT and the hassle of lugging large packages back with you by having
stores ship your purchases for you; many happily do so. However, shipping charges
can double the cost of your purchase, and you may have to pay duties when the goods
arrive. Rather than use this costly strategy, consider paying for excess baggage (rates
vary with the airline).

An exception is if you stay in an expensive hotel with porters who carry
your bags (£1/$2 per bag) and doormen who hail you a cab (£1/$2 per
successful hail). In fancier country-house hotels, like Gidleigh Park,
where the service is extremely attentive, tipping is left to the discretion
of the guests. In such cases, you may want to leave a minimum of £20
($40) per guest for the staff. In a pub, never tip the bartender — if you
want to acknowledge the service, offer to buy him or her a drink.

Getting to England
In This Chapter
 Traveling to England by plane, train, or ferry
 Finding the best airfare

N
ow that you’ve decided to visit England, you need to find a way to
get there. In this chapter, I discuss getting you to England. What
are your options for direct, nonstop flights? How can you save money on
your flight (and your hotel)? What are the pros and cons of taking an
escorted tour?
Finding Out Who Flies Where
Most regularly scheduled international flights from the United States,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand arrive at London’s Heathrow and
Gatwick airports. Flights from the Continent land at Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, or London City. Charter flights from the Continent usually fly
into Luton, the smallest of London’s five airports. Manchester, in north-
ern England, has an international airport, but I don’t recommend flying
into it unless you plan to skip London entirely. Here’s a brief description
of each of the London airports, who flies to them, and how to travel from
them to Central London (see the Appendix for the contact information
for these airlines):
 Heathrow: The main international airport, 24km (15 miles) west 
of Central London. It’s served by Air Canada (flights from Calgary,
Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and St. John’s), Air New
Zealand (flights from Australia and New Zealand), American (flights
from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Miami), British
Airways (U.S. flights from Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles,
Miami, Newark, New York JFK, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle,
and Washington Dulles; Australian flights from Brisbane, Melbourne,
Perth, and Sydney; New Zealand flights from Auckland), Continental
(flights from Los Angeles, New York JFK, Newark, San Francisco,
and Washington Dulles), Icelandair (flights from Baltimore, Boston,
Minneapolis/St. Paul, and New York JFK), Qantas (Australian flights
from Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney; New Zealand flights from

Auckland), United (flights from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Newark, New York JFK, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles), and
Virgin Atlantic (flights from Chicago, Newark, New York JFK, San
Francisco, and Washington Dulles).
For information on getting into London from Heathrow, check out
Chapter 11.
 Gatwick: A smaller airport than Heathrow, about 40km (25 miles)
south of London. It’s served by American (flights from Boston,
Dallas/Ft. Worth, and Raleigh/Durham), British Airways (flights
from Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver,
Houston, New York JFK, Miami, Orlando, Phoenix, and Tampa),
Continental (flights from Boston, Cleveland, Houston, Miami,
Newark, and Orlando), Delta (flights from Atlanta and Cincinnati),
Northwest (flights from Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul), Qantas
(flights from Sydney, Australia), and Virgin Atlantic (flights from
Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, Newark, Orlando, and San Francisco).
For information on getting into London from Gatwick, see 
Chapter 11.
 Stansted: Eighty kilometers (50 miles) northeast of London, this 
airport handles national and European flights. The Stansted
Express train to Liverpool Street Station takes 45 minutes and 
costs £14.50 ($29).
 London City: Only 10km (6 miles) east of Central London, this 
airport services European destinations. A new extension of the
Docklands Light Railway travels from the airport to Bank Street, in
Central London, in 22 minutes (£4/$10); the Underground requires
an additional fare if you are traveling beyond Bank Street.
 Luton: Forty-five kilometers (28 miles) northwest of London, this
airport services mostly charter flights. Travel by free shuttle bus to
Luton Airport Parkway station, then take a Capital Connection train
to King’s Cross Station in Central London for £11 ($22); the trip
takes 30 to 45 minutes.
 Manchester Airport, in Yorkshire, is served by Air Canada
(flights from Toronto), American (flights from San Francisco and
New York JFK), British Airways (flights from Boston and New York
JFK), British Midland (flights from Washington, D.C.; Chicago; 
and Toronto), Continental (flights from Newark), Delta (flights
from Atlanta), SAS (flights from Toronto), United (flights from
Washington, D.C., and Chicago), US Airways (flights from Orlando),
and Virgin Atlantic (flights from Orlando).
Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a

coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate, known
as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket far in advance, stay over
Saturday night, and are willing to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs),
you can qualify for the least expensive price — usually a fraction of 
the full fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops within the United
States, the full fare runs close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day
advance-purchase ticket may cost you less than half that amount.
Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As
you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend
to take place in seasons of low travel volume — in England, that’s basi-
cally October through March. You almost never see a sale around the peak
summer vacation months of July and August or around Thanksgiving or
Christmas, when many people fly regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Working with consolidators
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets (although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America). Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price. And some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Web,
and most of them offer flights to London. STA Travel (% 800/781-
4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in student travel, offers
good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress (% 800/TRAV-800;
www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excellent fares worldwide.
Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. Air Tickets Direct
(% 800/778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
can try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents can
go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different business
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
72

deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same flights,
so you may want to shop around. Expedia and Travelocity send you 
an E-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your
favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web sites, SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser
add-on that purports to search more than 200 sites at once, but in real-
ity, it beats competitors’ fares only as often as other sites do.
You can find great last-minute deals through free weekly E-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced 
on Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most deals
work only for travel that weekend, but you can book some (such as
Southwest’s) weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly E-mail
alerts at airline Web sites or check megasites that compile compre-
hensive lists of last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.
smartertravel.com). For last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the 
U.S. and www.lastminute.com in Europe often have better deals than
the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use 
an opaque fare service, such as Priceline (www.priceline.com) or
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange
for travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with 
a mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all
major, well-known carriers — and you don’t really have to worry about
being sent from Philadelphia to London via Salt Lake City. But you have a
pretty good chance of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight. Hotwire tells you
flight prices before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than
Hotwire, and has added nonopaque service to its roster. You now have
the option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers —
or opt to bid on opaque fares.
Arriving by Other Means
If you’re traveling to London from another destination in Europe, flying
isn’t the only way to get there. Train and car ferries and high-speed hover-
crafts cross the English Channel throughout the year from ports in France,
Holland, and Belgium. And the Eurostar high-speed train zips beneath the
channel through the Chunnel, a tunnel beneath the English Channel.
Taking the train
London has several train stations, and the one you arrive at depends 
on your point of departure from the Continent. The three-hour Eurostar
service connecting Paris and Brussels to London via the Chunnel arrives
at King’s Cross/St. Pancras Station. Trains from Amsterdam arrive at
Liverpool Street Station. Other London train stations include Victoria,
Paddington, Waterloo, and Euston Station.
Chapter 6: Getting to England 73

You can’t use a Eurailpass on trains in England and the rest of the United
Kingdom, so if you plan to travel within England or the rest of the United
Kingdom, check out the various BritRail passes available (see Chapter 7
for more information).
The high-speed Eurostar train runs from London to Paris or Brussels.
Several types of Eurostar fares are available. Senior fares (for passengers
over 60) and youth fares (for passengers under 26) can cut the price of 
a first-class fare by 20 percent or more. The same reductions apply for
passengers traveling with validated Eurail and BritRail passes. To check
out current and special promotional fares for Eurostar, visit Rail Europe’s
Web site at www.raileurope.com.
Riding a ferry or hovercraft
Crossing time for the car, train, or passenger ferries that regularly 
crisscross the English Channel can take anywhere from 90 minutes to 
5 hours, depending on the point of departure. Various hovercrafts (high-
speed ferries with propellers that lift them off the surface of the water)
skim over the water in as little as half an hour. Frequent train service to
London is available from all the channel ports. The following lists the
major ferry and hovercraft companies:
 Hoverspeed UK (% 08705/240-241 in the U.K.; www.hoverspeed.
co.uk): Operates hovercrafts that zip across the channel between
Calais and Dover in 35 minutes; the SuperseaCats (jet-propelled
catamarans) run between Newhaven and Dieppe in 55 minutes.
 P&O Ferries (% 870/242-4999 in the U.K. or 561-563-2856 in the
U.S.; www.poferries.com): Offers daily ferry/car crossings between
Cherbourg and Portsmouth (crossing time is five hours), between
Le Havre and Portsmouth (51⁄2 hours), and between Calais and
Dover (75 minutes).
 SeaFrance (% 01304/212-696 in the U.K.; www.seafrance.co.uk):
Runs ferries between Dover and Calais (crossing time is 90 minutes).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront, and you don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, it probably doesn’t fulfill its insurance obligations, either. Get
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
74

travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you more about
the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you are unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to 
fit 25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to
relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may dodge this question because they may not know the exact size
of the group until everybody makes reservations. But the operator
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Does the tour have a minimum group size? Some tours have a
minimum group size and may cancel the tour if they don’t book
enough people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close
they are to reaching it. Again, tour operators may dance around
these questions, but the information may help you select a tour
that you know will actually happen.
 What exactly does the tour include? Don’t assume anything. You
may have to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box
lunch may be included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra.
Beer may be included, but not wine. How much flexibility do you
have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave
once a day, with no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in
advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody
get the same chicken cutlet?
Here are a few companies that offer escorted tours to London and the
rest of England (with prices per person, based on double occupancy):
 Globus and Cosmos (www.globusandcosmos.com): Well-known
budget tour companies working in partnership. Current offerings
include an eight-day tour of the scenic and historic highlights in
southern England starting at $1,449, airfare included.
 Trafalgar Tours (www.trafalgartours.com): Provides more
upscale choices; prices for the eight-day “Best of Devon & Cornwall”
tour start at $1,350, airfare not included. They also offer an eight-
day “London Stratford & Bath” tour starting at $1,060, airfare not
included.
Chapter 6: Getting to England 75

Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, including England, package tours can be a smart
way to go. In many cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and
transportation to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on
a tour you book yourself. That’s because tour operators buy packages in
bulk, so they can resell them to the public for less.
Package tours vary greatly in what they provide. Some offer a better class
of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices.
Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In some pack-
ages, you may have a limited choice of accommodations and travel days.
Some packages let you choose between escorted vacations and independ-
ent vacations; others let you add on just a few excursions or escorted day
trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines, such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the north-
eastern U.S. and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. 
Most major airlines offer air/land packages. Several big online travel
agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and Lastminute.com —
also do a brisk business in packages.
Locating package tours
Information about package tours is available from a variety of sources. A
few companies that offer packages to England are
 British Travel International (% 800-327-6097; www.british
travel.com): A good source for discount packages.
 Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com): One
of the biggest packagers in the northeastern United States, offers
reasonably priced packages.
 Trailfinders (www.trailfinders.com): A good source for discount
packages for Australian visitors, it has several offices in Australia:
Sydney (% 02/9247-7666), Melbourne (% 03/9600-3022), Cairns
(% 07/4041-1199), Brisbane (% 07/3229-0887), and Perth (% 08/
9226-1222).
Checking out airline and hotel packages
Airlines are good sources for package tours, especially to London,
because they package their flights together with accommodations. The
following airlines offer packages to England:

Chapter 7
Getting Around England
In This Chapter
 Deciding on the best way to travel
 Traveling through England by train
 Seeing the country by bus
 Exploring the countryside by car
I
strongly recommend that you explore at least a portion of England
that has nothing to do with London. Out of the city and in the coun-
tryside or an ancient village, the quiet magic of this country comes over
you like a spell. The gently unfolding and sometimes dramatic land-
scapes vary from region to region, and so do the cities and towns. Great
and unforgettable sights await you at every turn, and so do small, local
surprises. This chapter helps you decide whether train travel, bus
travel, or auto-motion is for you.
Weighing the Options: Train or Car?
Because of England’s small size and easy access to train and road net-
works, the country is a joy to explore. Many cities and sights are work-
able as day trips from London. You can reach Bath, Brighton, and
Canterbury from London in 90 minutes or less by train and in about two
hours by car or bus. The trip to Stratford-upon-Avon or to Salisbury (the
closest large town to Stonehenge) takes about two hours by train and
about three hours by car. If London is your home base, and you get an
early start, you can explore any one of these places, have lunch, and be
back in London in time for dinner.
Riding the Rails
In England, people still take trains to travel around the country. I recom-
mend traveling by train over all other forms of transportation — especially
if you’re a first-time visitor to England. Traveling by train is fun, safe, and
convenient. In smaller cities, the train stations are never more than a few
minutes’ walk or a simple bus ride from the town center. If you want to
explore the countryside, you can easily take a train to a new city and
then rent a car.

The sleek, high-speed Intercity trains that run between London and
heavily traveled main-line routes are the most dependable and comfort-
able trains you can take. You can ride these fast trains to York, Stratford-
upon-Avon, Bath and Cheltenham (both good bases for exploring the
Cotswolds), Oxenholme (closest station to the Lake District), Exeter 
(in Devon), and Penzance (in Cornwall). For shorter trips, such as to
Brighton and Cambridge, you can take a commuter train. In some cases,
you may need to transfer to a local train to reach your destination.
The local trains connect larger towns to smaller ones and are very basic.
Unlike all other trains, local trains don’t have toilets or food service.
Smoking isn’t permitted on local trains, and it’s confined to strictly des-
ignated areas on commuter and Intercity trains. The local stations are
small; sometimes (particularly on Sun) no one is available to help with
information or ticket sales. You can always find train schedules posted
in the local stations, and if no window service is available, you can buy
your ticket on the train.
For the most current train schedules and fares, call National Rail
Enquiries at % 08457/484-950 in the United Kingdom. You can also find
timetable information online at www.nationalrail.co.uk, but always
call National Rail Enquiries to verify schedules.
Buying your train ticket
You can purchase your train ticket with cash or credit card at a ticket
window or ticket machine in the train station. If the windows are closed,
you have to buy your ticket on the train with cash. If you have a BritRail
pass (see “Saving with BritRail passes,” later in this chapter), you don’t
have to bother with buying tickets; just board the train.
In England, you call a one-way train ticket a single. A round-trip ticket is
a return. If you go on a day trip, ask for a day return.
When you buy your ticket, you have to choose between first and stan-
dard (second) class. First-class tickets cost about one-third more than
standard class. The first-class cars have roomier seats, but you can
travel quite comfortably in standard class. If you want a first-class ticket,
you have to request one — otherwise, the agent will sell you a standard-
class ticket.
First-class service on some Intercity train routes includes a free news-
paper and complimentary coffee, tea, beverages, and snacks served at
your seat. Standard-class passengers can buy sandwiches and drinks in
a cafe car. On some lines, an employee comes through with a food-and-
beverage trolley.
You usually save money by buying your train ticket at least a day or
more before you travel. You also save by traveling “off-peak” (that is,
after 9:30 a.m.).
Chapter 7: Getting Around England 79

Negotiating the rail system
The British rail system is currently emerging from a crisis. It had seri-
ously deteriorated since being privatized in the 1980s and is in the midst
of a multibillion-pound restoration plan scheduled to end in 2008.
Service has already improved, at least on the main routes, but you may
still encounter canceled trains, departure tracks changed without
notice, and railway employees who don’t always have the correct infor-
mation to help you on your journey.
For all these reasons, I urge you to keep your wits about you when trav-
eling by train in England. Keep the following in mind:
 Always call National Rail Enquiries (% 08457/484-950) the 
night before your train trip to verify departure times and departure
stations.
 Whenever possible, choose a direct train over one that requires a
change along the way. In some cases, trains going to the same desti-
nation (such as Canterbury or Dover) depart from different London
stations. Ask National Rail Enquiries or information agents at the
station for the quickest and most direct routes to a destination.
 Tracks can change without an announcement, so always verify
with a railway employee before you board that the train is going
to your destination.
 On some lines, Sunday is one of the worst days to travel because
fewer trains run, and they tend to be slow. Track work often takes
place on Sunday, sometimes causing long delays or requiring that
you complete part of the journey by bus.
Getting to know London’s train stations
One of the busiest transportation hubs in the world, London has 11 major
stations, so you need to get to the right station in order to catch your
train. (Throughout this book, I tell you which London station serves 
the destination that I describe.) The Underground (subway) serves all
London’s train stations. In every station, a large overhead display, usu-
ally near the platforms, lists the departing trains and platforms.
If you travel around England or the rest of the United Kingdom from
London, you’ll depart from one of the following stations:
 Charing Cross Station: Trains from here travel southeast to
Canterbury, Hastings, Dover, and English Channel ports that con-
nect with ferry service to the Continent.
 Euston Station: Trains from this station head north to the Lake
District and up to Scotland.
 King’s Cross Station: Trains from here travel to destinations in the
east of England, including Cambridge and York.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
80

 Liverpool Street Station: Trains from this station head to English
Channel ports, with continuing service to the Netherlands, north-
ern Germany, and Scandinavia.
 Paddington Station: Trains from Paddington travel southwest to
Bath, Plymouth, and Penzance in Cornwall, stopping at cities along
the way.
 St. Pancras Station: Newly renovated and reopened in late 2007,
this station provides expanded Eurostar service to and from Paris
and Brussels from the Midlands.
 Victoria Station: Head here for trains traveling to the south and
southeast of England, including Canterbury, Brighton, and Gatwick
Airport.
 Waterloo: Primarily for trains going to the south of England. Note:
Until late 2007, Waterloo International was the London station for
Eurostar trains to and from Paris and Brussels; St. Pancras is now
the London station for international trains.
Saving with BritRail passes
If you plan to travel around England by train, consider purchasing a
BritRail pass before you arrive. BritRail passes are really convenient
because you don’t have to stand in line to buy train tickets; if a train is in
the station, you can just hop on. In peak summer travel months, you
may want to reserve your seat, which you can do for a small fee.
BritRail passes are sold only outside the United Kingdom; therefore, you
must purchase them before you arrive in England. You can order the
passes through a travel agent or by contacting RailEurope (% 877-257-
2887 in the U.S. or 800-361-RAIL in Canada; www.raileurope.com). The
various kinds of BritRail passes are
 BritRail London Plus Pass: This pass covers a large area around
London and gets you to Cambridge, Oxford, Canterbury, Dover,
Winchester, Salisbury, and as far west as Exeter in Devon. With this
pass, the cost for first-class travel for any two days in an eight-day
period is $113 for adults; children ages 5 to 15 travel free with a
parent; standard class is $74 for adults. Four- and seven-day London
Plus Passes are also available. The first-class, round-trip full fare
between London and Exeter costs you about $334, so with this pass
you save money the farther you travel from London (within the
allowed area). If you take day trips only to Hampton Court Palace
and Windsor, for example, you’re better off paying the regular 
train fares.
 BritRail Flexipass: This pass allows you to travel any 4, 8, or 15 days
within a two-month time period. A four-day, first-class Flexipass
costs $436 for adults, $370 for seniors over 60; children ages 5 to 
15 travel free with a parent. In standard class, the four-day pass
Chapter 7: Getting Around England 81

costs $293 for adults; children ages 5 to 15 travel free with a parent
(there’s no standard-class senior rate). The Flexipass allows you to
visit Wales and Scotland.
 BritRail England Consecutive Pass: Good if you’re going to be on
the go, this pass lets you visit all of England over a specific number
of consecutive days (but you don’t get to go to Wales or Scotland).
An eight-day, first-class pass costs $399 for adults, free for children
ages 5 to 15 traveling with a parent. An eight-day standard-class pass
costs $265 for adults, and is free for children ages 5 to 15 traveling
with a parent.
 BritRail Family Pass: This pass makes traveling with kids cheaper
and easier. Buy any adult or senior pass, and you get one free youth
pass (ages 5–15) of the same type and duration; additional children
pay 50 percent of adult fares. Children under 5 travel free at all times.
Hopping a Coach: Bus Travel
A long-distance touring bus in England is a coach. (You take buses for
local transportation.) The main long-distance coach company is National
Express. Its routes cover the entire country, and its comfortable coaches
have reclining seats and a toilet; they sometimes have food-and-beverage
service. Tickets usually cost half of what the train does, and they’re even
cheaper if you buy a return ticket. The one drawback, at least for the
busy traveler without much extra time, is that coaches take at least one
or two hours longer than the train.
If you travel around England by coach from London, you’ll depart from
Victoria Coach Station, Buckingham Palace Road (% 020/7730-3466;
Tube: Victoria), located just two blocks from Victoria Station. Coach sta-
tions in cities outside of London are always close to the city center,
often next to the train station. For information on travel by coach and
the various money-saving passes available, contact National Express
(% 08705/808-080); you can view schedules and fares online at www.
nationalexpress.com.
National Express offers a money-saving Brit Xplorer pass for 7 days
(£79/$158), 14 days (£139/$278), and 28 days (£219/$438) of unlimited
travel. Purchase tickets online (www.nationalexpress.com) or in
London at the Eurolines Travel Shop at Victoria Coach Station. National
Express also offers a wide array of ticket options for seniors over 60, for
students, and for families.
Driving on the Left, Passing on 
the Right: Car Travel
I always suggest that people travel through England by train rather than
car. You usually spend much of a long-distance car trip on motorways
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
82

without much scenery, so what’s the point? But having a car does open
up whole regions of the English countryside for exploration. In some
areas, such as the Cotswolds, where trains don’t serve villages and local
bus service is sporadic or infrequent, having a car is almost a necessity.
Additionally, parts of Cornwall and the Lake District aren’t accessible by
train or bus.
Americans renting a car in England need a valid U.S. driver’s license that
they’ve had for at least one year. The same holds true for Canadians,
Australians, and New Zealanders. In most cases, depending on the
agency, you must be at least 23 years old (21 in some instances, 25 in
others) and no older than 70 (some companies have raised this age 
to 75).
Renting a car in London — or not
Having a car in London is far more of a hassle than a help for the follow-
ing reasons:
 Finding your way through the city in heavy traffic while driving on
the left-hand side of the road can turn even the best American
driver into a gibbering nutcase.
 Maneuvering through London’s congested and complicated maze of
streets can be an endurance test even for Londoners.
 Parking is difficult to find and expensive. (Street meters cost a mini-
mum of £1/$2 for 15 min.)
 Just entering Central London by car on weekdays sets you back 
£8 ($16); for details, see the nearby box “Cough up the congestion
charge.”
 Paying for gas (petrol in Britspeak) costs about £4 ($8) a gallon.
That’s right: $8 a gallon!
 Riding public transportation — especially the Underground — gets
you everywhere you want to go at a fraction of the cost.
Chapter 7: Getting Around England 83
Cough up the congestion charge
Traffic in Central London was such a snarl that, in February 2003, a new congestion
charge went into effect. Drivers must pay £8 ($16) to enter Central London from 
7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. You can make this payment online (www.
cclondon.com), at retail outlets, or by phone (% 0845/900-1234). There are no toll-
booths, but high-tech cameras read the plate numbers of all cars entering the charge
zone and match them to a database; if you haven’t paid by 10 p.m., you get fined. The
Inner Ring Road forms the boundary for the congestion charge.

Do yourself a favor: Forget about renting a car in London. If you want to
be with Londoners on their own turf (or in their own tunnels), the Tube
(Underground) is a great way to do it. Even if you plan excursions out-
side London, the trains are a better option than a car. If you need a car
to explore the countryside, you can rent one in a hub city or town after
you arrive by train.
Renting a car in England
Although the rental car market in Britain is highly competitive, renting 
a car in England costs more than in the United States — unless, that is,
you can find a special promotional offer from an airline or a car-rental
agency. When I last rented a car in England, in 2007, without benefit of
any special offers, the total cost was more than £140 ($280) for a one-
week rental of a compact car with manual transmission. That price
included unlimited mileage and all the insurance but not gas (petrol),
which added another £100 ($200). Rental car rates vary even more than
airline fares. The price depends on a host of factors, including car size,
the length of time that you keep it, where and when you pick the car up
and drop it off, and how far you drive it.
Asking a few key questions can save you hundreds of dollars when rent-
ing a car. Keep the following factors in mind:
 You can often get a lower rate if you reserve seven days in advance
by using a toll-free reservations number. (See the Appendix for a
list of international rental car firms that rent cars in England.)
 Find out whether the quoted price includes the 17.5 percent value-
added tax (VAT). (See Chapter 5 for more about this tax.)
 If you plan to do a lot of driving, a rental package with unlimited
mileage is your best option.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates.
 If you keep the car for five or more days, a weekly rate may be
cheaper than the daily rate.
 The rate may be cheaper if you pick up the car at a central town
office rather than at an airport.
 Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier
programs, and trade unions. These affiliations usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent. Check with your
travel agent about any and all of these rates.
 Most car rentals are worth at least 500 miles on your frequent-flier
account.
 Some airlines offer package deals that include car rental. (See
Chapter 6 for more about package tours.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
84

In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals. Many credit card companies cover the collision-damage
waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage to the car in a colli-
sion. Check with your credit card company before you go so you can
avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $15 per day).
The rental car companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). If you have insurance on your car at home,
you’re probably covered for most of these unlikelihoods. If your own
insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals, or if you don’t have auto insur-
ance, consider the additional coverage.
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. The major booking
Web sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.
expedia.com), and Yahoo! Travel (http://travel.yahoo.com), for
example — have search engines that can dig up discounted rental car
rates. Just enter the car size you want, the pickup and return dates, and
the city where you want to rent, and the server returns a price. You can
even make the reservation through these sites.
Hitting the road: Motorways, dual carriageways, 
and roundabouts
What some countries call a freeway, the Brits call a motorway. England
has a good motorway network. Don’t stop on a motorway (indicated as
M plus a number on maps) unless you have an emergency. You don’t
have to pay a toll to drive on British motorways if you’re going to any of
the places described in this book.
The English call a two-way road a single carriageway and a four-lane
divided highway (two lanes in each direction) a dual carriageway.
Country roads, some of them paved-over tracks dating back centuries,
are full of twists and turns, and often barely wide enough for two cars to
pass. One element of British roads that invariably throws non-native
drivers is the roundabout — a traffic junction where several roads meet
at one traffic circle. At a roundabout, the cars already circulating in the
roundabout always have the right of way, as do cars entering the round-
about from entrances to one’s right.
On certain sections of the motorway, where speeding is especially dan-
gerous, speed cameras have been installed. The cameras take a photo-
graph of any car exceeding the speed limit so that the police can trace
the culprit. You can see a camera symbol on entering these areas.
Surveillance cameras have also been installed at some traffic lights to
catch anyone who doesn’t stop for the red.
Chapter 7: Getting Around England 85

Following the rules of the road
You need to know some general facts if you plan to drive in England:
 All distances and speed limits are shown in miles and miles per
hour (mph). If you need to translate from the metric system, a kilo-
meter is 0.62 of a mile, and a mile is 1.62 kilometers. Speed limits
are usually
• 30mph (49kph) in towns
• 40mph (65kph) on some town roads where posted
• 60mph (97kph) on most single-carriageway (two-way) roads
• 70mph (113kph) on dual carriageways and motorways
 Road signs are usually the standard international signs. Buy a book-
let (available at many shops and in airports) called Highway Code
before you set out. The information in this book is essential for
driving in England.
 On major motorways, lanes closest to the outside edge of the 
road are intended for general driving, while the lanes closest to 
the median are intended for overtaking (passing) slower moving
vehicles.
 The law requires you to wear a seat belt. If you have children, make
sure that you ask the rental car agency about seat belts or car seats
before you rent.
 At roundabouts, traffic coming from the right has the right of way.
 You can pass other vehicles only on the right.
 Parking in the center of most big towns is difficult and expensive.
Make sure that you read all posted restrictions or park in a lot.
 You must stop for pedestrians in crosswalks marked by striped
lines (called zebra crossings) on the road. Pedestrians have the
right of way.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
86
The royal fast lane
In 2001, Princess Anne, the 50-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth, was found guilty
of driving her Bentley at 93 mph in a 70-mph zone on a two-lane road in rural
Gloucestershire. The princess had a unique defense: She claimed that she thought
the police cars flashing their lights behind her were offering an escort, so she didn’t
slow down. A local magistrate fined her several hundred pounds.

Coping with emergencies on the road
All motorways have emergency telephones stationed a kilometer apart.
Markers at every tenth of a kilometer point to the nearest phone. The
phone operator can get emergency or automotive services for you if you
need them. Motorway service stations are usually about 40km (25 miles)
apart and occasionally as far as 80km (50 miles) apart.
Filling up the tank
Petrol (gasoline) stations are self-service. Use the green filler pipe for
unleaded petrol, the red filler pipe for leaded petrol, and the black filler
pipe for diesel fuel.
Petrol is often cheapest at supermarkets. (Yes, they may have pumps
outside.) But going to a motorway service station is more convenient.
You buy petrol by the liter (3.78 liters = 1 gallon). Expect to pay about £1
($2) per liter (approximately $8 per gallon) for unleaded petrol.

Accommodations

C
hant this as your mantra: “I will not arrive in London without a
hotel reservation. I will not arrive in . . . “ Reserving a room is espe-
cially important if you plan to be in London from mid-April to early
October (high season). If you arrive in London with a hotel reservation,
you don’t have to waste your precious time trying to find a place to stay.
Booking ahead isn’t quite as important in the rest of England, but I rec-
ommend that you do it — particularly if you’re going to spend a Friday
or Saturday night in a major tourist spot such as Stratford-upon-Avon or
in a resort town such as Brighton. Hotels in popular tourist areas, such
as the Cotswolds, Cornwall, and the Lake District, also fill up fast in June,
July, and August. Off season, and especially in the middle of winter, you
don’t have a problem booking a room on the spot, wherever you are.
You can find tourist information centers in all the larger towns and the
national parks, and they can always help you find a room. In most cases,
tourist information centers charge 10 percent of the first night’s hotel
rate, but you get that back at the hotel, so the service ends up costing
nothing.
Finding the Right Place for You
Accommodations in England are available in varying price ranges and
degrees of luxury. Places to stay generally fit into one of two categories:
hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns (B&Bs).
The situation in London — one of Europe’s most visited cities — differs
from the rest of England. The selection of hotels is far greater than you’ll

find elsewhere in England, and they cost considerably more money. But
London does offer good budget hotels and plenty of B&Bs that won’t
render you unconscious when you see the bill. If you have a few more
dollars (pounds, that is) to throw around, you can choose among unique
boutique hotels, large chain hotels, and several ultraluxurious places.
Other options include self-catering hotels (where the rooms come
equipped with small kitchens) or fully equipped flats (apartments).
Outside London, prices generally drop by half for small B&Bs and by
about one-third or more for hotels. The distinction between B&B and
hotel is less obvious outside of the capital because most places, even
large hotels, include breakfast with the room, which isn’t the case at
most high-end hotels in London. In small towns and rural villages, you
can also experience a “real” B&B — a home where a family resides and
rents out one or two bedrooms. You can also find marvelous country-
house hotels, where you get impeccable service and pay astronomical
prices. Away from the big city, many hotels also offer dinner to guests
for a special half-board rate.
Brits, and Europeans in general, aren’t as committed to smoke-free envi-
ronments as North Americans. But this attitude is changing, and in July
2007, all pubs and restaurants in England became smoke-free. More and
more hotels and B&Bs in England are now completely smoke-free, too,
but hotels can continue to offer rooms for smokers. In the hotel descrip-
tions in this book, I always note completely smoke-free hotels.
Understanding the pros and cons of B&Bs
B&Bs in England are different from what you may have experienced else-
where. Most are former — usually old — homes, and the comfort and
services vary widely. (Some are current homes where you stay with the
family.) The plumbing can be unpredictable, as can the water tempera-
ture. Space is often scarce. But they do offer a slice of domestic life that
you can’t get in a larger, more anonymous hotel.
Because B&Bs are often private homes and not hotels, typical amenities
can also vary widely, especially in the bathroom facilities. Nearly all B&B
rooms contain washbasins, but you may have to share a bathroom down
the hall. To be licensed, B&Bs must be inspected by the local tourist board,
so generally speaking you’ll find that the facilities are scrupulously clean.
Many travelers prefer private bathrooms, but keep in mind that en-suite (in-
the-room) bathrooms are often so small that you feel as if you haven’t left
the airplane, and squeezing into the super tiny showers can be a trial.
The décor in many of the lowest-priced B&Bs is fairly unimpressive.
Coming back to a small room with mismatched furniture, avocado 
walls, and a tiny bathroom down the hall with no hot water may be an
inconvenience you’re willing to suffer for saving money, but I don’t rec-
ommend any such places in this book. You do have to pay more for the
more popular and well-appointed B&Bs, but their comforts and conven-
iences make them worth the price.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 89

What about the breakfast part of the B&B? Well, gone are the days when
the staff of every B&B cooked you up a full English breakfast (also known
as a fry-up) of eggs, sausages, bacon, fried tomatoes, and beans. Many
still do — especially outside London — but others put out a continental
buffet, which consists of cereals, fruits, and breads. The B&B descrip-
tions in this book say “rate includes English breakfast” or “rate includes
continental breakfast” so that you know what to expect.
The overall quality of B&Bs has improved greatly over the years. I rec-
ommend them for people who don’t require many extras, although the
most successful B&Bs continually upgrade their services or offer some
enticing amenities. For example, many B&Bs now provide cable TV and
direct-dial phones in the rooms.
If you’re physically disabled or infirm in any way, B&Bs may not be the
choice for you. B&Bs usually don’t have elevators, so you may have to
carry your luggage up steep, narrow stairs. Be sure to check how acces-
sible the B&B is before making reservations.
Exploring hotel choices
England offers a wide choice of hotels. Some inexpensive ones provide
breakfast with a room rental; others charge an additional fee for the
most important meal of the day. At a four- or five-star hotel, you pay a
hefty price to eat breakfast on the premises. The guest rooms at a self-
catering hotel (see the section “Self-catering options,” later in this chap-
ter, for more about these rooms) come equipped with small kitchens so
that you can make breakfast, lunch, or dinner in your room.
In the following sections I describe the kinds of services and amenities
you can expect based on the type of accommodations you choose. But
you can get a pretty good sense of the level of pampering you’ll receive
based on price alone. Table 8-1 tells you what to expect from your holi-
day digs based on the amount of cash you dish out (prices are for
double rooms).

You are more likely to find these relatively

A bit classier, these midrange accommoda-

Higher-class still, these accommodations

amenities, and you can probably find a cafe

£201–£250 ($402–$500)
Hotels in this category generally meet high

letries, high-quality bedding, chocolates on
your pillow, a classy restaurant, and maybe
even expansive or romantic views. A fine
breakfast will be available, but you proba-
bly have to pay for it.

These top-rated accommodations gener-

and high-quality sheets, DVD/CD players,
and turn-down service — you get a great
experience, and you pay through the nose
for it. The great London hotels and the
exclusive country-house hotels generally
fall into this category, and they may include
a gourmet dinner and breakfast.
Boutique and deluxe hotels
More and more small hotels (and even upscale B&Bs) are now calling
themselves boutique hotels. In London, boutique hotels such as the 
41 (see Chapter 11), are midrange in size but not price; sumptuously 
furnished, they offer state-of-the-art amenities and full service.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 91

Older deluxe hotels, full of charm and character, offer a distinctly English
style. Older London hotels, such as The Gore or Hazlitt’s, have been
around for a century or more (see Chapter 11). Outside London, you can
routinely find hotels (such as The Mermaid Inn, in Rye; see Chapter 14)
that served as coaching inns 400 years ago. Perhaps the most atmos-
pheric hotels in England, they’re full of twisting stairways and oak-
beamed bedrooms (the bathrooms are always modern, however).
Chain properties
Maybe you always stay at one of the chain hotels — a Hyatt, a Hilton, a
Sheraton, a Radisson, a Best Western, or a Marriott. These newer places
are basically the same no matter where they are: They rely on their
brand name and a no-surprise approach to win customers. London is
chock-full of chain hotels, if that’s what you fancy. Outside the capital,
you also find chain hotels in most medium-size towns and in tourist-
heavy areas (such as the Lake District), but you may not recognize the
names. Keep your eyes open for Thistle, one reliable British chain. Its
hotels aren’t always new; some are in historic properties. Most chain
hotels cater to large groups, and you may feel rather anonymous in
them. On the other hand, these hotels usually come well equipped for
people with disabilities and families with children. For a list of chain
hotels in England, see the Appendix.
Landmark and country-house hotels
At the top of the hotel spectrum, in both price and prestige, are the 
landmark hotels and country-house hotels. In London, the Dorchester,
Claridge’s, and the Park Lane Sheraton Hotel (see Chapter 11 for all)
rank among the world’s best hotels. You can expect glamorous public
salons (and glamorous fellow guests), a generously proportioned and
well-decorated room with a large private bath, an on-site health club or
access to one nearby, and top-of-the-line service.
Country-house hotels are a world unto themselves. Former private estates
set within landscaped gardens, they typify a world of privilege and tradi-
tion, and work hard to make their guests feel pampered and comfort-
able. You can always expect fine gourmet cooking and a full range of
amenities, including room service and an on-site health club. You can
find two outstanding country-house hotels in Gidleigh Park in Devon
(see Chapter 17) and Middlethorpe Hall in Yorkshire (see Chapter 21).
Self-catering options
In London, you can also consider staying at a self-catering hotel, where you
do the cooking in your own hotel room. (Astons Apartments in London,
which you can read about in Chapter 11, is the only self-catering hotel
that I list in this book.) For short stays and for one or two people, self-
catering hotels don’t always beat the competition’s price. But for fami-
lies and people who can’t afford or don’t want to eat every meal out,
self-catering hotels can really save your budget. Outside of London, you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
92

find few self-catering hotels; instead, you find self-catering flats (apart-
ments) or holiday homes that you can rent for a week or more.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rate you pay for a room depends on many factors, the most impor-
tant being the way you make your reservation. The strategies in this sec-
tion can help you get the best rate available.
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
These are the rates I’ve listed in this book. Hotels are happy to charge
you the rack rate, but you can almost always do better. Perhaps the best
way to avoid paying the rack rate is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a
cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised.
A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with certain hotels
than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel often gives the
agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her business toward
that hotel.)
You may get a lower rate by reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-
free number rather than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the
central reservations number may not know about discount rates at spe-
cific locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number, and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier pro-
grams, and any other corporate rewards programs you belong to when
you call to book. Budget hotels and small B&Bs rarely offer these organi-
zation discounts, but you never know unless you ask.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 93
Renting your own historic cottage
The National Trust owns and operates scores of castles, gardens, and stately homes
throughout England, many of them featured in this book. But it also rents out a fabu-
lous selection of historic holiday cottages in cities, towns, and the countryside. These
self-catering properties are charming and unusual (I know, I’ve rented one) and can
provide an unforgettable vacation for those seeking something out of the ordinary. To
browse their collection of rental properties, simply go to www.nationaltrust
cottages.co.uk.

You may be able to save 20 percent or more by traveling off season,
which is mid-October to mid-December and January to March.
The best hotel and B&B rates are probably available through package
tours that include airfare and hotel (see Chapter 6 for more about pack-
age tours). With these packages, which are sometimes astonishingly
cheap, you have to choose a hotel that’s part of the package. Packages
offered by airlines tend to include larger chain hotels. So what? The
money you save may amount to hundreds of dollars.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
You generally shop online for hotels in one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency, like Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop you must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia (www.expedia.com) offers a long list of
special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so that
you can see what you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter the
claims that hotels often hold back the best rooms from bargain booking
Web sites). Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) posts unvarnished cus-
tomer reviews and ranks its properties according to the AAA rating
system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent
free program, Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search
multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard of —
and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes
and service charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travel-
web.com), is partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the
Hilton, Hyatt, and Starwood chains) and therefore plugs directly into the
hotels’ reservations systems — unlike independent online agencies,
which have to fax or E-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good
portion of which get misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers
have arrived at the hotel only to be told that they have no reservation.
To be fair, many of the major sites are undergoing improvements in serv-
ice and ease of use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into
the reservations systems of many hotel chains — none of which can be
bad news for you. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation
number and make a printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com) and
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com) get even better prices for hotels than for
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
94

airfares; with both sites, you get to pick the neighborhood and quality
level of your hotel before offering up your money, though they’re much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding
anything at the bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; BiddingforTravel gives you a fairly up-
to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both
Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable.
Note: Some hotels don’t provide loyalty program credits or points or
other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque
online services.
Some good England-specific Web sites that you can use to track down
and make online reservations at hotels in England follow:
 British Hotel Reservation Centre (www.bhrc.co.uk): Lists current
and seasonal specials at selected London and U.K. hotels.
 The Independent Traveller (www.gowithit.co.uk): Lists hun-
dreds of self-catering accommodations in London. These are pri-
vate flats, not hotels, and are available for a one-week minimum
period; they can be a fantastic bargain.
 London Bed & Breakfast (% 800/872-2632 in the U.S. or 020/
7351-3445 in the U.K.; www.londonbandb.com): Provides inexpen-
sive accommodations in select private homes.
 Londontown.com (www.londontown.com): Web site that has a 
long list of London properties to choose from, and some really
good prices.
 Refresh Accommodation (www.refreshaccommodation.com): A
great new site that lists self-catering flats throughout London in all
price ranges, from £70 ($140) per night.
 Wired Seniors (www.wiredseniors.com): A site for seniors that
includes home and apartment exchanges.
 Uptown Reservations (www.uptownres.co.uk): Provides listings
for dozens of B&Bs in private homes in London.
Reserving the Best Room
Asking one or two more pointed questions before you make your reser-
vation can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in
the house. Always ask for a corner room. These rooms are usually larger,
quieter, and have more windows and light than standard rooms, and
they don’t always cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is,
request a room away from the renovation work. Ask, too, about the loca-
tion of the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 95

annoying noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you
arrive, talk to the front desk. If they have another room, they should be
happy to accommodate you, within reason.
If you need a room where you can smoke, request one when you reserve.
If you can’t bear the lingering smell of smoke, tell everyone who handles
your reservation that you need a smoke-free room. Hotels in England
usually have nonsmoking rooms; more and more establishments are
entirely smoke free.

People with disabilities need to ensure that their itineraries offer wheel-

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an
insurmountable challenge. But you may find family travel immensely
rewarding, giving you new ways of seeing the world through smaller
pairs of eyes.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with
Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), another site that offers
customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamily
travelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a directory of
off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.

Admission prices for attractions in London and throughout England are
reduced for children 5 to 15 years old. Children under 5 almost always
enter free. If you’re traveling with one or two children ages 5 to 15,
always check to see whether the attraction offers a money-saving family
ticket, which considerably reduces the admission price for a group of
two adults and two children.
Locating family-friendly accommodations 
and restaurants
Most hotels can happily accommodate your family if you reserve your
rooms in advance and let the staff know that you’re traveling with kids.
The establishment may bring in an extra cot or let you share a larger
room; these types of arrangements are common. Smaller bed-and-break-
fasts (B&Bs) may present problems, such as cramped rooms and shared
toilet facilities, and some places don’t accept children at all. Ask ques-
tions before you reserve.
London and many of England’s midsize cities have plenty of American-
style fast-food places, including Burger King, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, and
KFC. You don’t find these chains in smaller villages and towns, however.
If you need a family-friendly spot, consult the pages of this book. I point
out plenty of places where you can take the kids.
Expensive, high-toned restaurants in England aren’t particularly wel-
coming to young children. The menus aren’t geared to the tastes of
American youngsters; the prices are high; and the staff can be less than
accommodating.
To keep costs down, rent a hotel room with a kitchen (in England, these
rooms are called self-catering units), and prepare your own meals. Another
option, when the weather cooperates, is to take the family on a picnic.
London’s Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 12) and the parks of Windsor
Castle and Warwick Castle (check out Chapters 13 and 19, respectively)
are great outdoor destinations. When in London, you can also take
advantage of pretheater fixed-price menus (usually served 5:30–7 p.m.),
which usually give you a good deal.
Younger teens traveling in London probably want to check out the 
Hard Rock Cafe (check out Chapter 11) or the scene at the Trocadero
in Piccadilly Circus (see Chapter 11 for information on this neighbor-
hood), which offers theme restaurants, such as Planet Hollywood and
the Rainforest Café. London is a good place to introduce more adventur-
ous kids to Chinese or Indian cuisine, or to the communal dining experi-
ence offered by Wagamama Japanese noodle restaurants.
Letting your younger children read Peter Pan or Peter Pan in Kensington
Gardens and telling them about his statue there can generate excitement
about the trip. Slightly older children may enjoy the Harry Potter series,
which takes place in real and fictional settings in London and around the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
98

country. (If your kids have already read the series, they know that Harry
shops in Diagon Alley in London before he goes off to school at Hogwarts.)
Older children may enjoy the thought of traveling around London in the
Underground (called the Tube) or taking a boat trip down the Thames.
With the information in this book and some online investigating, you can
also incite your kids’ curiosity about historic sites, such as the Tower of
London (see Chapter 12), Stonehenge (see Chapter 16), and Warwick
Castle (see Chapter 19).
Hiring a baby-sitter in England
Maybe you really need a relaxing evening at the opera and a romantic
late dinner. But you can’t take Junior along on this special evening. What
are your options? Ask your hotel staff if they can recommend a local
baby-sitting service. Most of the hotels marked with a Kid Friendly icon
in this book can help arrange baby-sitting. London also has several
respected and trustworthy baby-sitting agencies that provide registered
nurses and carefully screened mothers, as well as trained nannies, to
watch children. One old and trustworthy baby-sitting service is Universal
Aunts (% 020/7386-5900; www.universalaunts.co.uk), which charges
£11 ($22) per daytime hour, £9 ($18) evenings until midnight (three-hour
minimum for both), plus a £19 ($38) agency fee.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
England doesn’t present any problems for you if you’re a senior who
gets around easily. If this is not the case for you, be aware when planning
your trip that some hotels don’t have elevators — particularly less
expensive B&Bs. The steep staircases in some places are a test for
anyone with luggage. When you reserve a hotel, ask whether you have
access to an elevator (or lift, as Brits call it).
Being a senior may entitle you to some terrific travel bargains, such as
lower prices for BritRail passes and reduced admission at theaters,
museums, and other attractions. Always ask, even if the attraction 
doesn’t have the reduction posted. Carrying ID with proof of age can pay
off in all these situations. Note: You may find that some discounts, such
as public transportation reductions in London, are available only to U.K.
residents.

Accessing England: Information 
for Travelers with Disabilities
There are more options and resources for travelers with disabilities than
ever before. Most hotels and restaurants happily accommodate people
with disabilities. London’s top sights and many of the attractions in
other towns and regions are wheelchair accessible. (Call first to make
arrangements and get directions to special entrances and elevators.)
Theaters and performing-arts venues are usually wheelchair accessible
as well (again, call first).
Persons with disabilities often can get special discounts at sightseeing
and entertainment venues in Britain. They call these discounts conces-
sions (often shortened to concs).
Before departing on your trip, contact VisitBritain (see the Appendix 
for addresses and phone numbers) and request a copy of its Disabled
Traveler Fact Sheet, which contains some helpful general information.
Access London ($22) is the best and most comprehensive London guide
for people with disabilities and anyone with a mobility problem. The
book provides full access information for all the major sites, hotels, and
modes of transportation. You can order it at www.amazon.com.
The United Kingdom has several information resources for travelers
with disabilities. The best of these resources include the following:
 Artsline (% 020/7388-2227; www.artsline.org.uk) provides
advice on the accessibility of London arts and entertainment
events. The Society of London Theatres (32 Rose St., London
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
100

WC2E 9ET; www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk) also offers a
free guide called Access Guide to London’s West End Theatres.
 Holiday Care/Tourism for All Holidays Ltd. (Sunley House, 4
Bedford Park, Croyden, Surrey CR0 2AP; % 0845/124-9971 in the
U.K., 020/8760-0072 outside the U.K.; www.holidaycare.org.uk)
offers information and advice on suitable accommodations, trans-
portation, and other facilities in England.
 The National Trust (% 020/7447-6742; www.nationaltrust.
org.uk) is a British organization that owns and operates hundreds
of historic properties (castles, gardens, and more) throughout
England. For details on accessibility at each site, download the
National Trust Access Guide from their Web site. Although not 
all National Trust sites are accessible, the organization provides
powered four-wheeled vehicles free of charge at more than 50 prop-
erties; you can drive yourself or have a companion or volunteer
drive for you.
 RADAR (Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation),
12 City Forum, 250 City Rd., London EC1 8AF (% 020/7250-3222;
www.radar.org.uk) publishes information for travelers with dis-
abilities in Britain.
U.S.-based organizations that offer assistance to travelers with dis-
abilities include MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which pro-
vides a library of accessible-travel resources online; SATH (Society for
Accessible Travel and Hospitality) (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org;
annual membership fees: $49 adults, $29 seniors and students), which
offers a wealth of travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed
recommendations on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour
operators, vehicle rentals, and companion services; and the American
Foundation for the Blind (AFB) (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a
referral resource for the blind or visually impaired that includes informa-
tion on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities,
the community Web site iCan (www.icanonline.net/channels/travel/
index.cfm) has destination guides and several regular columns on
accessible travel. Also check out the quarterly magazine Emerging
Horizons ($17 per year, $22 outside the U.S.; www.emerginghorizons.
com), which is full of information and resources for the traveler with 
disabilities.
Considering the benefits of escorted tours
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537; www.disability
travel.com) offers tours of Britain and London in minibuses or motor-
coaches. The Guided Tour (% 800-783-5841; E-mail: gtour400@aol.com)
has one- and two-week guided tours for individuals, with one staff member
for every three travelers. Undiscovered Britain (% 215/969-0542; www.
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 101

undiscoveredbritain.com) provides specialty travel and tours for
individuals, small groups, or families traveling with a wheelchair user.
Dealing with access issues
In October 2004, part III of the Disability Discrimination Act — which
requires anyone offering a service to remove physical barriers that 
prevent people with disabilities from accessing it — went into effect
throughout the U.K. What this means is that more and more businesses
have become accessible, and access in general is easier than ever
before.
But don’t assume that every hotel, restaurant, and tourist attraction in
Britain provides wheelchair ramps. Most of the less expensive B&Bs and
older hotels don’t have elevators, or they have elevators that are too
small for a wheelchair (buildings given historic status can’t always
change their interior structure). Ask about this issue when you reserve
your room or table.
England’s better-known museums and attractions are accessible, but in
some cases, you have to use a different entrance. Call the attraction to
find out about special entrances, ramps, elevator locations, and general
directions.
Trains throughout the United Kingdom now have wide doors, grab 
rails, and provisions for wheelchairs. The National Rail Web site (www.
nationalrail.co.uk) has a section on travel for people with disabili-
ties and contact details for the various train operating companies.
Travelers with disabilities may want to keep the following in mind when
traveling in London:
 Although London’s streets and sidewalks are in good repair, you
don’t find as many modern curb cuts as in younger cities. (In other
historic towns, such as Rye, you have to deal with cobblestones.)
 Not all the city’s Underground (“Tube” or subway) stations have
elevators and ramps.
 Not all public buses are wheelchair accessible.
 You can fit a wheelchair in London’s black cabs.
 Victoria Coach Station in Central London has Braille maps.
The following organizations provide access information and services for
travelers with disabilities in London:
 Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk) pub-
lishes a free brochure called Tube Access, available in Underground
stations, and has information that you can download on its Web
Part II: Planning Your Trip to England 
102

site. The organization also provides information on the wheelchair-
accessible minibus service (called Stationlink) between all the
major BritRail stations.
 Wheelchair Travel (1 Johnston Green, Guildford, Surrey GU2 6XS;
% 1483/233-640; fax: 01483/237-772; www.wheelchair-travel.
co.uk) is an independent transport service for the traveler with
disabilities arriving in London. The organization offers self-drive
cars and minibuses (although I strongly discourage anyone, with a
disability or not, from driving in London) and can provide wheel-
chairs. You can get a driver who acts as a guide if you ask.
Following the Rainbow: Resources for 
Gay and Lesbian Travelers
London has always been a popular destination for gays and lesbians,
even in the days (up to 1967) when homosexuality was a criminal offense
in Britain. Today, with a more tolerant government at the helm — and
civil partnerships offering same-sex couples the same rights as hetero-
sexual couples — gay pride is prominent. The government actually
spends money to promote gay tourism. The VisitBritain Web site at
www.visitbritain.com has information on gay venues and events
throughout England.
In London, you can find gay theaters, gay shops, more than 100 gay
pubs, famous gay discos, and gay community groups of all sorts. The
gay-friendly resort town of Brighton is also known for its pub and club
scene. Elsewhere in the country, at least in the larger cities, you can 
usually find a gay pub or two and clubs with at least one night a week 
for gays.
Old Compton Street in Soho is the heart of London’s Gay Village. The
area has dozens of gay pubs, restaurants, and upscale bars and cafes.
The Earl’s Court area, long a gay bastion, has a large gay population,
gay pubs, and many gay-friendly restaurants.
Lesbigay events in London include the London Lesbian and Gay Film
Festival in March, the Pride Parade and celebrations in June, and the
big outdoor bash known as Summer Rites in August. You can obtain
information and exact dates from London’s Lesbian and Gay
Switchboard (% 020/7837-7324; www.llgs.org.uk).
Brighton (which you can read more about in Chapter 14) is one of the
gayest seaside resort towns in Europe. From London, you can get there
on the train in under an hour.

As you plan your trip, you may want to check out the following Web
sites; all are specifically geared to gay and lesbian travelers to England:
 www.pinkpassport.co.uk
 www.gayguide.co.uk
 www.gaylondon.co.uk
 www.gaybritain.co.uk
 www.timeout.com, the online edition of Time Out magazine, with a
gay and lesbian section
Several gay magazines and publications, useful for their listings and
news coverage, are available in London’s gay pubs, clubs, bars, and
cafes. The most popular are Pink Paper (www.pinkpaper.com) and QX
(Queer Xtra; www.qxmagazine.com). Gay Times (www.gaytimes.co.uk),
which covers all England, is a high-quality monthly news-oriented mag
available at most news agents. Gay and Lesbian Yellow Pages (www.glyp.
com) is good for its citywide listings, Time Out (www.timeout.com)
appears at news agents on Wednesdays.
Gay’s the Word (66 Marchmont St., WC1; % 020/7278-7654; www.
gaystheword.co.uk; Tube: Russell Square), London’s only all-around
gay and lesbian bookstore, was still open as of press time — but it was
“under threat” and in danger of closing. The store stocks a wonderful
selection of new and used books and current periodicals.

B
efore you depart for England to visit the British Museum in London
or Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, you need to
take care of some final details. Do you have an up-to-date passport?
Have you taken steps to meet your health needs while you’re on your
trip? Are you wondering how to use a cellphone or access E-mail while in
England? This chapter gives you the information you need.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross international borders without it. Getting a pass-
port is easy, but the process takes some time. For up-to-date passport
requirements for countries around the world, check out the Consular
Information Sheets for individual nations at the U.S. State Department
Web site (start at http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/
cis/cis_1765.html).
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State
Department Web site, http://travel.state.gov/passport, or

call the National Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778)
for automated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
You may also want to bring along your driver’s license, state or mil-
itary ID, or social security card.
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2x2 inches.
You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine
because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee.
For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for 10 years and costs $97.
For those travelers 15 and under, a passport is valid for 5 years and
costs $82. For expedited service, add $60 per passport application.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; standard pro-
cessing in 2007 took 10 to 12 weeks. Expedited service, which requires an
additional fee, takes two to three weeks. If you use the expedited service,
it’s also a good idea to arrange overnight delivery (for an extra charge) to
send your passport application and receive your passport.
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $67. Whether you’re applying in person
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov/passport. For
general information, call the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-
0518). To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State
Department Web site or call the National Passport Information Center’s
toll-free number (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers information for citizens of Australia, Canada,
and New Zealand:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call 
the Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free
from Australia), or go to www.passports.gov.au for details on
how and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada, post offices, or from the central Passport Office, Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A
0G3 (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be
accompanied by two identical passport-size photographs and proof
of Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days if you
apply in person or about three weeks by mail.

 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download one from its Web site.
Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-225-050 in New Zealand 
or 04-474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.
Entering England with your passport
If you’re a citizen of the United States, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand,
you must have a passport with at least two months remaining until its
expiration to enter the United Kingdom. You need to show your passport
at the customs and immigration area when you arrive at a U.K. airport 
or port of entry. After your passport is stamped, you can remain in the
United Kingdom as a tourist for up to three months. You don’t need a visa
if you’re going to stay in England or the rest of the United Kingdom for
less than three months.
Keep your passport with you at all times or at least keep it in a safe place.
You need to show it only when you’re converting traveler’s checks or for-
eign currency at a bank or currency exchange. If you’re not going to need
your passport for currency exchanges, ask whether the hotel has a safe
where you can keep it locked up.
Dealing with a (gulp) lost passport
Don’t worry; you won’t be sent to the Tower of London if you lose your
passport in England, but you need to take steps to replace it immedi-
ately. First, notify the police. Then go to your consulate or high commis-
sion office (you can find them all in London). Bring all available forms of
identification, and the staff can get started on generating your new pass-
port. For the addresses of consulates and high commissions, see the
Appendix. Always call first to verify open hours.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is my advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance: Helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation 
can range from sickness to natural disasters to the U.S. State
Department’s declaring your destination unsafe for travel. 
(Insurers usually don’t cover vague fears, though, as many 
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 107

travelers discovered who tried to cancel their trips in October 2001
because they were wary of flying.)
Travel Guard International publishes Travel Guard Alerts, a list of
companies it considers high risk (www.travelguard.com). Protect
yourself further by paying for the insurance with a credit card —
by law, consumers can get their money back on goods and services
that they don’t receive if they report the loss within 60 days after
the charge appears on their credit card statement.
 Medical insurance: For travel overseas, most health plans (includ-
ing Medicare and Medicaid) don’t provide coverage, and the ones
that do often require you to pay for services upfront and reimburse
you only after you return home. Even if your plan does cover over-
seas treatment, most out-of-country hospitals, including those in
England, make you pay your bills upfront and send you a refund
only after you’ve returned home and filed the necessary paperwork
with your insurance company. As a safety net, you may want to buy
travel medical insurance. If you want to get yourself additional
medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.
medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance International (% 800-
821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for general information on
services, call the company’s Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc., at
% 800-777-8710).
 Lost-luggage insurance: Most travelers don’t need this insurance.
On domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per
ticketed passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions
of international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.05 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see if
your homeowner’s policy covers your valuables, get baggage insur-
ance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or
buy Travel Guard’s BagTrak product. Don’t buy insurance at the 
airport, as it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, as many valu-
ables (including books, money and electronics) aren’t covered by
airline policies.
If the airline loses your luggage, immediately file a lost-luggage
claim at the airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most air-
lines, you must report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within
four hours of arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage,
once found, directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com), Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com), Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com), and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick can ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs don’t listen to me any more than
they probably listen to you).
For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs upfront and 
be reimbursed later. For information on purchasing additional medical
insurance for your trip, see the preceding section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through Medic Alert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT) (% 716-754-4883, or 416-652-0137 in Canada; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries you
plan to visit.
Staying Connected by Cellphone
For some (and I’m one of them), a vacation means a vacation from the
telephone and E-mail. But other travelers want or need to stay con-
nected to home, family, or office wherever they go. You can stay con-
nected in England, and quite easily. But there are few things you need 
to know about using a cellphone or laptop while there.
GSM (Global System for Mobiles), the three letters that define much of 
the world’s wireless capabilities, describe a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens
of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 109
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis or, as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. You can develop this potentially
deadly condition by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin — for
too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and stretch
your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventive meas-
ures include frequently flexing your legs while sitting, drinking a lot of water, and avoid-
ing alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart
disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend
wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask
your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis
include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

Cingular use this quasiuniversal system; in Canada, Microcell and some
Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians 
use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone, such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across civilized areas on much of
the globe, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator, and
ask it to activate “international roaming” on your account. Unfortunately,
per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50 in England and
Western Europe.
So you may want to buy an “unlocked” world phone from the get-go. Many
cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you from using any
other removable computer-memory phone-chip card (called a SIM card)
other than the ones that they supply. Having an unlocked phone lets you
install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (which you can find at a local retailer) in
your destination country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all
phones work on all networks.) You get a local phone number — and
much, much lower calling rates. Getting an already locked phone
unlocked can be a complicated process, but you can do it if you really
want; just call your cellular operator, and say that you plan to go abroad
for several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.
You may decide that renting a phone makes the most sense. Although
you can rent a phone from any number of overseas sites, including
kiosks at airports and at car-rental agencies, I suggest renting the phone
before you leave home. That way, you can give loved ones and business
associates your new number, make sure the phone works, and take the
phone wherever you go — especially helpful for overseas trips through
several countries, where local phone-rental agencies often bill in local
currency and may not let you take the phone to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. It usually costs $40 to $50 per week, plus airtime
fees of at least a dollar a minute. If you’re traveling to England, though,
local rental companies often offer free incoming calls within their home
country, which can save you big bucks. The bottom line: Shop around.
Rent-a-Phone (% 800-400-7221 in the U.S. or 0800/317-540 in the U.K.) is
an international cellphone rental company with offices in the U.S. and
U.K.; per-minute charges from England are generally about $3 per minute
to the U.S. and Europe, and you can have the phones delivered to your
door in the U.S. before you leave. In Terminals 1 and 2 at Heathrow
Airport, you can buy a range of mobile phones and services, including
SIM cards, at Primus (% 020/8607-5960).
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626;
www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-
5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they can tell
you what wireless products you need. InTouch can also, for free, advise
you on whether your existing phone can work overseas; simply call

Accessing the Internet Away From Home
Travelers can use any number of ways to check their E-mail and access
the Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a
PDA (personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. More and more hotels, even some of the
smallest, have computers that allow guests to check their E-mail. But
even if you or your hotel don’t have a computer, you can still access
your E-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
Nowadays, you may have a hard time finding a city in England that doesn’t
have a few cybercafes, though you probably won’t find any cybercafes in
smaller towns and villages. Although there’s no definitive directory for
cybercafes — these are independent businesses, after all — you can 
start looking at www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer you can use to get to the Internet. And most public
libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. If you want to save money, avoid hotel business centers unless
you can use the service for free.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices mean you want to avoid
them whenever possible.
To retrieve your E-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it
has a Web-based interface tied to your existing E-mail account. If your
ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web serv-
ice (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home E-mail. For
more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based E-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your E-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — as long as your “target” PC is running and
has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner
cable). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried
about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to
access the GoToMyPC system.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 111

If you bring your own computer with you, the buzzword in Internet
access is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity). More and more hotels, cafes, and
retailers are signing on as wireless “hotspots” from which you can get a
high-speed connection without cable wires, networking hardware, or a
phone line. You can get a Wi-Fi connection in one of several ways. Many
laptops now have built-in Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet
connection). Mac owners have their own networking technology, Apple
AirPort. If you have an older computer, you can plug an 802.11b/Wi-Fi
card (which costs around $50) into your laptop. You sign up for wireless
access service like you do cellphone service, through a plan offered by
one of several commercial companies that have made wireless service
available in airports, hotel lobbies, and coffee shops, primarily in the U.S.
(followed by the U.K. and Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.
com/hotspot) serves up wireless connections at Starbucks coffee shops
throughout England. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.
wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel 
lobbies. iPass providers also give you access to a few hundred wireless
hotel lobby setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four
Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a nice couch
in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be byzantine, with a
variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but in general
you pay around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and more
companies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even
more competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.

Surfing at Internet cafes in London
The easyInternetcafé chain has seven Internet cafes in the London — but cafe is really
a misnomer because the hundreds of screens in the largest locations make them look
like telemarketing sweatshops, and you don’t hear any conversation, just the clicking
of keyboards. The charging system is radical because surfers buy credit, not minutes.
The minimum spend is £2 ($4), and the amount of time you get for those couple of
pounds is in inverse proportion to how busy the branch is. The cafe adjusts the rate
every five minutes and posts the new rate on video screens, a bit like a stock
exchange. Your ticket has a user ID, which notes the current rate when you first log
on. That becomes your rate. You never pay more during your visit, but if things quiet
down, your credit can buy you more time — a pound can buy you up to six hours, or
so they claim. easyInternetcafé’s hours vary, so check www.easyeverything.com
for hours as well as new branches to add to this list: 358 Oxford St., W1 (Tube: Bond
Street); 9–16 Tottenham Court Rd., W1 (Tube: Tottenham Court Road); 160–166
Kensington High St. (Tube: Kensington High Street); and 456–459 Strand, WC2 (Tube:
Charing Cross). The telephone number for all locations is % 020/7241-9000.

If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout England and the rest of the U.K. offer dataports for laptop
modems, and many offer free high-speed Internet access via an Ethernet
network cable. You can bring your own cables, but most hotels rent them
for around $10. Call your hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world, let-
ting you go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site,
or call its toll-free number to ask how you can use your current account
away from home and how much it can cost. If you’re traveling outside the
reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers in most of the
world’s countries. You have to sign up with an iPass provider, which then
tells you how to set up your computer for your destination(s). For a list 
of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com. One solid provider is i2roam
(% 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
North American current runs 110V, 60 cycles; the standard voltage
throughout Britain is 240V AC, 50 cycles. You need a current converter
or transformer to bring the voltage down and the cycles up. Two-
pronged North American plugs don’t fit into the three-pronged square
British wall sockets, so you also need a three-pronged square adapter
and converter if you use North American laptops or appliances while in
England. You can find plug adapters and converters at most travel, lug-
gage, electronics, and hardware stores. Some plug adapters are also cur-
rent converters. Most contemporary laptop computers automatically
sense the current and adapt accordingly.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports have become more stable and consistent. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee, and she can probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for inter-
national flights.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And e-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with e-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 113

their home computers. Online check-in involves logging on to your air-
line’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out your board-
ing pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If
you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card you used to
book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass
from the kiosk, and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your
pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-
row seat, you can do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller air-
lines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to
make sure of these alternatives. Curbside check-in is also a good way 
to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call
before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide you with a
wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects, such as big
belt buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
passengers with disabilities or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. The general rule is that sharp things and bottled water are out,
and nail clippers are okay. Any liquids or gels must be in a three-ounce
or less container and placed in a see-through quart-sized plastic bag,
which is put separately through the scanner. (Once you’ve passed
through security, you can buy bottled water and bring it on the plane.)
Bring food in your carry-on rather than checking it, as explosive-
detection machines used on checked luggage have been known to mis-
take food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers
in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item” such as 
a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of
things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still consid-
ered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of restricted items; check
its Web site (www.tsa.gov) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that they need to search your checked
luggage by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and relock a checked bag if they need to hand-search it.
Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and at
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors
with a special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.
travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved
locks, your lock will be cut off if a TSA agent needs to hand-search your
luggage.

London and Environs

In this part . . .
F
or many travelers, a trip to England begins and ends in
London. That’s why I devote an entire part of this guide
to the United Kingdom’s capital. Chances are you’ll ﬂy into
one of London’s airports and use the city as your major trans-
portation and cultural hub. London is one of the world’s
major tourist magnets. After you start exploring, you under-
stand just why so many people love this city.
In Chapter 11, I help you settle into this exciting metropolis. I
explain how to get into the city from the airport, and then I
describe Central London’s neighborhoods and tell you about
the transportation options available. Next, I list my recom-
mended hotels and give advice for ﬁnding a room if you arrive
without a reservation. And ﬁnally, I give you a list of restau-
rants in all price ranges that feature different kinds of cuisine.
Chapter 12 helps you explore London in your own way and 
at your own pace. I describe the top attractions — those
places you absolutely don’t want to miss — and a host of
other intriguing sights that may interest you. I explain options
for touring by bus, boat, or foot. Next, I delve into London’s
truly mind-boggling shopping scene, as well as its array of
theater and nightlife possibilities.
Chapter 13 introduces you to several great side trips from
London — places you can easily visit in a day, returning in
time for dinner and a show. You’ll ﬁnd all you need for enjoy-
able day trips to Cambridge, Oxford, Hampton Court Palace,
Blenheim Palace, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (Kew
Gardens), and Windsor Castle.

s the oft-quoted Dr. Samuel Johnson observed more than 200 years
ago, “When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.” Year-round,
millions from all corners of the globe visit the U.K. capital. London is
famed for its venerable monuments, splendid museums, royal palaces,
magnificent parks, literary associations, exciting nightlife, and super
shopping. For many visitors, a trip to England begins and ends in
London.
This city may be old and full of quaint corners and age-old traditions,
but London isn’t a stodgy place. Trend-setting London is to the United
Kingdom what New York City is to the United States: the spot where
everything happens first (or ultimately ends up). This ancient metropo-
lis is as high-tech as a hyperlink, with mobile phones, cybercafes, and 
e-communications part of everyday life. In this city, you can see the tra-
ditional and the cutting edge on the same street corner. An enormous
city with more than 7 million inhabitants, London harbors a diversity of
sights, sounds, and experiences that make it as fascinating today as it
was for Dr. Johnson.
Getting There
As the capital and largest city in the United Kingdom, London doesn’t
lack transportation options. The city acts as a huge international hub,
which makes travel to London from overseas and the Continent easy.

Flying to London
London has five airports, but chances are you’ll fly into Heathrow or
Gatwick, which handle the bulk of London’s international flights. The air-
ports manage tens of thousands of visitors per day and are geared to
moving people efficiently from point A to point B.
Arriving at Heathrow
About 24km (15 miles) west of Central London, Heathrow (% 0870/
000-0123; www.baa.co.uk) is the largest of London’s airports, with four
passenger terminals (and a fifth under construction) serving flights from
around the globe. The corridors are surrealistically long, but moving
walkways make your trek easier. And everything is signposted, so you
won’t get lost.
Your first stop after deplaning is Passport Control and Customs, which
involves a fairly routine procedure. On the plane, you receive a landing
card to fill out. You must provide your name, your address, your passport
number, and the address where you’re staying in the United Kingdom.
Present this completed form and your passport to the passport official.
After the official stamps your passport, you pick up your luggage. From
there, you wend your way out through the Customs Hall.
After clearing Customs, you enter the terminal’s main concourse. All
sorts of services are available, including ATMs, hotel-booking agencies,
theater-booking services, banks, and bureaux de change (currency

It’s about time! 
Heathrow’s new Terminal 5
Heathrow Airport was initially built to serve about 45 million passengers a year, but
for a decade now its four terminals have been processing upwards of 70 million. The
overcrowding was so bad that passengers voted Heathrow their least favorite airport
worldwide in a 2006 poll by TripAdvisor. Some of that passenger crush should be alle-
viated in March 2008, when Heathrow opens Terminal 5. The new terminal, which
serves British Airways, is a radical departure from the other four. Designed by archi-
tect Richard Rodgers, it features light stone floors (instead of much-trampled carpet-
ing) and glass facades (instead of windowless corridors) that provide views of Windsor
Castle and Wembley Stadium. With some 112 retail outlets, including upscale stores
like Prada and Harrods, shopping is a major component of the new terminal. And so
are eating and drinking—the terminal is home to bars, cafes, and a restaurant from
celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay featuring a one-hour menu. Once Terminal 5 is up and
running, Terminal 2 will be demolished and a new Heathrow East Terminal built on its
site. Once that’s open, Terminal 1 will be closed and Terminal 3 expanded. By that
time—a decade or more away—Heathrow will be back to its original four terminals.
But what’s really needed, say many, is another runway.

exchange) windows, where you can swap your dollars or traveler’s checks
for pounds and pence. (See Chapter 5 for information about changing
money.) If you want to pick up a free map and general info, go to the
London Tourist Board’s Tourist Information Centre in the Underground
station for Terminals 1, 2, and 3 (open daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m.).
You have several options for getting into the city from Heathrow. You
can travel by train, bus, or shuttle:
 The London Underground (% 020/722-1234): This subway
system, called the Underground or the Tube, provides the cheapest
mode of public transportation to Central London destinations. All
terminals at Heathrow link up with the Tube system. Follow the
Underground signs to the ticket booth. The Piccadilly Line gets
you into Central London in about 45 minutes for a fare of £4 ($8).
Underground trains run from all four Heathrow terminals every five
to nine minutes Monday to Saturday 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and
Sunday 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Buy a money-saving Travelcard (see
“Getting Around London,” later in this chapter) and you can use it
on other Underground trains and buses once you’re in London. 
The one potential hassle with the Underground is that the trains
don’t have luggage racks. You have to stash your bags as best you
can — behind your legs, on your lap, or to one side of the center
doors where the cars have more space. To reach your hotel on the
Underground, you may have to change trains or take a taxi from the
Underground station closest to your destination.
Be sure to keep your luggage with you at all times; security has
been stepped up since the Underground bombings of July 2005, and
any bags or packages that you leave unattended, even for a couple
of minutes, may be confiscated.
If the Underground is closed when you arrive, the N97 night bus
connects Heathrow with Central London. Buses (located in front of
the terminals) run every 30 minutes Monday to Saturday from mid-
night to 5 a.m. and Sunday from 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The trip takes
about an hour; the one-way fare costs £2 ($4).
 National Express buses (% 0870/580-8080; www.national
express.com): Providing service from the airport to Victoria Coach
Station in Central London, these buses may be a better alternative
to the Underground if you’re loaded down with heavy luggage
because there’s more room to store your bags. The fare is £4 ($8),
payable on the bus. Up to three buses an hour depart daily between
4 a.m. and 11:23 p.m. from the front of Heathrow’s terminals.
 The Heathrow Express train (% 0845/600-1515; www.heathrow
express.com): The fastest way into London, this train runs from all
four Heathrow terminals to Paddington Station in just 15 minutes.
The trains have air-conditioning, ergonomically designed seating,
and plenty of luggage space. The standard Express Class fare is
£15.50 ($31) one-way. You can buy tickets at the airport (machines
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 119

and ticket windows) or, for a £2 ($4) extra charge, on the train.
Service runs every 15 minutes from 5:10 a.m. to 11:10 p.m.
 Taxis: You may find taking a taxi from Heathrow into Central
London cost effective if you’re traveling in a group of two or three
people. You can order a taxi at the Taxi Information booths in
Terminal 3 (% 020/8745-4655) or Terminal 4 (% 020/8745-7302).
Expect to pay about £45 to £50 ($90–$100), plus a 10 percent tip, for
a trip of about 45 minutes. Taxis are available 24 hours a day.
Arriving at Gatwick
Gatwick (% 0870/0002-468; www.baa.co.uk), located about 45km 
(28 miles) south of Central London, is considerably smaller than Heathrow.
International flights arrive at the South terminal. Gatwick provides the
same services Heathrow does, except that the London Tourist Board
doesn’t have an office there.
The highway system from Gatwick into London is far less efficient than
from Heathrow, so buses, minivans, or cabs can end up taking two to
three hours if traffic is in a snarl.
You find fewer transportation options for getting into Central London:
 Gatwick Express train (% 0845/850-1530; www.gatwickexpress.
co.uk): Right in the South terminal, this is your best bet for getting
into Central London. The handy train serves airport passengers
only, offers plenty of room for luggage, and whizzes you from the
airport to Victoria Station in half an hour for £15 ($30). Trains run
daily every 15 minutes from 5:50 a.m. to 1:45 a.m.
 Southern train (% 08456/48-49-50): A local passenger train, the
Southern runs to Victoria Station in half an hour and costs £8.90
($18). Four trains an hour run during the day; they run hourly from
midnight to 5 a.m.
 National Express buses (% 0870/580-8080; www.national
express.com): The buses run from the airport to Victoria Coach
Station in Central London, departing from both the North and
South Terminal. The fare is £6.60 ($13), payable on the bus.
 Hotelink (% 01293/532-244; www.hotelink.co.uk): This minibus
service charges £24 ($48) to take you directly to your hotel.
Minibuses are available at the terminal on the half-hour in the
summer or on the hour in winter.
 Checker Cars: Taxis provide 24-hour service between Gatwick and
Central London. You find cars outside the terminals, or you can
order a taxi from the South terminal (% 01293/502-808) or the
North terminal (% 01293/569-790). Fares cost £77 ($154), plus tip
(and a £8/$16 congestion fee surcharge if your destination is in
Central London), for the 90-minute journey.
Part III: London and Environs 
120

Arriving at another London airport
If you fly from North America, you’ll arrive at Heathrow or Gatwick.
European travelers have three other airport options in London:
 About 53km (33 miles) northeast of Central London, Stansted
(% 08700/000-303; www.stanstedairport.com) is a single-terminal
airport used for national and European flights. The Stansted Express
(% 0845/600-1245; www.stanstedexpress.com) to Liverpool
Street Station takes 45 minutes and costs £15.50 ($31). Trains run
every 15 minutes daily 5:30 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. A taxi fare into the
city averages about £60 ($120) plus tip.
 London City Airport (% 0207/646-000; www.londoncityairport.
com): A mere 10km (6 miles) from the city center, this airport serv-
ices European destinations only. A new extension of the Docklands
Light Railway (DLR) travels from the airport to Bank Street, in Central
London, in 22 minutes (£4/$8); the Underground requires an addi-
tional fare if you are traveling beyond Bank Street.
 Luton (% 01582/405-100; www.london-luton.co.uk): This small
independent airport 53km (33 miles) northwest of the city services
European charter flights. Travel by free shuttle bus to Luton Airport
Parkway station, then take a Capital Connection train to King’s
Cross Station in Central London for £11 ($22); the trip takes 30 to
45 minutes. Taxis into the city cost about £50 ($100), plus tip.
Taking the train
If you travel to London by train from the Continent, you’ll probably get
off the train near the English Channel and take a ferry or hovercraft (a
high-speed ferry) across the water (see Chapter 6 for more information
on crossing the Channel). You disembark at one of the United Kingdom’s
Channel ports. The ports closest to London are Dover, Ramsgate, and
Folkestone to the east, and Southampton, Portsmouth, and Newhaven to
the south. From whichever port you end up at, you take another train
into London. Trains connecting with ferries on the U.K. side of the
Channel generally go to Liverpool Street Station, Victoria Station, or
Waterloo Station. The Eurostar Chunnel trains arrive from Paris and
Brussels at St. Pancras/King’s Cross. (The Chunnel is the tunnel beneath
the English Channel.) On the super convenient Eurostar, you don’t have
to make any train–boat–train transfers along the way.
London’s train stations are bustling beehives of activity. In them, you
find restaurants, bookstores, news agents, bureaux de change, and many
of the services you find at an airport. A tourist information center is
located in Waterloo Station Arrivals Hall (% 020/7620-1550; open daily
8:30 a.m.–10 p.m.).
London’s train stations link to the Underground system. Just look for the
Underground symbol (a circle with a horizontal line through it). Waterloo
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 121

links to the Northern and Bakerloo lines; Victoria connects with the
District, Circle, and Victoria lines; Liverpool Street links to the Circle,
East London, Metropolitan, and Central lines. (See “Getting Around
London,” later in this chapter, for more information about the
Underground.) Taxi ranks wait outside all the train stations.
Orienting Yourself in London
From its beginnings nearly 2,000 years ago as a Roman garrison town
called Londinium, London has grown steadily and in a somewhat pell-
mell fashion, swallowing up what were once small villages. Today,
Greater London encompasses a whopping 1,611 sq. km (622 square
miles), an area larger than some of England’s national parks. The main
tourist portion of London covers only a fraction of that (65 sq. km/25 sq.
miles at the most).
London’s size, along with its confusing and sometimes oddly named
streets and its seemingly endless plethora of neighborhoods, confounds
many visitors — and Londoners as well. To help you find your way
around, I strongly suggest that you buy a copy of London A to Z (z is pro-
nounced “zed”). You can pick up this indexed street map at the airport,
at just about any bookstore, or from any news agent.
Introducing the Neighborhoods
London grew up along the north and south banks of the River Thames,
which snakes through the city in a long, loose S curve. This great tidal
river has played a major role in London’s growth and prosperity through
the ages. Most of London’s major tourist sights, hotels, and restaurants
are on the river’s north bank. London’s south bank, home to several
famous performing arts venues, has undergone major gentrification in
the past two decades, especially the area right along the river.
Central London, on the north bank of the Thames, is considered the city
center. Londoners think of this district as roughly the area covered by the
Circle Line Underground route, with Paddington Station anchoring the
northwest corner, Earl’s Court at the southwest corner, Tower Hill at 
the southeast corner, and Liverpool Street Station at the northeast corner.
Central London is divided into three areas: The City of London, the West
End, and West London.
All London street addresses include a designation, such as SW1 or EC3.
These codes represent postal districts, like ZIP codes in the United
States. When you actually hit the streets, the postal district designations
don’t matter as much as the nearest Tube stop.
For the locations of the districts in the following sections, see the
“London’s Neighborhoods” map on p. 124.
Part III: London and Environs 
122

The City of London
The City of London is a self-governing entity extending south from
Chiswell Street to the Thames. The area is bounded to the west by
Chancery Lane and to the east by the Tower of London, its most impor-
tant historic monument. Fleet Street, the former heart of newspaper
publishing, cuts through the center of the district to Ludgate Circus,
where it becomes Ludgate and leads to St. Paul’s Cathedral. Built on top
of the original 1 square mile the Romans called Londinium is an area
called The City. Today, this area is the Wall Street of England, home to
the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and the Stock Exchange. The
major Tube stops are Blackfriars, Tower Hill, St. Paul’s, Liverpool Street
Station (the main rail terminus in this area), Bank, Barbican, and
Moorgate.
West End
The West End (that is, west of The City) may be loosely called “downtown”
London. For most people, the West End is synonymous with the theater,
entertainment, and shopping areas around Piccadilly Circus and Leicester
Square. But the West End actually includes a host of neighborhoods:
 Holborn: Abutting the City of London to the west, the old borough
of Holborn serves as the legal heart of London. Barristers, solici-
tors, and law clerks scurry to and fro among the Inns of Court,
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, Royal Courts of Justice, and Old Bailey. This in-
between district is bounded roughly by Theobald’s Road to the
north; Farringdon Road to the east; the Thames to the south; and
Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster Place to the west. The major
Tube stops are Holborn, Temple, and Blackfriars.
 The Strand and Covent Garden: The northern section of The
Strand, the area west of Holborn, is Covent Garden, with Shaftesbury
Avenue as its northern boundary. The Strand, a major street run-
ning from Trafalgar Square to Fleet Street, is the principal thorough-
fare along the southern edge, with Charing Cross Road to the west
and Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster Place to the east. The major
Tube stops are Covent Garden, Leicester Square, and Charing
Cross.
 Bloomsbury: Just north of Covent Garden, New Oxford Street and
Bloomsbury Way mark the beginnings of the Bloomsbury district.
Home of the British Museum and several colleges and universities,
this intellectual pocket of Central London is bounded to the east by
Woburn Place and Southampton Row, to the north by Euston Road,
and to the west by Tottenham Court Road. The major Tube stops
are Euston Square, Russell Square, Goodge Street, and Tottenham
Court Road.
 Soho: The Soho neighborhood occupies the warren of densely
packed streets north of Shaftesbury Avenue, west of Charing Cross
Road, east of Regent Street, and south of Oxford Street. This lively

area is full of restaurants and nightclubs. London’s Gay Village cen-
ters on Old Compton Street. The major Tube stops are Leicester
Square, Covent Garden, and Tottenham Court Road.
 Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Charing Cross: Think 
of this area, just west of The Strand, as downtown London or
Theatreland. Piccadilly Circus, the area’s major traffic hub and
best-known tourist destination, feeds into Regent Street and
Piccadilly. Leicester Square and Shaftesbury Avenue, a few minutes’
walk to the east, house most of the West End theaters. From
Leicester Square, Charing Cross Road runs south to Trafalgar
Square, the National Gallery, and Charing Cross Station. The Tube
stops are Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Charing Cross.
 Mayfair: Elegant and exclusive Mayfair nestles comfortably
between Regent Street on the west, Oxford Street on the north,
Piccadilly on the south, and Hyde Park on the west. This area is the
land of luxury hotels and luxurious shopping. The major Tube
stops are Piccadilly Circus, Bond Street, Marble Arch, and Hyde
Park Corner.
 Marylebone: The neighborhood north of Mayfair and west of
Bloomsbury, Marylebone (Mar-lee-bone) abuts giant Regent’s Park.
Marylebone Road runs south of the park. Great Portland Street
marks the eastern boundary and Edgware Road, the western. You
may call this area “Medical London” because it has several hospi-
tals and the famous Harley Street Clinic. But perhaps the most
famous street is Baker Street, home of the fictional Sherlock
Holmes. Madame Tussauds wax museum on Marylebone Road
draws thousands of visitors. The major Tube stops are Baker
Street, Marylebone, and Regent’s Park.
 St. James’s: Considered “Royal London,” St. James’s is a posh green
haven beginning at Piccadilly and stretching southwest to include
Green Park and St. James’s Park, with Buckingham Palace between
them and St. James’s Palace across from St. James’s Park. Pall Mall
runs roughly east–west into the area and meets the north–south St.
James’s Street. Regent Street marks the eastern boundary. The
Tube stops are St. James’s Park and Green Park.
 Westminster: East and south of St. James’s, Westminster draws visi-
tors to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, the seat
of British government. Westminster extends from Northumberland
Avenue just south of Charing Cross to Vauxhall Bridge Road, with
the Thames to the east and St. James’s Park to the west. Victoria
Station, on the southwest perimeter, is a kind of axis for Westminster,
Belgravia, and Pimlico (see the next two listings). The Tube stops
are Westminster, St. James’s Park, and Victoria.
 Pimlico: The pie-shaped wedge of London extending west from
Vauxhall Bridge Road to Buckingham Palace Road is Pimlico.
Crowning it to the north is Victoria Station; the Tate Britain gallery,
Part III: London and Environs 
126

Pimlico’s major tourist draw, sits right on the Thames. The Tube
stops are Pimlico and Victoria.
 Belgravia: A posh quarter long favored by aristocrats, Belgravia
begins west of Victoria Station and Green Park, and extends south to
the river and west to Sloane Street; Hyde Park bounds the area to the
north. Many foreign embassies are located in Belgravia. The Tube
stops are Victoria, Hyde Park Corner, and Sloane Square.
West London
West London — still considered part of Central London — has several
distinctive neighborhoods filled with hotels, restaurants, great shopping,
and major tourist attractions:
 Knightsbridge: West of Belgravia, the fashionable residential and
shopping district of Knightsbridge is bounded to the north by Hyde
Park and to the west by Brompton Road, where you find Harrods,
the neighborhood’s chief shopping attraction. The Tube stops are
Knightsbridge and Sloane Square.
 Chelsea: Below Knightsbridge and west of Belgravia, Chelsea
begins at Sloane Square and runs south to the Thameside Cheyne
Walk and Chelsea Embankment. King’s Road, a bustling shopping
artery, acts as its northern boundary and Chelsea Bridge Road as
its eastern border. To the west, Chelsea extends as far as Earl’s
Court Road, Redcliffe Gardens, and Edith Grove. The Tube stop is
Sloane Square.
 South Kensington: Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park form the
green northern boundary of South Kensington. Frequently referred
to as Museumland, South Ken hops with hotels, restaurants, and
tourists flocking to the Natural History Museum, Science Museum,
and Victoria & Albert Museum. The district is bounded to the west
by Palace Gate and Gloucester Road, to the east by Fulham Road,
and to the south by busy Brompton Road. The Tube stops are
Gloucester Road and South Kensington.
 Kensington: The leafy residential neighborhood of Kensington 
fills the gap between Kensington Gardens and Holland Park, with
Notting Hill Gate and Bayswater Road marking its northern bound-
ary. Kensington Church Street runs north–south between Notting
Hill Gate and Kensington High Street. Kensington Palace, formerly
the home of Princess Diana, sits on the western side of Kensington
Gardens. The Tube stop is High Street Kensington.
 Earl’s Court: Beginning south of West Cromwell Road and extend-
ing down to Lillie Road and Brompton Road is the down-to-earth
Earl’s Court neighborhood. Its western boundary is North End
Road, and its eastern boundary is Earl’s Court Road. You won’t find
any major tourist attractions in Earl’s Court, which has long been a
haven for budget travelers (particularly Australians) and for gays
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 127

and lesbians. The area is being spruced up, but some streets still
look a bit frayed. The Tube stop is Earl’s Court.
 Notting Hill: Beginning north of Holland Park, Kensington Gardens,
and Hyde Park (Holland Park Avenue and Bayswater Road run along
the northern perimeter of the parks), you find Notting Hill and the
subneighborhood of Notting Hill Gate. The area is bounded by
Clarendon Road to the west, Queensway to the east, and Wesbourne
Grove to the north. The most famous street, Portobello Road, runs
north–south through the center. The superhip neighborhood was a
backdrop for the 1999 movie Notting Hill, starring Julia Roberts 
and Hugh Grant. The Tube stops are Notting Hill Gate, Bayswater,
and Queensway.
 Bayswater and Paddington: Picking up where Notting Hill ends,
Bayswater runs east to meet Marylebone at Edgware Road. The
roaring A40 (Westway) highway acts as its northern boundary.
Paddington Station sits in the northwestern corner of Bayswater.
This area is fairly commercial and not particularly attractive. Here,
you find no major tourist attractions and plenty of budget B&Bs.
The Tube stops are Paddington, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, and
Edgware Road.
 Shoreditch: London’s East End has no exact boundaries but basi-
cally extends east of The City to Canary Wharf. Historically, this
part of London has been home to working-class and immigrant
communities. Today, the area known as Shoreditch is one of London’s
hot new trendy zones, especially the area around Hoxton Square. The
primary tourist attraction in Shoreditch is the Geffrye Museum.
The South Bank
You probably don’t stay on the South Bank, but you may go to the South
Bank Centre for a play or a concert at one of its internationally known
arts and performance venues, all clustered beside the river within 
easy walking distance of Waterloo Station. The British Airways London
Eye, a high-rise observation wheel, revolves near Westminster Bridge.
For a scenic route to the South Bank, take the Tube to Embankment, on
the north bank, and walk across the Thames on the newly glitzed-up
Hungerford pedestrian bridge. The Jubilee Walkway, a breezy riverside
path, extends east from the South Bank Centre to the new Tate Modern
art gallery, the Globe Theatre, the new London City Hall, and Tower
Bridge. The new pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge spans the Thames
from the Tate Modern to St. Paul’s Cathedral. The Tube stops are
Waterloo, London Bridge, and Southwark.
Finding Information After You Arrive
The Britain & London Visitor Centre, 1 Lower Regent St., Piccadilly
Circus, SW1 (% 0870/156-6366; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), provides tourist
information to walk-in visitors. The office is open Monday from 9:30 a.m.

Wednesday.
Getting Around London
You can choose among many ways to get around London. If you travel
for any distance, the fastest mode of public transportation in this enor-
mous city is the Underground or Tube (the subway system). Many of the
slower but more scenic buses are double-deckers. Most convenient (and
most expensive) is to go by taxi. But walking is the most fun of all. When
you’re on foot, you see more and can explore some of the leafy squares
and cobbled lanes that contribute to London’s enduring charm.
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 129
The royal Dotty
Thanks to a dog named Dotty, Princess Anne, otherwise known as the Princess Royal,
became the first member of the modern royal family to have a criminal record. On April
1, 2003, Anne and her husband were walking their three English bull terriers in the park
around Windsor Castle (see Chapter 13). Dotty, one of the dogs, bolted away, knocked
over two boys on bicycles, and bit them. In court, Anne pleaded guilty to charges of
losing control of her dog and had to pay a £500 fine, £250 to the boys, and £148 in court
costs. Dotty escaped destruction but had to undergo retraining and had to be leashed
and muzzled in public.

For general London travel information, call % 020/7222-1234 or visit
the Transport for London Web site, www.tfl.gov.uk. You can get free
bus and Underground maps, and buy Travelcards and bus passes, at any
major Underground station or at the London Travel Information Centres
in the stations at King’s Cross; Liverpool Street; Oxford Circus; Piccadilly
Circus; St. James’s Park; Victoria; and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, and 3.
By Underground (subway)
London has the oldest and most comprehensive subway system in the
world. The Tube is fast and convenient, and just about everyone but 
the royals uses it. Everywhere you choose to go in London, you can 
find a nearby Tube stop, clearly marked by a red circle with a horizontal
line through it. For an Underground map, see the inside back cover of
this book.
Using the Underground
Thirteen Underground lines crisscross the city and intersect at various
stations where you can change from one train to another. On Underground
maps, every line is color-coded (Bakerloo is brown, Piccadilly is dark
blue, and so on), which makes planning your route easy. All you need to
know is the name of your stop and the direction you’re heading. After
you figure out which line you need to take, look on the map for the name
of the last stop in the direction you need to go. The name of the last stop
on the line appears on the front of the train and on electronic signboards
that display the name of the arriving train. (The one exception to this is
the Circle Line, which doesn’t list a last stop because it runs in a loop
around Central London.) Inside the trains, electronic signs, recorded
voices, or both announce the name of each approaching stop.
You may have to transfer from one Underground line to another to get 
to your destination. All Underground maps clearly show where various
lines converge. Signs in the stations direct you from one line to another.
To get from one line to another, you go through tunnels (which the Brits
call subways), and you may have to go up or down a level or two.
Most of the Underground system operates with automated entry and
exit gates. If you have a regular paper ticket or Travelcard, you feed it
into the slot; the ticket disappears and pops up again, the gate bangs
open; you remove your ticket and pass through. At the other end, you
do the same to get out, but the machine keeps the ticket (unless you
have a multiuse Travelcard ticket, which the machine returns to you). 
A new kind of electronic Tube ticket called the Oyster recently went into
effect. The Oyster is like a debit card, and a breeze to use: You simply
touch the card to the electronic keypad on the turnstile and the gate
opens. You won’t need an Oyster card unless you’re planning to be in
London for several days. For stays of one to three days, you’ll save con-
siderably by purchasing a Travelcard (more later).
Part III: London and Environs 
130

Underground service stops around midnight (a little earlier on less-used
lines). Keep this in mind when you’re out painting the town red. If you
miss the last train, you have to take a taxi or one of the night buses.
Buying tickets
You can purchase Underground tickets at the ticket window or from one
of the automated machines in most stations. Machines can change £5,
£10, and £20 notes. Tickets are valid for use on the day of issue only. For
fare purposes, the city is divided into six zones. Zone 1 covers all Central
London. Zone 6 extends as far as Heathrow to the west and Upminster
to the east. New pricing guidelines have raised the price of a one-way
single cash fare within Zone 1 to a whopping £4 ($8) for adults and £2 ($4)
for children 5 to 15. If you are making more than one trip by Underground,
you will save lots of money by purchasing a Travelcard or an Oyster card.
Saving with Travelcards
To make the most of London’s public transportation system, consider
buying a Travelcard, which allows unlimited travel by Underground and
bus. You can purchase these cards in the following increments:
 Day Travelcard: Good for one day in Zones 1 and 2 (everything in
Central London), this card costs £6.60 ($13) for an adult and £3.30
($6.50) for children 5 to 15. If you travel off-peak (after 9:30 a.m.),
the price of an adult Day Travelcard drops to £5.10 ($10).
 3-Day Travelcard: For Zones 1 and 2, this card, valid at peak travel
times (before 9:30 a.m.), costs £16.40 ($33) for an adult and £8.20
($16) for a child.
 7-Day Travelcard: Valid at all times in Zones 1 and 2 (all Central
London), this card costs £23.20 ($46) for an adult and £11.60 ($23)
for a child.
If you’re buying a Travelcard, it’s a bit cheaper to buy it in London, but
U.S. and Canadian travelers can purchase a London Travel Card before
leaving home. You can choose between two kinds of London Travel Cards,
the All-Zone (available for 7 days only) and the Central Zone (good for
Zone 1 only, in 1-, 3-, and 7-day increments); both allow unlimited travel
on the Tube, bus, and Docklands Light Rail (DLR) with no time restric-
tions. Prices for a 1-day Central Zone card are $15 for adults and $8 for
children; the 3-day Central Zone card costs $37 for adults and $19 for
children, and the 7-day version costs $52 for adults and $26 for children.
You can buy London Travel Cards by contacting a travel agent, calling
RailEurope at % 877-257-2887 from the United States or % 800-361-
RAIL from Canada, or going online to www.raileurope.com.
By bus
Distinctive red double-decker buses are very much a part of London’s
snarled traffic scene, but not all London buses are double-deckers, and
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 131

some aren’t red. Bus travel does have one drawback, especially for first-
timers: You need to know the streets of London so that you can get off at
the correct stop. Get a free bus map at one of the Travel Information
Centres (see the section “Finding Information After You Arrive,” earlier
in this chapter), or you may overshoot your destination. On the plus
side, riding the bus is cheaper than taking the Tube; you don’t have to
contend with escalators, elevators, or tunnels; and you get to see the
sights as you travel.
A concrete post with a red or white sign on top reading “London
Transport Bus Service” clearly marks each bus stop. Another sign shows
the routes of the buses that stop there. If the sign on top of the post is
red, the stop is a request stop, meaning that you have to hail the approach-
ing bus as you would a taxi (don’t whistle; just put up your hand). If the
sign is white, the bus stops automatically. Be sure to check the destina-
tion sign in front of the bus to make sure that the bus travels the entire
route. Have some coins with you, because the drivers don’t change 
banknotes.
Unlike the Underground, the bus network isn’t divided into fare zones.
The bus fare for a journey of any length costs £2 ($4) for adults. Children
11 and under ride free if they are traveling with an adult with a valid ticket.
A 1-day bus pass is a good thing to have if you plan to do much traveling
by bus. You can use the pass all day, but it isn’t valid on N-prefixed night
buses (which you can read about in the following paragraph). You can
purchase this one-day pass and bus passes good for longer periods at
most Underground stations, selected news agents, and Travel Information
Centres. For adults, a 1-day bus pass for all Central London costs £3.50
($7); a 7-day bus pass for Central London costs £14 ($28). Note: Children
15 and under travel free with an adult after 9:30 a.m.
At the witching hour of midnight, buses become night buses (N), and
their routes change. Nearly all night buses pass through Trafalgar
Square, Central London’s late-night magnet for insomniacs.
By taxi
You can safely and comfortably get around the city by taking a taxi.
Riding in the old-fashioned, roomy black taxis is a pleasure. Today, there
are also many smaller and newer-model taxis. London cabs of any size
or color don’t come cheap, however. Fares change depending on the
time of day, speed, and distance traveled. Fares and any extra charges
are also displayed on the meter next to the driver.
The basic fare begins at £2.20 ($4.40) and rises in increments of 20p (40¢)
every 160 meters or 34.5 seconds. Tip your cabbie 10 percent to 15 per-
cent of the total fare.
Part III: London and Environs 
132

You can hail a cab on the street. If a cab is available, the yellow or 
white FOR HIRE sign on the roof is lit. You can order a radio cab by calling
% 02072/720-272 or 02072/535-000. Be aware that if you call for a cab,
you’ll pay an additional charge of £2 ($4).
You don’t have to worry about whether the cab driver knows where he’s
going in London. When it comes to finding a street address, London cab-
bies are among the most knowledgeable in the world. Their rigorous
training, which includes an exhaustive street test called “The Knowledge,”
gives them an encyclopedic grasp of the terrain.
On foot
If you really want to get acquainted with the charming hodgepodge and
monumental grandeur of London, bring along a good pair of walking
shoes and explore on foot. Everywhere you turn, you see enticing side
streets, countrylike lanes, mews (former stables converted into homes),
and picturesque garden squares. London’s great parks are as safe to
walk in as its streets. (In fact, crime is less prevalent in London than in
many other major cities, and all the neighborhoods included in this
book are safe.)
If you want to follow a detailed stroll or two around the city, perhaps 
of Dickens’s London or of Westminster and Whitehall, check out the 11
tours in Frommer’s Memorable Walks in London, by Richard Jones (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
The Diana Memorial Walk, an 11km (7-mile) walk commemorating the life
of Princess Diana, passes through four of London’s royal parks: St. James’s
Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens. Along the way, 
90 plaques point out sites associated with Diana, including Kensington
Palace (her home for 15 years), Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Palace
(where she shared an office with Prince Charles), and Spencer House
(her family’s mansion, now a museum).
When you walk in London (or anywhere in England), remember the 
following:
 Traffic moves on the opposite side of the street from what you’re
accustomed to if you’re from the U.S. or Canada. This tip sounds
simple enough on paper, but in practice, you need to keep remind-
ing yourself to look in the “wrong” direction when crossing a street.
Throughout London, you see LOOK RIGHT or LOOK LEFT painted on
street crossings.
 Striped lines (called zebra crossings) on the road mark pedes-
trian crossings. Flashing lights near the curb indicate that drivers
must stop and yield the right of way when a pedestrian steps out
into the zebra to cross the street.
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 133

Staying in Style
As you might expect, London’s hotels are the most expensive in England.
Accommodations come in all shapes, sizes, and prices (see Chapter 8 
for more information on booking your accommodations). Good budget
hotels and B&Bs do exist, and won’t cost you an arm and a leg. Sliding
up the scale, you come to unique boutique hotels, older traditional
hotels, large chain hotels, and several ultraluxurious places known the
world over.
You really don’t want to arrive in London without a hotel reservation,
especially if you visit from mid-April to early October (high season). If
you do arrive without a reservation, you can book rooms through the
agencies listed in Chapter 8.
If you stay in London over a weekend, ask if your hotel has a special week-
end rate. Larger hotels that cater to business travelers often drastically
reduce their rates and throw in a few extra perks for Friday-to-Sunday-
night stays. Special weekend rates generally aren’t available at smaller,
less expensive hotels or B&Bs.
For a key to the dollar-sign ratings that I use in the hotel listings, see
Chapter 8. For general information on U.K. accommodations and for defi-
nitions of such terms as value-added tax (VAT), self-catering rooms, and
English breakfast, check out Chapter 8. For the locations of the hotels that
I discuss in this chapter, see the “London’s Top Hotels” map on p. 136.
The top hotels
London has an enormous range of hotels in all price categories and in 
all parts of town. I list a fair range of accommodations; if you want more
options or have particular needs that my picks don’t meet, the Britain &
London Visitor Centre, 1 Regent St. (walk-in or online service only; www.
visitlondon.com), can help you find what you need.
Note: Remember that this book lists the rack rates, the highest published
rates for a room with no discounts. You can often find a lower rate by
checking the hotel’s Web site for special promotional and weekend rates.
Aster House
$$$–$$$$
South Kensington
At the end of a street of early Victorian town houses, this 12-unit, 
nonsmoking B&B is a charmer. Each guest room is individually decorated
in English country-house style, and many rooms have four-poster, 
half-canopied beds and silk wallpaper. The bathrooms come with power
showers. Every room has a dataport for plugging in a laptop computer.
The breakfasts, served in the glassed-in garden conservatory, are more
health-conscious than you’d expect from an English B&B.

Astons Apartments
$–$$
South Kensington
Astons offers value-packed accommodations in three carefully restored
Victorian red-brick town houses. Each studio has a compact kitchenette
(great for families on a budget); a small bathroom; and bright, functional
furnishings. (Because you can cook on your in-room stove, the English call
these accommodations “self-catering” units.) The more expensive designer
studios feature larger bathrooms, more living space, and extra pizzazz in
the décor. If you like the idea of having your own cozy London apartment
(with daily maid service), you can’t do better. Free cribs, baby baths, and
baby-bottle sterilization equipment are available.

Avonmore Hotel
$–$$
Kensington
In 2000, the British Automobile Association awarded this small hotel four
diamonds (out of a possible five) for its high standards of service. The
property is in a quiet neighborhood that gives you easy access to West
End theaters and shops. Each of the nine tastefully decorated guest rooms
has an array of amenities (such as Wi-Fi, hair dryers, minibars, tea- and
coffee-making facilities, and color televisions) that you don’t usually find
in this price range. An English breakfast is served in a cheerful breakfast
room, and a bar and limited room service are available. The staff can
arrange baby-sitting if necessary.

moderately priced hotels. Family-owned and -operated, the freshly refur-
bished 54-room hotel has small guest rooms (and equally small bath-
rooms) that are comfortably furnished and well maintained. You find a

Cadogan Hotel
$$$$$
Chelsea
Memories of the Victorian era fill this beautiful 65-room hotel, which is
close to the exclusive Knightsbridge shops. The main floor includes a
small, wood-paneled lobby and sumptuous drawing room (good for after-
noon tea). The Cadogan (pronounced Ca-dug-en) is the hotel where Oscar
Wilde was staying when he was arrested. (Room 118 is the Oscar Wilde
Suite.) The large guest rooms, many overlooking Cadogan Place gardens,
are quietly tasteful and splendidly comfortable, with large bathrooms. The
sedate Edwardian restaurant is known for its excellent cuisine.

Rates don’t include 17.5% VAT. AE, MC, V.
Cartref House
$
Westminster and Victoria
One of the top B&Bs in London, Cartref House deserves its many acco-
lades. Each guest room (all are non-smoking) is individually designed and
has a small, private bathroom; some of the larger rooms contain bunk
beds, which make them suitable for families. You get a generous English
breakfast, and everything is in tip-top order. There’s no elevator, but guests
don’t seem to mind. Friendly, unpretentious service is the hallmark here.

minute walk south on Buckingham Palace Road, west on Eccleston Street). Rack

Claverley Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Knightsbridge
On a country-quiet cul-de-sac a few blocks from Harrods and the best of
Knightsbridge shopping, this cozy place is one of London’s best B&Bs.
Georgian-era accessories, 19th-century oil portraits, elegant antiques, and
leather-covered sofas accent the public rooms. The 29 guest rooms are
smart and cozy, with marble bathrooms with tubs and power showers. 
Part III: London and Environs

The hotel offers an excellent English breakfast and great value for this 
tony area.

The Cranley
$$$–$$$$
South Kensington
On a quiet street near South Kensington’s museums, the Cranley occupies
a quartet of restored 1875 town houses. Luxuriously appointed public
rooms and 39 high-ceilinged, air-conditioned guest rooms — with original
plasterwork, a blend of Victorian and contemporary furnishings, and up-
to-the-minute in-room technology — make this property a standout. The
bathrooms are large and nicely finished, with tubs and showers. Rates
include tea with scones in the afternoon, and champagne and canapés in
the evening.

Dorset Square Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Marylebone
This sophisticated 38-room luxury hotel occupies a beautifully restored
Regency town house overlooking Dorset Square, a private garden sur-
rounded by graceful buildings. Aggressively gorgeous inside and out, the
hotel is the epitome of traditional English style. Each guest room is unique,
but all are filled with a superlative mix of antiques, original oil paintings,
fine furniture, fresh flowers, and richly textured fabrics. The bathrooms
contain marble and mahogany.
See map p. 136. 39–40 Dorset Sq. (just west of Regent’s Park), London NW1 6QN.

Durrants Hotel
$$$
Marylebone
Opened in 1789 off Manchester Square, this 92-room hotel makes for an
atmospheric London retreat. Durrants is quintessentially English, with
pine- and mahogany-paneled public areas, a wonderful Georgian room that
serves as a restaurant, and even an 18th-century letter-writing room. Most
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 139

of the wood-paneled guest rooms are generously proportioned and nicely
furnished, with decent-size bathrooms. Some rooms are large enough for
families with children.

Bond Street (then a five-minute walk west on Oxford Street and north on Duke Street
and Manchester Street). Rack rates: £195 ($390) double. AE, MC, V.
Fielding Hotel
$$
Covent Garden
The Fielding sits on a beautiful old street (now pedestrian only) lit by 19th-
century gaslights, just steps from the Royal Opera House. The hotel doesn’t 
have an elevator, and the stairways are steep and narrow. The 24 rather
cramped guest rooms have showers and toilets but aren’t particularly
memorable. However, this quirky hotel is an excellent value for such a cen-
tral location. A small bar is on the premises, and the area is loaded with
cafes, restaurants, and fab shopping.

$$$$–$$$$$
Victoria
Overlooking Buckingham Palace Mews, this unique 18-room boutique
hotel is the epitome of luxury and offers superior personal service. The
hotel lobby and breakfast room is an elegant conservatory that was once
the waiting room for debutantes who were going to Buckingham Palace to
be presented. Every detail in the beautifully furnished rooms, from the
Frette sheets to the Penhaligon toiletries, is pure luxe. The staff here is
wonderfully friendly.

Palace Road). Rack rates: £220–£295 ($440–$590) double. Rates include continental
breakfast. Rates don’t include the 17.5% VAT. AE, MC, V.
The Gore
$$$$–$$$$$
South Kensington
Lovers of true Victoriana love the Gore, which sits on a busy road near
Kensington Gardens and South Kensington museums. More or less in con-
tinuous operation since 1892, this hotel has loads of historic charm. Each
of the 54 guest rooms is unique, filled with high-quality antiques and ele-
gant furnishings. Even old commodes conceal the toilets. Bistro One
Ninety Queen’s Gate, the hotel restaurant, is hip and popular.

Hazlitt’s
$$$$–$$$$$
Soho
Staying in this intimate, 23-room gem (built in 1718) is a delight, thanks in
part to its old-fashioned atmosphere and location in the heart of hip Soho.
The Georgian-era guest rooms are charming, with mahogany and pine fur-
nishings and antiques, as well as lovely bathrooms, many with claw-foot
tubs. Every room comes equipped with dataports for laptop computers;
the hotel doesn’t have an elevator, however. Rooms in the back are qui-
eter; the front rooms receive more light, but restrictions on historic prop-
erties don’t allow for double-glazed windows.

Hotel 167
$–$$
South Kensington
Hotel 167, one of the more reasonably priced guesthouses in South Ken,
attracts international visitors who like the price and businesspeople who
like the central location. Every guest room has a decent-size bathroom
(some with showers, others with tubs), and the overall ambience is bright
and attractive. The 16 rooms are furnished with a mix of fabrics and styles.
Have fun exploring this busy neighborhood!

The Hoxton
$–$$$
Shoreditch
This trendsetting “Urban Lodge” opened in 2007 and offers something
quite unique for London: chic style at a cheap price. In fact, check their
Web site because The Hoxton periodically holds incredible sales and you
may be able to nab a room for as little as £1 ($2)! The rooms are comfort-
able, well designed, and refreshingly free of frou-frou. The beautifully tiled,
shower-only bathrooms have every hotel in this price range beat by a mile.
A simple bagged breakfast arrives at your room every morning; food and
wine are sold in the lobby at supermarket prices; high-speed computers
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 141

are available for guests; and phone calls are incredibly cheap. In short,
you’ll find great value and no rip-offs.

Luna & Simone Hotel

Westminster and Victoria
The outside of this big, stucco-fronted, family-run hotel gleams bright
white, and each freshly renovated guest room has a newly tiled private
bathroom (with shower). The 36 rooms vary widely in size, but with their
blue carpeting and cream-colored walls, they beat all the dowdy, badly
designed hotels and B&Bs for miles around. The beechwood and marble-
clad reception area is all new, too, as is the smart-looking breakfast room,
now totally nonsmoking. The look throughout is refreshingly light, simple,
and modern.

Marazzis recently created some beautiful extra public bathrooms, so you
can easily survive the sharing experience. Some rooms look out onto the

Dining Out
For the past two decades or so, London has been in the grip of a gastro-
nomic revolution. The Modern British cuisine many London restaurants
Part III: London and Environs 
144

now serve takes old standards and deliciously reinvents them with 
foreign influences and ingredients, mostly from France (sauces), the
Mediterranean (olive oil, oregano, and garlic), and northern Italy (pasta,
polenta, and risotto). Besides Modern British cuisine, London foodies
continue to favor classic French and Italian cuisines. Indian cooking has
been a favorite ethnic food for decades. London abounds with Indian
restaurants serving curries and dishes cooked in clay tandoori pots.
At the same time, the city has witnessed a renewed interest in and respect
for traditional English fare. In the past, many people regarded English
cooking as dull and tasteless. But when done well, this country’s cuisine is
both hearty and delicious. The best traditional dishes are game, lamb,
meat and fish pies, and the ever-popular roast beef with Yorkshire pud-
ding (a crispy concoction made with meat drippings and served with
gravy). At the lower end, you find fish and chips, steak-and-kidney pie, and
bangers and mash (sausages and mashed potatoes) with a side of peas
and carrots. (For more information on English food, check out Chapter 2.)
Neighborhoods for ethnic eats
London has more than 5,000 restaurants, so you can probably find some-
thing to suit your tastes and your pocketbook. Unlike in some other
large cities, ethnic restaurants aren’t really confined to one particular
area of London. You do find a few exceptions, however: Several Chinese
restaurants cluster along Lisle, Wardour, and Gerrard streets in Soho’s
Chinatown; Notting Hill has long been a standby for low-price Indian and
Caribbean restaurants; and a number of Middle Eastern (especially
Lebanese) restaurants line Edgware Road. But otherwise, ethnic restau-
rants are scattered all over. In terms of sheer variety, Soho and neighbor-
ing Covent Garden offer the most choices in the West End, with British,
African, Caribbean, Mongolian, American (North and South), French,
Italian, Spanish, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Eastern European,
Modern European, Turkish, and vegetarian all represented. South
Kensington offers you another grab bag of culinary choices.
Strategies for budget dining
Eating out in London can be mind-bogglingly pricey. So where do you 
go for lower-cost meals? Try pubs, cafes, sandwich bars, food halls in
department stores, ready-made meals in supermarkets, pizza places, and
ethnic restaurants — places where you’re not paying for custom cooking
and high-end personal service. If you opt for a pricier establishment,
always find out whether the restaurant of your choice has a fixed-price
menu. Many of London’s top restaurants offer two- and three-course
fixed-price meals that can slash an a la carte tab by one-third or more.
Sometimes restaurants call these fixed-price meals pre- or post-theater
menus, which means that the restaurant serves those menus only from
about 5:30 to 7 p.m. and after 9:30 p.m. Wine can cost you a bundle, so
forgo that glass of chardonnay if you need to watch your budget. And try
your splurge dining at lunch, when prices often drop by one-third of the
cost at dinner and you get the same food. Note that in London and

throughout England, tap water is not automatically brought to your
table and you must specifically request it. Bottled mineral water (still or
“fizzy”) is more commonly drunk with meals than tap water.
The top restaurants
For a key to the dollar-sign ratings that I use in the following listings, see
the Introduction. For the locations of the restaurants I discuss in this
section, see the “London’s Top Restaurants” map on p. 146.
Aubergine
$$$$
Chelsea
FRENCH
Aubergine is one of London’s top “name” restaurants, so you need to book
weeks in advance. Chef William Drabble has earned a Michelin star for his
delicate delivery of classy, contemporary French cuisine. Every dish, from
fish and lighter-Mediterranean-style choices to assiette of veal with arti-
chokes and watercress, is a culinary achievement of the highest order. Cap
off your meal with the celebrated cappuccino of white beans with grated
truffle. Service is polished and efficient.
See map p. 146. 11 Park Walk, SW10. % 020/7352-3449. Reservations essential. Tube:
Sloane Square (then a ten-minute walk southwest on King’s Road to Park Walk and
Fulham Road, or bus 11, 19, 22, or 211 southwest on King’s Road from the Tube sta-
tion). Fixed-price menus: lunch £34 ($68) for three courses and wine; dinner £64 ($128)
for three courses, £77 ($154) for five courses. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2:15
p.m.; Mon–Sat 7–11 p.m.
Boxwood Cafe
$$$–$$$$
Knightsbridge
MODERN BRITISH
This cafe may be the most stylish kid-friendly restaurant in London, but
grownups can find plenty of comforting delights on the menu too. Created
by culinary superstar Gordon Ramsay, Boxwood Cafe is chic without being
fussy, and the same goes for the food, which emphasizes fresh and healthy
dishes ranging from a glazed pea and leek tart to fresh steamed fish, wine-
braised veal, roast chicken salad, and steaks.
See map p. 146. In the Berkeley Hotel, Wilton Place, SW1. % 020/7235-1010. Tube:
Knightsbridge (then a five-minute walk east on Brompton Road). Reservations rec-
ommended. Main courses: £9–£25 ($18–$50); fixed-price lunch £21 ($42); fixed-price

Smoke-free dining and drinking
Gone are the days of smoke-filled London restaurants. A new ordinance went into
effect throughout England in July 2007 that prohibits smoking in restaurants and pubs.
More and more restaurants are also prohibiting the use of cellphones in the dining room.

dinner £55 ($110); children’s menu £7.50 ($15). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–
3 p.m.; Sat–Sun noon–4 p.m.; daily 6–11 p.m.
Cafe in the Crypt
$
Trafalgar Square
BRITISH
Eating in a crypt might not be everyone’s idea of fun, but eating in this
crypt — below St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields Church on Trafalgar Square — is
an inexpensive London dining experience that you won’t forget. The food
is basic but good, served cafeteria style. Choose among a big salad bar
and traditional main courses, such as shepherd’s pie, filled rolls, and
hearty soups. One fixture is that most traditional of British desserts, bread-
and-butter pudding (bread soaked in eggs and milk with currants or sul-
tanas and then oven-baked). The cavernous, candlelit room, with its stone
pillars and gravestones, is wonderfully atmospheric. The crypt is also a
nice spot for a good, inexpensive afternoon tea.
See map p. 146. St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Duncannon Street, WC2. % 020/7839-4342.
Tube: Charing Cross (then a three-minute walk west to Trafalgar Square).
Reservations not accepted. Main courses: £5.95–£7.50 ($12–$15); fixed-price meal
£5.25 ($11); afternoon tea £4.95 ($10). No credit cards. Open: Mon–Wed 11:30
a.m.–7:30 p.m.; Thurs–Sat 11:30 a.m.–10:15 p.m.; Sun noon–5 p.m.
Criterion Bar & Grill
$$–$$$$
Piccadilly
MODERN FRENCH/BRITISH
It’s almost worth coming to the Criterion just to see its Byzantine palace
interior with gold vaulted ceiling. The food — a mixture of modern French
and British standards — doesn’t quite match the grandeur of the décor,
but it’s generally quite good. You can order Brit faves such as mushroom
soup, pan-fried mullet, or sausages, or French faves such as slow-roasted
duck with apple sauce or steak au poivre. This place is smack-dab on
Piccadilly Circus, making it wonderfully convenient. You can get a great
deal with the fixed-price lunches and dinners.
See map p. 146. 224 Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7930-0488. Reservations essential. Tube:
Piccadilly Circus (the restaurant is on the southeast side of the Circus). Main courses:
£11–£25 ($22–$50); fixed-price lunch and pre-theater dinner (Mon–Sat noon–2:30 p.m.
and 5:30–7 p.m.): £15–£18 ($30–$36). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–2:30 p.m.,
Mon–Sat 5:30–11:30 p.m.
Fortnum & Mason
$$–$$$
St. James’s
BRITISH
Fortnum & Mason, a posh London store famous for its food section, also
has three restaurants: the lower-level Fountain (breakfast, lunch, tea, and
dinner), the mezzanine-level Patio (lunch), and the fourth-floor St. James’s
(morning coffee, lunch, and afternoon tea). Although crowded with
tourists, these restaurants remain pleasant places where you can get a good
meal and a glimpse of the fading Empire. The Fountain serves sandwiches
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 149

and daily specials. The Patio’s lunch menu offers an assortment of pricey
sandwiches and main courses, especially hot and cold pies (steak and
kidney, curried fish and banana, chicken, and game) and Welsh rarebit
(thick melted cheese poured over toast) prepared with Guinness stout.
The well-heeled dine at the St. James’s, where the menu is even more tra-
ditionally British: For starters, try the kipper (smoked herring) mousse or
the potato and Stilton brûlée; main courses include pies and roast rib of
Scottish beef. The more informal Fountain and Patio are good places to
dine with a family; ice-cream sundaes are a specialty.
See map p. 146. 181 Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7734-8040. Reservations accepted for St.
James’s only. Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then a five-minute walk west on Piccadilly).
Main courses: £11–£24 ($22–$48); fixed-price menus: £20–£37 ($40–$74). AE, DC, MC,
V. Open: St. James’s and the Patio, Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; the Fountain, Mon–Sat
8:30 a.m.–7:45 p.m.
Gourmet Pizza Company
$
St. James’s
PIZZA/PASTA
If you’re in the West End or across the river in Southwark and want an eco-
nomical lunch or dinner in a family-friendly environment, stop at one of
these bright, pleasant spots. You can choose among 20 pizzas (pizza as in
pie, not slice). Everything from a B.L.T. version to one with Cajun chicken
and prawns is available; about half the choices are vegetarian, and some
are vegan. The crusts are light and crispy, and the toppings are fresh and
flavorful. Pasta dishes are also available. The new branch at Upper Ground,
Gabriel’s Wharf (% 020/7928-3188; Tube: London Bridge), is right on the
river.
See map p. 146. 7–9 Swallow Walk (off Piccadilly), W1. % 020/7734-5182. Tube:
Piccadilly Circus (then a five-minute walk west on Piccadilly and north on Swallow
Street). Reservations not accepted. Pizzas: £7–£10 ($14–$20). Pastas: £8–£11
($16–$22). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–10:30 p.m. (until midnight at Gabriel’s
Wharf location).
Hard Rock Cafe
$$
Mayfair
NORTH AMERICAN
The original Hard Rock, now a worldwide chain of rock-and-roll/American-
roadside-diner-themed restaurants, serves up comfort food amid a col-
lection of rock memorabilia and loud music. The burgers aren’t
particularly good, so you may want to stick to the salads, all of them big
enough for three. You can get some vegetarian dishes, too. Fajitas are
another good choice, and they serve a pretty good homemade apple pie.
Be prepared to stand in line on weekend evenings and pay fairly outra-
geous prices for the experience; teenagers love this place.
See map p. 146. 150 Old Park Lane, W1. % 020/7629-0382. Tube: Hyde Park Corner
(take the Park Lane exit; Old Park Lane is just east of Park Lane). Reservations not
accepted. Main courses: £8.50–£15 ($17–$30). AE, MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 11:30
a.m.–midnight, Fri–Sat 11:30 a.m.–1 a.m.

150

The Ivy
$$$–$$$$
Soho
BRITISH/FRENCH
The Ivy, with its 1930s look, tiny bar, glamour-scene crowd, and later-than-
usual hours, is one of the hippest places to dine after the theater. The
menu is simple, and the cooking is notable for skillful preparation of fresh
ingredients. Popular menu items include white asparagus with sea kale
and truffle butter, roast chicken and stuffing, roast beef and potatoes, and
Mediterranean fish soup. Try one of the wonderful English desserts, such
as sticky toffee pudding or caramelized bread-and-butter pudding. You
need to book as far in advance as possible for this top dining spot.
See map p. 146. 1–5 West St., WC2. % 020/7836-4751. Reservations required; book
at least a month in advance. Tube: Leicester Square (then a five-minute walk north
on Charing Cross Road; West Street is at the southeastern end of Cambridge Circus).
Main courses: £10–£39 ($20–$78); fixed-price menu: Sat–Sun lunch £22 ($44); cover
£2 ($4). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.–midnight.
Joe Allen
$$–$$$
Covent Garden
NORTH AMERICAN
With its checkered tablecloths and crowded dining room, Joe Allen is a
West End institution where actors often come after a performance to wolf
down chili con carne or gnaw on barbecued ribs. This spot keeps a low
profile on a back street in Covent Garden. The food, American classics with
some international twists, is sturdy and dependable, though not very
inspired, and the set menu is a real value: After a starter (maybe smoked
haddock vichyssoise), you can choose from main courses such as pan-
fried pork loin, Cajun chicken breast, and grilled lamb cutlets. If you’re an
American feeling homesick, console yourself with a burger, a brownie, and
a Coke. Come before the show for the best prices; come after for potential
star-gazing.
See map p. 146. 13 Exeter St., WC2. % 020/7836-0651. Reservations recommended.
Tube: Covent Garden (then a five-minute walk south past the Market to Burleigh
Street on the southeast corner of the Piazza and west on Exeter Street). Main
courses: £9–£16 ($18–$32); fixed-price lunch (Mon–Fri) and pretheater dinner
(Mon–Sat 5–5:45 p.m.): £15–£17 ($30–$34). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–12:45 a.m.,
Sat 11:30 a.m.–12:45 a.m., Sun 11:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.
Langan’s Bistro
$$–$$$
Marylebone
BRITISH/FRENCH
Clusters of Japanese parasols, rococo mirrors, paintings, and old photo-
graphs cover this busy bistro’s dining room, which sits behind a brightly
colored storefront. The menu features English foods with an underplayed
(some may say underdeveloped) French influence. Depending on the
season, the fixed-price menu may start with goose liver parfait or smoked
trout mousse and move on to steamed brill with lime and ginger sauce or
coq au vin. Chocoholics have to try the dessert extravaganza known as
“Mrs. Langan’s chocolate pudding.”
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 151

See map p. 146. 26 Devonshire St., W1. % 020/7935-4531. Reservations recom-
mended three days in advance. Tube: Regent’s Park (then a five-minute walk south
on Portland Place and west on Devonshire Street). Fixed-price menus: lunch or
dinner £20 ($39) for two courses, £22 ($44) for three courses. AE, DC, MC, V. Open:
Mon–Fri 12:30–2:30 p.m.; Mon–Sat 6:30–11 p.m.
Mildred’s
$$
Soho
VEGETARIAN
Considered by many to be London’s best vegetarian restaurant, Mildred’s
is a busy, buzzy place. It isn’t fancy but that only seems to add to the hip
ambience. The restaurant always features a pasta of the day and a variety
of robustly flavored offerings such as organic lentil casserole with roasted
pumpkin and squash, or sundried tomato, bean, and tarragon sausages.
Try the sweet potato fries as a side, and don’t forget dessert.
See map p. 146. 45 Lexington St., W1. % 020/7494-1634. Reservations not accepted.
Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then a five-minute walk). Main courses: £7–£8.50 ($14–$17).
No credit cards. Open: Mon–Sat noon–11 p.m.
Moro
$$–$$$
Clerkenwell
SPANISH/NORTH AFRICAN
Clerkenwell, on the fringes of The City, has become a very hip neighbor-
hood in recent years, and the award-winning Moro has become this unpre-
tentious area’s best haute spot. The décor is modern and minimalist, and
the North African cuisine is earthy and powerful. The kitchen uses only
the best ingredients, organic whenever possible, in its daily-changing
menu. I highly recommend the grilled asparagus with pine nut, egg, and
dill sauce (a seasonal spring dish); the charcoal-grilled lamb with cauli-
flower, chickpea, and coriander salad; and the wood-roasted pork with
chard. For dessert, try one the yummy house-specialty desserts: yogurt
cake with pistachios or rosewater and cardamom ice cream.
See map p. 146. 34–36 Exmouth Market, EC1. % 020/7833-8336. Reservations rec-
ommended. Tube: Farringdon (then a five-minute walk north on Farringdon to
Exmouth Market). Main courses: £17–£18 ($34–$36); tapas: £5–£7 ($10–$14). AE, DC,
MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 12:30–2:30 p.m. and 7–10:30 p.m.
Mosaique
$$
Holborn
MEDITERRANEAN
Tourists staying on the beaten track never find this wonderful restaurant,
but the people who work in the area know it well. The interior is bright and
cheerful, with yellow walls and white tablecloths glowing under skylights.
The menu choices feature dishes from all across the Mediterranean region,
prepared with an assured hand. You can dine here on the mezes (small
plates), such as grilled halloumi or tabbouleh, or feast on a lamb or chicken
“shish” (as in “kebab”), which comes with vegetables and rice. Vegetarian
choices include risotto primavera and vegetable moussaka. A jazz pianist
adds to the ambience Wednesday through Saturday from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m.
Part III: London and Environs 
152

See map p. 146. 73 Gray’s Inn Rd., WC1. % 020/7404-7553. Reservations recom-
mended. Tube: Chancery Lane (then a five-minute walk north on Gray’s Inn Road).
Main courses: £7.50–£11 ($15–$22); mezes: £3–£4 ($6–$8); fixed-price lunch: £8–9
($16–$18). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–midnight; Sat 5 p.m.–midnight.
Noor Jahan
$$
South Kensington
INDIAN
Small, unpretentious, and always reliable, Noor Jahan is a neighborhood
favorite. The marinated chicken and lamb dishes cooked tandoori style in
a clay oven are moist and flavorful. Try the chicken tikka specialty, a staple
of northern India, or sample one of the biriani dishes — chicken, lamb, or
prawns mixed with basmati rice, fried in ghee (thick, clarified butter), and
served with a mixed vegetable curry. If you’re unfamiliar with Indian food,
the waiters will gladly explain the dishes.
See map p. 146. 2A Bina Gardens (off Old Brompton Road). % 020/7373-6522.
Reservations recommended. Tube: Gloucester Road (then a five-minute walk south
on Gloucester Road, west on Brompton Road, north on Bina Gardens). Main courses:
£7–£12 ($14–$22); fixed-price menu: £19 ($38). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–2:45
p.m. and 6–11:45 p.m.
North Sea Fish Restaurant
$$
Bloomsbury
SEAFOOD
If you get a craving for “real” fish and chips — not the generic frozen stuff
that often passes for it — definitely try this unassuming “chippie” where
the fish is always fresh. With its sepia prints and red velvet seats, the place
is pleasant, comfortable, and popular with adults and kids. You may 
want to start with grilled fresh sardines or a fish cake before digging into
a main course of cod or haddock. The fish is most often served battered
and deep fried, but you can also order it grilled. The chips are almost as
good as the fish.
See map p. 146. 7–8 Leigh St. (off Cartwright Gardens), WC1. % 02073/875-892.
Reservations recommended. Tube: Russell Square (then a ten-minute walk north on
Marchmont Place and east on Leigh Street). Main courses: £8–£17 ($16–$34). AE,
MC, V. Open: Daily noon–2:30 p.m.; Mon–Sat 5:30–10:30 p.m.
The Oratory
$$
South Kensington
MODERN BRITISH
Named for the nearby Brompton Oratory, a famous late-19th-century
Catholic church, and close to the Victoria & Albert Museum and
Knightsbridge shopping, this funky bistro serves up some of the best and
least expensive food and wine in tony South Ken. The high-ceilinged room
is decorated in what I call Modern Rococo, with enormous glass chande-
liers, patterned walls and ceiling, and wooden tables with wrought-iron
chairs. Take note of the daily specials on the chalkboard, especially any
pasta dishes. Noteworthy dishes include homemade fish cakes, roasted
field-mushroom risotto, and grilled calf’s liver with bacon and deep-fried

mouth.
See map p. 146. 232 Brompton Rd., SW3. % 020/7584-3493. Tube: South Kensington
(then a five-minute walk north on Brompton Road). Reservations not accepted. Main

Oxo Tower Brasserie
$$$$
South Bank
FRENCH/FUSION
Book well in advance, and insist on a window table at this sleek and styl-
ish brasserie perched atop the landmark Oxo Tower on the South Bank.
The Brasserie is less chi-chi than the adjacent Oxo Tower Restaurant, but
you get marvelous food and pay about half the price of the place next door.
Plus you can feast your eyes on the sublime river and city views. The food
has taken on more fusion elements recently but remains as good as ever.
Order such tasty dishes as duck breast with pistachio and five-spice, or
turbot fillet with spiced crab and grapefruit. The fixed-price lunch and
pretheater menu makes this spot an affordable extravagance.
See map p. 146. Oxo Tower Wharf, Barge House Street, SE1. % 020/7803-3888.
Reservations essential; book at least one or two weeks in advance. Tube: Waterloo
(then head north to the South Bank Centre and follow the Thames pathway east to
the Oxo Tower, about a ten-minute walk). Main courses: £14–£18 ($28–$36); fixed-
price lunch and pretheater menu (Mon–Fri): £17–£22 ($34–$44). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:
Mon–Sat noon–3:15 p.m. and 5:30–11 p.m.; Sun 6–10 p.m.
R.S. Hispaniola
$$$
The Strand
BRITISH/FRENCH
Permanently moored in the Thames, this comfortably outfitted former pas-
senger boat provides good food and spectacular views of the river traffic.
The frequently changing menu offers a variety of sturdy and generally well-
prepared dishes. On any given night, you may find pork tenderloin with
apple and sage puree, rack of lamb, poached halibut, and several vegetar-
ian dishes, such as linguini with leeks, red peppers, and basil oil. Most
nights feature live music, and the place can be fun and romantic, if a bit
touristy. This is also an unusual spot to have afternoon tea.
See map p. 146. River Thames, Victoria Embankment, Charing Cross, WC2. % 020/
7839-3011. Reservations recommended. Tube: Embankment (the restaurant is a few
steps from the station). Main courses: £15–£20 ($30–$40); fixed-price lunch and dinner
menu: £21.50–£25 ($43–$50); afternoon tea £18 ($36). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily
noon–3 p.m. and 6:30–11 p.m.; closed Dec 24–Jan 4.
Rules
$$$–$$$$
Covent Garden
BRITISH
If you want to eat classic British cuisine in a memorable (nay, venerable)
setting, put on something dressy, and head for Maiden Lane. London’s
oldest restaurant, Rules was founded in 1798, and two centuries’ worth of
Part III: London and Environs 
154

prints, cartoons, and paintings decorate the walls. If you’re game for game,
go for it, because that’s what Rules is famous for. On the menu, you may
find roast loin of Wiltshire rabbit, Irish sirloin steak with béarnaise sauce,
or Gloucestershire pork chops with crackling and chutney. The food is 
delicious — traditional yet innovative, until you get to the puddings
(desserts), which are a mix of nursery and dinner-dance classics. In recent
years, the restaurant has added fish and a few vegetarian dishes.
See map p. 146. 35 Maiden Lane, WC2. % 020/7836-5314. Reservations recom-
mended. Tube: Covent Garden (then a five-minute walk south on James Street to

£19 ($38). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon–11:45 p.m.; Sun noon–10:45 p.m.
Simpson’s-in-the-Strand
$$$
The Strand
BRITISH
Simpson’s, open in this location since 1848, is — or used to be — a London
institution serving the best of traditional English food. Lately, however,
sloppy service and indifferent cooking have made dining here a hit-or-miss
experience. You still find the largest array of roasts in London: sirloin of beef,
saddle of mutton with red-currant jelly, and Aylesbury duckling. (Remember
to tip the tail-coated carver.) For a pudding (dessert course), you may want
to order treacle roll and custard or Stilton with vintage port. A smart-casual

Suze in Mayfair
$–$$
Mayfair
PACIFIC RIM/INTERNATIONAL
For relaxed, charming, bistrolike ambience in Mayfair, check out Suze. The
well-prepared food is Australasian with some international crossovers. Try
the succulent New Zealand green-tipped mussels, a house specialty, or New
Zealand rack of lamb. You can choose among several sharing platters: cheese,
Greek, Italian antipasti, seafood, and vegetarian. Save room for Pavlova, a light
meringue covered with kiwi fruit, strawberries, passion fruit, and mangoes.

If you’re exploring Soho and want a delicious, nutritious meal, try this
trendsetting noodle bar modeled after the ramen shops of Japan. You pass
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 155

along a stark, glowing corridor with a busy open kitchen and descend to
a large open room with communal tables. The specialties are ramen,
Chinese-style thread noodles served in soups with various toppings, and
the fat white noodles called udon. You can also choose among rice dishes,
vegetarian dishes, dumplings, vegetable and chicken skewers, and tem-
pura. Your order is sent by radio signal to the kitchen and arrives the
moment the food is ready. You may have to stand in line to get in, but it’s
worth the wait. Teens especially love the loud, hip, casual atmosphere.
Branches of Wagamama are scattered all over London, including a new one
on the river beneath Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank.

Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese
$$–$$$
The City
BRITISH
Opened in 1667 and a one-time haunt of Dr. Johnson, Charles Dickens, and
Fleet Street newspaper scandalmongers, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is
London’s most famous chophouse and a wonderfully atmospheric place
to dine. You find six bars and two dining rooms (reserve a table in The
Chop Room for the most traditional dining experience) in this place, which
is perennially popular with families and tourists looking for some genuine
Olde London atmosphere. The house specialties include “ye famous pud-
ding” (steak, kidney, mushrooms, and game), Scottish roast beef with
Yorkshire pudding and horseradish sauce, and pot roast shank of lamb. If
those choices put the kids off, they can choose sandwiches and salads.
See map p. 146. Wine Office Court, 145 Fleet St., EC4. %020/7353-6170. Tube: Blackfriars
(then a ten-minute walk north on New Bridge Street and west on Fleet Street).
Reservations recommended. Main courses: £8–£10 ($16–$20). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: pub
Mon–Sat noon–9:30 p.m., Sun noon–2:30 p.m.; bar snacks and drinks daily noon–10 p.m.
Zafferano
$$$$
Knightsbridge
ITALIAN
If you want perhaps the best Italian food in London, served in a quietly ele-
gant, attitude-free restaurant, head to Zafferano (but only after you’ve
made reservations weeks in advance). The menu changes seasonally and
retains classic favorites. The semolina pastas are perfectly cooked and
come with various additions; you can sometimes get chestnut tagliatelle
(wide noodle pasta) with wild mushrooms. The deliciously simple main
courses may include roast rabbit with Parma ham and polenta, venison
with polenta, tuna with rocket and tomato salad, and pan-fried prawns.
For dessert, try the pear and almond tart with mascarpone ice cream.
See map p. 146. 15 Lowndes St., SW1. % 020/7235-5800. Reservations essential.
Tube: Knightsbridge (then a five-minute walk south on Lowndes Street, two streets
east of Sloane Street). Fixed-price menus: lunch £25.50–£34.50 ($51–$69), dinner
£30–£45 ($60–$90). AE, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–2:30 p.m. and 7–11 p.m.

Treating Yourself to a Tea
The stereotype is true: Brits do drink tea — though overall consumption
is dropping, thanks to a new emphasis on coffee. Teatime is traditionally
from about 3:30 to 5 p.m. Your afternoon tea can be a lavish affair served
by a black-coated waiter in a hotel lobby, or you can have a quick
“cuppa” with a slice of cake or a sandwich at a corner tea shop or patis-
serie (a bakery where you can sit down or get pastries to take away). Tea
may be served fast-food style in paper cups, home-style in mugs, or
more elegantly on bone china.
So what exactly, you ask, is the difference between afternoon tea and
high tea?
 Afternoon tea: Tea with cakes, scones, or sandwiches (or all of
them), served between 3 and 5 p.m.
 High tea: Served from about 5 to 6 p.m., this teatime is more of a
light supper, with a hot dish followed by dessert and tea.
Casual tearooms and patisseries
In the following comfortable neighborhood tearooms and patisseries,
you can get a good cup of tea along with a scone or other pastry or a
plate of tea sandwiches for about £5 to £10 ($10–$20):
 Muffinski’s (5 King St., WC2; % 020/7379-1525; Tube: Leicester
Square): Offers great homemade muffins, including organic, low-
fat and vegetarian ones. It’s open Monday through Friday from 
8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Pâtisserie Cappuccetto (8 Moor St., W1; % 020/7437-9472; Tube:
Leicester Square): Serves breakfast, sandwiches, soups, and superb
desserts Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., and
Friday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 Pâtisserie Deux Amis (63 Judd St., WC1; % 020/7383-7029; Tube:
Russell Square): A good choice for a quick bite. It’s open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m.
 Pâtisserie Valerie (44 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/7437-3466;
Tube: Leicester Square or Tottenham Court Road): Around since
1926, this place serves a mouthwatering array of pastries, but
expect to stand in line, night or day. It’s open Monday through
Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Pâtisserie Valerie also has two branches in Marylebone. One is at
105 Marylebone High St., W1 (% 020/7935-6240; Tube: Bond Street
or Baker Street); the other is near Regent’s Park at 66 Portland Place,
W1 (% 020/7631-0467; Tube: Regent’s Park). The Marylebone
Chapter 11: Settling Into London 157

branch is open Monday through Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Regent’s Park branch opens at 7:30 a.m.
Monday through Saturday and stays open until 7 p.m., and opens at
8 a.m. on Sunday.
 Richoux: This place has three old-fashioned tearooms in choice
London locations. They serve food all day long, and they’re kind to
your budget:
Richoux-Knightsbridge (215 Brompton Rd., SW3; % 020/
7823-9971; Tube: Knightsbridge)
Richoux-Mayfair (41A South Audley St., W1; % 020/7629-
5228; Tube: Bond Street or Green Park)
Richoux-Piccadilly (172 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7493-2204;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus)
All locations keep basically the same hours: Monday through
Saturday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. (Mayfair branch open until 9 p.m.),
Sunday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. (Mayfair branch open until 9 p.m.)
Elegant spots for high tea
A traditional afternoon English tea has cakes, sandwiches, and scones with
clotted cream and jam, and is “taken” in a posh hotel or restaurant. These
rather lavish affairs are expensive but memorable. At any one of the follow-
ing places, you can get a proper traditional afternoon or high tea (respect
the smart-casual dress code — don’t wear tennis shoes and jeans):
 Brown’s Hotel (Albemarle Street, W1; % 020/7493-6020; Tube:
Green Park): This hotel’s English Tea Room serves a superlative
and very pricey tea Monday through Friday from 3 to 6 p.m. (Sat
and Sun from 2 p.m.) for £32.50 to £45 ($65–$90). Reservations are
highly recommended.
 Claridge’s (Brook Street, W1; % 020/7629-8860; Tube: Bond
Street): Serves a glamorous and expensive tea daily from 3 to 5:30
p.m. for £30.50 to £38 ($61–$76). Reservations are a good idea.
 Fortnum & Mason (181 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7734-8040; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus): Serves afternoon and high tea in the St. James’s
Restaurant, Monday through Saturday 3 to 5:15 p.m. for £24 to £34
($48–$68). Reservations aren’t necessary.
 Georgian Restaurant, on the fourth floor of Harrods (87–135
Brompton Rd., SW1; % 02/07225-6800; Tube: Knightsbridge): Serves
afternoon and high tea Monday through Saturday from 3:45 to 5:30
p.m. It costs £20 ($40) per person, and you don’t need reservations.
 The Lanesborough (Hyde Park Corner, SW1; % 02072/595-599;
Tube: Hyde Park Corner): You need reservations for high tea here,
which is served daily 3:30 to 6 p.m. and costs £28 to £37 ($56–$74).

Exploring London
In This Chapter
 Visiting London’s many attractions
 Choosing a tour that’s right for you
 Finding London’s hot shopping spots
 Discovering London theater and nightlife
 Getting some fast facts about London
T
wo millennia ago, London was Londinium, a walled colony of the
Roman Empire. Today, this dazzling metropolis, home to more than 
7 million people, is one of the most historic, cultured, and exciting cities
on earth. London is a big city built (mostly) on a human scale, with charm-
ing old streets, bustling modern thoroughfares, plenty of greenery, plenty
of traffic, and a vitality that spills over into the night. When the sun goes
down and floodlights bathe London’s historic buildings and monuments,
all kinds of new possibilities spring up.
History-laden London can stir the imagination like few other cities. No
matter how often you hear or read about places such as Westminster
Abbey, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower of London, nothing can beat
the thrill of actually visiting them. And although you’ll no doubt keep
yourself busy trying to see the important sights, save a little time for
just wandering around London’s streets. You can find a wealth of archi-
tectural styles, curious reminders of days gone by, and blue famous-
person-lived-here plaques on houses all over the city. On some streets,
you can almost hear the horses’ hooves clopping on the cobblestones,
as they did until about 1915. London grew from a series of villages, and
that villagelike character survives in many London neighborhoods.
Discovering the Top Attractions
Where do you begin? If you’re a dedicated museum maven, London’s
museums can keep you going for days, weeks, months, and even years.
But the city is also loaded with famous monuments, fascinating historic
buildings, and flower-filled parks. In this treasure trove of possibilities,
you have to make some decisions. The sights in this section are my roster
of the most important London attractions. For their locations, see the
“London’s Top Attractions” map on p. 160.

To beat the crowds, try to hit the top sights on your London list early 
in the day (preferably right when they open) or late in the afternoon.
Westminster Abbey, to cite just one example, can receive upward of
15,000 visitors per day. Other top tourist draws, such as Buckingham
Palace (when it’s open to the public during Aug and Sept), the Tower of
London, the British Museum, and Madame Tussauds can jam up as the
day wears on.
British Museum
Bloomsbury
The British Museum ranks as the most-visited attraction in London, with
a magnificent, wide-ranging collection of treasures from around the world.
Wandering through its seemingly endless galleries, you can’t help but be
struck by humankind’s enduring spirit and creativity. You can see perma-
nent displays of antiquities from Egypt, Western Asia, Greece, and Rome,
as well as prehistoric and Romano-British, medieval, Renaissance, modern,
and Oriental collections. The most famous of the countless treasures are
the superb Parthenon Sculptures that once adorned the Parthenon in
Athens — sculptures that Greece wants returned. Other must-sees are the
Rosetta Stone (which allowed archaeologists to decipher Egyptian hiero-
glyphics); the Egyptian Mummies; the Sutton Hoo Treasure, an Anglo-
Saxon burial ship believed to be the tomb of a seventh-century East
Anglian king; and Lindow Man, a well-preserved ancient corpse found in
a bog. In December 2000, the museum’s Great Court reopened with a glass-
and-steel roof designed by Lord Norman Foster. Inaccessible to the gen-
eral public for 150 years, the Great Court is now the museum’s central axis.
In the center, a circular building completed in 1857 served as the museum’s
famous Reading Room. Completely restored, this building now houses
computer terminals where visitors can access images and information
about the museum’s vast collections. For a layout of the museum, see the
“British Museum” map on p. 164.
If you get hungry along the way, you can find a cafe and a restaurant in the
Great Court, and another cafe next to Room 12. Weekday mornings are the
best times to go and avoid big crowds. You may want to pick up a Visit
Guide (£2.50/$5) at the information desk in the Great Court to help you
chart your way.
If you have only limited time for the British Museum, consider taking
one of the 90-minute highlight tours offered daily at 10:30 a.m. and 1
and 3 p.m.; the tour costs £8 ($16). Audio tours covering some of the
most important objects in the museum’s collections cost £3.50 ($7). You
can get tickets and information for both tours at the information desk in
the Great Court.
See map p. 160. Great Russell Street (between Bloomsbury Street and Montgomery
Street), WC1. % 020/7636-1555. www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk. Tube: Russell
Square (then a five-minute walk south on Montgomery Street, along the west side of
Russell Square, to the museum entrance on Great Russell Street). Admission: Free.

entrance information.
Buckingham Palace
St. James’s Park and Green Park
All the pomp, majesty, scandal, intrigue, tragedy, power, wealth, and tra-
dition associated with the British monarchy hide behind the monumental
facade of Buckingham Palace, the London residence of the sovereign
since Victoria ascended the throne in 1837.
An impressive early-18th-century structure, the palace was rebuilt in 1825
and further modified in 1913. From late July or early August (the dates
change yearly) through September, when the royal family isn’t in resi-
dence, you can buy a ticket to get a glimpse of the impressive staterooms
used by Elizabeth II and the other royals. There isn’t a guided palace tour;
you just wander at your own speed through 18 rooms, most of them
baroque, filled with some of the world’s finest artworks. In these rooms,
the queen receives guests on official occasions. You leave through the gar-
dens where the queen holds her famous garden parties each summer.
Budget about two hours for your visit.
On Monday through Thursday throughout the year, you can visit the Royal
Mews, one of the finest working stables in existence, which house the mag-
nificent Gold State Coach (used in every coronation since 1831) and other
royal conveyances. The newly refurbished Queen’s Gallery, which fea-
tures changing exhibits of works from the Royal Collection, reopened early
in 2002 in time for the queen’s Golden Jubilee.
Buckingham Palace forms the centerpiece of St. James’s Park and Green
Park, two royal parks acquired by Henry VIII in the early 16th century. St
James’s Park, the prettier of the two, was landscaped in 1827 by John Nash
in a picturesque English style with an ornamental lake and promenades.
Major ceremonial occasions are held in The Mall, a processional route
between the palace and Whitehall and Horse Guards Parade. St. James’s
Palace, the former London abode of Prince Charles and his two sons, and
adjacent Clarence House, residence of the Queen Mum until her death in
2002 and now the London home of Prince Charles, are between The Mall
and Pall Mall (pronounced Pell Mell), a broad avenue running from
Trafalgar Square to St. James’s Palace. Clarence House is now open to visitors
Chapter 12: Exploring London 163
The power of the written word
The incredible literary collection that was in the British Museum Reading Room
(including its rare copy of the Magna Carta, the charter of liberties that was a fore-
runner to modern constitutions) has been moved to a remarkable space in North
London. For details, see the entry for the British Library Exhibition Centre in the sec-
tion “Finding More Cool Things to See and Do,” later in this chapter.

from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. or until it sells the last ticket. Keep in mind that
every visitor gets a specific time for entry into the palace, so you prob-
ably want to phone ahead for tickets. All phone-charged tickets cost an
additional £1 ($2).

Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace
St. James’s Park
Free of charge, you can stand outside Buckingham Palace and watch the
Foot Guards of the Household Division of the Army, the queen’s personal
guard, carry out the Changing of the Guard. The Old Guard forms in the
palace forecourt before going off duty and handing everything over to the
New Guard, which leaves Wellington Barracks at 11:27 a.m. precisely and
marches to the palace on Birdcage Walk, usually accompanied by a band.
The Guard consists of 3 officers and 40 men but is reduced when the queen
is away. The entire ceremony takes around 40 minutes. If you can’t find a
spot at the front of the railings of Buckingham Palace, you can see pretty
well from the Victoria Memorial in front of the palace.
Chapter 12: Exploring London 165
More changing of the guards
If you miss the Changing of the Guard, or if the event doesn’t take place on the day of
your visit, you can still get an eyeful of London pageantry by attending the Mounted
Guard Changing Ceremony at the Horse Guards Building in Whitehall. The ceremony
takes place Monday to Saturday at 11 a.m. and Sunday at 10 a.m. No ticket is required,
but arrive early for a good view. To get there, take the Tube to Charing Cross, and walk
south from Trafalgar Square along Whitehall (about a five-minute walk); the Horse
Guards Building will be on your right.

The pageantry of the Changing of the Guard is no longer a daily occur-
rence. The event takes place daily from May through July at 11:30 a.m., but
only on alternate days at other times of the year. To avoid disappoint-
ment, call ahead or check the Web site listed in the following information.
See map p. 160. Buckingham Palace Road, SW1. % 020/7321-2233 (24-hour recorded
info). www.army.mod.uk. Tube: St. James’s Park (then a ten-minute walk north on
Queen Anne’s Gate and west on Birdcage Walk to Buckingham Gate); or Green Park
(walk directly south through the park). Admission: Free.
Houses of Parliament and Big Ben
Westminster
The Houses of Parliament, situated along the Thames, house the land-
mark clock tower containing Big Ben, a huge bell whose booming chime
is a familiar London sound. Designed in a neo-Gothic style by Sir Charles
Barry and A.W.N. Pugin, the Parliament buildings were completed in 1857.
Covering approximately 8 acres, they occupy the site of an 11th-century
palace of Edward the Confessor. At one end (Old Palace Yard) is the Jewel
House, built in 1366 and the former treasury house of Edward III, who
reigned from 1327 to 1377.
For most visitors, a glimpse of the exterior of the Houses of Parliament is
sufficient (you can get the best view from Westminster Bridge). If you want
to sit in the Stranger’s Gallery to hear the rancorous debates, you can line
up (pardon me, queue) for tickets at the St. Stephen’s entrance.
Previously, overseas visitors had to go through an elaborate procedure
weeks in advance of their trip in order to tour the Houses of Parliament.
Now, however, you can join 75-minute guided tours in late summer and
early fall (generally from the first week in July until early Oct). The tours
cost £12 ($24) for adults, and you probably want to book in advance.
You can reserve by phone at % 0870/906-3773 or order tickets online 
at www.firstcalltickets.com. You can also buy tickets at the ticket
kiosk in Westminster Hall (at the Houses of Parliament). For the rest of
the year, the procedure for getting a tour is much more difficult. If you’re
interested, you can find details on the Web at www.parliament.uk.
See map p. 160. Bridge Street and Parliament Square, SW1. % 020/7219-4272.
www.parliament.uk. Tube: Westminster (you can see the clock tower with Big
Ben directly across Bridge Street when you exit). Admission: Free. For free tickets,
join the line at St. Stephen’s entrance. Open: Stranger’s Gallery House of Commons,
Mon 7:30–10:30 p.m., Tues–Wed 11:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Thurs 11:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., most
Fridays 9:30 a.m.–3 p.m.; House of Lords, Mon–Wed 2:30–10 p.m., Thurs 11 a.m.–7:30
p.m. Parliament isn’t in session late July to mid-Oct or on weekends.
Hyde Park
Westminster
Once the private hunting domain of Henry VIII, Hyde Park is one of the
largest urban parks in the world. With adjoining Kensington Gardens, it
offers 630 acres of lushly landscaped lawns, magnificent flower beds,
Part III: London and Environs 
166

avenues of trees, and a 41-acre lake known as the Serpentine, where you
can row and sail model boats. Rotten Row, the park’s famous 300-year-old
riding track, was the country’s first public road to be lit at night. At the
northeastern tip, near Marble Arch, Speakers’ Corner is a famous Sunday-
morning venting spot for anyone who wants to climb up on a soapbox.
Free band concerts are held in the park’s bandshell on Sundays and bank
holidays May to August, and the Dell Restaurant (% 020/7706-0464), at
the east end of the Serpentine, offers cafeteria-style food and drinks
Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter (to 5 p.m. on weekends)
and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer (to 7 p.m. on weekends). The park is a
pleasant place for an hour’s stroll, but staying longer is always tempting.
See map p. 160. Bounded by Knightsbridge to the south, Bayswater Road to the north,
and Park Lane to the east. % 020/7298-2100. Tube: Marble Arch or Lancaster Gate
on the north side (the park is directly across Bayswater Road) or Hyde Park Corner
in the southeast corner of the park. Open: Daily dawn–midnight.
Kensington Gardens
Kensington
One of London’s loveliest and most family-friendly parks, Kensington
Gardens adjoins Hyde Park west of the Serpentine lake. The park was laid
out during the reign of William and Mary, after they moved into Kensington
Palace in 1689. Generations of children have gazed upon the famous
bronze statue of Peter Pan, located north of the Serpentine Bridge.
Commissioned in 1912 by Peter Pan’s creator, J.M. Barrie, the statue marks
the spot where Peter Pan (in the book Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens)
entered the gardens to get to his home on Serpentine Island.
The park is also home to the Albert Memorial, an ornate neo-Gothic
memorial honoring Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert; the lovely
Italian Gardens; and the free Serpentine Gallery (% 020/7298-2100),
which is gaining a reputation for showing cutting-edge art and is open daily
(except Dec 24–27 and Jan 1) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Princess Diana
Chapter 12: Exploring London 167
Fountain for Diana
The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is Hyde Park’s newest attraction.
Made of Cornish granite, the fountain aims to reflect Diana’s life through its design.
From its highest point, water flows in two directions, falling in cascades, swirls, and
bubbles before meeting in a calm pool at the bottom. Three bridges where you can
cross the water and go right to the heart of the fountain are meant to reflect Diana’s
openness. Ironically, the fountain has been plagued with problems since it was opened
by the queen in 2004. Visitors slipped on the granite and at one point the fountain mal-
functioned and flooded Hyde Park. It is now functioning properly and open daily from
10 a.m. Knightsbridge is the nearest Tube stop. Diana fans will also want to visit the
new “Diana: A Princess Remembered” exhibit at Kensington Palace (see “Kensington
Palace” later).

Memorial Playground, which opened in 2000, is in a fenced-in area at the
park’s northwest corner. If the weather is fine, give yourself enough time
for a leisurely stroll — at least a couple of hours.
See map p. 160. Bounded by Kensington Palace Gardens and Palace Green on the
west, Bayswater Road on the north, Kensington Road and Kensington Gore on the

gardens.Tube: High Street Kensington (then a ten-minute walk east on Kensington
High Street) or Queensway (directly across from the northwest corner of the park).
Admission: Free. Open: Daily dawn to midnight.
Kensington Palace
Kensington
Acquired by William III in 1689 and remodeled by Sir Christopher Wren,
the monarchy used Kensington Palace as a royal residence until 1760.
Victoria was born in the palace and was informed here, in 1837, that she
was the new queen of England (and could move to the grander
Buckingham Palace). One wing of the palace (not open to visitors) was
Princess Diana’s London home after her divorce from Prince Charles. After
her death, tens of thousands of mourners gathered in front of the palace
and left a sea of floral tributes. The palace was also home to Princess
Margaret, who died in 2002, and remains the home of other “grace and
favor” royals and dependants (the Crown provides them with free hous-
ing). Visitors can visit the State Apartments, view several interesting
exhibits relating to the history of the palace, and see some of Diana’s
dresses in the new “Diana: A Princess Remembered” exhibit. The freshly
restored King’s Apartment features a magnificent collection of Old
Masters. Give yourself about 90 minutes to view the palace.
For a pleasant and not-too-expensive tea or snack after visiting Kensington
Palace, stop in at The Orangery (% 020/7376-0239) in the gardens next
to the palace. The cafe is open daily noon to 6 p.m. Lunches cost about £8
($16); from 3 p.m., you can get a good tea for £7 to £18 ($14–$36).
See map p. 160. The Broad Walk, Kensington Gardens, W8. % 0870/751-5170.
www.hrp.org.uk. Tube: Queensway on the north side (then a ten-minute walk
south through the park) or High Street Kensington on the southwest side (then a ten-
minute walk through the park). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.).
Admission: £12 ($24) adults, £10 ($20) seniors and students, £6 ($12) children 5 to 15,
£33 ($66) family. Despite some stairs, the palace is accessible for visitors with dis-
abilities; call first.
Madame Tussauds
Marylebone
Madame Tussauds wax museum is a world-famous tourist attraction, and
people tend to either love it or hate it. The question is: Do you want to pay
the exorbitant admission price and devote the time to see lifelike wax fig-
ures? (You need at least two hours to see everything.) The original mold-
ings of members of the French court are undeniably fascinating. Madame
Tussaud had direct access to the former royals — she made molds of their

heads after they were guillotined during the French Revolution. And ani-
matronic gadgetry makes the Spirit of London theme ride fun. But
Chamber Live (formerly called the Chamber of Horrors) is definitely for
the ghoulish and unsuitable for kids under 12. Next door, the former
London Planetarium has been remade into the Stardome, and now fea-
tures a special-effects show about the stars on earth rather than those in
the heavens. The Blush exhibit features screen faves like Brad Pitt, Samuel
L. Jackson, and Daniel Radcliffe of the Harry Potter series.
Go early to beat the crowds; better still, reserve tickets by credit card 
(% 0870/400-3000) up to three days in advance and then go straight to
the head of the line at your scheduled time.

National Gallery
Trafalgar Square
If great art is your passion, you may think that the National Gallery is par-
adise. The museum houses one of the world’s most comprehensive col-
lections of British and European paintings. All the major schools from the
13th to the 20th centuries are represented, but the Italians get the lion’s
share of wall space, with artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, and
Raphael on the roster. The French Impressionist and post-Impressionist
works by Monet, Manet, Seurat, Cézanne, Degas, and van Gogh are shim-
mering and sublime. And because you’re on English soil, check out at least
a few of Turner’s stunning seascapes, Constable’s landscapes, and
Reynolds’ society portraits. And you don’t want to miss the Rembrandts.
Budget at least two hours here. If you’re hungry, stop by the second-floor
restaurant for lunch, tea, or snacks.
To make the most of your time at the gallery, pick up a free portable
audio-tour guide (security deposit required). Free guided tours are
offered daily at 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.

sisters, Winston Churchill, Oscar Wilde, Noël Coward, Mick Jagger, and
Princess Di? Their portraits hang in the National Portrait Gallery, a visual
Who’s Who of famous Brits. The galleries are arranged in chronological
order. The earliest portraits are in the Tudor Gallery; the latest (such as
Dame Helen Mirren) are on the first floor. The rooftop cafe provides great
West End views. Plan on spending at least two hours, but getting side-
tracked here is easy, so you may want more time.

Natural History Museum
South Kensington
Filled with magnificent specimens and exciting displays relating to natural
history, this museum houses the national collections of living and fossil
plants, animals, and minerals. The most popular attraction in this enor-
mous Victorian-era museum is the huge dinosaur exhibit, with 14 com-
plete skeletons; a pair of animatronic raptors; and a life-size, robotic T-Rex
lunching on a freshly killed Tenontosaurus. Bug-filled Creepy Crawlies is
another popular kid pleaser. The sparkling gems and crystals in the
Mineral Gallery are literally dazzling, and in the Meteorite Pavilion, you
can see fragments of rock that crashed into the earth from the farthest
reaches of the galaxy. The intriguing Darwin Centre showcases the pri-
vate collection of Charles Darwin, father of evolutionary theory, and
houses the museum’s huge collection of preserved specimens. The
museum offers enough to keep you occupied for at least two hours.

Picture-perfect Queen Mum
In 2000, the National Portrait Gallery commissioned a Royal Family portrait to cele-
brate the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday. Artist John Wonnacott painted a canvas that
portrays Queen Elizabeth, Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, and Princes William and Harry
in conversation with the Queen Mother in the White Drawing Room in Buckingham
Palace. (Interestingly, Prince William — Charles’ firstborn and thus the second in line
to the throne — dominates the picture.) The much-loved Queen Mum died in 2002, and
plans are now afoot to erect a bronze statue of her to stand beneath a sculpture of
her husband, King George VI, off the Mall. Artist Philip Jackson’s representation of the
royal matriarch as a younger woman is scheduled to be unveiled in mid-2008.

St. Paul’s Cathedral
The City
After the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed the city’s old cathedral, the great
architect Christopher Wren was called upon to design St. Paul’s, a huge
and harmonious Renaissance-leaning-toward-baroque building. Nazi
bombing raids wiped out the surrounding area, so Wren’s masterpiece,
capped by the most famous dome in London, rises majestically above a
crowded sea of undistinguished office buildings. Grinling Gibbons carved
the exceptionally beautiful choir stalls, which are the only impressive art-
works inside.
Christopher Wren is buried in the crypt, and his epitaph, on the floor
below the dome, reads “LECTOR, SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS, CIRCUMSPICE”
(“Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you”). His companions in
the crypt include Britain’s famed national heroes: the Duke of Wellington,
who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo; and Admiral Lord Nelson, who took
down the French at Trafalgar during the same war. But many people want
to see St. Paul’s simply because Lady Diana Spencer wed Prince Charles
here in what was billed as the fairy-tale wedding of the 20th century.
You can climb up to the Whispering Gallery for a bit of acoustical fun or
gasp your way up to the very top for a breathtaking view of London. You
can see the entire cathedral in an hour or less. For an overview of 
the cathedral’s layout, see the “St. Paul’s Cathedral” map on p. 172. The
pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge, designed by Lord Norman Foster and
opened in 2000, links St. Paul’s Cathedral to the Tate Modern art gallery
on the other side of the Thames.

ble by the service entrance near the South Transept; ring the bell for assistance.
Tate Britain
Pimlico
The Tate Gallery took this name to distinguish it from its new counterpart,
Tate Modern, which opened in May 2000 on the South Bank. Tate Britain
retains the older (pre-20th-century) collections of exclusively British art,
plus works by major British stars like David Hockney and experimental
works by Brits and foreigners living in Britain. Among the masterpieces on
display in a host of newly refurbished galleries are dreamy works by the
British pre-Raphaelites, the celestial visions of William Blake, bawdy satir-
ical works by William Hogarth, genteel portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
bucolic landscapes by John Constable, and the shimmering seascapes of
J.M.W. Turner. Plan on spending at least two hours here. A restaurant and
cafe are on the lower level.

Tate Modern
Bankside
The former Bankside Power Station is the setting for the fabulous Tate
Modern, which opened in May 2000. Considered one of the top modern
art museums in the world, the Tate Modern houses a collection of inter-
national 20th-century art, displaying major works by some of the most
influential artists of the last century: Picasso, Matisse, Dalí, Duchamp,
Moore, and Bacon among them. A gallery for the 21st-century collection
exhibits new art as artists create it. If you’re a fan of contemporary art and
architecture, don’t miss this new star on the London art scene. Plan on
spending at least two hours. The Tate Restaurant, open for lunch and tea,
offers stunning views over the Thames; definitely call first to book a table.

Tower of London
The City
The Tower of London offers enough to keep you captivated for a good
three to four hours, but make sure you save time for the Crown Jewels,
which include the world’s largest diamond (the 530-carat Star of Africa)
and other breathtaking gems set into royal robes, swords, scepters, and
crowns.
In 1066, William the Conqueror built the city’s best-known historic site.
The Tower served as his fortress and later as a prison, holding famous cap-
tives, such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Princess Elizabeth I. Anne Boleyn and
Catherine Howard (two of the eight wives of Henry VIII), the nine-day
queen Lady Jane Grey, and Sir Thomas More were among those who lost
their heads on Tower Green. According to Shakespeare, henchmen of
Richard III murdered the two little princes (the sons of Edward IV) in the
Bloody Tower, but many modern historians refute this story. For the
layout of the tower, see the “Tower of London” map on p. 175.

buildings can’t accommodate wheelchairs.
Trafalgar Square
St. James’s
Until very recently, Trafalgar Square was an island in the midst of a roar-
ing traffic interchange surrounded by historic buildings, such as St. Martin-
in-the-Fields church and the National Gallery. After a major urban redesign
scheme, it reopened in 2003 with one side attached to the steps of the
National Gallery, so visitors can easily get to the square without crossing
any streets at all. Besides being a major tourist attraction, many large gath-
erings take place in Trafalgar Square, including political demonstrations,
Christmas revels, and New Year’s Eve festivities. The square honors mili-
tary hero Admiral Lord Nelson (1758–1805), who lost his life at the Battle
of Trafalgar. Nelson’s Column, with fountains and four bronze lions at its
base, rises some 145 feet above the square. At the top, a 14-foot-high statue
of Nelson (who was 5 feet, 4 inches tall in real life) looks commandingly
toward Admiralty Arch, which state and royal processions between
Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s Cathedral pass through. You don’t really
need more than a few minutes to take in the square.
St. Martin-in-the-Fields (% 020/7930-0089), the famous neoclassical church
at the northeast corner of Trafalgar Square, was designed by James Gibbs,
a disciple of Christopher Wren, and completed in 1726; the 185-foot spire
was added about 100 years later. The church was the precursor of dozens of
similar-looking churches throughout colonial New England. (For a special
place to dine inexpensively, try the Cafe in the Crypt; see Chapter 11 for
details.) The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a famous musical ensem-
ble, frequently performs here. Lunchtime concerts are held on Monday,
Tuesday, and Friday at 1 p.m., and evening concerts are held Thursday to
Saturday at 7:30. Concert tickets are £6 to £15 ($12–$30). For reservations by
credit card, call % 020/7839-8362. The church is open Monday to Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.; admission is free.
See map p. 160. Bounded on the north by Trafalgar, on the west by Cockspur Street,

tion leads to the square).

Birds and Beefeaters
Huge black ravens hop around the grounds of the Tower of London. An old legend says
that the British Commonwealth will end when the ravens leave the tower. Their wings
have been clipped as a precaution, and in 2006, during the avian flu scare, the Tower
ravens were put in quarantine. On another note, the ancient, all-male order of Yeomen
Warders, more familiarly known as the Beefeaters, installed its first woman member
in 2006.

Victoria & Albert Museum
South Kensington
The Victoria & Albert Museum (known as the V&A) is the national
museum of art and design. In the 145 galleries filled with fine and decora-
tive arts from around the world, you can find superbly decorated period
rooms, a fashion collection spanning 400 years of European designs,
Raphael cartoons (designs for tapestries in the Sistine Chapel), the Silver
Galleries, and the largest assemblages of Renaissance sculpture outside
Italy and of Indian art outside India. The Canon Photography Gallery

Westminster Abbey
Westminster
The Gothic and grand Westminster Abbey is one of London’s most impor-
tant and venerable historic sites. The present abbey dates mostly from the
13th and 14th centuries, but a church has been on this site for more than
a thousand years. Since 1066, when William the Conqueror became the
first English monarch to be crowned here, every successive British sov-
ereign save two (Edward V and Edward VIII) has sat on the Coronation
Chair to receive the crown and scepter. In the Royal Chapels, you can see
the tomb of Henry VII, with its delicate fan vaulting, and the tomb of
Queen Elizabeth I, buried in the same vault as her Catholic half-sister,
Mary I, and not far from her rival, Mary Queen of Scots. In Poets’ Corner,
some of England’s greatest writers (including Chaucer, Dickens, and
Thomas Hardy) are interred or memorialized. Other points of interest
include the College Garden; Cloisters; Chapter House; and Undercroft
Museum, which contains the Pyx Chamber, with its display of church plate
(silver utensils once used in church services). In September 1997, the
abbey was the site of Princess Diana’s funeral, and in 2002, the funeral
service for the Queen Mother took place here. The Abbey is within walk-
ing distance of the Houses of Parliament. For a floor plan of the Abbey, see
the “Westminster Abbey” map on p. 177.

a horse-drawn bus, and London’s first trolley bus. Interactive
exhibits allow younger visitors to operate the controls of a Tube
train and get their tickets punched. After two hours, you may have
to drag them away. The museum was scheduled to reopen in late
2007 after a complete interior overhaul, and new admission prices
were not available at press time, but rates shouldn’t be too much
higher than what I list here: £6 ($12) for adults, £4.50 ($9) for sen-
iors, free for children under 16 with adult. The museum is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (last entry at 5:15 p.m.).
 The London Zoo (at the north end of Regent’s Park, NW1; % 020/
7722-3333; www.zsl.org; Tube: Regent’s Park, then bus C2 north
to Delaney Street or Camden Town): Britain’s largest zoo covers 
36 acres, and has recently created a series of new habitats and
exhibits. The best attractions are B.U.G.S. (insects of every descrip-
tion), Gorilla Kingdom (with a colony of Western lowland gorillas),
the Clore Rainforest Lookout (South American monkeys, birds, and
vertebrates), Komodo Dragons, and Into Africa (zebras, giraffes,
okapi, red river hogs). The Children’s Zoo, with interactive exhibits
placed at low height, is designed for 4- to 8-year-olds. Many families
budget almost an entire day for the zoo; I recommend that you give
it at least three hours. Admission is £14.50 ($29) adults; £13 ($26)
seniors, students, and visitors with disabilities; £11 ($22) children 
3 to 14; £48.50 ($97) families (2 adults, 2 children). The zoo is open
daily from late March to late October from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., the
rest of the year from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Chapter 12: Exploring London 179

 The Museum of London (150 London Wall, EC2, in the Barbican dis-
trict near St. Paul’s Cathedral; % 020/7600-3699; www.museumof
london.org.uk; Tube: St. Paul’s): One of the most comprehensive
city museums in the world, the Museum of London sits in the origi-
nal square-mile Londinium of the Romans, overlooking Roman 
and medieval city walls. Archaeological finds; paintings and prints;
social, industrial, and historical artifacts; and costumes, maps, and
models trace the city’s history and development from prehistoric
times to the 21st century. Of special interest is the gilt-and-scarlet
Lord Mayor’s Coach, built in 1757 and weighing 3 tons. Admission
is free. The museum is open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to
5:50 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5:50 p.m. Closed January 1 and
December 24 to 26.
 Regent’s Park (just north of Marylebone Road, surrounded by
Outer Circle Road; % 020/7486-7905; Tube: Regent’s Park or Baker
Street): One of London’s great green spaces and home of the London
Zoo. People come to the park to play soccer, cricket, tennis, and
softball; boat in the lake; visit Queen Mary’s Rose Garden; and let
their kids have fun in the many playgrounds. Summer lunch and
evening bandstand concerts happen here, as well as puppet shows
and other children’s activities on weekdays throughout August.
The park’s northernmost section rises to the summit of Primrose
Hill, which provides fine views of Westminster and the city. The
park is open from dawn to dusk.

www.sciencemuseum.org.uk; Tube: South Kensington): This state-
of-the-art museum covers the history and development of science,
medicine, and technology. You can see rarities such as an 1813
steam locomotive, Arkwright’s spinning machine, Fox Talbot’s first
camera, Edison’s original phonograph, and the Apollo 10 space
module on display. Kids 7 to 12 years old find the interactive dis-
plays challenging and fun. The Garden Galleries provide construc-
tion areas, sound-and-light shows, and games for younger kids. The
Wellcome Wing, which opened in 2000, focuses on contemporary
science and has an IMAX 3-D film theater. Allow at least two hours,
more if you’re going to see the film. A signposted exit in the Tube
station goes directly to the museum. Admission to the museum is
free; the IMAX theater (% 0870/870-4868 for advance booking)
costs £8 ($16) for adults, £6 ($12) for seniors and children 5 to 15.

 The “new” Somerset House (The Strand, WC2; % 02078/454-600;
www.somersethouse.org.uk; Tube: Temple, then a five-minute
walk north on Arundel Street and west on The Strand): This 18th-
century civil palace, with its three noteworthy art collections,
offers a heady mix of high culture and street entertainment. It also
has a new courtyard with dancing fountains and a riverside terrace
with a great summer cafe. Admission to Somerset House is free;
each gallery charges an admission fee of £5 ($10) for adults, £4 ($8)
for seniors; children under 18 enter free. All three galleries are open

courtyard is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. (7 p.m. in winter).
• The Courtauld Gallery (% 020/7848-2526; www.courtauld.
ac.uk): This gallery has been in Somerset House since 1989.
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings are the gallery’s
main strength. Major works include Manet’s Bar at the Folies
Bergères; Monet’s Banks of the Seine at Argenteuil; Lady with
Parasol by Degas; La Loge by Renoir; van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with
Bandaged Ear; and several Cézannes, including The Card Players.

Chapter 12: Exploring London 181
Dinner and a show at the Globe Theatre
The Globe presents Shakespeare plays from late April to early October. Theatergoers
sit on wooden benches or stand, as they did in Shakespeare’s day, under the open sky.
For tickets, call % 020/7401-9919 in the U.K. or 020/7902-1475 from overseas; you can
check out the current performance schedule at www.shakespeares-globe.org.
You can stand (700 £5/$10 seats are available for every performance) or sit on benches;
any discomfort is worth the opportunity to see Shakespeare performed not far from
the original theater and right beside the Thames. Even if you don’t plan to see a play
at the Globe, you can have a snack, tea, or a full meal in the theater. No reservations
are required at The Globe Cafe, open daily from May to September 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
and from October to April 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. If you want lunch or dinner, reserve a table
in advance at The Globe Restaurant (% 020/7928-9444), which is open daily from noon
to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 11 p.m.

• The Hermitage Rooms (% 020/7845-4630; www.hermitage
rooms.com): An offshoot of the State Hermitage Museum in
St. Petersburg, this area exhibits pieces from the Russian
Imperial collections in changing shows.
 10 Downing Street (10 Downing St., SW1; Tube: Westminster): The
residence of the prime minister, is on many London visitors’ must-
see lists, so I’m sorry to tell you that there’s nothing to see here
except a heavily guarded gate. By peering through the gate, you
can get a glimpse (on the right side) of No. 10, the official residence
of the British Prime Minister since 1732. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer usually resides next door at No. 11, and No. 12 serves as
the office of the chief government whip, responsible for maintain-
ing discipline and cooperation in the unruly House of Commons.
These three small brick terrace houses, built on a cul-de-sac in
1680, stand in sharp contrast to the enormous 19th-century offices
lining Whitehall, the government quarter around Downing Street.

From Blair to Brown: A new prime 
minister takes the reins
Of course, London gossip swirls around 10 Downing Street, just as it does around
Buckingham Palace. After Tony Blair’s position on the Iraq war cost his New Labour
Party one-third of its seats in 2005, he announced that he would not run for a fourth
term. In 2007, Blair stepped down and handed over the reins of power to Gordon Brown,
a Scotsman who had served as Blair’s Chancellor of the Exchequer. Unlike the voluble
Blair, Brown is something of an enigma to the British public. Born in 1951 in Glasgow,
he earned a Ph.D. in history at the University of Edinburgh (and is only one of four prime
ministers not to attend Oxford or Cambridge University). During a school rugby match
he was kicked in the head and suffered a detached retina that left him blind in his left
eye. Later, the same symptoms threatened the vision in his right eye, but several sur-
geries saved his sight. After working as a lecturer in politics and a journalist, Brown
was elected to Parliament in 1983. After the sudden death of Labour leader John Smith
in 1994, Brown was regarded as a potential party leader, but did not contest the lead-
ership when Tony Blair became the favorite. It has long been rumored that a deal was
struck between Blair and Brown in which Blair promised to give Brown control of eco-
nomic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. In
public, the two remained mostly united but there have been many reports of serious
rifts between them. The new resident of 10 Downing Street has been careful not to sug-
gest that there will be any changes in the key areas of Blair’s social policy, or any rad-
ical changes in New Labour itself. Since taking office, he has promoted the idea of
creating several “eco-towns” with affordable, environmentally friendly housing, and
proposed tighter coastal security controls after the thwarted terrorist attacks of 2007.
The new prime minister is married to Sarah Macauley, a public relations executive, and
has two sons, one of whom was diagnosed in 2006 with cystic fibrosis.

 Tower Bridge Exhibition (North Pier, Tower Bridge, SE1; % 020/
7378-1928; Tube: Tower Hill): You get to go inside one of the world’s
most famous bridges to find out why, how, and when it was built
and see how the mechanism for raising the bridge works. And 
you definitely want to see the magnificent views up and down the
Thames from the bridge’s glass-enclosed walkways. Admission is 
£6 ($12) for adults; £4.50 ($9) for seniors and students, and £3 ($6)
for children 5 to 15. The attraction is open daily October through
March from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., April through September from 9:30
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (last admission 75 minutes before closing).
 The Wallace Collection (Hertford House, Manchester Square,
Marylebone, W1; % 020/7935-0687; www.wallacecollection.
org; Tube: Baker Street): In the palatial “town house” of the late
Lady Wallace. The French works by such artists as Watteau and
Fragonard are outstanding, but you also find masterworks from the
Dutch (including Rembrandt), English, Spanish, and Italian schools.
Vying for your attention are collections of decorative art, ornaments
from 18th-century France, and European and Asian armaments. 
You need at least an hour just to give everything a cursory glance.
Admission is free. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Seeing London by Guided Tour
When it comes to London sightseeing tours, you’re limited only by your
imagination, stamina, and budget. You can tour London with an experi-
enced guide by bus, by boat, or on foot.
Bus tours
Original London Sightseeing Tours (% 020/8877-1722; www.the
originaltour.com) maintains a fleet of double-decker buses (many of
them open on top) and offers hop-on/hop-off service at more than 90
boarding points around the city plus a 50-minute river cruise. You can
choose among four tour routes. The Original London Sightseeing Tour
lasts 90 minutes and passes every major sight in Central London and the
South Bank; the tour starts from Piccadilly Circus (Tube: Piccadilly Circus)
outside the Planet Hollywood restaurant on Coventry Street and departs
every few minutes daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 9 p.m. in summer). You
don’t have to book any of the sightseeing tours in advance; you can pay
on the bus. A ticket good for 24 hours on all routes costs £19 ($38) for
adults and £12 ($24) for children under 16. For more information or to
book discounted tickets online, check out the Web site.
The Big Bus Company (% 020/7233-9533; www.bigbus.co.uk) leaves
from Green Park, Victoria, and Marble Arch daily every 15 to 30 minutes,
from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (4:30 p.m. in winter) on three different routes
that take anywhere from one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half hours. Tickets
include a river cruise and walking tours, and cost £20 ($40) for adults
Chapter 12: Exploring London 183

and £10 ($20) for children ages 5 to 15. Valid for 24 hours, these tickets
let you hop on and off at 54 locations. Big Bus often has special offers,
too, throwing in cheap theater tickets, fast entry to popular attractions,
and so on.
Another tour company with many guided excursions is Golden Tours,
4 Fountain Square, 123–151 Buckingham Palace Rd. (% 800-456-6303 in
the U.S. or 020/7233-7030; www.goldentours.co.uk). It has comfy buses
with restrooms, and the certified guides have a certifiable sense of
humor. The daily Historic & Modern London tour is a full-day outing
that includes the West End, Westminster Abbey, the Changing of the
Guard (at Buckingham Palace or Horse Guards Parade), the City of
London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and a cruise from the
Tower down to Charing Cross Pier; the price includes a pub lunch and
all admissions. This tour costs £72 ($144) for adults, £69 ($138) for sen-
iors and students, and £62 ($124) for kids under 16. Tours depart from
the office at Buckingham Palace Road (Tube: Victoria) and other points
in Central London. You can book your tickets directly or online, or you
can ask your hotel concierge to do it at least two days in advance.
Boat tours
A cruise down the majestic Thames is a marvelous way to take in the
city’s sights. Sightseeing boats regularly ply the river between Westminster
and the Tower of London; some continue downstream to Greenwich
(site of the Prime Meridian, Cutty Sark, and the Old Royal Observatory)
and upstream to Kew Gardens and Hampton Court (see Chapter 13 for
descriptions of all three places). Along the way, you can see many of
London’s great monuments: the Houses of Parliament, Westminster
Abbey, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and Tower Bridge. The
main departure points along the Thames are at Westminster Pier (Tube:
Westminster), Waterloo Pier (Tube: Waterloo), Embankment Pier (Tube:
Embankment), Tower Pier (Tube: Tower Hill), and Greenwich Pier
(Tube: Greenwich). Call the London Travel Information line at % 020/
7222-1234 for recorded information on tours.
Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk) runs a fleet
of commuter and sightseeing boats on the Thames from Westminster
Pier to Greenwich. An all-day hop-on/hop-off River Rover ticket costs 
£11 ($22) adults, £5.50 ($11) children, £27 ($54) for a family (2 adults, 
2 children).
Daily from March through November and on weekends the rest of the
year, Bateaux London/Catamaran Cruisers (% 020/7695-1800; www.
catamarancruisers.co.uk) offers a one-hour circular cruise from
Westminster Pier (Tube: Westminster) that passes most of London’s major
monuments and stops at Festival Pier, Bankside Pier, London Bridge City
Pier, and St. Katharine’s Pier (hop-on/hop-off service). All the boats pro-
vide live commentary and have a fully licensed bar. The cruise costs
£9.50 ($19) for adults, £4.75 ($9.50) for children, and £23 ($46) for fami-
lies (2 adults, 3 children).
Part III: London and Environs 
184

The same company offers a daily lunch cruise departing at 12:30 p.m. that
costs £24 ($48) for adults, £13 ($26) for children. A nightly dinner cruise
leaves at 7:15 p.m. and returns at 9:45 p.m. The cruise, which includes a
two- to four-course dinner with live music and after-dinner dancing, costs
£69 to £105 ($138–$210) per person, depending on the various add-ons that
you choose. A two-hour Sunday jazz lunch cruise departs at 12:30 p.m.
and costs £39.50 to £55 ($79–$110) per person. Advance reservations are
required for all tours, and a smart-casual dress code applies (no sweat-
pants or running shoes). All cruises depart from Embankment Pier.
An amphibious tour
London Duck Tours (% 020/7928-3132; www.londonducktours.co.
uk) has adapted several World War II amphibious troop carriers, known
as DUKWs, to civilian comfort levels and painted them bright yellow. It
runs 80-minute road-and-river trips. Tours start behind County Hall (site
of the British Airways London Eye giant observation wheel). It picks up
passengers on Chicheley Street (Tube: Westminster, then walk across
Westminster Bridge) and then rumbles through Westminster and up to
Piccadilly, gathering bemused stares as it passes many of London’s major
tourist sites. Then the vehicle splashes into the Thames at Vauxhall for a 
30-minute cruise as far as the Houses of Parliament. The tickets cost £18
($36) for adults, £14 ($28) for seniors, £12 ($24) for children.
Walking tours
A walking tour is an affordable way to see London from street level in
the company of a knowledgeable guide. This type of tour is great for his-
tory, literature, and architecture buffs, and older kids generally have a
good time as well. The weekly events listings in Time Out magazine,
which you can pick up at any news agent in London, include dozens of
intriguing walks; a walk happens every day.
The Original London Walks, P.O. Box 1708, London NW6 4LW (% 020/
7624-3978; www.walks.com), offers a terrific array of tours, including
Jack the Ripper’s London, Christopher Wren’s London, Oscar Wilde’s
London, and The Beatles’ Magical Mystery Tour. Guides lead walks
every day of the week, rain or shine; tours last about two hours and end
near an Underground station. You don’t need to make advance reserva-
tions. Call for schedules and departure points. A London Walk costs
£5.50 ($11) for adults and £4.50 ($9) for students with ID; kids walk free
with a parent. If you want to follow detailed strolls on your own, check
out the 11 tours in Frommer’s Memorable Walks in London, by Richard
Jones (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Following an Itinerary
Every London visitor faces one problem: how to see as much as possible
in a limited amount of time. What do you do if you have only one, two, or
three days at your disposal? I provide one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
Chapter 12: Exploring London 185

for top London sights in Chapter 4 (the first three days in the “Seeing
England’s Highlights in One Week” section).
Shopping in London
When you think of shopping in London, what items come to mind? Silky
cashmere sweaters? Burberry raincoats? Hand-tailored suits and shirts?
Tartan plaids? Irish linens? Silver spoons? Old engravings? Bone china?
Books? Whatever you think of, you can find it somewhere in London, one
of the world’s greatest shopping cities. In addition to the major depart-
ment stores, you can find hundreds of small, enticing specialty shops
and boutiques that delight the eye and empty the wallet. For the loca-
tion of all the shops listed in this section, see the “West End Shopping”
map on p. 188.
When to shop and how to find deals
Normal shopping hours are Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.,
with late closing (7 or 8 p.m.) on Wednesday or Thursday. Stores may
legally be open for six hours on Sunday, usually 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Stores in London have two sale periods: one in January and the other in
July. Discounts can range from 25 percent to 50 percent at leading depart-
ment stores. Harrods has the most famous January sale in London, but
just about every other store also has a big sale at this time.
The VAT (value-added tax) in London and throughout England is 17.5 per-
cent. The VAT is added to the price on every price tag. Anyone who isn’t
a resident of the European Union can get a VAT refund on retail goods,
but not on restaurant and hotel bills. For the details on how to recoup as
much as 15 percent of your shopping spree, see Chapter 5.
Where to shop and what to buy
Most of the department stores, designer shops, and multiples (chain
stores) have their flagships in the West End. The key streets are Oxford
Street for affordable shopping; Regent Street for fancier shops, more
upscale department stores, and specialty dealers; Piccadilly for older,
established department stores; Jermyn Street for traditional English
luxury goods; and Bond Street for chic, upscale fashion boutiques. The
Covent Garden area is great for all-purpose shopping. Charing Cross
Road is known for its extraordinary number of bookstores, selling both
new and old volumes.
Chelsea is known for King’s Road (Tube: Sloane Square), a street that
became world-famous during the Swinging Sixties. The young crowd still
flocks to King’s Road, but it’s becoming more and more a lineup of chain
stores, markets, and multistores (large or small conglomerations of indoor
stands, stalls, and booths within one building). The area is also known
Part III: London and Environs 
186

for its design-trade showrooms and stores of household wares. King’s
Road begins on the west side of Sloane Square Tube station.
London has plenty of big department stores to choose among. Harrods,
87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1 (% 020/7730-1234; Tube: Knightsbridge),
may be the world’s most famous department store. As firmly entrenched
in London life as Buckingham Palace, this enormous emporium has some
300 departments, delectable Food Halls, and several cafes. Fortnum &
Mason, 181 Piccadilly, W1 (% 020/7734-8040; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), a
department store, serves as the queen’s London grocer. In a setting of
deep-red carpets and crystal chandeliers, you find everything from pâté
de foie gras and Campbell’s soup to bone china, crystal, leather, antiques,
and stationery. Dining choices include the Patio, St. James’s and The
Fountain (for restaurant reviews, see Chapter 11). A Chelsea emporium
founded in 1877, Peter Jones, Sloane Square, SW1 (% 020/7730-3434;
Tube: Sloane Square), is known for household goods, household fabrics
and trims, china, glass, soft furnishings, and linens; the linen department
is one of London’s best.
Bargain hunters can zero in on goods manufactured in England. The
Filofax Centre, 21 Conduit St., W1 (% 020/7499-0457; Tube: Oxford
Circus), carries the entire range of Filofax inserts and books at about
half the price that you can get them in the States. Prices at the U.K.-based
Body Shop stores are much lower than in the States. You can stock up
on their politically and environmentally correct beauty, bath, and aro-
matherapy products at The Body Shop, 375 Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7409-
7868; Tube: Bond Street), which has branches in every shopping zone 
in London. Dr. Marten’s Department Store, 1–4 King St., WC2 (% 020/
7497-1460; Tube: Covent Garden), is the flagship for internationally
famous Doc Martens shoes. Prices are far better here than they are 
outside the United Kingdom.
The following sections describe where to go and what to look for in
some of London’s key shopping areas. For the locations of stores in the
West End, see the “West End Shopping” map on p. 188.
Bond Street
Divided into New (northern section) and Old (southern portion), Bond
Street is the address for all the hot international designers. Here and on
adjacent streets, you can find a large conglomeration of very expensive
fashion boutiques. Church’s, 133 New Bond St., W1 (% 020/7493-1474;
Tube: Bond Street), sells classy shoes said to be recognizable to all the
snobby maîtres d’hôtel in London.
Charing Cross Road
For books, head to Charing Cross Road, where you find W & G Foyle, Ltd.,
113–119 Charing Cross Rd., WC2 (% 020/7440-3225; Tube: Tottenham
Court Road), which claims to be the world’s largest bookstore and car-
ries an impressive array of hardcovers and paperbacks, as well as travel

Rd., WC2 (% 020/7734-3485; Tube: Leicester Square), specializes in
crime, romance, science fiction, and horror books. Established in 1797,
Hatchards, 187 Piccadilly, W1 (% 020/7439-9921; Tube: Piccadilly

distance away, in Kensington, you can find the Children’s Book Centre,
237 Kensington High St., W8 (% 020/7937-7497; Tube: High Street
Kensington), the best place in London to go for children’s books; fiction

Covent Garden
The Covent Garden Market (% 02078/369-136; Tube: Covent Garden),
which is actually several different markets, is open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The place can be a little confusing until you dive in and explore it all.
The Apple Market is the fun, bustling market in the courtyard, where
traders sell collectible nostalgia: glassware and ceramics, leather goods,
toys, clothes, hats, and jewelry. On Monday, antiques dealers take over.
On the backside, you can find the Jubilee Market (% 020/7836-2139),
with inexpensive crafts, clothes, and books. The Covent Garden Market
itself (in the restored hall on The Piazza) is full of specialty shops selling
fashions and herbs, gifts and toys, books and personalized dollhouses,
hand-rolled cigars . . . you name it.
The Covent Garden area is a good place to find herbalists and shops sell-
ing excellent English soaps, toiletries, and aromatherapy goods. Culpeper

men. People the world over know Neal’s Yard Remedies, 15 Neal’s Yard

its all-natural, herbal-based bath, beauty, and aromatherapy products in
cobalt-blue bottles.
Jermyn Street
Two-block-long Jermyn Street, one of St. James’s most exclusive nooks,
is home to posh high-end men’s haberdashers and toiletry shops, many of
which have been doing business for centuries. Taylor of Old Bond Street,
74 Jermyn St., SW1 (% 020/7930-5544; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), carries
the world’s finest collection of men’s shaving brushes, razors, and combs,
plus soaps and hair lotions. Floris, 89 Jermyn St., SW1 (% 020/7930-
2885; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), is a small mahogany-clad store that’s
been selling its own line of soaps and perfumes since 1851. For more
than a century, Hilditch & Key, 73 Jermyn St., SW1 (% 020/7930-5336;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus), has been selling what many people consider
the finest men’s shirts in the world: 100 percent cotton, cut by hand,
with buttons fashioned from real shell.
Part III: London and Environs 
190

If you’re shopping in Regent Street or Jermyn Street, visit the Burlington
Arcade, running from Regent Street to Savile Row. This famous, glass-
roofed Regency passage, lit by wrought-iron lamps and decorated with
clusters of ferns and flowers, is lined with intriguing shops and boutiques.
The Irish Linen Company, 35–36 Burlington Arcade, W1 (% 020/7493-
8949; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), carries items crafted of Irish linen, includ-
ing hand-embroidered handkerchiefs, and bed and table linens.
Regent Street
Curving Regent Street, just off Piccadilly Circus, is a major shopping
street for all sorts of goods. If you’re after English bone china, stop in at
Royal Doulton Regent Street, 154 Regent St., W1 (% 020/7734-3184;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus or Oxford Circus), which carries Royal Doulton,
Minton, and Royal Crown Derby china. Scotch House, 84–86 Regent St.,
W1 (% 020/7734-0203; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), has a worldwide reputa-
tion for its comprehensive selection of cashmere and wool knitwear for
men, women, and children; the shop also sells tartan garments and
accessories, as well as Scottish tweed classics. If you’re looking for toys
or children’s gifts, check out Hamleys, 188–196 Regent St., W1 (% 020/
7494-2000; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), which stocks more than 35,000 toys
and games on seven floors.
Living It Up After Dark
London by day is lovely; London by night is lively. Whatever you’re look-
ing for — grand opera, a hip-hop dance club, or a historic pub — you
can find it here. As the cultural hub of the United Kingdom, London is
always brimming over with possibilities for after-dark adventures.
Finding out what’s happening
You can find details for all London shows, concerts, and other perform-
ances in the daily newspapers: the Daily Telegraph, the Evening Standard,
the Guardian, the Independent, and the Times. For the most comprehen-
sive listings of everything that’s going on in London, plus thumbnail
descriptions and (usually scathing) critical opinion, buy a copy of the
weekly magazine Time Out. New editions hit London newsstands every
Wednesday. Online, www.londontheatre.co.uk provides a complete
Chapter 12: Exploring London 191
Shopping in the vaults
If you’re searching for silver, go to the London Silver Vaults, Chancery House, 53–63
Chancery Lane, WC2 (% 020/7242-3844; Tube: Chancery Lane). Here, you go into real
vaults — 40 in all — filled with a staggering collection of old and new silver and silver
plate, plus a collection of jewelry.

listing of shows currently playing in London’s West End, plus seating
plans for the theaters and theater news and reviews.
Getting tickets
The following ticket agencies accept credit card bookings 24 hours a
day, and all charge at least a 25 percent commission:
 Albemarle Booking Agency (% 020/7637-9041; www.albemarle-
london.com)
 Keith Prowse (% 800-669-7469 in the U.S. or 020/7836-9001;
www.keithprowse.com)
 Ticketmaster (% 0870/606-9999; www.ticketmaster.co.uk)
You can avoid the agencies’ hefty fees if you go to the box office to buy
tickets or call the venue and order tickets by phone. With a credit card,
you can usually order tickets directly from the box office (or online in
some cases) before you leave home and pick them up after you arrive 
in London.
Raising the curtain on performing arts and music
When you plan a night out in London, your biggest problem will be
choosing among all the possibilities.
Theater
When it comes to theater, London is the greatest. The West End theater
district — or Theatreland, as it’s called — concentrates in the area
around Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden. But the
theaters at the Barbican and South Bank Arts Centre are considered
West End theater venues as well. For even the biggest hit shows you
rarely pay more than £50 ($100) for the best seats in the house. The
city’s many “fringe” venues also play an important part in the theatrical
vitality of London. Fringe is the London equivalent of Off or Off-Off
Broadway in New York. If you want to see a show, look at the following
theaters’ schedules:
 The Royal National Theatre, South Bank Arts Centre, SE1 (% 020/
7452-3000; www.nt-online.org; Tube: Waterloo): This company
performs Shakespeare, classic revivals, musicals, and new plays in
three theaters. For information on performances, call % 020/7452-
3400 (Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–11 p.m.); check the Web for information and
an online booking form.
 The Royal Shakespeare Company (% 08706/091-110; www.rsc.
org.uk): Based in Stratford-upon-Avon, this prestigious company
performs in London at the Gielgud Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue,
W1 (% 020/7494-5085; Tube: Piccadilly Circus), and the Theatre
Royal Haymarket, Haymarket SW1 (% 0870/901-3356; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus).
Part III: London and Environs 
192

 Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, New Globe Walk, Bankside, SE1 
(% 020/7401-9919; www.shakespeares-globe.org; Tube: Cannon
Street or London Bridge): This theater presents a June-to-September
season of the Bard’s plays in a reconstructed open-air Elizabethan
theater. After a couple of hours, the benches can be a bit numbing,
but you get to see Shakespeare performed not far from the original
theater — and you’re right beside the Thames.
The Society of London Theatres operates tkts, a half-price ticket booth
in the clock tower building by the gardens in Leicester Square (Tube:
Leicester Square). The booth doesn’t have a phone info line, so you have
to show up in person to see what’s on sale that day. One of the notice
boards lists available theatre tickets for matinee performances (which
may be on Wed, Thurs, Sat, or Sun); the other lists tickets available for
evening performances. (Check the signs above each of the windows.)
The booth is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Sunday noon to 3 p.m. You can buy tickets only on the day of perform-
ance. The ticket booth accepts MasterCard and Visa. You pay exactly
half the price, plus a nominal service fee (under £3/$6). The most popu-
lar shows usually aren’t available, but you may luck out. Tickets for the
English National Opera and other events are sometimes available as
well. Ask for a free copy of The Official London Theatre Guide, which lists
every show, with addresses and phone numbers, and includes a map of
the West End theater district.
Opera, ballet, and classical music
The Royal Opera and Royal Ballet perform at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, WC2E (% 020/7304-4000 info line; www.royalopera.org;
Tube: Covent Garden). Ticket prices for grand opera run £8 to £175
($16–$350). The season runs September to August. For a summary of the
opera and ballet season, check the Web site.
The English National Opera and English National Ballet perform at the
London Coliseum, St. Martin’s Lane, WC2N (% 020/7632-8300 for box
office; www.eno.org; Tube: Leicester Square). The operas here are all
sung in English. Seats run £5 to £75 ($10–$150). The box office is open 
24 hours Monday through Saturday for phone bookings and from 10 a.m.
to 8 p.m. if you want to purchase tickets in person. The opera and ballet
season runs September to July. To book online, go to the Web site.
The London Symphony Orchestra (www.lso.co.uk) makes the Barbican
Hall at the Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2Y (% 020/7638-8891 for 
24-hour recorded info; Tube: Barbican), its home base.
You can see classical music performed at the Royal Albert Hall,
Kensington Gore, SW7 (% 020/7589-2141 box office; Tube: High Street
Kensington). This enormous, circular, domed concert hall has been a
landmark in South Kensington since 1871. One of London’s most eagerly
awaited musical events is the mid-July to mid-September series of classi-
cal and pops concerts known as the Proms. Orchestras come from all
over Europe to play.
Chapter 12: Exploring London 193

Checking out the club and bar scenes
London is a big club town; the action doesn’t really get hot until around
midnight. For more options than the ones you can find in the following
sections, check out the listings for music and clubs in Time Out. For the
locations of places in the following sections, see the “London’s Clubs,
Pubs, and Bars” map on p. 196.
Jazz and other live music
London has plenty of small, smoky jazz clubs where you can groove ’til
the wee hours. In Soho, Ronnie Scott’s, 47 Frith St., W1 (% 020/7439-
0747; Tube: Tottenham Court Road), has been London’s preeminent jazz
club for years, with dependably high-caliber performances, sometimes
with big-name stars. You have to order food (meals or snacks) on top of
the £15 to £125 ($30–$250) cover. In Earl’s Court, the 606 Club, 90 Lots
Rd., SW10 (% 020/7352-5953; Tube: Earl’s Court or Fulham Broadway),
is a basement club where young British jazz musicians play. You don’t
have to pay a cover to get in, but you have to order something to eat,
and the club adds a charge of £12 ($24) to your bill to pay the musicians.
You can find good food and diverse music (from Afro-Latin jazz to rap) 
at the Jazz Cafe, 5 Parkway, NW1 (% 020/7916-6060; Tube: Camden
Town). Admission costs £15 to £20 ($30–$40).
How about a pizza with your jazz? In Soho, try the Pizza Express Jazz
Club, 10 Dean St., W1 (% 020/7439-8722; Tube: Tottenham Court Road),
where big names from the American jazz scene regularly perform; the
cover is £15 to £20 ($30–$40). In Knightsbridge, you find Pizza on the
Park, 11 Knightsbridge, SW1 (% 020/7235-5273; Tube: Hyde Park
Corner), where the basement Jazz Room books mainstream jazz; admis-
sion costs £16 to £20 ($32–$40).
The Ain’t Nothing But Blues Bar, 20 Kingly St., W1 (% 020/7287-0514;
Tube: Oxford Circus), the only true-blue blues venue in town, features
Part III: London and Environs 
194
Four orchestras, one Royal Festival Hall
The biggest and most exciting cultural news in London in 2007 was the reopening of
the newly refurbished Royal Festival Hall, the major concert venue in the South Bank
Centre (Tube: Waterloo). Royal Festival Hall, which first opened in 1951 as part of the
Festival of Britain, is now home to four resident orchestras: the London Philharmonic,
the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta, and the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment. The South Bank Centre is also the home of Queen Elizabeth Hall, a
smaller venue that offers chamber music concerts and dance programs, and the
Purcell Room, an intimate setting used for recitals. You can get tickets and informa-
tion on all three venues at the box office (Foyer, Queen Elizabeth Hall), open daily 10
a.m. to 8 p.m., or online at www.sbc.org.uk; prices vary for each event. For credit
card bookings, call % 0871/663-2500.

local acts and touring American bands. The cover charge is £3 to £5
($6–$10) on Friday and Saturday; you get in free before 9:30 p.m.
Dance clubs
In Islington, The Complex, 1–5 Parkfield St., N1 (% 020/7288-1986; Tube:
Angel), has four floors with different dance vibes on each. Open Friday
and Saturday from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.; admission is £10 to £15 ($20–$30).
The Equinox, Leicester Square, WC2 (% 020/7437-1446; Tube: Leicester
Square), a lavishly illuminated club with London’s largest dance floor,
boasts one of the largest lighting rigs in Europe. A crowd as varied as
London itself dances to virtually every kind of music, including dance
hall, pop, rock, and Latin. The cover is £5 to £15 ($10–$30).
Lady Di’s favorite scene in her club-hopping days, the Hippodrome, at
the corner of Cranbourn Street and Charing Cross Road, WC2 (% 020/
7437-4311; Tube: Leicester Square), is a cavernous place with a great
sound system and lights to match. The club is tacky, touristy, and
packed on weekends. The cover is £6 to £15 ($12–$30).
Venom Club/The Zoo Bar, 13–17 Bear St., WC2 (% 020/7839-4188;
Tube: Leicester Square), features a trendy Euro-androgynous crowd and
music so loud that you have to use sign language. This club boasts the
slickest, flashiest, most psychedelic decor in London. The cover is £5 to
£8 ($10–$16) after 10 p.m.
Bar Rumba, 36 Shaftesbury Ave., W1 (% 020/7287-2715; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus), has a different musical theme every night: jazz fusion, phat funk,
hip-hop, drum ’n’ bass, soul, R&B, and swing. You have to be at least 21
years old to get in on Saturday and Sunday, and you have to be over 18
Monday to Friday. The cover is £5 to £15 ($10–$30).
London pubs
If you’re looking for a pub in The City, the Cittie of Yorke, 22 High
Holborn, WC1 (% 020/7242-7670; Tube: Holborn or Chancery Lane),
has the longest bar in Britain and looks like a great medieval hall, which
is appropriate because a pub has existed at this location since 1430. The
Seven Stars, 53 Carey St., WC2 (% 020/7242-8521; Tube: Holborn), at
the back of the law courts, is tiny and modest except for its collection of
Toby mugs and law-related art. Many barristers drink here, so Seven
Stars is a great place to pick up some British legal jargon while you
throw back a few. The namesake of an inn built here in 1547, the Olde
Mitre, Ely Place, EC1 (% 020/7405-4751; Tube: Chancery Lane), is a
small pub with an eccentric assortment of customers. An Edwardian
wonder of marble and bronze art nouveau, the wedge-shaped Black
Friar, 174 Queen Victoria St., EC4 (% 020/7236-5650; Tube: Blackfriars),
features low-relief carvings of mad monks, a low-vaulted mosaic ceiling,
and seating carved out of gold marble recesses.
In West London, the Churchill Arms, 119 Kensington Church St., W8 
(% 020/7727-4242; Tube: Notting Hill Gate or High Street Kensington),

which is loaded with Churchill memorabilia, hosts an entire week of cel-
ebration leading up to Winston’s birthday on November 30. Visitors are
often welcomed like regulars here, and the overall ambience is down to
earth and homey. The Ladbroke Arms, 54 Ladbroke Rd., W11 (% 020/
7727-6648; Tube: Holland Park), serves good pub food. With background
jazz and rotating art prints, the place strays a bit from a traditional pub
environment but makes for a pleasant stop and a good meal.
Classy bars
With surroundings far removed from the hurly-burly of London’s streets,
the hotel bars in this section are elegant and dressy. Gents need to wear
a jacket and tie at the American Bar; a smart-casual dress code (no
jeans, sweatpants, or tennis shoes) applies for the others.
With a plush décor of Chinese lacquer, comfortable sofas, and soft lighting,
Bracewells Bar in the Park Lane Sheraton Hotel, Piccadilly, W1 (% 020/
7499-6321; Tube: Green Park or Hyde Park), is chic and nostalgic.
The Library in the Lanesborough hotel, 1 Lanesborough Place, SW1 
(% 020/7259-5599; Tube: Hyde Park Corner), is one of London’s posh-
est drinking retreats and boasts an unparalleled collection of cognacs.
The Lillie Langtry Bar in the Cadogan Hotel, Sloane Street, SW1 (% 020/
7235-7141; Tube: Sloane Square or Knightsbridge), takes you back to the
charm and elegance of the Edwardian era, when Lillie Langtry, an actress
and a society beauty (and a mistress of Edward VII), lived here.
Gay and lesbian bars and dance clubs
Check the gay listings in the weekly magazine Time Out to find out what’s
going on, because many clubs have special gay nights. The Lesbian and
Gay Switchboard (% 020/7837-7324; www.llgs.org.uk) has 24-hour
information on everything. For the location of venues described here,
see the “London’s Clubs, Pubs, and Bars” map on p. 196.
In terms of size, central location, and continued popularity, the best gay
disco in London — which is the best disco here, period — is Heaven,
Under the Arches, Craven Street, WC2 (% 020/7930-2020; www.heaven-
london.com; Tube: Charing Cross or Embankment). Admission varies
from £3 to £10 ($6–$20). Hours are 10:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Monday and
Wednesday, 10:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Friday, and 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. on
Saturday. G.A.Y., London Astoria, 157 Charing Cross Rd., Soho, WC2 
(% 0906/100-0160; www.g-a-y.co.uk; Tube: Tottenham Court Road), 
is the biggest gay dance venue in Europe. Admission costs £10 ($20).
Hours are Saturday 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. The gay bars and pubs in Soho
often have flyers for reduced-price admission to these two venues.
For general, where-it’s-happening action, stroll along Old Compton Street
(Tube: Leicester Square or Tottenham Court Road) in Soho. You may want
to duck into Admiral Duncan’s, 54 Old Compton St., W1 (% 020/7437-
5300), or the two-floor Compton’s of Soho, 53–55 Old Compton St., W1
Part III: London and Environs 
198

(% 020/7479-7961). Both of these gay bar/pubs are Soho institutions,
open Monday through Saturday noon to 11 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10:30
p.m. The city’s largest women-only bar is Glass Bar, West Lodge, Euston
Square Gardens, 190 Euston Rd., NW10 (% 020/7387-6184; Tube: Euston).
This “non-scene” bar on two levels has a smart-casual dress code and is
open Tuesday through Friday from 5 p.m. until late, on Saturday from 6
p.m. until late, and Sunday from 2 to 7 p.m.; you can’t get in after 11:30 p.m.
You can find a louder lesbian scene at Candy Bar, 23–24 Bateman St., W1
(% 020/7437-1977; Tube: Tottenham Court Road), open seven nights a
week (until 1 a.m. Mon–Thurs, 3 a.m. Fri–Sat, and 11 p.m. Sun).

you’re calling within London, leave off the
020, and dial only the eight-digit number.
Currency Exchange
In London, you can easily exchange cash or
traveler’s checks by using a currency-
exchange service called a bureau de
change. You find these services at the major
London airports, at any branch of a major
bank, and at all major rail and Underground
stations in Central London, at post offices.

ment necessary) Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to

London Bridge) is open Monday to Friday
from 8:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for walk-in
patients.

Belsize Park); and University College
Hospital, Grafton Way, WC1 (% 020/
7387-9300; Tube: Warren Street or Euston
Square). Many other London hospitals also
have accident and emergency departments.
Information

& London Visitor Centre, 1 Lower Regent St.,
Piccadilly Circus, SW1; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus) provides tourist information to walk-
in visitors Monday 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
Tuesday to Friday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and
Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. You
can find another Tourist Information Centre
in the Arrivals Hall of the Waterloo Interna-
tional Terminal (open daily 8:30 a.m.–10 p.m.).
For general London information, call 
% 0870/156-6366.
Internet Access
easyEverything (www.easyeverything.
co.uk) has cybercafes all over London.
Most of them are open from 8:30 a.m. to 
11 p.m. or midnight.
Maps
The best all-around street directory, London
A to Z, is available at most news agents and
bookstores. You can obtain a bus and Under-
ground map at any Underground station.
Newspapers/Magazines
The Times, Telegraph, Daily Mail, and Evening
Standard are all dailies carrying the latest
news. The International Herald Tribune, pub-
lished in Paris, and an international edition of
USA Today are available daily. Most news-
stands also sell Time and Newsweek. The
weekly magazine Time Out contains an abun-
dance of useful information about the latest
happenings in London. Gay Times, a high-
quality, news-oriented magazine covering the
gay and lesbian community, is available at
most news agents.
Pharmacies
They’re called chemists in the United
Kingdom. Boots has outlets all over London.
Bliss the Chemist, 5 Marble Arch, W1 
(% 020/7723-6116; Tube: Marble Arch), is
open daily from 9 a.m. to midnight. Zafash
Pharmacy, 233–235 Old Brompton Rd., SW5
(% 020/7373-2798; Tube: Earl’s Court), is
London’s only 24-hour pharmacy.
Police
In an emergency, dial % 999 (no coin

Post Offices
The Main Post Office, 24 William IV St., WC2
(% 020/7930-9580; Tube: Charing Cross), is
open Monday to Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. Other post offices and sub-post
offices (windows in the back of news-agent
stores) are open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 
12:30 p.m. Look for red ROYAL MAIL signs 
outside.
Restrooms
The English often call toilets loos. They’re
marked by public-toilets signs on streets, in
parks, and in a few Tube stations. You also
find well-maintained public lavatories in all
larger public buildings, such as museums
and art galleries, large department stores,
and rail stations. Public lavatories are usu-
ally free, but you may need a 20p coin to get
in or to use a washroom. In some places
(like Leicester Square), you find coin-
operated “Super Loos” that are sterilized
after each use. If all else fails, duck into 
the nearest pub.
Safety
Security in the London Underground was
dramatically increased following the 2005
terrorist attacks. London is generally a safe
Part III: London and Environs 
200

city, though, both on the street and in the
Underground. As in any large metropolis,
use common sense and normal caution
when you’re in a crowded public area or
walking alone at night. The area around
Euston Station has more purse-snatchings
than anywhere else in London.
Smoking
As of July 2007, smoking is prohibited in all
public areas throughout the U.K., including
restaurants and pubs. Nonsmoking rooms
are available in more and more hotels, and
many B&Bs are now entirely smoke-free.
Taxes
The 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) is
added to all hotel and restaurant bills and is
included in the price of many items you buy.
You can get this tax refunded if you shop at
stores that participate in the Retail Export
Scheme (signs are posted in the window).
See Chapter 5 for more information.
Taxis
You can hail a cab from the street; if the “For
Hire” light is lit, the cab is available. You can
phone for cab at % 020/7272-0272.
Transit Assistance
For 24-hour information on London’s
Underground, buses, and ferries, call
Transport for London at % 020/7222-1234;

Day-tripping from London
In This Chapter
 Exploring the ancient university towns of Cambridge and Oxford
 Going upriver to Greenwich
 Discovering Hampton Court Palace
 Sniffing the roses at Kew Gardens
 Wandering through Blenheim Palace
 Visiting the royal residence at Windsor Castle
W
ith so much to see and do in London, many visitors never leave
the city. But several wonderful attractions are within easy com-
muting distance, and I share the best of them with you in this chapter. You
can visit any one of the places described here in a day and be back in
London in time for dinner and an 8 p.m. curtain. For locations of the des-
tinations in this chapter, see the “Day Trips from London” map on p. 204.
Cambridge: Medieval Colleges 
on the River Cam
Students at Oxford refer to Cambridge as “the other place.” Located
88km (55 miles) north of London in Cambridgeshire, Cambridge is most
famous for its university. Every year, about 8,000 students apply to this
prestigious school, which accepts only about 1,600. The beautiful col-
leges, many dating from the Middle Ages, are built around quiet inner
quadrangles, or “quads.” The River Cam runs past the colleges, and is
particularly beautiful in April, when daffodils line its banks. Magnificent
King’s College Chapel is a definite must-see in Cambridge. For the loca-
tions of the attractions and restaurants I recommend in the following
sections, see the “Cambridge” map on p. 203.
Getting to Cambridge
Direct trains depart hourly from London’s King’s Cross Station for the
45-minute journey to Cambridge. A round-trip “cheap day return” ticket
costs about £17 ($34); all travel must take place after 9:30 a.m. For
schedules, call % 0845/7484950. You can go by National Express more
cheaply — about £10 ($20) for a day-return (round-trip) ticket — but the

trip from Victoria Coach Station to Drummer Street Station in Cambridge
takes two hours. Contact National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.
nationalexpress.com) for schedules. I don’t recommend driving to
Cambridge because most of the city is closed to traffic (with parking lots
on the outskirts). If you drive from London, take the M11 north, and
follow the signs to Cambridge.
Finding information and taking a tour
 The Tourist Information Centre, Wheeler Street (% 0906/586-
2526; www.visitcambridge.org), has brochures on town and area
attractions and can also book a room for you. The center is open
Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. This office
offers a two-hour city walking tour (£9/$18) that includes colleges
open to the public. The walks leave from the Tourist Information
Centre daily at 1:30 p.m. throughout the year; from July to September,
additional walks depart at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Monday through
Saturday; and from October to March, another Saturday tour departs
at 11:30 a.m. For more information or to book a special guided tour,
stop in this office or call Blue Badge Guides at % 01223/457-574.
 City Sightseeing (% 01708/864340; www.citysightseeing.co.
uk) offers an 80-minute open-top bus tour (£10/$20). Buses depart
daily from the train station, starting at 9:45 a.m., and run every 
15 to 20 minutes until 3 or 4 p.m., depending on the season.
Getting around Cambridge
Cambridge is a compact city, so you can walk everywhere. The distance
from the train station to the city center is about a mile (a 20-minute
walk), so hop on the No. 3 shuttle bus that runs into town every few min-
utes from in front of the station. A Dayrider bus pass, good all day and
available from the driver, costs £2.80 ($5.50). Taxis are available right
outside the train and bus stations. Cambridge, with all its students, is a
big cycling city. If you want to rent a bike, during the summer months,
head to the rental stall right at the train station (no phone). You can also
rent bikes at Geoff’s Bike Hire, 65 Devonshire Rd. (% 01223/365-629),
and Mike’s Bikes, 28 Mill Rd. (% 01223/312-591). Expect to pay about
£10 ($20) a day, plus a refundable deposit for a standard bike.
Exploring the best of Cambridge
Cambridge has enough to keep you happily occupied for an entire 
day. Wandering through the ancient courtyards of the colleges is fun, 
but so many visitors (three and a half million a year) now descend on
Cambridge that several of the colleges have instituted visiting hours and
admission fees.
When visiting Cambridge, keep in mind that the colleges are completely
closed to visitors during exam season, from mid-April until late June.
Note, too, that open hours for the colleges can be restricted during term
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 205

time from September to June. Summer is the best time to visit if you want
to get into the college courtyards, but it’s also the busiest tourist season.
Fitzwilliam Museum
The Fitzwilliam Museum is Cambridge’s best museum and one of England’s
oldest museums. A palatial mid-19th-century building, the museum houses
the original collections bequeathed to Cambridge University in 1816 by
Viscount Fitzwilliam. Typical of an upper-class gentleman, Fitzwilliam col-
lected antiquities from Egypt and Greece (mummies, sarcophagi, vases,
and so on) and porcelain from all over Europe. You can see all these treas-
ures, plus an amazing assortment of later bequests — pewterware, por-
trait miniatures, and illuminated manuscripts — on display in the Lower
Galleries. You can find a rich and varied selection of European paintings
and sculpture, including works by Picasso, Cezanne, and Renoir, in the
Upper Galleries. Check out the rooms devoted to British painting to find
important works by the poet/artist/mystic William Blake, English land-
scapes by Constable and Turner, satirical prints by Hogarth, and portraits
by Gainsborough. The 20th-century gallery displays works by modern
British artists, such as David Hockney, Lucian Freud, and Barbara
Hepworth. Guided tours (£3/$6) are available on Sunday at 2:30 p.m. The
museum houses a pleasant cafe for lunch or tea.
See map p. 203. Trumpington Street (near Peterhouse College). % 01223/332-900.
www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk. Admission: Free, but suggested donation £3 ($6).
Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.; closed Jan 1, Good Friday, May Day,
and Dec 24–31.
King’s College
Founded by Henry VI in 1441, King’s College encloses one of England’s
greatest architectural treasures: King’s College Chapel. Located on the
north side of the college’s Great Court, the chapel was begun in 1446 and
completed about 90 years later. The structure was built in a tall, slender,
highly decorated Gothic style. The stunning interior conveys both strength
and delicacy. Look up to the ceiling, and you see what many consider to
be the finest fan vaulting in England. Nearly 500 years ago, Flemish glaziers
made the enormous windows of richly colored stained glass that depict
stories from the Old and New Testaments. A painting by Rubens, Adoration
of the Magi, adorns the altar.
You may want to arrange your schedule so you can hear Evensong at
King’s College Chapel. In the late afternoons during term time, the chapel’s
famous boys’ choir walks in procession across the college grounds in
black and white robes to sing in the chapel (Tues–Sat, 5:30 p.m.; free).
You can also hear the choir during Sunday services at 10:30 a.m. and
3:30 p.m. On Christmas Day, the famous Festival of Nine Lessons and
Carols (a traditional Christmas service) sung by the choir is broadcast
around the world from the chapel.
See map p. 203. On King’s Parade. % 01223/331-100. Admission (to college and
chapel): £4.50 ($9) adults; £3 ($6) seniors, students, and children 12–17; free for kids

under 12. Open: During the school year, Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m., Sun 1:15–2:15
p.m.; the rest of the year, Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed
Dec 26–Jan 1.
Queens’ College
Queens’ College got its name because two queens — one the wife of Henry
VI, the other the wife of Edward IV — endowed the college in 1448. For
many, Queens’ represents the quintessential and perhaps the most pic-
turesque of all the Cambridge colleges. Step inside to the Old Court, and
you can see a self-contained academic universe: library, chapel, hall,
rooms, and kitchens, all clustered around a small green lawn. The unique
sundial in Old Court dates from 1642 and is one of the country’s finest. Not
only can the sundial tell apparent solar time, but it also can calculate the
sun’s altitude, the date, the time of sunrise and sunset, and the zodiac sign.
The last remaining half-timbered building in Cambridge, President’s
Lodge, is in the southeast corner of Cloister Court. (A half-timbered build-
ing has a visible wooden framework with plaster or brick walls.) Another
unusual feature of Queens’ is the Mathematical Bridge over the Cam. A
copy of the original bridge built in 1749, the span was named because
meticulous calculations made nails unnecessary.
See map p. 203. Queen’s Lane. % 01223/335-511. Admission: £1.50 ($3). Open:
Nov–mid-Mar daily 1:45–4:30 p.m.; mid-March–mid-May Mon–Fri 1:45–4:30 p.m. and
Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; late June 20–Sept, daily 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Oct Mon–Fri
1:45–4:30 p.m. and Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; closed mid-May–mid-June.
St. John’s College
Before entering St. John’s College, on St. John’s Street next door to Trinity,
take a moment to examine its magnificent Tudor gateway. All the fancy
carving and statuary is the heraldic “signature” of Lady Margaret Beaufort
(1443–1509), mother of Henry VII and grandmother of Henry VIII. A great
patron of Cambridge, Lady Margaret founded Christ’s College in 1505 and
died before her second project, St. John’s, was completed in 1511. Inside
the First Court, you can see the original building of St. John’s College. Two
more courts lie beyond, and beyond those courts, you come to the famous
Bridge of Sighs, built in 1831 over the River Cam. The covered wooden
bridge is closed to the public; you can get a better view from a punt, or
small boat. (For information about punt rentals, see “Finding more to see
and do in Cambridge,” later in this chapter.)
See map p. 203. St. John’s Street. % 01223/338-600. Admission: £2.50 ($5). Open:
Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Feb–Mar Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Trinity College
Henry VIII founded Trinity College in 1546, and his coat of arms decorates
the Great Gate on Trinity Street. Beyond the gate is the Great Court, a
vast, asymmetrical expanse of lawn surrounded by fine Tudor buildings,
including a 15th-century clock tower. Rumor has it that Lord Byron
(1788–1824), a Trinity student who became the most famous poet of his
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 207

day, bathed naked with his pet bear in the fountain. Pass through “the
screens” — a passageway between the dining hall and the kitchens — and
you come to Nevile’s Court, where Sir Isaac Newton tested his theory on
the speed of sound. Trinity College Library, on the west side of Nevile’s
Court, is another famous Cambridge building. Designed by Sir Christopher
Wren and begun in 1676, the library contains a treasure trove of rare books
and manuscripts, many written by Trinity alums. The library’s marble
statue of Lord Byron, shown composing his poem Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage, is a masterful work by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.
The four figures standing on the library’s parapet are 17th-century repre-
sentations of Divinity, Mathematics, Law, and Physics — the disciplines
for which Trinity is best known.
See map p. 203. Trinity Street. % 01223/338-400. Admission (college and library):
£2.20 ($4.50). Open: College, daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; library, during the school year,
Mon–Fri noon–2 p.m. and Sat 10:30 a.m.–2:30 p.m.; library, outside of term, Mon–Fri
noon–2 p.m. Closed 1 week June, Sept–early Oct.
Finding more to see and do in Cambridge
Visitors flock to Cambridge to see the historic colleges and breathe in
the rarified academic atmosphere. Check out my additional suggestions
for things to see and do:
 Punting on the River Cam: Cambridge takes its name from the
lovely River Cam. The most famous section of the river is called “The
Backs” because many of the colleges back onto its shores. Punting
on the Cam is a time-honored tradition. Floating along in one of these
flat-bottomed boats looks so romantic, so delightful, so easy! Rather
than oars, the punter uses a long stick and propels the boat from the
rear like a Venetian gondolier. But the stick frequently gets stuck in
the muddy river bottom, and the boat often just doesn’t obey orders.
So unless you’re adept at watersports, consider a chauffeured punt
tour along the river (£12/$24 adult, £10/$20 senior/student, £6/$12
child). If you want to try navigating the river yourself, you can rent
punts, rowboats, and canoes from Scudamore’s Punting Company
(% 01223/359-750; www.scudamores.com). It has two locations:
Quayside Punt Station, beside the Magdalene Street bridge, and Mill
Lane Boatyard, beside the Silver Street bridge. The boatyards are
Part III: London and Environs 
208
Trinity greats
The largest of the Cambridge colleges, Trinity also has the longest list of illustrious
alums. Isaac Newton and Lord Byron; the poets John Dryden and Alfred Lord
Tennyson; the novelists William Thackeray and Vladimir Nabokov; the composer Ralph
Vaughan Williams; the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein; kings Edward VII and George
VI; and the present heir to the throne, Prince Charles, all attended Trinity.

open from Easter to October. The rental costs £16 to £18 ($32–$36)
per hour, plus a refundable £60 ($120) deposit, for up to six people in
a punt. You can arrange a chauffeured punt at these boatyards, too;
the price usually comes out to about £12 ($24) per person.
 Flying back in time: Duxford, in the countryside about 8km (5 miles)
south of Cambridge, was an important airfield during World War II.
Today, with its preserved hangars, control tower, and Operations
Room, the Duxford Imperial War Museum (% 01223/835-000;
http://duxford.iwm.org.uk) is one of Europe’s top aviation
museums. You can check out a major exhibition on the 1940 Battle
of Britain, in which Duxford played a major role, and more than 180
historic aircraft. You can also see a collection of tanks and military
vehicles, including Field Marshal Montgomery’s mobile tactical
headquarters. The American Air Museum features American fighter
planes and other artifacts. A free sightseeing train takes visitors
around the 85-acre site. Pick up something to eat at the self-service
restaurant on the grounds, or bring your own picnic. To get here,
rail travelers can take Stagecoach Lines (% 0870/608-2608) C7 bus
service, which runs every 30 minutes (8:55 a.m.–4:35 p.m.) from the
Cambridge train station (on Sun, use Myalls bus 132 from Cambridge
bus station on Drummer Street). By car, drive south from Cambridge
on the M11 to Junction 10. Admission costs £14.95 ($30) for adults,
£11.50 ($23) for seniors and students, free for children under 16. The
museum is open daily March 17 to October 27 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
and in winter daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; closed December 24 to 26.
Dining in Cambridge
If you’re looking for good vegetarian food, try the Rainbow Vegetarian
Cafe (% 01223/321-551). Located at 9A King’s Parade, down a narrow
passageway opposite King’s College Gates, this subterranean haven is
noted for its excellent daily specials, spinach lasagna, and a hearty
Latvian potato bake with carrots, garlic, herbs, and cheese. Main courses
cost £7.95 ($16). The cafe takes MasterCard and Visa. It’s open Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
You can get a good pub lunch at The Eagle Pub, 8 Benet St. (% 01223/
505-020). The pub, which dates to the 16th century, was a gathering
place for both American and British pilots during World War II. You find
a bit of everything on the menu, including fish and chips, bangers and
mash, pasta, and beef stroganoff. Main courses cost £4 to £12 ($8–$24).
The pub accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
Food is served Monday through Saturday from noon to 3 p.m. (Sun until
4 p.m.) and from 5 to 9 p.m.; the pub is open until 11 p.m.
Restaurant 22, the restaurant in a converted Victorian house at 22
Chesterton Rd. (% 01223/351-880), is the place to go if you’re in the
mood for fine dining. This dinner-only restaurant (open Tues–Sat 7–9:45
p.m.) is one of the best in Cambridge. The modern English cooking
emphasizes local products of the highest quality. This place gets busy,
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 209

so you probably want to make reservations. The set-price dinner costs
£26.50 ($53). The restaurant takes MasterCard and Visa.
Greenwich: The Center of Time and Space
Time is of the essence in Greenwich, a town and borough of Greater
London, about 6.5km (4 miles) east of The City. The world’s clocks are
set according to Greenwich Mean Time, and visitors from around the
globe flock here to stand on the Prime Meridian, the line from which the
world’s longitude is measured. The main attractions in Greenwich, parts
of which UNESCO has designated a World Heritage Site, are the Old Royal
Observatory, the Queen’s House, and the National Maritime Museum, all
located in Greenwich Park, and the Cutty Sark, berthed on the Thames.
The Royal Naval College, a grouping of historic buildings on the Thames,
is one of the finest and most dramatically sited architectural and land-
scape ensembles in the British Isles. Greenwich offers enough to keep
you fully occupied for a full day and is a great outing for kids.
Getting to Greenwich
The most interesting route to Greenwich is by Docklands Light Rail,
which takes you past Canary Wharf and all the new Docklands develop-
ment. The one-way fare costs £4 ($8). To get to Greenwich, ride the Tube
to Tower Hill, where you connect to the DLR at its Tower Gateway sta-
tion (near the Tower of London). Take the light rail to Island Gardens
and then walk through the foot tunnel beneath the Thames to Greenwich.
You come out next to the Cutty Sark. You can also take the Jubilee Under-
ground line to North Greenwich and bus no. 188 from the station into
town. Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234) runs a fleet of boats
from Westminster Pier to Greenwich Pier year-round. A round-trip ticket
costs £9.40 ($19) for adults, £4.70 ($9.50) children, £26 ($52) for families
(2 adults, 2 children).
Finding information and taking a tour
All the attractions in Greenwich are clearly signposted, and you can
easily reach them on foot. The Greenwich Tourist Information Centre,
Pepys House, Cutty Sark Gardens (% 0870/6082-000), open daily from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., offers one-and-a-half- to two-hour walking tours (at
12:15 and 2:15 p.m.) of the town’s principal sights for £4 ($8). You don’t
need to make reservations, but you may want to call first to verify the
schedule.
Exploring Greenwich
Cutty Sark
The majestic Cutty Sark, last of the tea-clipper sailing ships, was launched
in 1869 and first used for the lucrative China Sea tea trade. Later, the ship
carried wool from Australia, and after that (until the end of World War II),
Part III: London and Environs 
210

it served as a training ship. The ship had been closed for restoration when
a fire struck on May 21, 2007, causing major damage. It is scheduled to
reopen in late 2008. Until that time, you can visit an adjacent exhibition
that details the history of the Cutty Sark and the work that’s being done to
save it.
Cutty Sark Visitor Centre, King William Walk. % 020/8858-3445. Admission: £2 ($4)
per person. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–5 p.m; closed Dec 24–26.
National Maritime Museum
The National Maritime Museum is dedicated to Britain’s seafaring past.
The paintings of ships tend to be boring, but you also find sailing crafts
and models and an extensive exhibit on Admiral Lord Nelson, which
includes hundreds of his personal artifacts (including the coat he was
wearing when he was shot at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805). New galleries
with interactive technology explore modern maritime issues. You can see
the entire collection in about 30 minutes.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Old Royal Observatory
After leaving Queen’s House (see the following listing), you can huff your
way up the hill in the park to explore the “center of time and space.”
Situated on the Prime Meridian (longitude zero degrees), the Observatory
reopened in 2007 after a spectacular £15 million ($30 million) redevelop-
ment. Interactive exhibits in the new Weller Astronomy Galleries explain
how stars and planets are born and help you to unravel the mysteries of
the universe. The Star Life planetarium show in the new, state-of-the-art
Peter Harrison Planetarium explores the night sky and how stars are born,
grow up, grow old, and die. Shows are hosted by real astronomers, who are
available to answer questions after the main program (children must be 7
years or older). Also look for the collection of original 18th-century
chronometers (marked H1, H2, H3, and H4), beautiful instruments that were
developed to help mariners chart longitude by time instead of by the stars.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. www.nmm.ac.uk/astronomy. Admission:
Observatory: Free; Planetarium: £6 ($12 adults), £4 ($8) seniors, students, children (no
children under 7 permitted). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (June–Sept until 6 p.m.);
Planetarium shows Mon–Fri 1, 2, 3, 4 p.m., Sat–Sun add’l shows at 11 a.m. and noon.
Queen’s House
Adjacent to the National Maritime Museum is the splendidly restored
Queen’s House, designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 and later used as a model
for the U.S. White House. Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I, commis-
sioned Queen’s House, the first classical building in England, and it was
completed in 1635 (with later modifications). You can visit the royal apart-
ments on a self-guided tour that takes about a half-hour; special exhibits
are also held here.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 211

Royal Naval College
Near the Cutty Sark, the Royal Naval College occupies the site of Greenwich
Palace, which stood here from 1422 to 1620 and was the birthplace of
Henry VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Badly damaged by Oliver Cromwell’s
troops during the Civil War in the 17th century, the palace was later torn
down. In 1696, a naval hospital for retired seamen was erected in its place.
The riverside buildings, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, became the
Naval College in 1873 and are today a UNESCO-designated World Heritage
Site. The only rooms open to visitors are the chapel and the imposing
Great Hall, with its dazzling painted ceiling; the body of Lord Nelson lay
in state here in 1805.
King William Walk (along the Thames). % 020/8858-2154. Admission: Free. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Dining in Greenwich
If you’re looking for a nice spot for lunch, try Inside, 19 Greenwich St.
(% 020/8265-5060). This neighborhood restaurant serves Modern British
cuisine and has vegetarian options. Main courses range from £11 to £17
($22–$34) with daily fixed-price specials. It’s open for lunch Tuesday to
Sunday from noon to 2:30 p.m., for dinner Tuesday to Saturday from 6:30 to
11 p.m., and for brunch on Saturday and Sunday (11 a.m.–3 p.m.).
Hampton Court Palace: Henry VIII’s 
Riverside Estate
In 1514, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII’s Lord Chancellor, began
building Hampton Court in East Moseley, Surrey, 21km (13 miles) west
of London on the north side of the Thames. But Cardinal Wolsey got 
on the monarch’s bad side when he opposed the king’s request for a
divorce from Catherine of Aragon. This opposition provided a conven-
ient excuse for the greedy Tudor monarch to nab Hampton Court for
himself and make the property a royal residence, a status it held from
1525 until 1760. Henry’s fifth wife (of six), Catherine Howard, supposedly
haunts the place to this day, though you’d think the hordes of tourists
would have scared her away by now.
Getting to Hampton Court
Frequent trains from London’s Waterloo Station make the half-hour trip
to Hampton Court Station; a round-trip “cheap day return” fare costs
about £6 ($12). The palace entrance is a two-minute walk from the sta-
tion. If you have plenty of time, you can take a boat from Westminster
Pier to Hampton Court; the journey takes almost four hours. From April
to September, boats usually run at 11 a.m. and noon; call Westminster
Passenger Service (% 020/7930-7770; www.wpsa.co.uk) for more infor-
mation. One-way fares (you can easily take the train back) are £13.50
($27) for adults, £9 ($18) for seniors, £6.75 ($14) for children 5 to 15, and
Part III: London and Environs 
212

£33.75 ($67) for families (2 adults, 2 children). By car, the palace is on A308
close to the A3, M3, and M25 motorways.
Exploring Hampton Court
Hampton Court Palace
The Anne Boleyn Gate, with its 16th-century astronomical clock, and the
Great Hall, with its hammer-beam ceiling, are remnants from Hampton
Court’s Tudor days. In the late 17th century, Sir Christopher Wren signifi-
cantly altered the place for William and Mary. Wren also designed the
famous Maze, where you can wander in dizzy confusion. Inside the enor-
mous palace, something of a maze itself, you can see various state apart-
ments and private rooms, including the King’s Dressing Room, the Tudor
kitchens, wooden carvings by Grinling Gibbons, Italian paintings, and
guides dressed in period costumes. If the weather is nice, take a few min-
utes to stroll through the lovely, manicured Thames-side gardens, or grab

Ghost palace
So many people, from staff to visitors, have reported encounters with Catherine
Howard’s ghost in the “haunted gallery” at Hampton Court that psychologists from the
University of Hertfordshire conducted an investigation to see if they could find a sci-
entific explanation for the phenomenon. Catherine, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII,
was locked up in Hampton Court prior to her beheading for adultery in 1542. One day,
she supposedly escaped and in desperation ran along the 40-foot gallery to pound on
the king’s door and beg for mercy. Sightings in this gallery of a running, screaming
apparition have been reported for centuries. After weeks of research, the ghost
hunters came away empty-handed.

Lichfield Street. If you have more time, you can take a boat. From April
to late September, the Westminster Passenger Service Association
(% 020/7930-2062; www.wpsa.co.uk) operates vessels that leave from
London’s Westminster Pier daily at 10:30 and 11 a.m., noon, and 2 p.m.
Round-trip fares for the 90-minute journey cost £16.50 ($33) for adults,
£11 ($22) for seniors, £8.25 ($17) for children 5 to 15, and £41.25 ($83)
for families (2 adults, 2 children). The last boat from Kew back to London
usually departs around 5:30 p.m. (depending on the tide).
Exploring Kew Gardens
Royal Botanic Gardens
A marvelous array of specimens, many first planted in the 17th and 18th
centuries, thrive in the 300-acre gardens. Gardeners nurture orchids and
palms in the Victorian conservatory. Also onsite, you can find a lake,
aquatic gardens, a Chinese pagoda, and even a royal palace. Kew Palace,
the smallest and most picturesque of the former royal compounds, is
where King George III went insane and where Queen Charlotte died in 1818,
is open from April through September. Queen Charlotte’s Cottage
(not open to the public) served as the mad king’s summer retreat. A sight-
seeing bus called Kew Explorer makes a complete circuit of the gardens
(with hop-on/hop-off service) and costs £3.50 ($7) for adults, and £1 ($2)
for children.
Kew. % 020/8332-5622. www.kew.org. Admission: £12.25 ($25) adults, free for chil-
dren under 16. Tours: Free one-hour tours Mar–Nov daily 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Open:

before gardens; Kew Palace Apr–Sept 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m.; conservatory closes one
hour before gardens.
Oxford: Town and Gown
Oxford University, one of the world’s oldest, greatest, and most revered
universities, dominates the town of Oxford, about 87km (54 miles)
northwest of London. With its skyline pierced by ancient tawny towers
and spires, Oxford has been a center of learning for seven centuries (the
Saxons founded the city in the tenth century). Roger Bacon, Sir Walter
Raleigh, John Donne, Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Samuel Johnson, Edward
Gibbon, William Penn, John Wesley, Lewis Carroll, T. E. Lawrence, W. H.
Auden, and Margaret Thatcher are just a few of the distinguished alumni
who’ve taken degrees here. Even Bill Clinton studied at Oxford.
Although academically oriented, Oxford is far from dull. Its long sweep
of a main street (High Street, known as “The High”) buzzes with a cosmo-
politan mix of locals, students, black-gowned dons, and foreign visitors.
You can tour some of the beautiful historic colleges, each sequestered
away within its own quadrangle (or quad) built around an interior court-
yard; stroll along the lovely Cherwell River; and visit the Ashmoleon
Museum. For the locations of the attractions and restaurants in the fol-
lowing sections, see the “Oxford” map on p. 215.

Getting to Oxford
Trains to Oxford leave from London’s Paddington Station every hour; 
the trip takes about one hour and costs about £17 ($34) for a round-trip
“cheap day return” ticket. For train schedules, call % 0845/748-4950. By
car, take the M40 west from London, and follow the signs. Note, however,
that parking in Oxford is a nightmare.
Finding information and taking a tour
The Oxford Information Centre, 15–16 Broad St. (% 01865/726-871; www.
visitoxford.org), is open Monday to Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The center sells a variety of visitors’
guides and conducts two-hour walking tours of the town and its major
colleges (but not New College or Christ Church). Tours cost £6.50 ($13)
for adults and £3 ($6) for children 5 to 15; tours leave daily at 11 a.m.
and 2 p.m., with additional walks on Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.
City Sightseeing (% 01708/864-340; www.citysightseeing.co.uk)
offers a one-hour bus tour (£9.50/$19) with hop-on/hop-off service.
Buses depart daily from the train station starting at 9:30 a.m. and run
every 15 to 20 minutes until 5 or 6 p.m., depending on the season.
The Oxford Story, 6 Broad St. (% 01865/790-055), packages Oxford’s
complexities into a concise and entertaining exhibit-cum-ride that takes
you through 800 years of the city’s history, reviewing some of the archi-
tectural and historical features that you may otherwise miss. It also 
fills you in on the backgrounds of the colleges and those people who’ve
passed through their portals. Admission costs £7.25 ($15) for adults and
£5.25 ($11) for children 5 to 15. The exhibit is open daily in July and August
from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and from September through June from 10 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. (from 11 a.m. on Sun).
Exploring the best of Oxford
Many Americans arriving at Oxford ask, “Where’s the campus?” Oxford
doesn’t have just one campus; it includes 45 widely dispersed colleges
serving some 16,000 students. Instead of trying to see them all (impossi-
ble in a day), focus on seeing a handful of the better-known ones. Faced
with an overabundance of tourists, the colleges have restricted visiting
to certain hours (usually between 2 and 5 p.m.) and to groups of six or
fewer; in some areas, you aren’t allowed at all. Before heading off, check
with the tourist office to find out when and what colleges you can visit.
You may want to start your tour with a bird’s-eye view of the colleges
from the top of Carfax Tower (% 01865/792-653) in the center of the
city. The tower is all that remains from St. Martin’s Church, where William
Shakespeare stood as godfather for a fellow playwright. The tower is
open daily November to March from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and April to
October from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission costs £2 ($4) for adults and £1
($2) for children 5 to 15.
Part III: London and Environs 
216

I recommend visits to the following four colleges:
 Christ Church College (% 01865/276-150): Facing St. Aldate’s
Street, Cardinal Wolsey (who built Hampton Court, described ear-
lier in this chapter) began this college in 1525. Christ Church has
the largest quadrangle of any college in Oxford and a chapel with
15th-century pillars and impressive fan vaulting. Tom Tower houses
Great Tom, the 18,000-pound bell that rings nightly at 9:05, signaling
the closing of the college gates. Several notable portraits, including
works by Gainsborough and Reynolds, hang in the Picture Gallery
and 16th-century Great Hall. Admission costs £4.90 ($10) for adults,
£3.90 ($8) for seniors and children 5 to 15. The college and chapel
are open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday
from 1 to 5:30 p.m. (last admissions at 4:30 p.m.).
 Magdalen (pronounced Maud-lin) College (% 01865/276-000):
This college on High Street, founded in 1458, boasts the oldest
botanical garden in England and the most extensive grounds of 
any Oxford college; you even find a deer park. The 15th-century
bell tower, one of the town’s most famous landmarks, is reflected in
the waters of the Cherwell River. You can cross a small footbridge
and stroll through the water meadows along the path known as
Addison’s Walk. Admission is £3 ($6) for adults and £2 ($4) for chil-
dren 5 to 15. October to June, the college is open daily from 1 p.m.
to dusk; July and August, it’s open daily from noon to 6 p.m.
 Merton College (% 01865/276-310): Dating from 1264, this college
stands near Merton Street, the only medieval cobbled street left 
in Oxford. The college is noted for its 14th-century library, said to
be the oldest college library in England (admission to the library
costs £1/$1.85). You can see an astrolabe (an astronomical instru-
ment used for measuring the altitude of the sun and stars) thought
to have belonged to Chaucer. The library and college are open
Monday to Friday from 2 to 4 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; both close for a week at Easter and at Christmas.
 New College (% 01865/279-555): On New College Lane, this col-
lege contains the first quadrangle to be built in Oxford (14th cen-
tury), an architectural boilerplate for the quadrangles in many
other colleges. The antechapel holds Sir Jacob Epstein’s remark-
able modern sculpture of Lazarus and a fine El Greco study of St.
James. In the garden, you can see remnants of the old city wall that
used to surround Oxford. Admission costs £2 ($4) from Easter to
October (open daily 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.), free October to Easter (open
daily 2 to 4 p.m.).
Finding more to see and do in Oxford
Other attractions worth checking out in Oxford include the following:
 Architectural highlights: East of Carfax, at the north end of Radcliffe
Square, is the Bodleian Library, Broad Street (% 01865/277-224;
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 217

www.bodley.ox.ac.uk), the world’s oldest library, established in
1450. The Radcliffe Camera, the domed building just south of the
Bodleian, is the library’s reading room, dating from 1737. Although
this and other reading rooms are closed to the public, you can see
the Divinity School; a 15th-century lecture hall; the Exhibition Room,
which mounts rotating displays of rare volumes and prints; Duke
Humfrey’s Library, a collection of early manuscripts; and other parts
of the library on guided tours daily at 10:30 and 11:30 a.m., and 2
and 3 p.m. The fee is £6 ($12); call or stop in at the bookstore for
details. To one side of the Bodleian, you can see the Sheldonian
Theatre, Broad Street (% 01865/277-299), which dates from 1669
and was the first major work by Sir Christopher Wren, designed
when he was an astronomy professor at Oxford. Today, the college
uses the building for lectures and concerts, and you get great city
views from the cupola. Admission costs £2 ($4) for adults and £1
($2) for children 5 to 15. It’s open Monday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 4:30 p.m.
 Ashmolean Museum: Located on Beaumont Street (% 01865/278-
000; www.ashmolean.org), this is the oldest museum in England. A
beautiful classical building from the 1840s houses the collections of
the University of Oxford: European and Asian art; silver; ceramics;
and antiquities from ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. You can get
into the museum for free, and it’s open Tuesday to Saturday from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.
 University Museum of Natural History: Located on Parks Road 
(% 01865/270-949; www.oum.ox.ac.uk), this free museum shows
off a good collection of dinosaur skeletons and other curiosities in
a marvelous glass-roofed Victorian hall. It’s open daily from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Entered from the Natural History Museum, the Pitt Rivers
Museum (% 01865/270-949) is also free and worth poking your
head into for its curiosity value. General Pitt Rivers gave his collec-
tion of ethnic artifacts to the university in 1884, and there are now
more than half a million objects in old-fashioned cases crammed
into a dimly lit room. Arranged by type rather than geography or
date, the exhibits demonstrate how different peoples tackled the
same tasks. Most redolent of adventure are the 150 pieces collected
during Captain Cook’s second voyage, from 1773 to 1774. The Pitt
Rivers Museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to
4:30 p.m., and on Monday from noon to 4:30 p.m.
 Modern Art Oxford: This leading center for contemporary visual
arts, located on Pembroke Street (% 01865/813-830; www.modern
artoxford.org.uk), holds ever-changing exhibitions of sculpture,
architecture, photography, video, and other media. Admission is
free. It’s open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. You can make a tasty stop at 
Café Varvara for breakfast, lunch, or a tea-time snack. It opens
Tuesday to Saturday at 9:30 a.m., and nothing costs much more
than £5 ($10).

Dining in Oxford
Browns, 5–11 Woodstock Rd. (% 01865/511-955), a large, casual,
upbeat brasserie, is one of the best places to eat in Oxford. It serves
hearty food, including a good traditional cream tea, and has a large con-
vivial bar and a very pleasant outdoor terrace. Mummies and daddies
visiting their high-achieving offspring at the university bring them here.
Main courses run from £7 to £16 ($14–$32). Browns accepts American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa. The restaurant is open daily from 9:30
a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday until 10:30 p.m.
If you don’t want to spend a lot for lunch, stop in at Mortons, 22 Broad
St. (% 01865/200-860). It makes delicious sandwiches on fresh baguettes
and serves a daily soup. You can eat upstairs, in the back garden, or take
your sandwich away and picnic elsewhere. Sandwiches cost about £3
($6). Mortons is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
For inexpensive pub grub (salads, soups, sandwiches, beef pie, chili con
carne, and so on) or a pint of beer, try The Turf Tavern, 4 Bath Place
(% 01865/243-235). Dating to the 13th century, the tavern has served
the likes of Thomas Hardy; Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor; and Bill
Clinton, who was a frequent visitor during his student days at Oxford.
You reach the pub using St. Helen’s Passage, which stretches between
Holywell Street and New College Lane. Main courses cost £4 to £9
($8–$18); the tavern accepts MasterCard and Visa. Food is served
Monday to Saturday from noon to 8 p.m.
Blenheim Palace: Ancestral Home 
of the Churchills
Located 13km (8 miles) north of Oxford in Woodstock, Oxfordshire,
Blenheim Palace is one of the most beautiful country estates in England.
Visiting the magnificent Baroque palace, birthplace of Sir Winston
Churchill, and strolling through the magnificently landscaped grounds
can take up the better part of a day, although you can sample the high-
lights in three hours. The palace has several playgrounds and activity
areas for kids.
Getting to Blenheim Palace
From Oxford, the nearest train station, you can take a taxi (about £12/$24)
or bus no. 20 from the Oxford bus station (it stops at the palace gate and
costs £5/$10 for a day return). If you have a car, Blenheim is a 10-minute
drive from Oxford and a 45-minute drive from Stratford-upon-Avon (see
Chapter 19). Approaching Oxford from the M40, take the Junction 9
turnoff, and follow the signs to Blenheim.
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 219

Exploring Blenheim Palace
Make the palace your first stop. To get there, you can walk or take a
narrow-gauge railway from the parking lot. I recommend that you join 
up with a palace tour — tours start every five to ten minutes and last
about a half-hour — but you can also wander through at your own 
pace. Blenheim was built between 1705 and 1722 for John Churchill, first
Duke of Marlborough, in recognition of his victory over the French at 
the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. The palace was a gift from Queen Anne,
whose royal coat of arms is part of the decorations in the Great Hall. The
principal architects were Sir John Vanbrugh, also responsible for Castle
Howard in Yorkshire, and Nicholas Hawksmoor. Together, they devised
the most beautiful baroque palace in England.
The remarkable Great Hall is 67 feet high, with stone carvings by Grinling
Gibbons and a painted ceiling that shows Marlborough victorious at
Blenheim. Sir Winston Churchill, England’s prime minister during World
War II, was born in a room west of the Great Hall in 1874. The Churchill
Exhibition contains a variety of interesting exhibits, from letters to his
baby curls. The Green Drawing Room and the two damask-covered rooms
beyond it all have their original ceilings and family portraits painted by
George Romney, Joshua Reynolds, John Singer Sargent, and Sir Anthony
Van Dyck. A famous tapestry in the Green Writing Room shows
Marlborough accepting Marshall Tallard’s surrender at the Battle of
Blenheim. In the Saloon, used as the state dining room, the silver-gilt
dining table is laid with Minton china.
Three apartments known as the State Rooms display more hung tapestries
showing Marlborough’s victorious campaigns. The Long Library, famous
for its extraordinary stucco decoration and two false domes, exhibits coro-
nation robes, liveries, uniforms, and the coronets of the present duke and
duchess. Sarah, the first duchess, designed much of the chapel, which not
unexpectedly pays homage to the Duke of Marlborough.
Blenheim is set in acres of beautiful parkland with a variety of gardens
designed by Capability Brown and the French landscape architect Achille
Duchene. In spring, daffodils and bluebells cover the grassy banks. In
summer, hoops of pink roses adorn the Rose Garden. Brown designed the
Grand Cascade, a picturesque waterfall. A path leads to the lake, where
you can rent a rowboat. Exotic butterflies inhabit The Butterfly House.
The Marlborough Maze, the world’s largest symbolic hedge maze, was
designed to reflect the palace’s history and architecture. You can have
lunch, tea, or a snack during your rambles at one of the many cafes and
restaurants scattered about.

Windsor Castle: Official Royal Residence
Located in Windsor, Berkshire, 32km (20 miles) from the center of
London, Windsor Castle is one of the queen’s official residences. Some
900 years ago, William the Conqueror constructed the castle, an impos-
ing skyline of towers and battlements rising from the center of the 4,800-
acre Great Park, which has been used as a royal residence ever since.
The town is also the site of Eton College, one of the most exclusive boys’
schools in the world.
Getting to Windsor Castle
Trains leave every half-hour from Waterloo Station in London for the 
50-minute trip (the stop is Windsor & Eton); the round-trip “cheap day
return” fare is about £8 ($16). If you’re driving from London, take M4 west.
Exploring Windsor Castle
The State Apartments, open to visitors, range from the intimate chambers
of Charles II to the enormous Waterloo Chamber, built to commemorate
the victory over Napoleon in 1815. All are superbly furnished with impor-
tant works of art from the Royal Collection. Sir Edwin Lutyens designed
Queen Mary’s Dollhouse, a marvelous palace in miniature, as a present
for Queen Mary (wife of King George V) in 1921. From April through June,
the Changing of the Guard takes place Monday through Saturday at 11
a.m. (on alternate days the rest of the year). From the ramparts of Windsor,
you can look down on the playing fields of Eton College, where aristocrats
and social climbers have been sending their boys for generations. You can
explore the famous school and the charming town of Eton by strolling
across the Thames Bridge.
Windsor, Berkshire. % 01753/831-118. www.windsor.gov.uk/attractions/

Mar 28, June 16, Dec 25–26.
Chapter 13: Day-tripping from London 221
A royal pain
In June 2003, the royal family was royally freaked out when a man dressed in an Osama
bin Laden costume managed to scale a wall at Windsor Castle, talk his way past secu-
rity guards, and get into Prince William’s 21st birthday party. The culprit, who climbed
up onto the stage as William was making a speech thanking his grandmother, Queen
Elizabeth II, for the costume party, turned out to be a comedian known for gate-crash-
ing celebrity events. But the queen wasn’t amused, and the security breach led to an
apology from the police, a full-scale investigation, and a new beefed-up security
system.

Part IV
The Southeast

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I introduce you to Kent and Sussex, the coun-
ties that form the wedge-shaped southeastern corner of
England between London and the English Channel. The area
is incredibly rich in history.
In Chapter 14, I take you to a trio of beautiful towns.
Canterbury is famous for its magniﬁcent cathedral, a place of
pilgrimage for hundreds of years. Rye is a treasure trove of
ancient streets lined with half-timbered inns and Georgian
shops. Brighton, with its long beach, amusement pier, and
fanciful Royal Pavilion, is a seaside resort that’s a favorite
weekend getaway spot for Londoners. In this chapter, I also
tell you about visiting Battle, home to one of the most hal-
lowed spots on English soil — the site where William the
Conqueror fought King Harold for the English throne in 1066.
Moated castles, glorious gardens, and stately homes ﬁll the
Kentish countryside. In Chapter 15, I guide you through
Dover Castle, with its 2,000-year history that stretches back
to the time of the Romans. Hever Castle is noteworthy for its
associations with Anne Boleyn and its magniﬁcent gardens.
Many castle connoisseurs, including several kings and queens
who lived there, consider Leeds Castle the most beautiful in
England. And speaking of beautiful, you won’t ﬁnd a more
spectacular garden anywhere than the one at Sissinghurst.
For a glimpse of how the other half lived, you can visit Knole,
a country estate that just happens to have 365 rooms, or
Chartwell, the country home of Sir Winston Churchill.
You can easily experience every place that I describe in this
part in a day trip from London. Or you can stay overnight in
any of the towns in Chapter 14 and be assured of a good
hotel, ﬁne restaurants, and atmosphere galore.

K
ent and Sussex make up the southeast corner of England, an area
that extends east and south from London to the English Channel.
(See “The Southeast” map on p. 226.) At its narrowest point, near Dover,
the channel separating England from France is only 32km (20 miles)
wide. Because of its proximity to the European mainland, this part of
England has always been of prime strategic importance. Two thousand
years ago, the Romans landed on these shores and began their system-
atic conquest of what they called Britannia. In 1066, William the Conqueror
sailed over from Normandy and fought King Harold for the crown of
England at a place now called, appropriately enough, Battle. Kent and
Sussex became the scene of ferocious air battles and daring sea escapes
during World War II. (Dover Castle, which you can read about in Chapter
15, played a pivotal role in the country’s coastal defenses.)
Despite all the historic dramas that have played out here, the country-
side has an air of calm repose. The land is lush and green, with chalk
downs (high, open, grassy land over a chalk–limestone subsoil) appear-
ing near the coastline. Kent and Sussex (divided into West Sussex and
East Sussex) are wealthy counties, favored spots for country living
because of their mild climate and proximity to London.
In this chapter, I head first to Canterbury to explore the wonders of
Canterbury Cathedral and the charming old town that grew up around it.
From Canterbury, I travel to Rye and stroll the ancient lanes of a once-
proud seaport that is today one of England’s loveliest small towns. After
exploring the battlefield and ruined abbey at Battle, I stop off in the
lively resort town of Brighton for some fun beside the sea.

Canterbury: Tales from the Great Cathedral
Spinning the yarns immortalized in The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer’s pil-
grims made their way to magnificent Canterbury Cathedral, one of
England’s greatest religious structures. For nearly 400 years, the devout,
in search of miracles and salvation (and a bit of adventure), trekked to
the cathedral’s shrine of St. Thomas à Becket, archbishop of Canterbury.
In 1170, Henry II’s henchmen murdered him in the cathedral. The pilgrims
didn’t stop coming until Henry VIII had the shrine destroyed in 1538.
Modern pilgrims, called day-trippers, continue to pour into the Kentish
city of Canterbury, on the River Stour. I recommend that you spend most
of your time visiting the cathedral, which remains the town’s greatest
attraction, and exploring the picturesque streets that surround it. You
may also want to visit some of the small but noteworthy museums and
attractions that can help you piece together an image of Canterbury
through the centuries. For the locations of museums, hotels, restaurants,

and attractions described in the following sections, see the “Canterbury”
map on p. 228.
Getting to Canterbury
Canterbury, which is 99km (62 miles) east of London, has two train sta-
tions, Canterbury East and Canterbury West, both within easy walking
distance from the city center. From London’s Victoria Station, trains run
about every half-hour to Canterbury East. Hourly trains from London’s
Charing Cross stop at Canterbury West. The journey takes one hour and
45 minutes and costs £19.50 ($39) for a “cheap day return” (round-trip)
ticket from London. For train schedules and information, call % 08457/
484-950.
National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com)
offers frequent, direct bus service from London’s Victoria Coach Station
to Canterbury’s bus station on St. George’s Lane, a few minutes’ walk
from the cathedral. The trip takes one hour and 50 minutes; day-return
fare is £8 to £12 ($16–$24).
To drive from London, take A2, then the M2; Canterbury is signposted all
the way. The city center is closed to cars, but several parking areas are
close to the cathedral.
Finding information and taking a tour
At the Tourist Information Centre, 12–13 Sun St. (% 01227/378-100;
www.canterbury.co.uk), opposite Christchurch Gate at the entrance
to the cathedral precincts, you can buy tickets for guided-tour walks of
the city and cathedral. The walks leave from here daily at 2 p.m. (in July
and Aug, additional walks Mon–Sat at 11:30 a.m.). The cost is £4.50 ($9)
for adults, £4 ($8) for seniors and students, £3 ($6) for children under 12,
and £15 ($30) for families. From Easter through October, the center is
open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the rest of the year, it’s open Monday through
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Canterbury Historic River Tours, Weaver’s House, 1 St. Peter’s St. 
(% 07790/534-744), offers half-hour boat trips on the Stour River with 
a commentary on the history of the buildings you pass. From April
through September, river conditions permitting, boats depart daily
every 15 to 20 minutes from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets cost £6 ($12) for
adults, £5 ($10) for seniors and students, and £4 ($8) for children 5 to 15.
Umbrellas are available in case of rain. The boats leave from behind the
15th-century Weaver’s House (which you can get to through the
Weaver’s restaurant garden).
Staying in or near Canterbury
Canterbury itself has surprisingly few hotels, but you can find some
other acceptable options in the vicinity.

Cathedral Gate Hotel

Canterbury
If you want to stay near the cathedral like the pilgrims of yore, you can’t
get any closer than this 27-room hotel adjoining Christchurch Gate (one
of the gates into the cathedral precincts). Dating from 1438, the hotel has
comfortable and modestly furnished rooms, and an overall ambience of
sloping floors, massive oak beams, and winding corridors. With the
cheaper rooms, you’ll be sharing a bathroom.

Canterbury
Originally a Georgian residence, the Chaucer stands opposite Canterbury’s
ancient city walls, about a 10-minute walk from the city center. This is a
small, pleasant, recently refurbished hotel with 42 comfortable rooms, all
of them different in size and layout, some with views over the city’s
rooftops to the cathedral. The bathrooms are a decent size. The locals
really like the hotel’s restaurant.

Exploring Canterbury
Much of central Canterbury is a pedestrian-only zone, making it a pleas-
ant place to stroll.
Canterbury Cathedral
Imagine how overwhelmed medieval pilgrims must have been when they
first saw this massive and magnificent structure. The cathedral’s origins
date to A.D. 597, when St. Augustine arrived on a mission from Rome. Fire
and Viking marauders destroyed the earlier church. What stands on the
site today is the first cathedral in England to be built in the Gothic style.
The crypt dates from about 1100 and the cathedral from the 13th century,
with a central bell tower — called Bell Harry — added in the 15th century.
After Archbishop Thomas à Becket was murdered in the cathedral in 1170,
pilgrims from all over Europe began to flock to his shrine. Although Henry
VIII destroyed Becket’s shrine, its site is still marked in the Trinity Chapel,
near the high altar. Noteworthy features of the cathedral include panels of
rare stained glass and the medieval royal tombs of Henry IV and Edward
the Black Prince. Give yourself at least an hour to visit the cathedral.
As you stroll the cathedral grounds, you may encounter flocks of well-
behaved boys and girls wearing blazers and ties. They attend King’s
School, the oldest public school in England, housed in several fine
medieval buildings (not open to the public) around the cathedral.

The Canterbury Tales
This museum and exhibition are informative and entertaining even if you
don’t know a thing about Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400) or The Canterbury
Tales, his spirited and sometimes-bawdy stories about a group of medieval
pilgrims on their way to visit Becket’s shrine at Canterbury Cathedral. The
pilgrimages that were so popular in Chaucer’s time are re-created here in
tableaux. You can hear five of Chaucer’s tales and the story of St. Thomas
à Becket’s murder on audio headsets. Give yourself 45 minutes to an hour
to see and hear the entire show.

Roman Museum
Two millennia ago, following their conquest of England, Romans lived in
Canterbury, which they called Durovernum Cantiacorum. This small but
fascinating museum, in the excavated Roman levels of the city between the
cathedral and High Street, chronicles their daily lives. Allow 30 minutes.
See map p. 228. Butchery Lane. % 01227/785-575. Admission: £3.10 ($6.25) adults;
£1.90 ($3.75) seniors, students, and children 5–15. Open: Year-round Mon–Sat 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; June–Oct Sun 1:30–5 p.m.
St. Augustine’s Abbey
Although the cathedral gets the lion’s share of attention in Canterbury,
another Christian site predates the cathedral by about 600 years. Set in a
spacious park, about a 15-minute walk east from the town center, are the
atmospheric ruins of St. Augustine’s Abbey, founded in A.D. 598 and one of
the oldest Anglo-Saxon monastic sites in the country. You tour this World
Heritage site with an interactive audio tour. Allow 30 minutes.
Trek another five minutes east from St. Augustine’s Abbey, and you
encounter England’s oldest parish church. No one knows for sure who
founded St. Martin’s Church, North Holmes Road (% 01227/459-482),
but it was already in existence when Augustine arrived from Rome to
convert the Anglo-Saxon natives in A.D. 597. The tiny church was given 
to Queen Bertha, the French (Christian) wife of Saxon (pagan) King
Ethelbert of Kent, as part of her marriage contract. The church is open
daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and admission is free. Allow ten minutes at
most; the church is tiny.

Rye: Smugglers, Mermaids, and Writers
“Rye is like an old beautifully jeweled brooch worn at South-England’s
throat.” So wrote Patric Dickinson, one of the many writers who have
fallen under the spell of this remarkably beautiful coastal town in East
Sussex. (See the “Rye” map on p. 233.) Henry James spent the last years
of his life here, and E. F. Benson, author of Mapp and Lucia, was mayor.
(Benson called the town “Tilling” in his novels.)
The town earned its official title, “The Ancient Town of Rye,” nearly a
millennium ago when Rye joined the federation of coastal defense towns
known as the Cinque Ports. After a pleasurable stay in 1573, Queen
Elizabeth I decreed that the town could use the additional title “Rye
Royale.” Located today about 3km (2 miles) inland from the English
Channel, Rye was a powerful seaport that protected the coast from for-
eign marauders while carrying on a lively business in smuggling and
piracy. That maritime history still clings to the cobblestone lanes
threading through Rye.
Rye is small enough that you can see it all in about three hours but so
charming that you may want to spend the night. The town claims to have
more historic buildings than any other town in England, and preserva-
tionists carefully protect their appearance. As a result, you see buildings
dating from the 13th century to the Victorian era, with no modern intru-
sions. Rye is also known for several excellent restaurants, many of which
serve fresh, locally caught seafood. For the locations of hotels, restau-
rants, and attractions that follow, see the “Rye” map on p. 233.
Getting to Rye
Rye is 100km (62 miles) southeast of London. By train, you can visit Rye
in an easy day trip. Trains depart hourly from London’s Charing Cross
Station, and you have to make a change at Ashford International; the
total trip takes about two hours. The day return (round-trip) fare from
London costs about £22 ($44). For train schedules, call % 08457/484-
950. The easy walk from Rye train station on Cinque Ports Street to
Strand Quay, a good place to start your explorations, takes about ten
minutes.
By car, Rye is 16km (10 miles) northeast of Hastings on A259. From London,
take the M25, M26, and M20 east to Maidstone, turning southeast along A20
to Ashford; at Ashford, take A2070 south to Rye. Cars aren’t allowed into
the historic center, so you need to park in one of the nearby lots and walk
from there. Currently, no bus service is available from London to Rye.
Part IV: The Southeast 
232

If you drive, you can easily combine a trip to Rye with a trip to Battle,
scene of the momentous Battle of Hastings in 1066 (see the section
“Battle: 1066 and All That,” later in this chapter).
Finding information
One of Rye’s old sail lofts (where sails were repaired) on Strand Quay
now holds the Rye Heritage Center, home of the Tourist Information
Centre (% 01797/226-696; www.visitrye.co.uk). You can obtain a

Renting the audio walking tour from the information office on Strand
Quay (see the previous section, “Finding information”) is the best avail-
able way to get to know Rye. Easy to use, and packed with interesting
historical tidbits and ghost stories, the tour makes a circuit around the
town, stopping to point out sights you may otherwise miss. Depending
on how frequently you stop, the tour takes anywhere from one to three
hours. If you stay overnight in Rye, you may want to consider an
overnight rental of the “Ghost Walks” audio tour.
If you’re a fan of E. F. Benson’s novels set in Rye, you may want to con-
sider taking the “Mapp and Lucia’s Rye” walking tour. Conducted by
the secretary of the E. F. Benson Society, the walk takes you past the
characters’ houses to the Benson memorials in St. Mary’s Church and
ends at Lamb House, the onetime residence of E. F. Benson. From the
last week in May through September, the 90-minute walks take place 
on Wednesday and, in summer, on the first and third Saturday of the
month at 2 p.m. The tour costs £4.95 ($10) per person. You don’t need 
to reserve in advance; just show up at Hilder’s Cliff (the end of High
Street). For more information, call % 01797/223-114 or 01797/226-696.
(Before coming to Rye, you may also want to watch the film versions of
the books: The Mapp and Lucia stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s,
were filmed in ten one-hour segments for television in the 1980s and are
available on video and DVD.)
Staying in Rye
Rye offers any number of charming, historic places to stay, some with

Rye’s calendar of events
In late July, Rye holds its Siege of Rye weekend, with a parade of costumed locals and
demonstrations of medieval weaponry by the order of Rye Longbowmen. In September,
the town stages the Rye Arts Festival, which features concerts, lectures, perform-
ances and exhibitions. The town celebrates Guy Fawkes Night (Nov 5) with the Rye
Bonfire Weekend: Bonfire societies from all over Sussex participate in a parade and
torchlight procession through the darkened streets before the ceremonial bonfire and
fireworks. For information about the holiday, see the sidebar “Famous failure: Guy

Exploring Rye
Formerly a fortified island surrounded by the sea, Rye occupies a hill
that now rises above the flat green expanse of Romney Marsh. From
atop the former ramparts, you can see the River Rother, home to the
local fishing fleet, winding its way toward the sea. Rye is a town to
explore on foot (cars aren’t allowed) and at your leisure. You can savor
it in its entirety rather than in a specific church or museum. Rye is jam-
packed with half-timbered Tudor and Elizabethan houses, handsome
Georgian town houses, secret passageways, quaint corners, cobbled
lanes, windy viewpoints, enticing shops, and wonderful restaurants. (For
more about the architectural styles mentioned here, see Chapter 2.)
Lamb House
This dignified red-brick Georgian house is full of literary associations. The
house was the last residence of the American writer Henry James, who
became a British citizen at the end of his life and lived here from 1898 to
1916. In this house, James entertained many other writers, including H. G.
Wells, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. One guest, E. F. Benson,
acquired the house after James’s death. Benson, who became mayor of
Part IV: The Southeast 
236

Rye, went on to write a series of satirical novels set in the town. Visitors
to Lamb House, now a National Trust property, can see some of the rooms
and personal possessions used by James and Benson. The house also has
a charming walled garden. You can see the house and garden in under a
half-hour.
See map p. 233. West Street. % 01892/890-651 (regional office of National Trust).
Admission: £3.30 ($6.50) adults, £1.70 ($3.50) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Oct Thurs and
Sat 2–5:30 p.m.
Rye Castle Museum
Rye’s local history museum has two sites. The 12th-century Ypres Tower
displays medieval pottery, ironwork, and items having to do with smug-
gling (for which Rye was notorious). Originally built as part of the town’s
defenses, the tower is one of Rye’s oldest buildings. The structure survived
the burning of the town by the French in the late 14th century and was
later used as a prison and a mortuary. From the terrace, you can view what
was once Rye’s busy harbor. The Gungarden below the tower received its
name from the small cannons mounted there for the symbolic protection
of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who made an official visit in the
1980s. (The Queen Mum was Warden of the Cinque Ports, an honorary title
formerly held by Winston Churchill.) On East Street, a former bottling fac-
tory has been converted into the East Street Gallery, the second half of
the museum. In the Gallery, you can see a splendid 18th-century fire
engine, paintings and engravings of Rye, an exhibition of the famous local
pottery, and maritime memorabilia. You can breeze through both of these
sites in less than a half-hour.
See map p. 233. Pump Street (Ypres Tower) and East Street (Gallery). % 01797/
226-728. Admission: Joint ticket to both, £5 ($10) adults, £4 ($8) seniors and students,
children under 16 free. Open: Apr–Oct Thurs–Mon 10:30 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2–5 p.m.;
Nov–Mar Tower only Sat–Sun 10:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
St. Mary’s Church
For almost 900 years, the parish church of St. Mary’s has dominated the
hill on which the old town stands. In 1377, French invaders looted the
town, set it on fire, and carried the church bells off to France. The follow-
ing year, men from Rye sailed to Normandy and brought the bells back.
The church’s turret clock, the oldest in the country, dates from 1561 and
has an 18-foot-long pendulum. The church’s “Quarter Boys” (bells that
strike the quarters but not the hours) were added in 1760. The church has
several interesting stained-glass windows, although none is very old. You
can see the most beautiful window, by Sir Edward Burne-Jones and dating
from 1891, in the north aisle. You can climb the church tower for a mag-
nificent view out over the rooftops of Rye.
See map p. 233. Church Square. % 01797/222-430. Admission: church, free; Tower,
£1.50 ($3). Open: Church and tower, daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m. (4 p.m. in winter). The tower
isn’t accessible to wheelchairs.

The Story of Rye
Located in the same building as the tourist-information center, this attrac-
tion uses an elaborate scale model of the town for a miniature sound-and-
light show detailing highlights in Rye’s long and sometimes-bloody history.
Kids usually enjoy the spectacle. The show lasts approximately 20 min-
utes and provides a good overall introduction to Rye.
See map p. 233. Rye Heritage Center, Strand Quay. % 01797/226-696. Admission: £3
($6) adults, £1.50 ($3) seniors, £1 ($2) children 5–15. Open: Daily summer 10 a.m.–5
p.m., winter 10 a.m.–3 p.m.
Battle: 1066 and All That
If you ever studied English history, the year 1066 probably rings a bell.
That year, Duke William of Normandy defeated Harold, king of England,
at the Battle of Hastings. After the battle, William became known as
William the Conqueror. He had himself crowned king at Westminster
Abbey and Winchester, and began construction of the Tower of London
and other fortifications that you can still see today. William’s conquest
of England ended the post-Roman Anglo-Saxon era. For taxation pur-
poses, the new monarch compiled a list of every property and building
in his newly conquered land. The list became the famous Domesday
Book, a unique record of England in the 11th century. (The original
Domesday Book, housed in the Public Records Office in London, isn’t
accessible to the public. You can, however, look over its contents on 
the Web at www.domesdaybook.co.uk.)
But all this history started with a battle, and Battle marks the spot. In
the town, preserved behind high brick walls, you can see the actual bat-
tlefield where the Saxon and Norman soldiers clashed on that fateful 
day in 1066. (Many people think that the Battle of Hastings took place in
Hastings, but the conflict happened here, 9.5km/6 miles inland.) If you
have an interest in history, Battle is a memorable visit. Basing yourself in
nearby Rye or Brighton, you can come to Battle as part of a larger tour
of southeast England, or you can come to Battle for a day trip from
London. Local tourist associations refer to the Sussex countryside
around Battle as “1066 Country.”
Getting to Battle
Battle is 92km (57 miles) south of London. Direct train service is available
from London’s Charing Cross Station (Battle is a stop on the London–
Hastings line). The trip takes about 90 minutes; a standard day return
(round trip) costs £19 ($38). You also can get train connections from
Rye, about 29km (18 miles) southeast, via Hastings. The easy walk from
the Battle train station to the battlefield entrance on High Street takes
about ten minutes. (To get to the battlefield, turn left outside the station
and right at Lower Lake, the first main street.) For train schedules and
information, call % 08457/484-950.
Part IV: The Southeast 
238

By car, Battle is about 9.5km (6 miles) north of Hastings on A2100.
Parking lots are near the entrance to the battlefield.
Finding information
The Battle Tourist Information Centre, Battle Abbey Gatehouse, 88 High
St. (% 01424/773-721; www.visitsussex.org), has a free town pam-
phlet that includes a map. The center is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m. in summer, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter.
Dining in Battle
A plethora of restaurants and tearooms beckons travelers along High
Street. For hearty and traditional home-cooked English food, try the
Gateway Restaurant, 78 High St. (% 01424/772-056), open daily from 
9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Lunch specials usually include several old-fashioned
pies: steak, ale, and mushroom; steak and kidney; and chicken, leek, 
and bacon. You can also get toasted sandwiches, baguettes with differ-
ent fillings, an all-day brunch, or an afternoon cream tea (£4.95/$10).
Lunch costs about £5 to £8 ($10–$16); the restaurant doesn’t accept
credit cards.
Chapter 14: Kent and Sussex 239
Famous failure: Guy Fawkes
In the front hallway of the Almonery, the building on High Street that houses the Copper
Kettle (see the preceding section, “Dining in Battle”), you can see one of the oldest Guy
Fawkes sculptures in the country, bearded and dressed in black and red with a pointed
hat. Residents parade the figure around town before they light a bonfire on Guy Fawkes
Night, November 5.
Who, you may ask, was Guy Fawkes (1570–1606)? Guy was the most famous guy
behind the Gunpowder Plot, a conspiracy of Catholic extremists to blow up Protestant
King James and the Houses of Parliament. On November 4, 1605, poor Guy was caught
red-handed in the Palace of Westminster. The treasonous plot, and Guy Fawkes’s sub-
sequent execution, gave rise to a popular rhyme:
Please to remember / The 5th November:
Gunpowder, Treason and Plot.
We know of no reason / Why Gunpowder Treason
Should ever be forgot.
Every year since 1605, on November 5, residents of towns, villages, and cities through-
out England light bonfires, toss firecrackers, and parade or burn an effigy of Guy
Fawkes to celebrate his failure to blow up the king and the Parliament. Guy Fawkes
Night is perhaps the longest-running tradition in England, even though the religious
and royalist sentiments that inspired it have long vanished.

For another atmospheric place to get a simple hot lunch, snack, or after-
noon tea with homemade cakes, check out the Copper Kettle, also on
High Street (% 01424/772-727). It’s in the Almonery, a lovely, beamed
medieval hall (where the Town Council meets) with a pretty, walled
garden. Lunch costs under £7 ($14), but you can’t pay with a credit card.
The shop is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Exploring the Battle of Hastings Abbey 
and Battlefield
Make sure that you visit this site in Battle, and give yourself at least 
two unhurried hours to take it all in. This attraction offers a fascinating
journey back in time. The preservationist organization English Heritage,
which owns the site, has done a clever job of making the experience
both interesting and informative. You receive an audio guide when you
pay for your ticket.
The tour starts with an outdoor video presentation, 1066 — The Battle 
of Hastings, that fills you in on the major events leading up to the battle.
Next comes an exhibition, “Prelude to Battle,” which uses text panels 
to draw you deeper into the story of the intrigues and the royal power
struggle between King Harold and Duke William of Normandy. Finally,
you walk onto the battlefield itself. The long (complete) tour takes about
an hour; a shorter version takes about 45 minutes. Take the longer tour
if you have time (and the weather is good).
Linked to your audio guide, descriptive panels line the pathway around
the battlefield. The battle’s unfolding events are presented as seen
through the eyes of three different narrators: Aelfric, a Saxon thane;
Henri, a French knight; and Edith, the wife of King Harold. As you tour
the battlefield, you can follow the story and tactics used by both sides
from these three perspectives. The vivid, firsthand accounts of the
battle are fictional, but they bring history alive for kids of all ages.
King Henry VIII dissolved the great abbey that William had constructed
to mark the spot where King Harold was slain. Today, the abbey is an
atmospheric ruin, but you can explore several rooms.
Entrance at south end of High Street. % 01424/773-792. Admission: £6.30 ($13) adult,
£4.70 ($9.50) seniors, £3.20 ($6.50) children 5–15, £15.80 ($32) families (2 adults, 2 chil-
dren). Open: Daily Apr–Sept 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Oct–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m. (last audio tour
issued one hour before closing); closed Jan 1 and Dec 24–26. Uneven terrain makes
much of the battle site inaccessible to wheelchair users; however, a short gravel
path does wind through part of the site.
Brighton: Fun beside the Seaside
On the Sussex coast, a mere 81km (50 miles) south of London, Brighton
is England’s most famous, and probably most popular, seaside town.
Part IV: The Southeast 
240

(See the “Brighton” map above.) Brighton was a small fishing village
until the Prince Regent, a fun-loving dandy who reigned as George IV from
1820 to 1830, became enamored of the place and had the incredible Royal
Pavilion built. Where royalty moves, fashion follows, and Brighton, on
the English Channel, eventually became one of Europe’s most fashion-
able towns. (The long terraces of Georgian town homes that you see
everywhere in Brighton date from that period.) Later in the 19th century,
when doctors prescribed breathing sea air as a cure for everything from
depression to tuberculosis, the Victorians descended in hordes. (The
famous Brighton pier is from that era.) Today, Brighton is a popular place
for weekend getaways and conventions. People come to hang out on the
long stretch of beach, shop, stroll, and party the night away at clubs and
discos. Gays and lesbians are very much part of the local and visitor scene.
Getting to Brighton
More than 40 trains a day run from London’s Victoria Station to Brighton.

starters such as a salad of marinated goat’s cheese and artichokes with
pancetta, and main courses such as seared calf’s liver or simple classics
such as coq au vin; a glass of wine comes with the fixed-price meal.

Exploring Brighton
Brighton is a fun city to explore. It’s compact enough that you can walk
everywhere but large enough that you can discover quiet streets off the
beaten tourist track. A stroll along the seaside promenade is an essential
part of any trip to Brighton.
Brighton Museum & Art Gallery
Close to the Royal Pavilion on Church Street, you can find the city’s small
museum and art gallery, which has interesting collections of Art Nouveau
and Art Deco furniture, glass, and ceramics, plus a fashion gallery. You can
easily while away a spare hour here.
See map p. 241. Church Street. % 01273/290-900. Admission: Free. Open: Tues 
10 a.m.–7 p.m., Wed–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 2–5 p.m. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 24–26.
Palace Pier
The town’s famous amusement area (also called Brighton Pier) juts out
into the sea just south of the Royal Pavilion. The pier was built in the late
19th century, when Brighton became a major holiday resort. Today, Palace
Chapter 14: Kent and Sussex 245
A pier of the realm collapses
Brighton has two famous piers, but only the Palace Pier is open to visitors today. The
other, West Pier, was built in 1866 and reached its heyday in the 1920s, when it had a
concert hall and charged admission to keep the riffraff at bay; it closed in 1975 for
safety reasons. Plans to renovate West Pier, the only pier in Britain that has received
the top heritage grade designation, gained urgency just before New Year’s 2003, when
a chunk of the ornate structure collapsed into the sea. At last report, there was still no
consensus on what to do with what was once the greatest piece of marine architec-
ture in England.

Pier looks a bit tacky, but it’s kept in good shape and still worth visiting. If
the arcade games and rides don’t interest you, you can just walk and enjoy
the sea air. At night, all lit up with twinkling lights, the pier is almost cheer-
ily irresistible.
See map p. 241. Seafront. Admission: Free. Open: 24 hours.
Royal Pavilion
Set in a small landscaped park, Brighton’s must-see attraction is one of the
most extraordinary palaces in Europe. John Nash redesigned the original
farmhouse and villa on this site for George IV (when the king was still
Prince Regent). The fun- and food-loving George lived here with his mis-
tress, Lady Conyngham, until 1827. The king’s brother, William IV, and their
niece, Queen Victoria, also used the pavilion. Finding the accommodations
too cramped and lacking a sea view, Victoria closed the Royal Pavilion, put
the furnishings into storage, and moved to Osborne House on the Isle of
Wight. The city of Brighton eventually got the furnishings back and opened
the pavilion to the public. Give yourself about an hour for a leisurely walk-
through tour.
The crazily wonderful exterior is an Indian fantasy of turrets and minarets.
The interior, decorated in the Chinese style, is sumptuous and fantasti-
cally extravagant. The Long Gallery has a color scheme of bright blues
and pinks; the Music Room has a domed ceiling of gilded, scallop-shaped
shells; and the King’s private apartments on the upper floors epitomize
the Regency lifestyle of the rich and royal.

£5.10 ($10) children under 16, £20.50 ($41) families (2 adults, up to 4 children). Open:
Daily Oct–Mar 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Apr–Sept 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed Dec 25–26.
Wheelchair users should call first to make arrangements.
Seafront
Brighton and neighboring Hove stretch out along the English Channel. The
entire seafront is a pebbly public beach used for swimming and sunning.

246
Tea at the pavilion
Before you leave the Royal Pavilion, consider having lunch or a cream tea in the nicely
restored Queen Adelaide Tea Room (% 01723/292-736; see map p. 241), open daily
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (to 5 p.m. in summer). Queen Adelaide, who used this suite in
1830, didn’t appreciate the epicurean tastes of her husband, George IV. Dismissing his
renowned French chefs, she reverted to English cuisine so dreary that Lord Dudley
complained, “You now get cold pâté and hot champagne.” The lunch selections range
from £4 to £7 ($8–$14) and cream teas from £4 to £6 ($8–$12).

England, about a mile west of Palace Pier. All along the seafront, you can
find promenades for strolling.
Shopping in Brighton
The Lanes, Brighton’s original fishing village, is now a warren of narrow
streets filled with small shops selling mostly tourist trinkets. North
Laines has more interesting shops, including some trendy outfitters.
Duke’s Lane is a good place to look for men’s clothing, and Duke Street
and Upper North Street are good for antiques.
Shops in Brighton are generally open Monday through Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with a later closing on Thursday or Friday. During the
summer tourist season, some shops are open on Sunday and closed on
Monday.
Stepping out in Brighton, night or day
Brighton is preeminently a resort town, a place where people go to relax
and have fun. The nighttime scene is a lively one, especially from April
through September.
The performing arts
The Brighton International Festival (% 01273/292-950; www.brighton-
festival.org.uk), one of England’s best-known arts festivals, happens
in May and features a wide array of drama, literature, visual art, dance,
and concert programs ranging from classical to hard rock. England’s
best actors regularly appear at the Theatre Royal, New Road (% 01273/
328-488), which presents a full season of dramatic works.
The highly regarded Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra (% 01273/622-
900) performs a season of classical concerts at The Dome, 29 New Rd.
(adjacent to the Royal Pavilion). Built in 1803 as the stables for George
IV’s horses and remodeled into a concert hall in 1935, The Dome hosts
concerts of all kinds. When internationally known performers come 
to town, they play at the 5,000-seat Brighton Centre, Russell Road 
(% 01273/202-881).
The pub and club scene
Brighton fills up on the weekends, especially in summer, with folks look-
ing for a good time. You can find many choices for nighttime entertain-
ment. Pick up a copy of the local entertainment weekly, The Punter, or
look for What’s On, a weekly events sheet posted around town, to find
out what’s happening. Pub hours are Monday through Saturday from 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 10:30 p.m. Dance clubs open
later and sometimes remain open for 24-hour stretches on weekends.
Clubs generally have a cover charge of £5 to £7 ($10–$14).
Clubbers usually start their evening at a bar or pub. One good place to
begin is the 100-year-old Colonnade Bar, New Road (% 01273/328-728).
Chapter 14: Kent and Sussex 247

An even older establishment — parts of it date to the 16th century — 
is The Cricketers, Black Lion Street (% 01273/329-472). When you’re
ready to dance, you may want to try Event II, Kingswest on West Street
(% 01273/732-627), which boasts state-of-the-art lighting and visual
effects. At Gloucester, Gloucester Plaza (% 01273/699-068), you can
find different music all through the week: from ’70s and ’80s retro hits to
alternative and groove.
Gay and lesbian spots
Brighton’s “Gay Village” centers on St. James’s Street, east of the Royal
Pavilion, and along the seafront. Ask at the tourist information center 
for a list of current gay and lesbian nightlife choices. All the gay pubs
and bars are fairly close to one another. Pub hours are Monday through
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 10:30 p.m.
Legends, the smartly redecorated bar in the Legends Hotel, 31–32 Marine
Parade (% 01273/624-462), has a cabaret area for weekly entertain-
ment. Summer weekends are a nonstop buzz at the big new Amsterdam
hotel bar, 11–12 Marine Parade (% 01723/688-825). The Harlequin,
43 Providence Place (% 01273/620-630), a cabaret bar with weekly drag
shows and karaoke, has been voted the best gay bar outside London.
Marlborough, 4 Princes St. (% 01273/570-028), a traditional pub in the
heart of town, is popular with lesbians. Club Revenge, 32 Old Steine St.,
opposite the Palace Pier (% 01273/606-064), spreads over two floors
and holds about 700 people; the club has lasers, smoke machines, and
views of the seafront. A sociable crowd packs the place.

T
he county of Kent is rich in castles, stately homes, and magnificent
gardens. All are within about 81km (50 miles) of London, so you can
visit them on day trips. Alternatively, you can incorporate Kent’s most
famous sights into a car tour of the Southeast. (For ideas on towns to
visit, see Chapter 14.)
Kent is known as the Garden of England (see the “Kent’s Castles, Stately
Homes, and Gardens” map on p. 250). A mild year-round climate favors
Kent, where fruit grows and hops ripen in the summer sun. Old walled
orchards and conical oast (hops-drying) houses dot the landscape. Kent
has more gardens open to the public than any other county in England.
With the one exception of Dover Castle, the castles and stately homes
that I describe in this chapter all have superbly landscaped grounds.
Don’t worry about finding a meal. In every castle, home, and garden, you
can find at least one restaurant or tea shop where you can get lunch, a
snack, or tea.
The places in this chapter are all in the country. They’re near small
towns with rail stations but not always within easy walking distance of
the station. You can, however, visit them all by train or bus, continuing
by taxi when necessary. Taxis are generally available outside the train
stations. If you drive yourself, make sure that you have a good map with
you. I do provide directions to each sight, but as soon as you’re off the
motorway and main roads, Kent is full of winding lanes. The attractions
all have parking onsite or in parking lots.

The Web site www.traintaxi.co.uk provides information about taxi
service from every train station in England. The site gives you the phone
numbers of local taxi companies so that you can make reservations and
have a cab waiting when you arrive.
Knole: A Room for Every Day of the Year
Set in a picturesque deer park, this great country homestead houses
important collections of portraits, silver, tapestries, and 17th-century
furniture. What make Knole so wonderfully unique are its size and the
fact that the house has remained basically unaltered since 1603. A visit
here is an ideal day trip from London; be sure to give yourself at least
three hours to take it all in.

Getting to Knole
Frequent train service connects Sevenoaks Station, 2.5km (11⁄2 miles)
from Knole, to London’s Charing Cross Station. The journey takes 30
minutes and costs about £8 ($16) for a “cheap day return” round-trip
ticket. Call % 08457/484950 for train schedules. From the rail station,
you can walk to the park entrance in the center of Sevenoaks or take the
connecting hourly bus service. You can also find cabs at the station or
call Bluebird (% 01732/45531) to reserve one in advance; one-way taxi
fare to the entrance is about £5 ($10). By car, Knole is 8km (5 miles)
north of Tonbridge, off A225.
Exploring Knole
With its skyline of gables, chimneys, battlements, and pinnacles, this
enormous house resembles an entire village. Like a well-protected
medieval community, Knole has a central gatehouse with an inner gate-
house (Bourchier’s Tower). The gatehouses may conjure up visions of a
traditional castle, but they are, in fact, entirely decorative.
Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, purchased the land and
original house at Knole in 1456. He set about transforming the fortresslike
building into a home suitable for princes of the church (the Archbishop
of Canterbury, as the spiritual head of the Church of England, wielded
enormous wealth and power). Four more archbishops resided at Knole
before Henry VIII took possession of the house (just as he took posses-
sion of Hampton Court Palace, home of Cardinal Wolsey). Henry VIII
enlarged Knole until it was suitable as a royal palace, but he never spent
much time there. His daughter Elizabeth I presented the house and
estate to her cousin Thomas Sackville, the first Earl of Dorset, in 1566.
His descendants have lived at Knole ever since. Knole was the childhood
home of Vita Sackville-West, who created the gardens at Sissinghurst
Castle. (See the section “Sissinghurst Castle Garden: Romance amongst
the Roses,” later in this chapter.)
In 1603, the first earl enlarged and embellished what would become one
of England’s greatest houses. Occupying some 4 acres, Knole was built
with seven courtyards, representing the days of the week, 52 staircases,
one for each week of the year, and 365 rooms, one for every day of the
year. The 13 state rooms open to the public are magnificent representa-
tives of the Elizabethan and Stuart eras. Rooms that you can tour
include three long galleries, each with an adjoining state bedroom, and
the King’s Bedroom, which has a 17th-century bed decorated with gold
and silver thread and topped with ostrich feathers.
In addition to its outstanding tapestries and textiles, important portraits
by Van Dyck, Gainsborough, and Reynolds fill the house. Among the
house’s original features are the fine plasterwork ceilings, the carved
Chapter 15: Kent’s Best Castles, Stately Homes, and Gardens 251

wooden screen in the Hall, and the painted walls of the staircases. The
elaborate marble-and-alabaster chimneypiece and mantle in the Ballroom
(the former living quarters of Archbishop Bouchier) stretch from floor
to ceiling and are considered one of the finest works of Renaissance
sculpture in England.
Large herds of fallow and Japanese deer roam the parkland surrounding
the house. The private garden is open only once a month and requires
separate admission. Look for the tearoom, where you can get lunch or
tea, on the premises.
See map p. 250. Tonbridge Road, Sevenoaks. % 01732/462-100. Admission: House
£8.50 ($17) adults, £4.25 ($8.50) children 4–15, £21.30 ($43) families (2 adults, 2 chil-
dren); garden £2 ($4) adults, £1 ($2) children 4–15; deer park free to pedestrians. Open:
House mid-Mar–Oct Wed–Sun noon–4 p.m.; garden mid-Mar–Oct Wed 11 a.m.–
4 p.m.; park daily; tearoom mid-Mar–Oct Wed–Sun 10:30–5 p.m.
Hever Castle: Anne Boleyn Slept Here
A lovely, moated castle set amid immaculately landscaped gardens 48km
(30 miles) south of London, Hever Castle was the childhood home of
Anne Boleyn (1507–1536), the second wife of Henry VIII. Anne of Cleves,
Henry’s fourth wife, also lived here. In 1903, the American millionaire
William Waldorf Astor bought the castle and created the beautiful gar-
dens. Hever is a fairly easy day trip from London. Give yourself at least
an hour for the house and another two hours to enjoy the gardens.
Getting to Hever Castle
From London’s Victoria Station, trains depart throughout the day for 
two stations near Hever Castle. The trip takes an hour and costs £8 ($16)
for a “cheap day return” round-trip ticket. You have to change trains at
East Croyden. From Hever Station, you can take a pretty 1.6km (1-mile),
15-minute walk to the castle. Taxis aren’t available at Hever station, but
they are available from Edenbridge Town Station, located 5km (3 miles)
from the castle. I recommend that you book a cab in advance, otherwise
you may have to wait for an hour or more. Call Rely On Cars (% 01732/
863-800) or Edenbridge Cars (% 01732/864-009); the one-way taxi fare
from the train station to the castle costs about £6 ($12).
If you’re traveling to Hever Castle on a Sunday, always check to find 
out whether the train stops at Edenbridge Town Station or Edenbridge
Station. Due to train-scheduling changes on Sunday, you may have to get
off at the Edenbridge Station and take a taxi to the castle; one-way fares
are about £6 ($12). For taxi companies, see the preceding information for
Edenbridge Town Station.
By car, Hever Castle is 5km (3 miles) southeast of Edenbridge, midway
between Sevenoaks and East Grinstead off B2026. From London, take the
M25, and exit at Junction 5 or 6.
Part IV: The Southeast 
252

Exploring Hever Castle
Hever Castle’s long and varied history stretches back over seven cen-
turies. To experience this rich history, you can wander through the
rooms in the castle at your own pace; guides can answer your questions.
The castle’s stone gatehouse and outer walls were constructed in the
13th century. In about 1500, the Boleyn (or Bullen, as it was then writ-
ten) family added a more comfortable Tudor manor house within the
walls. In the middle of divorcing his first wife, Catherine of Aragon,
Henry VIII wooed Anne Boleyn at Hever Castle.
Henry VIII’s desire for Anne Boleyn helped change the course of English
history. When Catherine of Aragon didn’t produce a male heir, the king
turned his eye to Anne. Hoping that the 25-year-old Anne would give him
the successor he wanted, Henry sought to divorce Catherine. When the
pope refused Henry’s request, Henry broke with the Catholic Church
and established the Church of England with himself as head. He then
married Anne, but she also failed to deliver a male child. (Her first child
was Elizabeth I, who became one of England’s greatest monarchs.)
Eventually, Henry had Anne arrested on trumped-up charges of adultery
and incest with her brother George. Both Boleyn siblings were executed,
George first and then the unfortunate Anne, who was beheaded at the
Tower of London. You may hear her called Anne of the Thousand Days
because that’s how long she was queen.
After Anne’s demise and the death in childbirth of his third wife, Jane
Seymour, the much-married monarch gave Hever Castle to his fourth
wife, Anne of Cleves, who lived there after Henry divorced her. You can
view costumed likenesses of Anne, Henry, and his other five wives in the
waxwork exhibition “The Six Wives of Henry VIII,” on the top floor of
the castle.
William Waldorf Astor acquired Hever Castle in 1903 and spent a fortune
restoring it. What you see today is a result of Astor’s preservation efforts.
Inside, splendid carving and paneling cover the castle walls. Antiques,
some interesting works of art, including portraits of Anne Boleyn and
her daughter, Elizabeth, and a Holbein painting of Henry VIII fill the
rooms. You can also view two of Anne’s prayer books. In 2003, two por-
traits of Mary, Queen of Scots went on display.
The gatehouse, the last room you visit, contains a grisly collection of
torture instruments, including beheading axes. Anne asked for a French
axe to be used on her neck — she knew French axes did a quicker,
cleaner job.
Between 1904 and 1908, Astor further enhanced the castle’s parklike 
setting by creating the magnificent gardens, which include the Italian
Garden, filled with statuary and sculpture collected in Italy and dating
from Roman to Renaissance times; the Maze; a 35-acre lake; and the rose
garden. The Tudor herb garden, close to the castle, opened in 1994.

Chartwell: The Private Life of a 
Famous Prime Minister
Chartwell House was the home of Sir Winston Churchill (1874–1965) from
1924 until he died. The home can’t compare with the grandeur of Blenheim
Palace (see Chapter 13), where Churchill was born, but if you’re inter-
ested in the personal life of Britain’s wartime prime minister and one of
its great statesmen, Chartwell will fascinate you. Give yourself at least
one-and-a-half hours to visit the house and gardens. If you’re driving,
you can easily combine a visit to Chartwell with a visit to Hever Castle
or Knole (see previous sections in this chapter for information on both).
Getting to Chartwell
From London’s Charing Cross Station, you can hop on frequent train serv-
ice to Sevenoaks, 10.5km (61⁄2 miles) east of Chartwell, or to Oxted, 6 miles
west of Chartwell. The journey takes about 40 minutes and costs about
£8 ($16) for a day-return (round-trip) ticket. Call % 08457/484-950 for
train schedules. From either station, you can take a cab to Chartwell. To
reserve a taxi from Sevenoaks, call Bluebird (% 01732/455-531); from
Oxted, call Terrys (% 01883/712-623) or D Line (% 01883/715-576).
The one-way taxi fare costs you approximately £9 ($18).
By car, Chartwell is 3km (2 miles) south of Westerham; fork left off B2026
after 2.5km (11⁄2 miles).
Exploring Chartwell House
The National Trust administers Chartwell, a family home where the rooms
and gardens remain much as Churchill left them. You can see Churchill’s

Leeds Castle: Castle of Queens, 
Queen of Castles
Leeds Castle, tucked away in the Kent countryside (64km) 40 miles
southeast of London, is one of the world’s most beautiful castles. Built
on two small islands, its stone facade mirrored in a lake, this treasure
trove of history has enough in its rooms and gardens to beguile you for
half your day. Coming here is an easy day trip by train or bus from
London, or you may want to combine a visit with an overnight trip to
Canterbury or Rye (both described in Chapter 14).
Getting to Leeds Castle
Trains run frequently from London’s Victoria Station to Maidstone
and Bearsted stations; Bearsted is closer to the castle. Southeastern
(% 0845/000-2222; www.southeasternrailway.co.uk) offers an all-in-
one ticket to Bearsted Station with connecting bus service to and from
the castle; the package costs £26 ($52) for adults, £14.75 ($29) for children.
National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) 
runs a special bus-and-admission package from London’s Victoria Coach
Station every day that the castle is open. Buses leave at 9 a.m., arrive at
Leeds Castle at 10:30 a.m., depart at 3 p.m., and arrive back in London
by 4:50 p.m. The package costs £21 ($42) for adults, £14 ($28) for chil-
dren. By car, from London’s ring road, continue east along the M26 and
M20; the castle is 6.5km (4 miles) east of Maidstone at the junction of
A20 and the M20.
Exploring Leeds Castle
Part of Leeds’ fascination lies in the stories of its various owners. The
castle reflects the changing tastes and fortunes of several families and
dozens of generations. The original buildings were wood, constructed in
A.D. 857 during the Saxon era. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the
buildings were given to the French Crevecoeur family, who rebuilt them
in stone. The castle’s vineyard (still producing) is listed in the Domesday
Book, tax records compiled in 1086. Under Edward I, in 1278, Leeds
became a royal palace. During the medieval era, six queens of England
lived there. Faces from many eras greet you as you walk through the
castle. Look for the portrait of Catherine of Valois (it hangs near her
apartments). Catherine, the widow of Henry V, eloped with Owen Tudor.
Chapter 15: Kent’s Best Castles, Stately Homes, and Gardens 255

Henry VIII, their great-grandson, stayed at the castle often and added the
Tudor windows.
By the mid-16th century, Leeds was no longer a royal palace. A house
was built on the larger island in the early 1600s. An owner in the 18th
century, the 6th Lord Fairfax, owned 5 million acres of land in Virginia
and was a mentor and friend to George Washington. After several more
owners, Olive Lady Baillie purchased the house in 1926 and completely
transformed the interior. Her collections of medieval and Renaissance
tapestries, Chinese porcelain, paintings, and furniture give Leeds Castle
a sumptuous quality.
The tour of Leeds Castle begins in the Norman Cellar, passes through
the medieval Queen’s Rooms, and into Henry VIII’s richly decorated
Banqueting Hall. The circuit then takes you into a suite of rooms deco-
rated in the 1920s. The Gatehouse, where you enter, houses the Dog
Collar Museum, with a collection that dates back to the 16th century.
You get your first glimpse of Leeds Castle from the Wood Garden and
Duckery, which you pass through on the way to the entrance. In the
spring, wood anemones carpet the banks of the stream; swans and wild-
fowl live here year-round. The Culpeper Garden, named for the castle’s
17th-century owners, is a large cottage garden planted with lavenders,
roses, lupines, and poppies that start blooming in early summer. The
Lady Baillie Garden takes its inspiration from the Mediterranean. If you
reach the center of the Maze, you’re rewarded with entry into a mysteri-
ous underground grotto.
Visitors often overlook the Aviary, which opened in 1988 and houses
more than 100 species of rare and endangered birds, including parrots,
toucans, cockatoos, kookaburras, and cranes.
Two restaurants serve hot meals. You can also find a tearoom and snack
stands throughout the grounds.
See map p. 250. Maidstone. % 01622/765-400. www.leeds-castle.com.
Admission: £14 ($28) adults, £11 ($22) seniors and students, £8.50 ($17) children 4–15,
£39 ($78) families (2 adults, 3 children). Open: Daily Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.,
Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–3:30 p.m.; closed Dec 25 and on certain days in June and July for
classical concerts.
Sissinghurst Castle Garden: Romance 
amongst the Roses
The writer Vita Sackville-West and her diplomat husband, Sir Harold
Nicolson, created Sissinghurst, one of the world’s most famous gardens.
Sissinghurst Castle, an Elizabethan manor house with a central red-brick
tower, was in ruins when the Nicolsons bought it in 1930. Harold developed
Part IV: The Southeast 
256

the basic garden scheme, which is like a series of small, enclosed 
outdoor rooms. Vita, who had grown up in the huge manor house at
Knole (see “Knole: A Room for Every Day of the Year,” earlier in this
chapter), was the plantswoman. She filled the “rooms” with an outstand-
ing assortment of flowering plants, creating a romantic atmosphere 
full of color year-round. Her goal was to create a garden of “profusion,
extravagance, and exuberance within the confines of the utmost linear
severity.”
Getting to Sissinghurst Castle Garden
The nearest train station, Staplehurst, is 9km (51⁄2 miles) away. Direct
trains run from London’s Charing Cross Station; the trip takes just under
an hour and costs about £13.50 ($27) for a combined rail–bus ticket. From
Staplehurst Station, take a Cranbrook bus to the village of Sissinghurst;
from there, the castle gardens are an easy 2km walk (11⁄4-mile) on pave-
ment and through countryside. From Staplehurst Station, you can also
get a cab; a trip one-way to the gardens costs about £9 ($18); to reserve
a taxi, call MTC (% 01580/890-003) or Weald (% 01850/893-650). For
train information, call % 0845/484-950. By car, the garden is 3km (2 miles)
northeast of Cranbrook and 1.6km (1 mile) east of Sissinghurst village 
on A262.
Exploring Sissinghurst Castle Garden
Sissinghurst features a beautiful garden with lush plantings that soften 
a strict formal design. The White Garden, with foliage and blossoms
that are entirely white or silver, is probably the most celebrated of the
several “rooms” created by Sir Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West.
Every season has its highlights. In April and May, primroses carpet the
Nuttery, and the Spring Garden explodes with blossoming daffodils and
other bulb plants. The orchard holds an enticing Wild Garden. Many
people come specifically to see the summer roses. Vita Sackville-West
planted hundreds in every form and helped return some lost roses to
cultivation. Lovely old varieties climb through trees and over walls. In
June and July, a wave of fragrance ascends all over the garden from the
thousands of roses blooming everywhere.
The library and the tower study where Vita worked are also open to 
visitors. You can have lunch or tea at the Granary Restaurant on the
premises.
Note: Sissinghurst limits the number of guests in its garden at any given
time. Upon your arrival, you receive a ticket that indicates your admit-
tance time. Waiting times depend on the season and time of day. If you
arrive during peak times (summer 11 a.m.–4 p.m.), you may have to wait
an hour or more for admittance; the garden is least crowded in April,
September, and October, and after 4 p.m. on Tuesday to Friday year-
round. If you arrive after 4 p.m. on Tuesday to Friday, you can get in
immediately. Wheelchairs can access only parts of the garden; baby
Chapter 15: Kent’s Best Castles, Stately Homes, and Gardens 257

strollers are not admitted (the paths are narrow and uneven), but free
baby carriers are available.
See map p. 250. Sissinghurst, near Cranbrook. % 01580/710-700 or 01580/710-701
(recorded information). Admission: £7.90 ($16) adults, £4 ($8) children, £22 ($44) fam-
ilies (2 adults, 2 children). Open: Mid-Mar–Oct Fri–Tues 11 a.m.–6.30 p.m.; last admis-
sion one hour before closing.
Dover Castle: Towers and Tunnels
Dover is one of the busiest Channel ports, with thousands of visitors
arriving daily on ferries and hovercraft from the Continent. Unfortunately,
your first impulse upon seeing Dover may be to turn around and leave 
as quickly as possible. The town is low on charm and has the transient,
unfocused air of a place where people pass through but never stay.
Many people want to visit Dover, however, to see the famed white cliffs.
A better reason to visit — the only reason, in my opinion — is to explore
Dover Castle. Sitting high on a clifftop overlooking the Channel, the
castle is awash with 2,000 years of history, right through World War II.
Dover Castle puts on a good show, one that everyone can enjoy. You can
go there as a day trip from London, or if you’re arriving in Dover by
ferry, you can visit the castle before heading on to other parts of the
country. I don’t recommend that you stay overnight in Dover.
Getting to Dover Castle
Dover is 124km (77 miles) southeast of London, on the English Channel.
Frequent train service connects London’s Victoria Station to Dover
Priory Station. The trip takes just under two hours; a round-trip ticket
costs about £23 ($46). Call % 0845/484-950 for train schedules. From
the train station, you can walk through the town to the castle — about 
a 2.5km trek (11⁄2-mile), part of it uphill — or take a Stagecoach bus (no.
90, 91, or 111) from Dover Priory Station to the castle (£2.40/$5 for a
Dayrider one-day bus pass, available from the driver). You can also get 
a cab right outside the station; the one-way fare costs about £6 ($12). 
I don’t recommend traveling to Dover from London by bus as a day trip,
because the trip takes anywhere from two hours and 40 minutes to 
three hours. By car, the castle is on the east side of Dover, signposted
from the M20 and A2.
The castle covers some 70 acres and offers plenty to see. If you don’t
want to walk from place to place within the compound, take the free
Land Train that makes a circuit of the grounds. You can get a free map
when you enter.
Exploring Dover Castle
Start with the Secret Wartime Tunnels. The entrance to the tunnels is
near the castle’s general visitor entrance. You can visit these tunnels
only with a guided tour (allow 40 minutes), and you may have to wait 
Part IV: The Southeast 
258

on busy days, but it’s well worth it. The tour takes you into the labyrinth
of underground tunnels that were used during World War II as a hospital
and general war office. Wartime sound and light effects accompany your
visit. The rooms have been preserved as they were during the war; you
see the Underground Command Center, the hospital with its operating
room, and the living quarters.
The other sites within the castle compound are set up as separate attrac-
tions (all included in your ticket price). In the Keep Yard, you find an
introductory film that you can use to help plan what you want to see.
You can view a 2,000-year-old lighthouse tower (called “the Roman
pharos”) dating from the Roman occupation of Britain and a much-
restored Saxon church beside it. The 1216 Siege Experience, an audio
tour of an exhibit that includes sound and light effects, tells the story of
the unsuccessful French siege of the castle. You can look out over the
channel on the Battlement Walk and explore the Medieval Tunnels.
Kids particularly enjoy the Secret Wartime Tunnels and the 1216 Siege
Experience because of the special effects.
For a glimpse of those famed white cliffs of Dover, which are sadly turn-
ing a bit brown because of air pollution, climb the steps to Admiralty
Look-out.
If all this clambering around makes you hungry, head to the restaurant in
the Keep Yard, where you can get hot food and snacks.
See map p. 250. Dover. % 01304/201-628. Admission: £9.80 ($20) adults, £7.40 ($15)
seniors, £4.70 ($9.50) children 5–15, £24.50 ($49) families (2 adults, 2 children). Open:
Daily Apr–Sept 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; closed
Jan 1 and Dec 24–26.

Part V
The West Country

In this part . . .
T
he West Country is a bold, mysterious place. Rugged
moors stretch like a spine down the center of a narrowing
peninsula that begins in Hampshire and ends in Cornwall 
at the rocky headland called Land’s End. Giant prehistoric
landmarks — Stonehenge being the most famous — dot the
landscape. Centuries of wind and rain have worn down the
ancient Celtic crosses that stand like lonely sentinels in vil-
lage churchyards. The sea beats incessantly along the penin-
sula’s north and south coasts. The West Country also happens
to have England’s mildest climate, with spring coming earlier
and autumn lingering later than in the rest of the country. All
this helps to explain why the West Country is one of the most
appealing regions in England to visit.
In Chapter 16, I introduce you to the best places in Hampshire
and Wiltshire. Bucolic Hampshire was part of the ancient
Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Winchester, the kingdom’s most
beautiful city, is a two-hour train ride from London. The land-
scape starts to change in Wiltshire, where Stonehenge, that
great silent challenge to modern sensibilities, stands on the
ﬂat expanse of Salisbury Plain.
I devote Chapter 17 to Devon, home to the cathedral city of
Exeter and enormous Dartmoor National Park, one of the
most unspoiled natural landscapes in England. The tiny town
of Clovelly on Devon’s north coast is a unique reminder of
Devon’s once-great ﬁshing industry.
In Chapter 18, I take you to Cornwall. Penzance on the south
coast and St. Ives on the north make good bases for exploring
Land’s End and other special places in this westernmost
county in the West Country. Tintagel on the north coast has
long been associated with the legend of King Arthur.

T
he Hampshire countryside has a bit of everything: marshland 
and heath, traditional farms and quiet villages with thatched-roof
cottages, ancient woodlands, rolling hills, narrow lanes, and chalk 
downs (high, open, grassy land over a chalk–limestone underlayment).
Hampshire is basically an agricultural county known for special crops,
such as watercress, strawberries, and hops, with large-scale farming
appearing on the scene more recently. Along its south coast is the naval
town of Portsmouth, with the Isle of Wight lying across the channel
known as The Solent.
Welcome to Wessex
Hampshire, along with Wiltshire and several other counties in southern England, was
part of the ancient kingdom of Wessex formed by Saxons in the fifth century, follow-
ing the withdrawal of Roman troops from England. Winchester, the Hampshire town of
most interest to visitors, was the capital of this ancient kingdom. The countryside
around Winchester is home to some famous manor houses and gardens.

Hampshire and Wiltshire
Part V: The West Country 
264
Wiltshire, adjoining Hampshire to the west, is a fertile county character-
ized by undulating chalk downs and stretches of woodland. Over the
centuries, farmers and herders have used much of the county for sheep
grazing. The flat and mostly treeless expanse of Salisbury Plain, an area
well known to prehistoric inhabitants of England, dominates the central
part of Wiltshire. The Ridgeway, the oldest known path in England,
crosses the plain, and ancient peoples erected mysterious stone-circle
monuments like Stonehenge here. Salisbury is a good place to headquar-
ter if you want to explore the Wiltshire countryside. Wilton House, one
of England’s finest stately homes, is close by, as are the magnificent gar-
dens at Stourhead, one of the oldest and most famous landscape gardens
in England.
For an overview, see the “Hampshire and Wiltshire” map above.

Chapter 16: Hampshire and Wiltshire: Old Wessex and New Sarum 265
Winchester: King Alfred Meets Jane Austen
King Alfred and Jane Austen didn’t really meet, of course, because they
lived almost a thousand years apart. But Alfred (849–899), the great
Saxon king of Wessex, and Jane Austen (1775–1817), the brilliant novel-
ist, are the most prominent personalities associated with Winchester,
the capital of the ancient kingdom of Wessex. Elusive, legendary King
Arthur has a spot of honor, too — King Arthur’s Round Table has been
on display here for more than 600 years. Another famous visitor was
William the Conqueror, who came to Winchester to claim his crown after
the Battle of Hastings (see Chapter 14). William founded the present
cathedral, and in Winchester, he ordered the compiling of his inventory
of England, the Domesday Book. But long before Arthur, Alfred, William,
or Jane, the Romans lived here — Winchester’s High Street was their
east–west route through the city.
Chapter 16: Hampshire and Wiltshire: Old Wessex and New Sarum

I recommend that you visit Winchester as a day trip from London 
(see the “Winchester” map on p. 265). Reaching Winchester and explor-
ing the city are easy. One of the best-kept and prettiest small cities in
England, it evokes its ancient heritage with pride. The cathedral alone 
is worth a trip. With a walk, lunch, and afternoon tea, you can spend a
very pleasant day indeed in the old capital of Wessex.
Getting to Winchester
Frequent, direct train service (% 08457/484-950) goes from London’s
Waterloo Station to Winchester. The trip takes about one hour; a “cheap
day return” round-trip ticket costs about £23 ($46). The center of town 
is about a 1⁄2-mile from the station. To get there, you can easily walk (ten
minutes), hop on a park-and-ride bus (40p/80¢), or take a taxi (about
£4/$8) from the rank outside the station. National Express (% 08705/
808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) runs several buses a day from
London’s Victoria Coach Station; the fastest trip takes two hours (the
longest, more than four hours); a round-trip ticket costs about £13 ($26).
The bus lets you off on Broadway, in the center of town. If you’re driving
from London, take the M3 to Junction 9. You can’t drive in the town
center; you can find parking lots on the roads coming into the city.
Finding information and taking a tour of Winchester
The ultra helpful Tourist Information Centre, in the Guildhall on
Broadway (% 01962/840-500; www.visitwinchester.co.uk), has
loads of local info and a free, self-guided walking tour booklet. You can
also buy tickets for guided walking tours that make a 90-minute circuit
around this fascinating city. From April through October, tours leave
almost every day at 11 a.m. or 2:30 p.m., with additional walks during
the summer (Sat only from Nov through March). The tour costs £4 ($6)
for adults, free for kids. The center is open May through September
Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; October through April, hours are Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Staying in Winchester
The Tourist Information Centre has a hotel-booking service. If you want
to spend the night, I recommend the following hotels:
 Hotel du Vin, Southgate Street, Winchester, Hants SO23 9EF 
(% 01962/841-414; Fax: 01962/842-458; www.hotelduvin.com): 
A stylish town house hotel with a good bistro. A double with 
breakfast costs £130 to £200 ($260–$400).
 Winchester Royal Hotel, St. Peter Street, Winchester, Hants 
SO23 8BS (% 01962/840-840; www.winchester-hotels.co.uk):
Comfortable, full of character, and close to the cathedral. Doubles
with breakfast start at £80 ($160).
Part V: The West Country 
266

Finding lunch or a spot of tea
The Courtyard Cafe (% 01962/622-177), in the Winchester Guildhall
right behind the Tourist Information Centre, is a great, informal spot for
a morning cappuccino; homemade soups, salads, and sandwiches at
lunchtime; or an afternoon tea. Lunch costs about £6 to £8 ($12–$16).
The cafe is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Cathedral Refectory, Inner Close (% 01962/853-224), is behind a
medieval wall next to the cathedral. This spot specializes in desserts
and meals made from fresh local ingredients. Lunch costs about £6 to
£10 ($12–$20). Hours are Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5
p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Nov–Feb open until 4:30 p.m.)
Exploring Winchester and the surrounding area
The main attraction in Winchester is the ancient cathedral. After viewing
the cathedral, stroll through the town, using the walking tour I describe
in the section “Strolling through Winchester: A walking tour,” later in this
chapter. Jane Austen fans can visit her former homes in Winchester and
in the nearby village of Chawton, but you need at least two additional
hours to visit Chawton if you rely on public transportation.
Visiting the top attraction: Winchester Cathedral
The 900-year-old Winchester Cathedral occupies the heart of the city
and is the repository of many historic treasures. In all, 12 English kings
lie here, indicative of Winchester’s long reign as capital of Wessex and
England after the Norman Conquest. The cathedral you see today was
begun in 1079, after the Conquest, and has the longest nave (the long
central hall of a church) in Europe. Jane Austen’s grave is a simple
stone floor marker in the north aisle. A few feet farther along is a 12th-
century font made of Tournai marble carved with stories of St. Nicholas
(patron saint of pawnbrokers long before he became known as Old Saint
Nick). Above and on either side of the Great Screen, an elaborate carv-
ing completed in 1476, you see mortuary chests containing the remains
of Saxon kings and bishops. The beautiful choir stalls were carved in
about 1308. Check out the Winchester Bible, an extraordinary illumi-
nated manuscript, in the library. For a leisurely stroll through the cathe-
dral, give yourself about 30 minutes.
The world-famous Winchester Cathedral Choir sings at all main serv-

Strolling through Winchester: A walking tour
Winchester is a walking city par excellence, with all sorts of fascinating
corners in which you can poke around. The walking tour in this section
takes about two hours, longer if you linger. For all the sights this tour
describes, see the “Winchester” map on p. 265.
1. Winchester Cathedral and precincts: Begin your tour at Winchester
Cathedral, described in the preceding section. Outside, adjacent to
the cathedral, is the Deanery, formed from 13th-century buildings
that had belonged to the Priory of St. Swithin (which stood here
before Henry VIII dissolved all the monasteries in 1539). Cheyney
Court, the picturesque half-timbered porter’s lodge beside the
ancient priory gate (King’s Gate) was formerly the Bishop of
Winchester’s courthouse. The Deanery and Cheyney Court build-
ings aren’t open to the public.
2. Jane Austen’s Winchester house: Walk through King’s Gate, and
turn left onto College Street. Almost immediately, you come to a
private house with a plaque on it. This is where Austen died on July
18, 1817, aged 42. Austen scholars believe she died of Addison’s
disease, a malfunctioning of the adrenal glands. The ailing writer
came to Winchester from the nearby village of Chawton so she
could be close to her doctor. She is buried in Winchester Cathedral.
Farther down Queen Street, you see the buildings of Winchester
College, the oldest public school in England, founded in 1382.
Neither the Austen house nor the college allows public access.
3. Winchester City Mill and statue of King Alfred the Great: Follow
College Street to the end, and turn left. Then take the short, lovely
walk along the narrow River Itchen, which served as part of the
Roman defense system. To your left, you can see the remains of
Wolvesey Castle, a 12th-century bishop’s palace destroyed during
the Civil War of 1642 to 1649. At the end of Bridge Street, you come
to the City Bridge, an 1813 reconstruction of a Saxon span built
1,000 years earlier. The Winchester City Mill (% 01962/870-057) is
located on the opposite side of the bridge. You can stop in to have
a look at the mill’s restored machinery; an exhibition on the history
and surroundings; and a pretty island garden that’s home to king-
fishers, otters, and water voles. The mill is open March through
Christmas Wednesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission costs £3.40 ($6.75).
Turn left on Bridge Street, and you see the famous bronze statue of
King Alfred the Great holding aloft his sword. What, you ask, made
Alfred so great? Probably that he was an enlightened man in the
Dark Ages and drove off the marauding Danes. A soldier, statesman,
and scholar, he made Winchester the capital of his southern
England kingdom, called Wessex. Winchester remained as powerful
and prosperous as London even after the Norman Conquest of 1066.
Part V: The West Country 
268

4. City Museum: Walk down Broadway to The Square, and you find
the small, attractive City Museum (% 01962/863-064), with a room
devoted to Roman Winchester and a fine Roman mosaic center-
piece. You can see everything in about 15 minutes. Admission is
free. Hours are April to October Monday through Saturday from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.; November to March,
hours are Tuesday to Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.
5. King Arthur’s Round Table and the Great Hall: Continue down
High Street, and turn left (south) through the Westgate, a fortified
medieval gateway. All that remains of once-mighty Winchester
Castle is the Great Hall (% 01962/846-476) on Castle Avenue. The
stone hall is famous for displaying something that isn’t what legend
claims it is: the Round Table of King Arthur and his knights. Looking
like a giant wheel of fortune, the painted wooden table has hung
here for some 600 years. King Arthur, if he ever existed, was proba-
bly a Roman-British chieftain of the fifth century. (Do the math.) The
hall is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 4 p.m. on winter week-
ends). Admission is by suggested donation of 50p to £1 ($1–$2).
Taking a side trip to Chawton
Jane Austen’s house in Chawton is about 27km (17 miles) northeast of
Winchester. Stagecoach Hampshire Bus (% 01256/464-501) no. X64
runs from Winchester Bus Station to Chawton at ten minutes past each
hour Monday through Saturday; on Sunday and holidays, bus no. 64
leaves at 20 minutes past the hour starting at 10:20 a.m. and every two
hours thereafter. The trip takes about 30 minutes. Ask the driver to drop
you at the Alton Butts stop, the one closest to the Austen house. From
the bus stop, walk toward the railway bridge, cross the busy road, and
continue, passing a brown tourist sign and following the road beneath an
underpass. The walk from the bus stop to the house takes about 15 min-
utes. For more information, inquire at the Tourist Information Centre in
Winchester. If you drive from Winchester, take A31 northeast; you can see
a signposted turnoff to the house from the roundabout junction with A32.
Jane Austen’s House in Chawton
Jane Austen’s novels have been in print since they were first published
nearly 200 years ago. Television and movie adaptations in the last few
decades have made her work even more popular. The witty, eagle-eyed
novelist did more than sleep in this sturdy red-brick Georgian house,
where she lived with her mother and sister Cassandra from 1809 until 1817.
Here, on a small round table in the parlor, she dipped her quill and revised
her earlier novels, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and wrote
Mansfield Park and Emma. Creatively, this was where she spent the most
productive years of her life. When she wasn’t writing, she made patchwork
quilts (you can see one on display in her bedroom) and jaunted around in
her donkey carriage (on view in the old bakehouse). Austen family mem-
orabilia spreads throughout the house, which has a charm and modesty
evidently not unlike the great author herself. Allow a half-hour.

Touring more of the region’s historic sights
The National Trust (www.nationaltrust.org.uk) maintains several
interesting properties in Hampshire. Opening times vary throughout 
the year and can be somewhat complicated, so it’s a good idea to verify
times before you go. Among the best are

delightful estate on the River Test with ruins of a 12th-century
monastery and walled gardens containing the National Collection of
Old-Fashioned Roses. The abbey is a few miles west of Winchester.
The house and gardens are open daily 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in June;
daily 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. in July; Saturday through Wednesday 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. from mid-March to May; and weekends only 11 a.m.

adults, £3.40 ($6.75) children.
 The Vyne, Sherborne St. John, Basingstoke (% 01256/883-858): 
A 16th-century manor with a Tudor chapel and lovely gardens. 
The manor is north of the village of Basingstoke, northeast of
Winchester, off A339. House and garden are open mid-March
through October (Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m., Mon–Wed 1–5 p.m.).
Admission is £7.30 ($15) adults, £4 ($8) children.
Salisbury: High-Spire Act
The tall, slender spire of Salisbury Cathedral rises from the plains 
of Wiltshire like a finger pointing toward heaven. Salisbury, or New
Sarum as it was once called, lies in the valley of the River Avon, 145km
(90 miles) southwest of London and about 48km (30 miles) west of
Winchester (see the “Salisbury” map on p. 271). Filled with Tudor inns
and tearooms, and dominated by its beautiful cathedral, this old market
town is often overlooked by visitors eager to see Stonehenge, about
14.5km (9 miles) away.

Getting to Salisbury
Hourly trains travel from London’s Waterloo Station to Salisbury (pro-
nounced Sauls-bury); the journey takes about one hour and 30 minutes
and costs about £26 ($52) for a “cheap day return” round-trip ticket. For
information and schedules, call % 08457/484-950. National Express
(% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) has direct bus service
from London’s Victoria Coach Station; the bus terminal in Salisbury 
is about a ten-minute walk east of the train station. If you drive from
London, head west on the M3 to the end of the run, continuing the rest
of the way on A30.
Finding information on Salisbury
Salisbury’s Tourist Information Centre, Fish Row (% 01722/334-956;
www.visitsalisbury.com), is open Monday through Saturday from
9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (also Sun May–Sept 10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.). To reach
the center, take Fisherton Street on your far left as you leave the train

Exploring Salisbury and the surrounding area
In many ways, Salisbury is a quintessential English country town,
bustling during the day and quiet at night. Make a stroll around the 
quiet confines of the cathedral close (the enclosed precinct surrounding
a cathedral) part of your exploration. Within the old cathedral gates, 
you can find several streets with 18th- and 19th-century houses; it’s the
largest cathedral close in England. If you follow the Town Path through
the water meadows west of the cathedral, you can see views of Salisbury
Cathedral that have changed little since the days of John Constable
(1776–1837), who painted the scene many times.
Salisbury Cathedral
Salisbury
Despite an ill-conceived renovation in the 18th century, this 13th-century
structure remains the best example in England of Perpendicular Gothic,
an architectural style in which vertical lines predominate (see Chapter 2
for more on English architectural styles). At 404 feet, the cathedral’s spire
is the tallest in the country. The cathedral’s beautiful 13th-century octago-
nal chapter house possesses one of the four surviving original texts of the
Chapter 16: Hampshire and Wiltshire: Old Wessex and New Sarum 273

Magna Carta. The cloisters and an exceptionally large close, comprising
about 75 historic buildings, add to the serene beauty of the cathedral.
Allow about an hour.
See map p. 271. The Close, Salisbury. %01722/555-120. www.salisburycathedral.
org.uk. Admission: Free; suggested donation £5 ($10) adults, £4.25 ($8.50) seniors and
students, £4 ($8) children, £12 ($24) families. Open: Daily 7:15 a.m.–7:15 p.m.(Sept–May
until 6:15 p.m.).
Stourhead
Stourton
Stourhead is a world-famous 18th-century landscape garden. The Palladian-
style villa (a classical style incorporating elements from ancient Greek and
Roman buildings), with its early Chippendale furniture and art treasures,
was built in 1722 for a merchant banker, Henry Hoare. The gardens, laid out
in 1741, represent a dramatic change in English garden design. Until the
early 18th century, English gardens generally followed the formal, geomet-
rical French style. At Stourhead, the landscape was fashioned to look more
natural and more picturesque, with small temples, monuments, rare trees,
flowering shrubs, and plants set around a beautiful lake. With its tranquil
walks and long vistas, Stourhead is pleasant to visit any time of year, but the
grounds explode into blossom in May and June.
See map p. 264. Stourton (from Salisbury, take A36 northwest to A303 west to Mere
[about 40km/25 miles total]; Stourton is 5km/3 miles northwest of Mere off B3092). 
% 01747/841-152. Admission: House and garden £11 ($22) adults, £5.50 ($11) children
5–15, £26 ($52) families (2 adults, 2 children). Open: Garden daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; house
mid-Mar–Oct Fri–Tues 11:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Wilton House
Wilton
Wilton is one of England’s great country estates. The home of the earls of
Pembroke, the house is noted for its 17th-century state rooms designed
by the celebrated architect Inigo Jones and for the historic events that
took place here. Shakespeare’s troupe may have entertained in Wilton
House. Several centuries later, General Dwight Eisenhower and his advis-
ers made preparations here for the D-Day landings at Normandy.
Beautifully maintained furnishings and paintings by Van Dyck, Rubens,
Brueghel, and Reynolds fill the house. You can visit the reconstructed
Tudor kitchen and Victorian laundry, and see the Wareham Bears, a col-
lection of some 200 miniature dressed teddy bears. The 21-acre grounds
include rose and water gardens, riverside and woodland walks, and a
huge adventure playground for children.
If you’re without wheels, take the bus that stops on New Canal, a ten-
minute walk north of Salisbury train station, to Wilton House; check with
the tourist office for schedules (see “Finding information on Salisbury,”
earlier in this chapter).

Stonehenge: Outstanding Standing Stones
About 14.5km (9 miles) north of Salisbury, you can see one of the 
world’s most renowned prehistoric sites and one of England’s most popu-
lar attractions, the giant stone circle of Stonehenge. Recognizing its
importance, UNESCO designated Stonehenge a World Heritage Site.
The crowds can reach epidemic proportions as the day wears on, so I
recommend that you come here as early as possible.
Getting to Stonehenge
Wilts and Dorset bus no. 3 (% 01722/336-855; www.wdbus.co.uk)
departs from Salisbury bus station for Stonehenge every hour beginning
at 9:45 a.m. and departs from Stonehenge for Salisbury every hour from
10:30 a.m., with the last return to Salisbury at 5:30 p.m. The trip takes 40
minutes, and the fare is £7.50 ($15) return if you buy an Explorer pass
good for the entire day. Far more convenient is the City Sightseeing
Stonehenge Tour, an excellent and easy way to explore the region’s fas-
cinating history. From mid-May through September, City Sightseeing
departs from the Salisbury train station daily at 9:55 and 11:55 a.m. 
and 1:55 p.m. Visitors ride a double-decker bus to Old Sarum and on to
Stonehenge, where a guide explains the site. The cost is £16.50 ($33) for
adults, £13.50 ($27) for seniors, and £8 ($16) for children ages 5 to 15;
admission to Stonehenge is included in the price.
If you drive from London, head west on the M3 to the end of the run,
continuing the rest of the way on A30 to Salisbury. From there, take A338
north to A303 and then head east to the turnoff on A360.
Exploring Stonehenge
Stonehenge is a stone circle of megalithic pillars and lintels built on the
flat Salisbury Plain from 3,500 to 5,000 years ago. Many folks are disap-
pointed when they actually see the site, which isn’t as huge as modern-
day megasensibilities expect. (A barrier surrounds the site and keeps
visitors 50 feet from the stones.) Keep in mind, however, what a remark-
able achievement, in terms of design and engineering skills, Stonehenge
represents. Many of the stones, which weigh several tons, were mined
and moved from distant sites in a time before forklifts, trucks, and dyna-
mite. Such a feat indicates a high level of skill, dedication, and man-
power.
Chapter 16: Hampshire and Wiltshire: Old Wessex and New Sarum 275

Who built it, and what does it all mean? Researchers have discredited
the old belief that the Druids built Stonehenge (the site is older than the
Celtic Druids). Because Stonehenge is aligned to the summer equinox
and can predict eclipses, a popular theory maintains that the site was an
astronomical observatory. Recent archaeological evidence has uncov-
ered another ceremonial avenue nearby and has led experts to speculate
that Stonehenge was also an important burial place. Whatever its pur-
pose, Stonehenge served as a shrine or ceremonial gathering place of
some kind. But in an age that thinks it knows everything, these enig-
matic standing stones still keep their tantalizing secrets to themselves.

Chapter 17
Devon: Moors, Tors, 
and Sandy Shores
In This Chapter
 Examining Exeter
 Exploring Dartmoor National Park
 Touring Torquay and the English Riviera
 Seeing Plymouth, the Pilgrims’ port
T
raveling westward from London through Wiltshire, you enter Devon,
a scenically diverse county with a windy, unspoiled north coast, a
popular south coast, and a giant national park in between. (See the
“Devon” map on p. 278.) If you’re looking for outdoor adventures in
England, Devon is a good place to visit. You can go walking or pony
trekking across Dartmoor National Park, with its high, open moorland
and giant granite rock formations known as tors. You can go swimming
along the south coast, with its clean, sandy beaches. Or you can relax in
laid-back Torquay, taking leisurely boat rides or drives in an area known
as the English Riviera. Devon’s cities and villages are loaded with his-
tory. Exeter’s magnificent cathedral dates from the 12th century, and
Plymouth was where the Pilgrims set sail for the New World in 1620.
You can easily get to Exeter, Torquay, and Plymouth by train from
London. Devon’s good public transportation system lets you explore
without a car by using local buses, small rail lines, and boats. If you want
to see more of the countryside, consider renting a car in Exeter.
Devon, like neighboring Cornwall (see Chapter 18), has long been associ-
ated with the cream tea, which is available every afternoon at restau-
rants and teashops throughout the county. Devonshire clotted cream, 
a version of what the French call crème fraîche, appears “silvery,” as
opposed to Cornish cream’s “golden” hue. A cream tea should be served
with a scone (made without baking soda) and strawberry preserves.

Exeter: Sea Captains and Silversmiths
Exeter, one of England’s oldest cities, began as the most westerly out-
post of the Roman Empire (see the “Exeter” map on p. 279). Saxon King
Alfred the Great refounded Exeter in the ninth century. By the 11th 
century, the time of the Norman Conquest, Exeter was one of England’s
largest towns. The English wool trade, which made villages in the
Cotswolds (see Chapter 20) so prosperous during the Tudor era, 
also sustained Exeter until the 18th century. During World War II, the
Germans bombed the center of the city. Much of Exeter’s medieval core

Exeter
Chapter 17: Devon: Moors, Tors, and Sandy Shores 279
was gutted, but luckily, the city’s greatest treasure, its magnificent
Norman cathedral, wasn’t destroyed. As a result of the bombing and
subsequent rebuilding, Exeter (like Plymouth) has a somewhat piece-
meal look. The most picturesque part of town is the area around the
cathedral; you also find a redeveloped area along the River Exe that’s
good for strolling and shopping. You may want to stay overnight in
Exeter or just stay long enough to see the cathedral and other sights.
From the cathedral, you can easily hop in a car and explore Dartmoor
National Park, just a few miles to the west.
Getting to Exeter
Trains from London’s Paddington Station depart hourly for the two-and-
a-half-hour journey to Exeter’s St. David’s Station (a round-trip fare costs
£59/$118); local trains connect St. David’s to Exeter Central, closer to
the town center. For train schedules, call % 08457/484-950. National
Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) buses depart
from London’s Victoria Coach Station every two hours during the day;

the trip takes four hours. Frequent bus service is also available for the
one-hour trip between Exeter and Plymouth. (See the section “Plymouth:
Where the Pilgrims Set Sail,” later in this chapter.) By car from London,
take the M4 west, cutting south to Exeter on the M5 (junction near
Bristol).
Finding information and taking a tour
The Tourist Information Centre, in the Civic Centre, Paris Street 
(% 01392/265-700; www.exeter.gov.uk), is open Monday to Saturday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sundays in July and August from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. You can book a hotel room at this center.
Free 90-minute guided tours leave daily at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. throughout
the year from opposite the Abode Hotel (formerly the Royal Clarence) in
the Cathedral Close, the area immediately adjacent to Exeter Cathedral.
Staying in Exeter
Exeter has a full range of hotels and B&Bs.
Abode Hotel
$$
This Georgian-era hotel opposite the cathedral has just been given a com-
plete makeover and is now one of the most stylish and innovative bou-
tique hotels in the region. The 56 rooms have been redecorated in a
strikingly modern style; the rooms in front look out onto the cathedral.
Some units are big enough for families, and the hotel can help arrange
baby-sitting. Michael Caines, the hotel restaurant, is one of Exeter’s top
dining spots (see “Dining in Exeter,” later in this chapter).

You’d be hard pressed to find a better hotel in this price range. Queen’s
Court sits on a quiet, leafy square just a few minutes’ stroll from High

Dining in Exeter
From Modern British cuisine to simple pub fare, Exeter has a restaurant
to suit every taste. Here are some that I like.
Michael Caines
$$–$$$$
MODERN BRITISH
This classy hotel restaurant is one of Exeter’s dining hot spots. Many of the
dishes are made with local, organically grown products. The menu changes
all the time, but you may find lentil and foie gras soup or seafood risotto as
a starter, with main courses featuring fresh fish, lamb, venison, or chicken
with interesting accompaniments. The restaurant has a special children’s
menu, and kids under 5 eat free. Michael Caines Cafe, adjacent to the
restaurant, is less fancy in cuisine and décor, but also a great place to dine.
Michael Caines formerly presided over the famous kitchen at Gidleigh Park
(see “Staying in Dartmoor National Park,” later in this chapter).
See map p. 279. In the Royal Clarence Hotel, Cathedral Yard. % 01392/310-031.

noon–2:30 p.m. and 7–10 p.m.
The Ship Inn
$
TRADITIONAL ENGLISH/PUB
For an atmospheric, inexpensive pub lunch, try this restaurant. The Ship
Inn is the oldest pub in Exeter; Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh fre-
quented the place more than 400 years ago. The menu has plenty of simple
offerings, like soups and sandwiches, but you can also get homemade
steak, kidney or chicken and mushroom pie, and good fish and chips.

hotel because of its reliably high standards of cooking. All ingredients are
sourced in the West Country. For starters, you may find game terrine with
prune chutney, with rack of lamb, filet steak, fresh fish, or roasted duck
breast to follow. The desserts are wonderful.

Exploring Exeter
You can see the noteworthy sights in Exeter in a couple of hours and on
foot.
Exeter Cathedral
The cathedral’s twin towers are of Norman origin, built in the 12th cen-
tury. The west front has remarkable rows of sculptured saints and kings,
the largest surviving array of 14th-century sculpture in England. The orig-
inal Norman interior was remodeled in the 13th century, in a soaring
Decorated Gothic style. The remarkable fan-vaulted roof is the longest of
its kind in the world. The cathedral’s astronomical clock is reputedly the
source of the “Hickory Dickory Dock” nursery rhyme. Allow 30 minutes.
See map p. 279. 1 The Cloisters. % 01392/255-573. www.exeter-cathedral.
org.uk. Admission: Free; suggested donation £3.50 ($7). Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Guided Tours: Mar–Oct Mon–Fri 11 a.m., 12:30 and 2:30 p.m., Sat 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.,

Exeter Guildhall
One of England’s oldest municipal buildings, the Guildhall was referred to
in surviving documents as far back as 1160. Its colonnaded front was a
Tudor addition of 1593. Inside, you can find a display of silver; the city has
long been known for its silverwork. This is a working building and may be
closed without notice; if you’re keen to visit, call first to verify opening.

town center, you come across a small port to which seagoing ships have
access by means of a 9km-long (51⁄2-mile) canal dug in the 16th century. The
Visitor Centre provides an audiovisual program that fills you in on key
events in Exeter’s 2,000-year history.
See map p. 279. Quayside. % 01392/265-213. Admission: Free. Open: Daily Easter–Oct
10 a.m.–5 p.m., Oct 11–Easter Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–4 p.m.

The city’s large Victorian-era museum has collections of paintings, local
glassware, clocks and watches, silver, and Roman artifacts. The Royal
Albert also administers St. Nicholas Priory (off Fore Street), the guest wing

ductory video and a tour tell you the tunnels’ history. Kids love the tour,
which explores the ancient tunnels.

Shopping for Exeter silver
Exeter is known for its silver, identifiable by the three-castle mark
stamped onto the article. At Burford, 1 Bedford St. (% 01392/254-901),
you can find spoons that date from the 18th century and earlier. Ten
dealers share space in The Quay Gallery Antiques Emporium, on the
Quay off Western Way (% 01392/213-283), selling furniture, porcelain,
metalware, and collectibles.
Dartmoor National Park: Back to Nature
A protected national park since 1951, Dartmoor is one of England’s unique
natural landscapes (see the “Dartmoor National Park” map on p. 284).
Dartmoor National Park’s eastern boundary is only 21km (13 miles) west
of Exeter. Dartmoor encompasses some 953 sq. km (368 square miles) of

Dartmoor National Park
Part V: The West Country 
284

high, open moorland covered with yellow-flowering gorse (a spiny,
yellow-flowered shrub), purple heather, and windswept granite outcrop-
pings called tors. Moorland rivers and their many small waterfalls rush
down green, wooded valleys. The last unspoiled landscape in England,
Dartmoor is home to wild ponies and many other kinds of wildlife. More
than 800km (500 miles) of public footpaths and bridle paths crisscross
this remarkably atmospheric landscape. Although a national park, the
land in Dartmoor is privately owned, and about 33,000 people live and
work in the area.
Scattered throughout Dartmoor are grand country hotels, cozy village
inns, and countryside B&Bs. The ancient village of Chagford, about
32km (20 miles) west of Exeter, makes a good base for touring. Open
moors with high granite tors surround the town, which overlooks the
River Teign in its deep valley. In addition to enjoying the splendid coun-
tryside, you can visit Dartmoor’s two historic houses: Buckland Abbey,
near Plymouth, was the home of Sir Francis Drake; and Castle Drogo,
just a mile from Chagford, was the last castle built in England.
Getting to the park
You can take the train to Exeter (see the section “Getting to Exeter,” ear-
lier in this chapter) and then use local buses to connect you with vil-
lages in Dartmoor. Transmoor Link (% 01392/382-800) operates buses
throughout the summer. If you’re driving, Exeter is the nearest large city
to the park. From Exeter, continue west on B3212 to Chagford or other
Dartmoor villages.
You may want to take the train to Exeter and then rent a car. The follow-
ing car-rental companies have offices in Exeter:
 Avis, 29 Marsh Green Rd. (% 01392/259-713)
 Budget, Unit 2 Grace Rd. Central (% 01392/496-555)
 Hertz, 12 Marsh Barton Rd. (% 01392/207-207)
The car-rental agencies cluster in the Marsh Barton industrial area, a
couple of miles south of Exeter’s town center. To get there, you can call a
local taxi at % 01392/433-433.
Finding information
Dartmoor National Park’s main information hub is High Moorland
Visitor Centre, Tavistock Road, Princetown, Yelverton, Devon PL20 6QF
(% 01822/890-414). The center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. in
summer and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter. Smaller park information
centers with limited opening times are in Haytor (% 01364/661-520),
Newbridge (% 01364/631-303), and Postbridge (% 01822/880-272).
Tourist Information Centres for Dartmoor are in Ivybridge (% 01752/
897-035), Okehampton (% 01837/53020), Tavistock (% 01822/612-938),
Chapter 17: Devon: Moors, Tors, and Sandy Shores 285

and Totnes (% 01803/863-168). You can also find information on the 
Web site of the Dartmoor National Park Authority: www.dartmoor-npa.
gov.uk.
Taking a tour of the park
Year-round, the Dartmoor National Park Authority offers guided walks —
a great way to introduce yourself to Dartmoor’s special landscape. Walks
range from easy one-and-a-half-hour village strolls to six-hour treks cov-
ering 14.5 to 19km (9–12 miles) of moorland. For details, contact the
High Moorland Visitor Centre (see the preceding section). The walks
cost £2 to £4 ($4–$8), depending on their length. You don’t need to make
a reservation; just show up at the departure point. Going to the park’s
Web site at www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk is the fastest way to get infor-
mation about the walks.
Staying in Dartmoor National Park
Dartmoor is a special world, with unspoiled countryside that’s still wild
in parts. Several old villages lie within the area Dartmoor National Park
covers. Chagford has one of the most convenient locations and offers
more amenities than other villages.
Gidleigh Park

Near Chagford
Staying at this marvelous country-house hotel is an unforgettable experi-
ence. Located 3km (2 miles) outside of Chagford, Gidleigh Park was built

through the property. The hotel has impeccably high standards, but it isn’t
fussy or formal. The 15 enormous guest rooms have fine marble baths and
a wonderfully old-fashioned English ambience (all rooms were refurbished
in 2007). The hotel is famous throughout the West Country for its cuisine
(see “Dining in Dartmoor National Park,” later in this chapter), and the
room rate includes a sumptuous four-course dinner. If you’re looking for a
dream splurge, this hotel is it.

adequate in an old-fashioned way. With its mullioned windows, massive
oak beams, and open fireplace, the downstairs lounge is a good spot for a
drink. The hotel restaurant serves traditional English cuisine; main
courses cost £10.50 to £18.50 ($21–$37). Kids usually enjoy the hotel’s

Exploring in and around Dartmoor National Park
Dartmoor is home to some of England’s wildest and windiest expanses,
where wild ponies still graze, giant tors rise among fields of bracken, and
streams rush through forested valleys. People have lived in Dartmoor
for centuries, and small villages make up a part of its timeless landscape.
Buckland Abbey
Yelverton
Tucked away in its own secluded valley above the River Tavy, 5km 
(3 miles) west of Yelverton, Buckland was originally a small but influential
Cistercian monastery. Parts of the abbey date from around 1278, but the
main parts of the house were built in the 16th century when Sir Richard
Grenville remodeled the dissolved abbey into a noble residence. The tower
over the church’s crossing and many other original features of Buckland
Abbey are still visible.
The great Elizabethan navigator Sir Francis Drake bought Buckland in 1581,
shortly after circumnavigating the world. The house, today a National
Trust property, displays memorabilia of Drake and Grenville. Behind the
house lies a monastic tithe barn, where the monks stored the food that the
farmers were required to give them. On the estate grounds, you can find
an herb garden and take some delightful walks. Give yourself at least an
hour to see everything. Call to verify opening times if you’re visiting in fall
or winter.
See map p. 284. 5km (3 miles) west of Yelverton off A386. % 01822/853-607.
Admission: £7.40 ($15) adults, £3.70 ($7.50) children 5–15, £18.50 ($37) families (2 adults,

Castle Drogo
Drewsteignton
The architect Sir Edwin Lutyens designed this granite castle, which was
built for a self-made millionaire, Julius Drewe, between 1910 and 1930.
Perched on a rocky cliff above the Teign River, the castle commands
panoramic views of Fingle Gorge and Dartmoor. Drewe wanted his dream
house — the last castle built in England — to combine the grandeur of a
medieval castle with the comforts of the 20th century. Designed for easy,
elegant living, the interior includes a kitchen, a scullery, and elaborately
appointed bathrooms. Go outside to see the terraced formal garden with
roses and herbaceous borders, as well as woodlands with flowers in
spring. You can see the house and gardens in about an hour.

Visitors in wheelchairs can access most of the castle and grounds; call in advance
to make arrangements.
Dartmoor National Park
You can find more remains of prehistoric huts, enclosures, burial monu-
ments, stone rows, and stone circles in Dartmoor National Park than any-
where else in Europe. You need a detailed ordnance survey map to find
these ancient sites (you can buy maps at the visitor centers; see the sec-
tion, “Finding Information,” earlier in this chapter). Scorhill Circle, 6.5km
(4 miles) west of Chagford, is a prehistoric stone circle. Near Postbridge,
a village about 23km (14 miles) south of Chagford, you can see a legacy of
Dartmoor’s medieval past in the form of a clapper bridge, a giant slab of
flat rock spanning the East Dart River.
Dartmoor is popular walking country, but don’t attempt any long-distance
hikes without taking sensible precautions. Always have an ordnance
survey map of the area with you, and be prepared for sudden changes in
the weather.
If you’re not a walker, you can explore Dartmoor by car. Two main roads
cross the open moorland. B3212 enters and crosses the eastern side of the
high moor through the best area of heather moorland, which you can see
at its peak bloom in late August. B3357 cuts through the center, sometimes
running alongside the West Dart River and passing the tors. From the vil-
lages, smaller lanes lead off into the moorland.
Torquay: Relaxing on the English Riviera
Torquay (pronounced Tor-key), 37km (23 miles) southeast of Exeter, lies
on sheltered Tor Bay, an inlet of the English Channel, in an area known
as the English Riviera. The area isn’t like the French Riviera except that
Chapter 17: Devon: Moors, Tors, and Sandy Shores 289

it has mild temperatures, many sunny days, and easy access to the sea.
Victorian health-seekers made the town a popular spot. The pre–jet set
crowd that brought Torquay a touch of British glamour from the 1950s
to the 1970s has long since departed on cheap flights to more exotic
locales.
Torquay is now essentially a resort town for honeymooners, retirees,
and families. Visitors come to Torquay to hang out and take it easy.
Torquay and the neighboring towns of Brixham and Paignton form
Torbay, a cluster of resorts around Tor Bay. You can find several safe,
sandy beaches, parks, seaside promenades, and gardens along Torbay,
which is a center for yachting and watersports. At night, concerts, pro-
ductions from London’s West End, vaudeville shows, and ballroom danc-
ing keep the vacationers entertained. I don’t suggest that you go out of
your way to visit Torquay, but it does make for a good overnight if you’re
touring the West Country (see the “Devon” map on p. 278).
Getting to Torquay
Trains run throughout the day from London’s Paddington and Waterloo
stations to Torquay, whose station is in the town center on the seafront.
The trip takes three to four hours and costs £63 ($126) for a round-trip
ticket. You can also take direct service from Exeter’s St. David’s Station;
the trip takes only 40 to 50 minutes. For train schedules and fares, 
call % 08457/484-950. National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.
nationalexpress.com) buses leave from London’s Victoria Coach
Station every couple of hours during the day. The trip takes five to six
hours and costs about £34 ($68) round-trip. From Exeter, the bus jour-
ney takes less than an hour and costs about £7 ($14) round-trip. If you’re
driving from Exeter, take A38 south, and continue on A380.
Getting around and touring Torquay
If you don’t have a car, you can make local excursions by boat. From
May through October, the Brixham Ferry provides daily service
between Torquay and Brixham for £4.50 ($9) round-trip. Riverlink
(% 01803/834-488; www.riverlink.co.uk) has a fleet of boats and
runs daily excursions from Torquay up the Dart River to Dartmouth for
£9 ($18). You can buy river-excursion tickets at the kiosk on the quay; at
the Stagecoach Travel office, Vaughn Parade; or at the Riverlink kiosks
on Totnes quay and Lower Street, Dartmouth. For more information,
contact the Tourist Information Centre (see the following section).
Finding information
The Tourist Information Centre, Vaughan Parade (% 01803/297-428), 
is open April through August Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the rest of the year it opens at
9:30 a.m. and is closed on Sunday. The office has plenty of information
on local attractions and a hotel-finding service.

Staying and dining in Torquay
If you’re going to stay in Torquay, I recommend that you find a seafront
hotel with a good restaurant and rooms with views over Tor Bay. Try 
the following, which all have good restaurants, evening entertainment,
and recreational facilities, and offer special short-break rates for two or
more nights:
 Paramount Imperial Hotel, 1 Park Hill Road, Torquay, Devon TQ1
2DG (% 0870/168-8833 or 01803/294-301; Fax: 01803/298-293; www.
paramount-hotels.co.uk): This hotel overlooks Tor Bay and is
the dowager empress of Torquay luxury resort hotels. Doubles
start at £120 ($240), with English breakfast.
 Livermead Cliff Hotel, Sea Front, Torquay, Devon TQ2 6RQ 
(% 01803/299-666; Fax: 01803/294-496; www.livermeadcliff.
co.uk): This hotel sits right on the water’s edge with steps down 
to a beach. Doubles with sea views go for £120 to £140 ($240–$280),
with English breakfast.
 The Livermead House, Sea Front, Torquay, Devon TQ2 8QJ 
(% 01803/294-361; Fax: 01803/200-758; www.livermead.com): 
With its heated swimming pool and sun patio, Livermead House 
is another good choice on the seafront. Doubles with sea views go
for £140 to £160 ($280–$320), with English breakfast.
 Osborne Hotel, Hesketh Crescent, Meadfoot, Torquay, Devon TQ1
2LL (% 01803/213-311; Fax: 01803/296-788; www.osborne-torquay.
co.uk): Part of a beautiful Regency building, this hotel has sea-facing
doubles, with English breakfast, from £145 to £170 ($290–$340).
Exploring Torquay
Torquay’s only nonaquatic tourist attraction of note is Torre Abbey, The
Kings Drive (% 01803/293-593), about a 1⁄4-mile east of the town center.
A prosperous abbey founded in 1196, Torre was later converted to a 
luxurious private residence and now serves as Torquay’s municipal
museum. It has painting galleries, furnished period rooms, ancient cel-
lars, and gardens. The Agatha Christie Memorial Room displays the
personal possessions, paintings, books, and original manuscripts of the
famous mystery writer, who was born in Torquay. Admission costs £3
($6) for adults, £2.50 ($5) for students and seniors, and £1.50 ($3) for
children 8 to 15. The abbey is open from Easter to November daily 
9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The English Riviera coastline stretches some 35km (22 miles), from
Torquay to the family resort town of Paignton and the harbor and fishing
town of Brixham. In 1874, Isaac Singer, founder of the sewing-machine
empire, built the Oldway Mansion (% 01803/201-201), which is on
Torquay Road in Paignton, a short drive south of Torquay. His son Paris
enhanced the mansion’s décor and had a rehearsal space and perform-
ance hall built for his mistress, the dancer Isadora Duncan. The house is
Chapter 17: Devon: Moors, Tors, and Sandy Shores 291

open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from 2 to 
5 p.m. in summer. Admission costs £1 ($2).
Plymouth: Where the Pilgrims Set Sail
Many Americans want to visit Plymouth because the Pilgrims set sail
from this port on the Mayflower in 1620. They landed 66 days later 
in Massachusetts. Don’t go to Plymouth expecting to find a quaint
Elizabethan city. During World War II, German bombs gutted the ancient
town, and the way the town has been rebuilt isn’t what you would call
picturesque. I don’t recommend staying in Plymouth, but you may want
to stop off here as part of your exploration of the West Country (see the
“Devon” map on p. 278). I suggest that you give yourself a couple of
hours here; have a cream tea; and head out to someplace more scenic,
perhaps Dartmoor or neighboring Cornwall.
Getting to Plymouth
Frequent direct trains leave from London’s Paddington Station for the
three-and-a-half- to four-hour journey to Plymouth. You also can get
direct service from Exeter’s St. David’s Station (one hour) and from
Torquay (one hour) to Plymouth. For train fares and schedules, call 
% 08457/484-950. The Plymouth Train Station is on North Road, north
of the town center. Western National Bus no. 83/84 runs from the station
into the heart of town. National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.
nationalexpress.com) runs buses from London’s Victoria Coach
Station; the trip takes five to nine hours. Buses also run directly to
Plymouth from Exeter and from Torquay. Driving from Exeter, head
southwest (skirting around Dartmoor National Park) on A38. From
Torquay, head west on A385, and continue southwest on A38.
The Plymouth Discoverer (% 01752/222-221) bus runs year-round in
Plymouth, making a circuit from the railway station to the Barbican, the
seafront, and back.
Taking a cruise in Plymouth
If you’re feeling seaworthy, you may want to take a boat tour of
Plymouth Sound. Plymouth Boat Cruises (% 01752/671-166) offers a
one-hour cruise that passes the Mayflower Steps, commercial docks,
and nuclear-submarine base, and continues to the Tamar River. Boats
depart from April through September daily every 30 minutes from 11
a.m. through the afternoon; the fare costs £5.50 ($11) for adults, £5 ($10)
for seniors, £3 ($6) for children 5 to 15, and £13 ($26) for families (2 adults,
3 children). It also has four-hour cruises up the Tamar River and two-hour
sea cruises. Cruise boats depart from Phoenix Wharf, a short walk south
from the Barbican. You can purchase tickets from the Tourist Information
Centre, the National Marine Aquarium, or the kiosk at Phoenix Wharf.
Part V: The West Country 
292

Finding information
You can find the Tourist Information Centre at Island House, the Barbican
(% 0870/225-4950; www.visitplymouth.co.uk). A second information
center, Plymouth Discovery Centre, is at Crabtree Marsh Mills. Both are
open from Easter through September, Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; winter hours are Monday through
Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Locating a spot for lunch or tea
You may want to stop in at the Tudor Rose Tea Rooms, 36 New St. 
(% 01752/255-502), a convenient and inexpensive little tearoom and
lunch spot dating from 1640 that has an outdoor garden; it’s close to the
Mayflower Steps but away from the crowds on the quay. Tudor Rose
serves traditional home-cooked English food and afternoon cream teas.
A sandwich or a cream tea costs about £5 ($10). Hours are Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Tudor Rose doesn’t
accept credit cards.
Exploring Plymouth
Plymouth was badly bombed in World War II, and the area around
Plymouth Harbour is the only part of town where you’ll probably want
to spend any time.
The Barbican
This small segment of the Elizabethan town of Plymouth, reconstructed
around the harbor, is Plymouth’s primary tourist area. Today’s mall-like
atmosphere makes it difficult to imagine Plymouth as it was in Elizabethan
days, when it was one of England’s greatest ports. Sir Francis Drake, whose
house, Buckland Abbey, you can see near Dartmoor (see “Exploring in and
around Dartmoor National Park,” earlier in this chapter), became
Plymouth’s mayor after he made his famous round-the-world voyage on
the Golden Hinde. Drake left Plymouth in 1577 from a quay in the Barbican
area and was gone for three years.
On Plymouth Harbour.
Black Friars Distillery
The former Black Friars priory was turned into a gin distillery in 1793 and
has been in continuous operation ever since. In 2005, a Visitor Centre
opened with a cafe, but you have to pay a pretty steep price to tour this
facility, and you don’t really get what you pay for. The distillery makes the
only English gin with an appelation contrôlée, which means the Plymouth
Gin brand can be made only here. The distillery still makes the gin with
water from Dartmoor, in the original copper stills.
60 Southside St. % 01752/665-292. www.plymouthgin.com. Admission (includ-
ing 11⁄2-hr. tour): £6 ($12) adults. Distillery tours offered Mon–Sat 10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.,
Sun 11:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
Chapter 17: Devon: Moors, Tors, and Sandy Shores 293

The Hoe
If you walk south from the Barbican, you come to the Hoe, a promontory
overlooking Plymouth Sound, an inlet of the English Channel. The River
Tamar, the age-old boundary between Devon and Cornwall and a Royal
Navy anchorage for more than 400 years, flows into the sound from the
west. To the east, you can see the River Plym, from which Plymouth takes
its name. On the Hoe, you can see 17th-century ramparts surrounding a
citadel and an 18th-century lighthouse, Smeatons Tower.
South of the Barbican.
Mayflower Steps
To commemorate the spot from which the Mayflower sailed for the New
World, a neoclassical stone archway was erected in 1934 at the base of
West Pier in the Barbican. The flags of the United States and the United
Kingdom fly above the spot, but otherwise, little distinguishes it. You can
read a full list of the names of all who sailed on the side of Island House,
now the Barbican’s Tourist Information Centre. Some of the Pilgrims reput-
edly lodged at the house before setting sail.
On Plymouth Harbour in the Barbican.
National Marine Aquarium
This popular and well-designed aquarium gives you insight into the lives
of the aquatic creatures that inhabit the rivers of Devon and the waters of
Plymouth Sound. The exhibits start with the watery environment of a
moorland stream on Dartmoor; continue to a river; and then move down
an estuary and beyond, from the shoreline to the continental shelf. You
see fish, anemones, corals, seahorses, jellyfish, and sharks. The large tanks
and variety of fish inevitably fascinate children.
Rope Walk, Coxside (follow signs from the Barbican). % 01752/600-301. www.
national-aquarium.co.uk. Admission: £9.50 ($19) adults, £8 ($16) seniors, £5.75
($12) children 5–15, £27 ($54) families (2 adults, 2 children). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
(until 5 p.m. Nov–Mar).

Plymouth: Departure point for the U.S.
The Pilgrims may have been the earliest and most famous emigrants to leave Plymouth,
England, for Plymouth, Massachusetts, but they were hardly the last. During the 19th
century, estimates show that more emigrant ships bound for the United States left from
Plymouth than from anywhere else in Europe. More than 100 towns in New England
are named after places in Devon.

Chapter 17: Devon: Moors, Tors, and Sandy Shores 295
Up-along/Down-along: Clovelly 
on Devon’s North Coast
If you have a car and want to explore more of Devon, Clovelly on the north coast is
absolutely unique: a privately owned Devon fishing village built along one main street
that is so steep donkeys and sledges are used to haul goods up and down (cars are
not allowed and wouldn’t fit). The street, intricately cobbled with pebbles from the
beach below, is called “Up-along” if you’re panting your way up it, or “Down-along”
if you’re heading downhill to the harbor. Clovelly’s impressive quay dates from the 14th
century, as do many of the tiny, whitewashed cottages lining Up-along/Down-along.
There are some pretty clifftop walks in the vicinity but otherwise not a lot to do except
poke around in secretive little alleys and enjoy the views and overall charm. The best
place to stay is the New Inn Hotel, High Street (another name for Up-along/Down-
along), Clovelly, North Devon EX39 5TQ (% 01237/431-303; www.clovelly.co.uk),
where a double room with breakfast goes for £98 to £103 ($196–$206). The New Inn
has the town’s best restaurant, and you can get special deals that include bed, break-
fast, and dinner. Clovelly is located just off the A39, about 12 miles west of Bideford;
turn off the main road at Clovelly Cross roundabout and follow the signs (see “Devon”
map on p. 278). All visitors to Clovelly must park at the Visitor Centre (% 01237/131-781;
www.clovelly.co.uk), which is a large and somewhat tacky souvenir and food
shop with a video about the town’s history. Day visitors must pay to visit the town
(£4.95/$10 for adults, £3.25/$6.50 children, £14.50/$29 family); if you’re staying overnight,
you can pass through free of charge. If you’re visiting Clovelly, you may want to com-
bine it with a visit to Tintagel, described in the following chapter.

T
he Tamar River west of Plymouth is the age-old boundary between
Devon and Cornwall. (See the “Cornwall” map on p. 297.) At one
time, the river was also a kind of dividing line between Cornwall and the
rest of “civilized” England. The Cornish, who spoke their own language
until the 18th century, were always considered a race apart. Their land,
Cornwall, jutting like a toe out into the Atlantic, was a place of myth and
mystery, associated with legendary figures such as Tristan and Isolde
and King Arthur.
Cornwall has a special mystique that comes from its rocky landscape; its
warm, buttery light; and the windy blue seascapes that you encounter at
every turn. A history that stretches back more than 3,000 years to a time
when Phoenician traders sailed up the Cornish coast to trade for the tin
that was mined here haunts Cornwall. In Cornish churchyards, you can
see ancient Celtic crosses from the fifth and sixth centuries, the time
when men and women known as “saints” (missionaries from Ireland and
Wales) first brought Christianity to this pagan land. Many Cornish places
are named for these early saints. Along the Cornish coast, you find pic-
turesque stone-built fishing villages huddled alongside small, sheltered
harbors. The former haunts of fishermen and sea salts, and more than a
few pirates and smugglers, they’re a reminder of Cornwall’s strong sea-
faring traditions.

Chapter 18: Cornwall: Saints, Salts, Sea, and Sun 297
Today, tourism keeps Cornwall afloat. In summer, the warm, often-sunny
climate draws hordes of vacationers. In this chapter, I take you first to
the lively market town of Penzance, the end of the line as far as train
travel goes. The major attraction in Penzance is St. Michael’s Mount, a
castle that began life as a monastery. From Penzance, you can easily
reach Land’s End, the westernmost point in England, exploring the
south-coast fishing villages of Newlyn and Mousehole on the way. The
picturesque village of St. Ives on the north coast (a few miles from
Penzance) became an artists’ colony in the early 20th century. Today,
with a branch of the Tate Museum and plenty of good hotels and restau-
rants, St. Ives is one of the nicest spots to stay in Cornwall. I also point
you in the direction of other worthwhile sights — from major tourist
attractions, such as the Eden Project, to historic houses and special 
gardens — scattered throughout Cornwall.

Penzance: As in “The Pirates of . . . ”
Penzance, 124km (77 miles) southwest of Plymouth (see the “Cornwall”
map on p. 297), is the most westerly town in England and a good base
for exploring Land’s End and western Cornwall. Penzance is the end of
the line for mainline trains from London, 451km (280 miles) to the north-
east. Built on hills overlooking Mount’s Bay, Penzance is temperate
enough to grow palm trees and plants that can’t survive elsewhere in
England.
Gilbert and Sullivan made Penzance famous in their operetta The Pirates
of Penzance, but the town doesn’t trade on that musical connection. In
reality, Penzance has survived several major calamities: Barbary pirates
raided the town, and Spaniards sacked and burned it in the 16th century,
Cromwell partially destroyed it during the 17th-century Civil War, and
the Germans bombed it in the 1940s. Despite all that, Penzance is an
unusually friendly town. This is the only part of England where you may
hear yourself addressed as “my love.”
Getting to Penzance
Express InterCity trains depart throughout the day from London’s
Paddington Station for the five-hour journey to Penzance. The round-trip
advance-purchase supersaver fare costs £70 ($140). For train schedules,
call % 08457/484-950. National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.
nationalexpress.com) operates daily bus service from London’s
Victoria Coach Station, but the trip takes seven-and-a-half to nine hours.
If you’re driving, the fastest route is A30, which cuts across Devon and
Cornwall from Exeter.
Good train service connects London to Penzance and St. Ives, the two
places I recommend as touring headquarters in Cornwall. If you don’t
have a car, excellent local bus service serves towns throughout the
county; for more information, contact First (% 0845/600-1420; www.
firstgroup.com). If you want to rent a car, the following car-rental
agencies have offices in Penzance:

Princely perks: The Duchy of Cornwall
In his redistribution of English lands, William the Conqueror gave Cornwall to one of
his relatives. In the 14th century, Edward III created the Duchy of Cornwall as an estate
for the eldest sons of the monarch. Cornwall, through 24 dukes, has remained a duchy
ever since. Prince Charles, the oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, is the present Duke of
Cornwall (and his wife and former mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles, is the Duchess).
Income from the Duchy of Cornwall, in leased lands and estates, amounts to tens of
millions of pounds every year and is a “nice little earner” for Charlie.

Finding information and taking a tour of Penzance
The Tourist Information Centre, Station Road (% 01736/362-207;
www.penzance.co.uk), directly across from the train station, is open
daily Easter through September from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; October to Easter
Saturday hours are 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and the office is closed on Sunday.
Harry Safari (% 01736/711-427; www.harrysafari.com) runs a four-
hour guided tour, which offers one of the best ways to see this part of
Cornwall. Guides drive you through the area in a minivan to all sorts of
hidden corners and scenic spots. The tour costs £20 ($40); you can have
them pick you up in Penzance or St. Ives.
A cruise around Mounts Bay, passing St. Michael’s Mount and local
coastal beauty spots where you may see seals or dolphins, makes for a
fun excursion. Mermaid Pleasure Trips (% 07901/731-201) operates
two-hour coastal cruises at 3 p.m. (most days); these cruises cost £10
($20) adults, £8 ($16) children 5 to 12. Boats leave from the marina area.

The Abbey, in a 17th-century building overlooking the harbor, is the most

to convey an atmosphere of overstuffed English elegance. It’s like staying

and so are the bathrooms. The Abbey is owned by 1960s supermodel Jean

MODERN EUROPEAN
At this stylish restaurant next to the Abbey Hotel, you enter a luscious red
womb of a bar/lounge and walk up to an airy dining room with views out
over Penzance harbor. Chef–owner Ben Tunnicliffe cooks in a modern
European style that makes use of fresh local fish, meat, and produce. For
starters, try pan-fried foie gras or crab cakes with cucumber chutney. Main

Harris’s Restaurant

MODERN BRITISH/FRENCH
For a restaurant to stay in business for more than 30 years, it must be
doing something right. This well-established restaurant, located down a
narrow cobbled lane off Market Jew Street, is one of Penzance’s best and
most highly regarded. The cooking emphasizes fresh, local produce and
seafood, with dishes such as crab Florentine and guinea fowl breast with
Cornish brie on spinach with lime and basil sauce.

Indian dish.

Exploring in and around Penzance
St. Michael’s Mount is the must-see attraction in Penzance. The town
itself doesn’t offer a lot in the way of special interest or tourist attrac-
tions, though Chapel Street has some interesting buildings. Garden
lovers may enjoy visiting Trengwainton Garden outside of town.
Castle on St. Michael’s Mount
Mount’s Bay
For nearly 350 years, this amazing island/castle in Mount’s Bay has been
the home of the St. Aubyn family. Connected to the mainland by a 500-foot-
long causeway, the castle incorporates parts of an earlier 12th-century
Benedictine priory that was founded as the daughter house of Mont St.
Michel in Normandy. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, St. Michael’s
Mount was an important fortress to protect the coastline from foreign
attack. (The beacon on top of the church tower was lit to warn of the
approach of the Spanish Armada in 1588.) A royalist stronghold during the
Civil War, the fort was forced to surrender after a long siege. The St. Aubyn
family still inhabits part of the castle and has lived there since 1659.
Visitors enter through the West Door, above which hangs the St. Aubyn
family crest. The Entrance Hall, altered in the 19th century, was the living
area for the Captain of the Mount in the 16th and 17th centuries. The little
adjacent chamber, known as Sir John’s Room, is the owner’s private sit-
ting room. Sporting weapons and war memorabilia hang in the Armoury.
The snug Library is in the oldest (12th-century) part of the castle, as is
the dining room, which served as the monks’ refectory. The Priory Church
on the island’s summit has beautiful rose windows. In a newer section of
the castle, you can see the elegant rococo-style Blue Drawing Rooms.
St. Michael’s Mount is one of the most-visited National Trust properties in
Britain. Give yourself at least three hours for a visit, and be aware that you
have to climb many stairs to reach the castle. If the tide is in, boatmen
known as hobblers can ferry you over or back. If you need some nourish-
ment after all those stairs, you can refuel at one of two restaurants on the
island, open April to October only, where you can have lunch or tea. Lunch
costs about £4 to £8 ($8–$16); a cream tea, about £4 ($8).
To get here by bus, take bus no. 20 or 22 from Penzance to Marazion, the
town opposite St. Michael’s Mount.

Chapel Street
Penzance
Chapel Street, running north–south from St. Mary’s Church near the water-
front up to Parade Street, is the most architecturally significant street in
Penzance. Strolling the length takes only a few minutes, and doing so gives
you a glimpse of the Penzance of yore. Chapel Street has always been a
mixture of residential and commercial buildings. Facades that look
Georgian (from the late 18th and early 19th centuries) often hide much
older buildings. Two hundred years ago, the Union Hotel, with its
Assembly Rooms, was the center of the town’s social activities. Across the
road from the Union Hotel is the Egyptian House, built in 1835 with
Egyptian motifs and ornamentation. Other houses on the street belonged
to mayors, mariners, and traders. Just below the Regent Hotel is the Old
Custom House, a fine building whose interior retains many original 18th-
century features. Farther down is the Turks Head, which claims to be the
oldest inn in Penzance (see the section “Dining in Penzance,” earlier in this
chapter). The austere Wesleyan Chapel of 1814 is situated across from the
inn. Nearby, marked by a blue plaque, you can see the home of Maria
Branwell, the beloved “Aunt Branwell” who moved to Yorkshire to raise
Charlotte, Emily, Anne, and Branwell Brontë after their mother died.
Chapel Street’s most impressive building is St. Mary’s Church, rebuilt in
the 1830s on the site of an earlier medieval chapel.
Penlee House Gallery & Museum
Penzance
Built as a private residence in 1865, Penlee House now serves as
Penzance’s art gallery and museum. The painting collection focuses on the
Newlyn School of artists, mostly landscape painters active in the area
between 1880 and 1930. The museum has exhibits ranging from Stone Age
to the present day. You can tour the entire museum in about 30 minutes.
The Orangery Cafe is a nice spot for tea or a light lunch.
Morrab Road. % 01736/363-625. Admission: £2 ($4) adults, free for children 5–15.
Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., (10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Oct–Apr).
Trengwainton Garden
West of Penzance
Nowhere else on mainland Britain can you find a garden with plants as
exotic as the ones grown here. Trengwainton (pronounced as it’s spelled,
Treng-wain-ton), which means the “House of the Spring” in Cornish, is set
in the granite hills behind Penzance, and commands panoramic views of
Mount’s Bay and the Lizard Peninsula. The first walled gardens were con-
structed in the 18th century, but the plantings didn’t really flourish until
the late 1920s, under Sir Edward Bolitho. Several species of rhododen-
drons, which Bolitho planted from seeds collected in Asia, flowered for the
first time outside their native habitat in this garden. You see color through-
out the year, from camellias and magnolias in early spring to acres of blue
hydrangea in late summer. You can have lunch or a Cornish cream tea in
Chapter 18: Cornwall: Saints, Salts, Sea, and Sun 303

the teahouse. The garden is a National Trust property. Give yourself at
least an hour to enjoy it.
To get here by bus, take the First National bus no. 10/A from Penzance to
St. Just; ask the driver to let you off along the way at the stop nearest
Trengwainton. (For bus schedules, check with the Tourist Information
Centre; see “Finding information and taking a tour of Penzance,” earlier in
this chapter.)

The Penwith Peninsula: A Driving Tour 
from Penzance to Land’s End
On a map, the Penwith Peninsula west of Penzance looks like a giant toe
dipping into the Atlantic. You can take a great driving tour of this area,
which I outline in this section. B3315 follows the peninsula’s southern
coastline past the fishing villages of Newlyn and Mousehole — good
places to stop and explore for an hour or so — to famous Land’s End,
where you can pick up the fast A30 back to Penzance. The distances 
here aren’t that great; driving this loop without stopping takes about an
hour, but the trip makes a pleasant half- or full-day excursion from
Penzance or St. Ives. If you don’t have a car, bus service runs from
Penzance to Newlyn, Mousehole, and Land’s End. For times and sched-
ules, check with the tourist office or the local bus service, First (% 0845/
600-1420; www.firstgroup.com).
Stop #1: Newlyn
Just a couple of miles south of Penzance lies the port of Newlyn, home 
of England’s second-largest fishing fleet. Chances are that any fresh fish
or lobster that you eat in Penzance or even St. Ives was landed in the
waters near Newlyn. Pilchards (mature sardines) have traditionally been
the biggest catch off these shores. In general, though, because of over-
fishing, the pilchard fishing industry that was the mainstay of Cornwall’s
coastal villages from the medieval era until the early part of the 20th
century is now a tiny fragment of what it once was. The Pilchard Works
Museum and Factory, The Coombe (% 01736/332-112), is the last
remaining salt pilchard factory in England; the factory has a small
adjunct museum that explains the process of curing pilchards; for
almost a hundred years, this factory has supplied salt (cured) pilchards
to the same Italian company. The museum is open Easter through
October weekdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The seascapes and the quality of light along this part of the Cornish
coast lured several artists to the area in the late Victorian era. You can
Part V: The West Country 
304

see the paintings of the Newlyn School in Penzance at Penlee House.
(See the section “Exploring in and around Penzance,” earlier in this
chapter.) The Newlyn Art Gallery, Newlyn Green (% 01736/363-715),
has a small collection of the distinctive Arts and Crafts copper work that
was produced in Newlyn from 1890 to 1950. The gallery is open Monday
to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
If the sea air has you feeling peckish (hungry), you can find the best fish
and chips in town at the Tolcarne Inn, Tolcarne Place (% 01736/365-
074). Or you may want to try fresh crab or Newlyn fish pie (white and
smoked fish and prawns in white wine sauce, topped with cheese and
breadcrumbs). Meals (lunch and dinner daily) are served in a publike
room with a beamed ceiling. Main courses go for £6 to £16 ($12–$32); the
inn accepts MasterCard and Visa.
Stop #2: Mousehole
A few miles south of Newlyn lies the former fishing village of Mousehole
(pronounced Muz-zle). With its curving quay, its small protected harbor,
and its quaint stone cottages, Mousehole is a pretty place. The town
attracts many tourists who come for lunch or tea and a look around. The
town itself is the attraction here.
One very good restaurant to try is Cornish Range, 6 Chapel St. 
(% 01736/731-488), open daily in the summer and Wednesday to
Saturday in the winter for lunch and dinner. On the menu, you find fish
soup, crab Florentine, roast cod and mullet, and many other fresh fish
dishes. Main courses go for £12 to £19 ($24–$38). MasterCard and Visa
are accepted. Cornish Range also rents out three guest rooms, each with
private bath, for £80 to £100 ($160–$200) per night, including breakfast.
If you’re looking for a good, unfussy Cornish cream tea, pop into Pam’s
Pantry, 3 Mill Lane (% 01736/731-532), open February to November
daily 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. This cash-only hole-in-the-wall also serves
Newlyn crab in soups, sandwiches, and salads. A cream tea costs about
£5 ($10), and main courses go for £5 to £9 ($10–$18).
Stop #3: The Minack Theatre
The oceanside Minack Theatre (% 01736/810-694; www.minack.com)
was carved out of a rocky hillside in Porthcurno, a village 14.5km (9 miles)
southwest of Penzance (from Mousehole, continue south on B3315, and
follow the signs). The theater is legendary because of its outdoor setting,
overlooking the ocean. If you stay in Penzance or St. Ives, an evening here
makes for a memorable experience. From May to September, theater 
companies from all over England stage performances of everything from
Shakespeare to musical comedies, a tradition dating to 1932. Bring a cush-
ion, a sweater, and a raincoat, just in case. You can check out the Visitor
Centre even if you’re not seeing a play. Theater tickets cost £7 to £8.50
($14–$17). The Exhibition Hall, which has information on the theater’s 
history, is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Oct–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m.,
matinee days 9:30 a.m.–noon); admission is £3.50 ($7) adults, £1.40 ($2.75)
Chapter 18: Cornwall: Saints, Salts, Sea, and Sun 305

children. The theater presents evening performances Monday through
Friday at 8 p.m., and matinees on Wednesday and Friday at 2 p.m. from
the end of May to mid-September.
Stop #4: Land’s End
Atlantic-facing Land’s End, where high granite cliffs plunge down to the
roaring sea, is one of the country’s most famous and dramatic land-
marks. But a theme-park development that you have to pass through to
reach the headland mars the grandeur of this windy point, the western-
most on mainland Britain. A well-marked path leads out to an observa-
tion point, and you can follow other coastal paths if the day is fine. The
British-owned Scilly Isles are 45km (28 miles) out to sea; otherwise,
nothing lies between England and the eastern coast of North America.
St. Ives: Artists’ Haven by the Sea
It’s easy to understand why this former fishing village on the north coast
of Cornwall attracts artists. The sea at St. Ives changes color like a jewel
shimmering in the sunlight. The town’s whitewashed stone cottages and
painted stucco villas stretch along rocky coves and a long, curving sand
beach. A relaxing place to stay, St. Ives is much smaller than Penzance. 
A branch of London’s Tate museum commemorates a group of local
artists, including Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, who lived and
worked in the town. The town is still a favorite hangout for artists and
craftspeople. You can find dozens of small galleries for browsing, in addi-
tion to plenty of good restaurants specializing in locally caught seafood.
Getting to St. Ives
Trains run throughout the day from London’s Paddington Station to 
the area. For St. Ives, you change trains at St. Erth on the main line to
Penzance, or you can take a train direct from Penzance. The total trip
takes about five-and-a-half to six hours. For train information, call 
% 08457/484-950. Long-distance buses from London’s Victoria Coach
Station take up to nine hours; call National Express (% 08705/808-080;
www.nationalexpress.com) for more information. Driving from
Penzance, you can take A30 northeast to its junction with A3074, and
follow A3074 north.
For information about renting a car in Penzance, see the section “Getting
to Penzance,” earlier in this chapter.
Finding information and taking a tour
The Tourist Information Centre in the Guildhall, Street-an-Pol (% 01736/
796-297), is open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.;
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. (mid-May to Aug 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.);
and Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. from mid-May through September. The
Part V: The West Country

center dispenses information on the area, stocks brochures on local
attractions, and operates a room-finding service.

corner of Cornwall, check out Cambron Tours (% 01736/796-389; www.

custom tour and take you around in a comfy minivan.
Staying in St. Ives
St. Ives draws visitors year-round, but it’s particularly busy in the warm
summer months. Dozens of hotels and B&Bs occupy this small Cornish
town. Here are my recommended choices.
Garrack Hotel & Restaurant
$$–$$$
This hotel is renowned for its restaurant and has special rates that include
dinner. The Garrack is in a traffic-free area of St. Ives, with views looking
out over the gardens to the sea. Some of the 18 guest rooms are in a former
private house; the others, in a modern wing and separate cottage. All have
private bathrooms. Kids love the indoor pool. The romantic sea-view
restaurant serves fresh fish and lobster from Newlyn; organic beef, lamb,
and venison; and produce from its own garden. Fixed-price meals range
from £22 to £28.50 ($44–$57). Even if you stay elsewhere, you may want to
eat here (reservations required).

MODERN BRITISH/INTERNATIONAL
This pleasantly upscale and relaxed cafe on Porthminster Beach over-
looking St. Ives Bay serves some interesting dishes. The offerings empha-
size fresh fish, but tasty vegetarian options are always on the menu. A meal
may consist of fish soup, seared scallops, venison salad, prawn risotto, or
baked Newlyn cod. For a nice sampling, try the tasting plate. This restau-
rant has more ambiance than the Seafood Cafe, described below, and the
menu is more ambitious.

Exploring St. Ives
Over a century ago, artists started coming to St. Ives for the wonderful
light and atmosphere. The sculptor Barbara Hepworth decided to stay,
and her house is one of the town’s most magical places to visit. Tate St.
Ives is the biggest tourist draw. The sandy beaches and high headlands
with views of the sea make for great walks.
Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden
This wonderful adjunct of the Tate St. Ives (just a couple of minutes’ walk
from that museum) gives remarkable insight into the work of Dame
Barbara Hepworth, one of the great sculptors of the 20th century. You get
to see Hepworth’s actual studio and sculpture garden. She lived here from
1949 until her death in 1975 at age 72. On the lower level, you can find an
informative exhibit on her life and career. Then you go upstairs to a mar-
velous living area and from there out into the sculpture garden. On dis-
play throughout are about 47 sculptures and drawings from 1928 to 1974,
photos, working tools, and Hepworth memorabilia.
Barnoon Hill. % 01736/796-226. www.tate.org.uk/stives/hepworth.
Admission: £4.75 ($9.50) adults, £2.75 ($5.50) students, free for seniors over 60 and

dents. Open: Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Feb Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Tate St. Ives
A branch of the Tate museum in London, Tate St. Ives opened in 1993 and
quickly became the town’s biggest attraction. The museum is devoted
exclusively to modern art and particularly to the works of artists who lived
in Cornwall. St. Ives itself has been an artists’ colony since 1928. Personally,
I think the building, which sits on the site of the old town gasworks, is
ungainly and confusing, although the spaces are filled with light and have
some fine seaward views. The museum has no permanent collection but

Finding more to see near St. Ives
Cornwall, like Wiltshire and Devon, is full of prehistoric sites, although
nothing as grand as Stonehenge. The following list describes three ancient
sites near St. Ives that you may want to check out; before you set out, stop
at the Tourist Information Centre (see the section “Finding information
about St. Ives,” earlier in this chapter) for more exact directions:
Chapter 18: Cornwall: Saints, Salts, Sea, and Sun 309

 Chysauster (Kie-sis-ter): The remains of a remarkable Iron Age vil-
lage with four pairs of houses, each fronting a village street. Each
house is oval in plan, with roughly circular rooms that open to a
central courtyard. Now roofless, the rooms were apparently cov-
ered with stone or thatch. During the excavation, archaeologists
discovered hearths, pottery, and other domestic debris lying on
the paved floors. Each house also had a stone-fenced back garden.
From St. Ives, drive south on B3311, turning west toward New Mill
and the marked site.
 Lanyon Quoit: This huge granite slab, 17 feet by 9 feet and 18
inches thick, rests on three upright stones. This formation is all
that remains of a Neolithic tomb. From St. Ives, drive west on B3306
to a signposted turnoff just before Morvah. Drive a couple of miles
farther south to see Trengwainton Garden (see the section
“Exploring in and around Penzance,” earlier in this chapter).
 Zennor Quoit (also called Mulfra Quoit): An unusual type of Early
Bronze Age megalithic tomb, which originated in Brittany and is
found throughout the Penwith area of Cornwall. Divided into cham-
ber and antechamber, a large round cairn (a heap of stones used as
a marker) originally covered the tomb, but all trace of this marker
has disappeared, leaving the internal structure standing free. From
St. Ives, drive west on B3306 to the signposted turnoff. Be prepared
for a 15-minute walk on a path that’s often wet and overgrown.
Fowey and the Saint’s Way: 
River Town and Holy Track
Located on the south coast, about midway between Plymouth and
Penzance, Fowey (pronounced Foy) is a small, scenic harbor town with
several historic buildings and an interesting past. The town stretches
along the green, wooded banks of the River Fowey, a shipping channel that
empties into St. Austell Bay. The river is a favorite spot for pleasure boats
of all kinds. A car-ferry service runs between Fowey to Bodinnick, on the
east side of the river. Daphne du Maurier, who used Cornwall as a setting
for her most famous novel, Rebecca, grew up in Bodinnick, part of Fowey.
You can pick up a free map and guide to the town and surrounding vil-
lages at Fowey’s Tourist Information Centre, The Ticket Shop, 4 Custom
House Hill (% 01726/833-616). The center is open daily from Easter
through September (Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.); the center closes on Sunday in the off season.
If you want lunch, tea, or a latte in Fowey, Zutshi’s at the Toll Bar,
Lostwithiel Street (% 01726/833-001), has a nice outdoor terrace over-
looking the river and sea. The Marina Villa Hotel & Restaurant Nathan
Outlaw, Esplanade, Fowey, Cornwall PL23 1HY (% 01726/833-315;
www.themarinahotel.co.uk), has 12 lovely rooms, most of them 
Part V: The West Country 
310

overlooking the river, and a fine-dining restaurant. A double room with
breakfast goes for £144 to £248 ($188–$496).
This region has been great walking country for thousands of years. The
42km-long (26-mile) Saint’s Way begins at Padstow on the north coast,
crosses the moors of central Cornwall, and ends at Fowey. During the
Bronze Age and Iron Age, Saint’s Way was a coast-to-coast trading route
that avoided the treacherous waters off Land’s End. Later, Saint’s Way
became the route for missionaries and pilgrims crossing from Ireland 
to take ships from Fowey to France and on to Rome or Santiago de
Compostela in Spain. You can see hill forts, granite Celtic crosses, holy
wells, and ancient churches all along the route.
Cotehele, Eden Project, and Lanhydrock: 
Three Great Cornish Gardens
Cornwall, blessed with the mildest climate in England, is equally blessed
with magnificent gardens. Check out these three places where plant
lovers can revel in nature. Two of them are former estates with fascinat-
ing houses; the third is newer.
Cotehele
Set on the steep, wooded slopes of the River Tamar, west of Plymouth,
Cotehele (pronounced Co-teel; % 01579/351-346) is a marvelous manor
house with magnificent gardens — one of the least altered medieval
houses in England. Built of granite and slate, Cotehele blends in naturally
with the landscape. The rooms inside, unlit by electricity (some so dim
you may have trouble finding your way), display a wonderful collection of
ancient furniture, textiles, and tapestries. The chapel contains the oldest
working domestic clock in England, still in its original place. Formal gar-
dens, terraces, and a daffodil meadow surround the house, situated near
the top of the valley. The steep valley gardens below contain many
species of exotic plants that thrive in Cornwall’s mild climate. The house
is a National Trust property. A good restaurant is in the nearby medieval
barn. You need at least two hours to see everything. Admission costs
£8.40 ($17), £4.20 ($8.50) for children, £21 ($42) for families (2 adults, 2
children). From mid-March through October, the house is open Saturday
through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. (in Oct until 4:30 p.m.); the gar-
dens are open year-round from 10:30 a.m. to dusk. To get to Cotehele
from Plymouth, take A38 northwest and then A388, turning east on A390
and south at Harrowbarrow (see the “Cornwall” map on p. 297).
Eden Project
A few miles west of Fowey, overlooking St. Austell Bay, you come to 
a major tourist attraction called Eden Project (% 01726/811-911;
www.edenproject.com), which opened in March 2001. The Eden Project
Chapter 18: Cornwall: Saints, Salts, Sea, and Sun 311

is both an educational resource and an environmental showcase. The site
comprises two gigantic geodesic conservatories, one devoted to the rain-
forest, and the other to the fruits and flowers of the Mediterranean, South
Africa, and California. Sunflowers, lavender, and hemp are among the
plants that grow outside, on the acres of landscaped grounds. The project
grows plants from all sorts of different terrains in microhabitats. Eden
Project is intriguing and definitely worth a couple of hours. A trip here is a
fun way to introduce kids to plants and environmental issues. Admission
is £14 ($28) for adults, £10 ($20) for seniors, £5 ($10) for children 5 to 15,
and £35 ($70) for families (2 adults, 3 children). The attraction is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (July–Aug until 9:30 p.m.; Nov–Mar until 4:30
p.m.). St. Austell is the nearest town. The Eden Project is signposted from
A390, A30, and A391 (see the “Cornwall” map on p. 297).
Lanhydrock
Set in a beautiful landscape overlooking the valley of the Fowey River,
Lanhydrock (Lan-hi-druck) is one of the grandest homes in Cornwall.
The magnificent Long Gallery, with its 17th-century plaster ceiling
depicting scenes from the Old Testament, is one of the few rooms that
survived a disastrous fire in 1881. You can view approximately 50 rooms
that reflect the organization and lifestyles in a rich Victorian household
that depended on servants to keep it running efficiently. Lanhydrock
reveals the other side of grand living: the kitchens, sculleries, and
larders where the staff toiled. And that’s part of what makes this place
so fascinating.
Part V: The West Country 
312
Tintagel: King Arthur . . . again?
The spots associated with King Arthur are legion, but none are quite so dramatic as
the ruins of Tintagel Castle (% 01840/770-328; www.english-heritage.org.
uk), on Cornwall’s rocky, windswept north coast (see “Cornwall” map on p. 297). A
stronghold of the Earls of Cornwall, the castle was built in the 13th century on the site
of a sixth-century Celtic monastery, right on the edge of a cliff, with the Atlantic thun-
dering below. Though it’s now in ruins, Tintagel Castle has long been associated with
romantic stories of King Arthur. Some say he was born here, which is perhaps true if
you regard Arthur as a legend. English Heritage maintains the cliffside castle ruins,
which require some steep stair-climbing if you want to fully explore them. The sur-
rounding area is rich in flora and fauna and provides a breeding ground for sea birds,
lizards and butterflies. Admission is £4.50 ($9) for adults, £3.40 ($6.75) for seniors and
students, and £2.30 ($4.50) children. The site is open daily (except Dec 24–26 and Jan 1)
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Oct until 5 p.m., Nov–late Mar until 4 p.m.). Tintagel is hard to
reach unless you have a car. From Exeter, head across Cornwall on the A30, continu-
ing west at the junction with the A395. From this highway, various signposted sec-
ondary roads lead to Tintagel. If you’re exploring this part of the West Country, you
may want to visit Clovelly on Devon’s north coast, about 90 minutes away by car (see
“Up-along/Down-along: Clovelly on Devon’s North Coast” in Chapter 17).

Different kinds of gardens — from Victorian parterres (ornamental gar-
dens with paths between the beds) to woodland gardens with camellias,
magnolias, and rhododendrons — surround the house. An avenue of
ancient beech and sycamore trees runs from the 17th-century gatehouse
down to a medieval bridge across the Fowey. The National Trust manages
the property. You need at least two hours to take it all in. Admission
costs £8.50 ($17) for adults, £4.25 ($8.50) children, £21.50 ($43) for fami-
lies (2 adults, 2 children). The house is open April through October
Tuesday to Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (in Oct until 5 p.m.). The
garden is open daily year-round from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Lanhydrock is
about 16km (10 miles) north of Fowey and 4km (21⁄2 miles) east of
Bodmin; the home is signposted from A30, A38, and B3268.

Part VI
England’s Heartland

In this part . . .
C
entral England encompasses many more counties than
the two I describe in this part. But the bordering coun-
ties of Warwickshire and Gloucestershire are, to my mind, 
the heart of England’s heartland. William Shakespeare, whose
words have become a permanent part of the English language,
was born and died in Warwickshire. And Gloucestershire can
boast some of the most beautiful countryside and villages in
England.
In Chapter 19, I take you through Shakespeare’s hometown,
Stratford-upon-Avon, where you can visit the houses that the
great poet and playwright called home. From Stratford, you
can make an easy day trip to mighty Warwick Castle, the most
impressive castle in this piece of central England.
Chapter 20 begins with the Regency spa town of Bath, a place
that epitomizes the graceful, glamorous world of Jane Austen
and Georgian England. From Bath, you can take a side trip to
the lovely cathedral town of Wells, or head to Cheltenham, a
smaller spa town in Gloucestershire. I end with a tour of the
Cotswolds, where picturesque medieval market towns of
honey-colored stone stand as proud reminders of the days
when the wool trade brought prosperity to the region.

Chapter 19
Stratford-upon-Avon 
and Warwick Castle
In This Chapter
 Visiting Shakespeare’s hometown
 Spending time in mighty Warwick Castle
W
illiam Shakespeare is the one name that people around the 
world associate with England. Shakespeare (1564–1616) was a
universal genius: His plays and poems transcend geographical bound-
aries and strike a chord common in all humanity. It’s no wonder, then,
that Stratford-upon-Avon, the town where he was born and died, is one
of the most visited places in England. Warwick Castle is only a few miles
away, and you can easily get there by train from Stratford, so you may
want to visit both when you’re in the area. Bath and the Cotswolds are
also nearby (see Chapter 20). For an overview of the area, see the
“England’s Heartland” map on p. 318.
Stratford-upon-Avon: In the Bard’s Footsteps
Do I need to tell you whose spirit pervades this market town on the
River Avon, 147km (91 miles) northwest of London? Stratford-upon-Avon
is a shrine to the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare, who
was born, lived much of his life, and is buried here. In summer, crowds
of international tourists overrun the town, which hustles its Shakespeare
connection in every conceivable way.
Stratford boasts many fine Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings, but 
it’s not really a quaint village anymore. (See the “Stratford-upon-Avon”
map on p. 320.) If you arrive by train, your first glimpse of Stratford 
is a vast parking lot across from the station. Don’t let this less-than-
Shakespearean view put you off. Stratford hasn’t completely lost the
charms of its formerly bucolic setting — you can find plenty of charming
corners as you explore. Besides the literary pilgrimage sights, the top
draw in Stratford is the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, where Britain’s
foremost actors perform.

Stratford has much to see and enjoy. I recommend that you spend at
least a day here. Consider an overnight stay if you’re a theater lover, but
make sure that you book your theater seat in advance. (See the section
“Seeing a play in Stratford-upon-Avon,” later in this chapter.)
Getting to Stratford-upon-Avon
Direct trains leave frequently from London’s Paddington and Marylebone
Station; the fastest direct trains take about two hours. The “supersaver
return” advance-purchase round-trip ticket costs about £40 ($80), but

you can actually save money by buying two single (one-way) fares for £15
($30) each way. Call % 08457/484-950 for information, fares, and sched-
ules. National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com)
offers daily bus service from London’s Victoria Coach Station; a direct
trip lasts a little more than three hours and costs about £16 ($32) for a
same-day round-trip ticket. By car from London, take the M40 toward
Oxford, and continue to Stratford-upon-Avon on A34.
Finding information about Stratford-upon-Avon
Stratford’s Tourist Information Centre, Bridgefoot (% 0870/160-7930;
www.shakespeare-country.co.uk), provides information and maps of
the town and its principal sites. The center has a currency exchange and
also offers a room-booking service at % 01789/415-061. Opening hours
are Easter through October, Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
and Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; November to Easter, Monday through
Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Getting around and touring Stratford-upon-Avon
Stratford is compact, and you can walk everywhere. The train and bus
stations are less than a 15-minute walk from the town center.
City Sightseeing, 14 Rother St. (% 01708/866-000; www.citysight
seeing.co.uk), offers guided tours of Stratford that leave from outside
the tourist office. Open-top, double-decker buses depart every 15 to 30
minutes daily between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. (until 3:30 p.m. Nov–Feb).
You can take the one-hour ride without stops, or get off and on at any or
all the town’s five Shakespeare properties, including Mary Arden’s House
in Wilmcote (see the section “Exploring the best of Stratford-upon-Avon,”
later in this chapter). The tour ticket is valid all day but doesn’t include
admission to any of the houses. The bus tour cost is £9 ($18) for adults,
£7 ($14) for seniors and students, and £4 ($8) for children under 12. You
can buy your ticket on the bus.
Staying in Stratford-upon-Avon
Make reservations if you plan to sleep, perchance to dream, in Stratford —
particularly on weekends during the theater season and during the sum-
mer. For those popular periods, make reservations at least a couple of
weeks in advance. The Tourist Information Centre (see “Finding informa-
tion about Stratford-upon-Avon,” earlier in this chapter) can also help
you find accommodations.

courses are skillfully prepared with curries, herbs, and spices. The fixed-
price meals are a good value.

Exploring the best of Stratford-upon-Avon
You can easily spend the better part of a day visiting the Shakespeare
sights in Stratford.
One ticket gets you into the five sites administered by the Shakespeare
Birthplace Trust (% 01789/201-807; www.shakespeare.org.uk): Anne
Hathaway’s Cottage, Hall’s Croft, Mary Arden’s House, New Place/Nash’s
House, and Shakespeare’s Birthplace. You can pick up the ticket at your
first stop. This five-in-one ticket costs £14 ($28) for adults, £12 ($24) for
seniors and students, £6.50 ($13) for children 5 to 15, and £29 ($58) for
families (2 adults, 3 children). A reduced-price ticket is available if you
only want to visit the three sites in town. All the Shakespeare sites have
access limitations, so visitors in wheelchairs may want to call ahead for
more information.
To follow Shakespeare’s life from birth to death, you can visit the sights
in the order in which they appear in this section.
Shakespeare’s Birthplace
Stratford-upon-Avon
The Bard, son of a glover and wool merchant, first saw the light of day on
April 23, 1564, in this house, the logical place to begin your tour. You enter
through the Shakespeare Exhibition, where you can spend a few minutes
browsing the exhibits that illustrate his life and times. The house, filled
with Shakespeare memorabilia, is actually two 16th-century half-timbered
houses joined together: His father’s shop was on one side and the family
residence on the other. After visiting the bedroom where wee Willie was
(probably) born, the Elizabethan kitchen, and other rooms, you can walk
through the garden. You need at least 30 to 60 minutes for a thorough visit;
be prepared for crowds.
See map p. 320. Henley Street. % 01789/204-016. Admission: £7 ($14) adults, £6 ($12)
seniors and students, £2.75 ($5.50) children 5–15, £17 ($34) families (2 adults, 3 chil-
dren). Open: Daily Apr–May and Sept–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; June–Aug 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
(Sun from 9:30 a.m.); Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.); closed Dec 24–26.
Chapter 19: Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Castle 323

Anne Hathaway’s Cottage
Shottery
Anne Hathaway, who came from a family of yeoman farmers (farmers who
owned and worked their own land), lived in this lovely thatched cottage
until 1582, the year she married 18-year-old Shakespeare. (Anne was seven
years older than Will.) Many original 16th-century furnishings, including
the courting settle (a type of bench that courting couples sat on), are pre-
served inside the house, which Anne’s descendents occupied until 1892.
Before leaving, stroll through the beautiful garden and orchard. Allow
about 30 minutes.
To visit the cottage, located about a mile south of Stratford, take a bus
from Bridge Street, or better still, walk there along the well-marked coun-
try path from Evesham Place.
See map p. 320. Cottage Lane, Shottery. % 01789/204-016. Admission: £5.50 ($11)
adults, £4.50 ($9) seniors and students, £2 ($4) children 5–15, £13 ($26) families 
(2 adults, 3 children). Open: Daily Apr–May and Sept–Oct 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. (Sun from
10 a.m.); June–Aug 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (Sun from 9:30 a.m.); Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m.;
closed Jan 1, Good Friday, and Dec 24–26.
New Place/Nash’s House
Stratford-upon-Avon
In 1610, Shakespeare was a relatively prosperous man whose plays had
been seen by Queen Elizabeth. He retired to New Place, a Stratford house
he had purchased a few years earlier and where he died in 1616. The house
was later torn down. Of New Place, only the garden remains. You enter the
garden through Nash’s House, which belonged to Thomas Nash, husband
of Shakespeare’s granddaughter. The house contains 16th-century period
rooms and an exhibit illustrating Stratford’s history. A knot garden land-
scaped in an Elizabethan style with clipped boxwood borders adjoins the
house. You can see the house and garden in 15 to 30 minutes.
To reach the site from Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, retrace your steps to
Shakespeare’s Birthplace and then walk east on Henley Street and south on
High Street, which becomes Chapel Street.
See map p. 320. Chapel Street. % 01789/204-016. Admission: £3.75 ($7.50) adults, £3
($6) seniors and students, £1.75 ($3.50) children 5–15, £10 ($20) families (2 adults, 
3 children). Open: Daily Apr–May and Sept–Oct 11 a.m.–5 p.m.; June–Aug 9:30 a.m.–
5 p.m. (Sun from 10 a.m.); Nov–Mar 11 a.m.–4 p.m.; closed Dec 24–26.
Hall’s Croft
Stratford-upon-Avon
Shakespeare’s daughter, Susanna, probably lived with her husband, Dr.
John Hall, in this magnificent Tudor house with a walled garden. The house
is furnished in the style of a middle-class 17th-century home. You can view
exhibits illustrating the theory and practice of medicine in Dr. Hall’s time.
Part VI: England’s Heartland 
324

The word croft, by the way, means a small farm. You can see Hall’s Croft in
less than a half-hour. To get here from New Place, travel south on Chapel
and Church streets, and turn east on Old Town.
You can take a convenient break from your Shakespeare pilgrimage at
Drucker’s Cafe, Old Town (% 01789/292-107), a cozy, informal eatery
attached to Hall’s Croft. Sandwiches and homemade soup cost about £3
($6), and a pot of tea runs £1.50 ($3). The cafe is open daily from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. in summer, until 4 p.m. in winter.
See map p. 320. Old Town. % 01789/292-107. Admission: £3.75 ($7.50) adults, £3 ($6)
seniors and students, £1.75 ($3.50) children 5–15, £9 ($18) families (2 adults, 3 chil-
dren). Open: Daily Apr–May and Sept–Oct 11 a.m.–5 p.m.; June–Aug 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
(Sun from 10 a.m.); Nov–Mar 11 a.m.–4 p.m.; closed Dec 24–26.
Holy Trinity Church
Stratford-upon-Avon
Shakespeare died on his birthday (April 23), aged 52, and is buried in this
beautiful parish church near the River Avon. His wife, Anne; his daughter,
Susanna; and Susanna’s husband, John Hall, lie beside him in front of the
altar. A bust of the immortal Bard looks down on the gravesite. For a man
who wrote some of the world’s most enduring lines, his tomb’s inscription
is little more than trivial verse, ending with “and curst be he who moves
my bones.” Obviously, Shakespeare didn’t want to leave Stratford — ever.
You can visit the entire church in about 15 minutes. To reach the church
from Hall’s Croft, walk south to Southern Lane, which runs beside the River
Avon, and follow it south to Trinity Street, where you can find a path to
the church. Today, the church is in dire need of structural improvements,
and a big campaign is underway to raise the necessary funds.
See map p. 320. Old Town. % 01789/266-316. Admission: Church free, Shakespeare’s
tomb £1.50 ($3). Open: Mar and Oct Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Apr–Sept Mon–Sat 8:30
a.m.–6 p.m., Nov–Feb Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–4 p.m.; year-round Sun 12:30–5 p.m. Closed
Dec 24–26, Jan 1.
Mary Arden’s House & Shakespeare Countryside Museum
Wilmcote
For more than 200 years, Palmers Farm, a Tudor farmstead with an old
stone dovecote and outbuildings, was identified as the girlhood home of
Mary Arden, Shakespeare’s mother. Recent evidence revealed, however,
that Mary Arden actually lived in the house next door, at Glebe Farm. In
2000, the house at Glebe Farm was officially designated the Mary Arden
House. Dating from 1514, this house contains country furniture and domes-
tic utensils; in the barns, stable, cowshed, and farmyard, you can see an
extensive collection of farm implements illustrating life and work in the
local countryside from Shakespeare’s time to the present.
For a leisurely look at everything, give yourself about 45 minutes.
Chapter 19: Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Castle 325

To reach this last Shakespeare shrine, drive north to Wilmcote on A34. The
house is also a stop on the City Sightseeing bus tour (see “Getting around
and touring Stratford-upon-Avon,” earlier in this chapter).
See map p. 320. Wilmcote (about 5.5km/31⁄2 miles north of Stratford on A34). 
% 01789/204-016. Admission: £6 ($12) adults, £5 ($10) seniors and students, £2.50 ($5)
children 5–15, £15 ($30) families (2 adults, 3 children). Open: Daily Apr–May and
Sept–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; June–Aug 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; closed
Dec 24–26.
Finding more to see and do in Stratford-upon-Avon
Most people come to Stratford to see the Shakespeare sites. If you have
the kids with you, and old houses bore them silly, here are a handful of
alternative attractions that they can enjoy:
 Avon Boating, Swan’s Nest Boatyard, Swan’s Nest Lane (% 01789/
267-073): Offers half-hour boat trips on the Avon River from April
to October. Boats depart daily, approximately every 20 minutes,
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The trip costs £4 ($8) for adults and £2.50
($5) for children.
 Butterfly Farm, Tramway Walk, Swan’s Nest Lane (% 01789/299-
288; www.butterflyfarm.co.uk): An enclosed greenhouse filled
with hundreds of colorful, free-flying butterflies. You can discover
various insect displays amid the tropical plants and flowers of a re-
created rainforest. Besides the butterflies, kids enjoy seeing forest
insects and spiders. Admission costs £5.25 ($11) for adults, £4.75
($9.50) for seniors and students, £4.25 ($8.50) for children 5 to 15,
and £15 ($30) for families (2 adults, 2 children). The farm is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the summer and from 10 a.m. to dusk
in the winter.
 Shakespearience, Waterside Theatre, Waterside (% 01789/290-111;
www.shakespearience.co.uk): Stratford’s newest attraction pres-
ents the life and works of Shakespeare in a unique way by using
show technology and special effects. The one-hour show includes
information about the Bard of Stratford and dramatic highlights from
nine of his best-loved plays. Tickets cost £7.25 ($14) for adults; £6.25
($12) for seniors, students, and children under 12; and £24 ($48) for
families (2 adults and 2 children). Shakespearience is open daily
(except Christmas) from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (11 a.m.–4 p.m. in winter).
 Stratford Brass Rubbing Centre, Avon Bank Gardens, Southern
Lane (% 01789/297-671; www.stratfordbrassrubbing.co.uk):
This center has dozens of interesting replica brasses from English
churches and provides all the materials that you need to make an
on-the-spot rubbing for £2 to £20 ($4–$40). You can easily create a
brass rubbing (and have fun doing it), even if you’re not exactly an
artist. To make a brass rubbing, you rub a hard wax crayon over
paper covering the memorial brass; the impression that you make
is the rubbing. The center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the
summer and Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the winter.

Seeing a play in Stratford-upon-Avon
The Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Waterside, Stratford-upon-Avon CV37
6BB (% 01789/403-403; www.rsc.org.uk), is the home of the prestigious
Royal Shakespeare Company, which typically stages five Shakespeare
plays during a season running from November to September. The com-
pany usually performs the plays in the Festival Theatre, which has a
proscenium stage (a traditional stage), or in the Swan Theatre, a thrust
stage (a stage that extends into the audience) with side galleries. Note,
however, that the Festival Theatre is closed for restoration until 2010; 
in the meantime, performances are held at the Swan Theatre and the
Courtyard Theatre, the latter of which opened in 2006. Although demand
depends on the play, you should order your tickets at least two to three
weeks in advance, if not earlier. The theater always holds a few tickets
for sale on the day of a performance, but you may not get a good seat if
you wait till the last minute. Returned tickets go on sale an hour before
the performance, but the queue (line) for these starts forming about two
hours before. The box office is open Monday through Saturday from 9
a.m. to 8 p.m. but closes at 6 p.m. on days when no performances are
scheduled. Ticket prices are £5 to £50 ($10–$100). You can book tickets
online through the Royal Shakespeare Company Web site.
Shopping in Stratford-upon-Avon
Stratford’s weekly Market, held on Friday, dates back over 800 years.
The Shakespeare Bookshop, in the Shakespeare Centre, Henley Street
(% 01789/201-819), is the region’s best bookshop for Shakespeare-
related material. The nearby Pickwick Gallery, 32 Henley St. (% 01789/
294-861), carries a wide variety of old and new engravings. Elaine Rippon
Craft Gallery, Shakespeare Craft Yard off Henley Street (% 01789/415-
481), designs, creates, and sells sumptuous silk and velvet accessories,
and carries fine British contemporary crafts.
Warwick Castle: Warlords and Ladies
The ancient county town of Warwick (pronounced War-ick) sits on a
rocky hill on the north side of the River Avon, about 13km (8 miles)
northeast of Stratford. Although you can explore some intriguing old
streets in the town, most visitors come here with one goal in mind: 
to visit mighty Warwick Castle, one of England’s most popular tourist
attractions. Dramatically sited above the river on the town’s south 
side, the castle is a splendid example of a medieval fortress that’s 
been adapted over the centuries to reflect its inhabitants’ tastes and
ambitions.
Give yourself at least three hours to visit the castle and the lovely gar-
dens and parkland around it; if you want to wander through the town,
add an hour or two.
Chapter 19: Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Castle 327

Warwick Castle was built as a medieval fortress and, as such, has a large
number of steps and narrow doorways, which present limitations for
mobility-restricted visitors. Travelers with disabilities are encouraged to
call first or check the Web site, www.warwick-castle.co.uk, for more
information.
Getting to Warwick
The castle sits right in the center of Warwick, a 15-minute walk from the
train or bus station. Stagecoach (% 0870/608-2608) provides direct bus
service from Stratford for about £4 ($8) round-trip; the trip takes about
15 minutes. Chiltern Railways (% 08705/165-165) runs direct trains to
Stratford and Warwick from London’s Marylebone station; the trip takes
one hour and 45 minutes and costs about £30 ($60) for a round-trip.
National Express (% 08705/808-080) offers daily bus service between
Victoria Coach Station in London and Warwick; the two-hour-and-45-
minute trip costs about £40 ($80) round-trip. National Express also runs
buses to Warwick from Riverside bus station in Stratford-upon-Avon. 
By car from Stratford, take Junction 15 off the M40, and continue for 3km
(2 miles).
Part VI: England’s Heartland 
328
History and architecture 
of Warwick Castle
Warwick Castle reflects more than a thousand years of turbulent English history. The
castle was the ancestral home of the Earls of Warwick, key players in medieval
England’s brutal political conflicts — not the sort of guys you want messing with you.
One of them, Richard Neville (known as “the Kingmaker”), was so powerful that he helped
depose both Henry VI and Edward IV. Another Earl of Warwick executed Joan of Arc.
For their family stronghold, the earliest earls chose a strategic site first fortified by the
Saxons and later, in 1068, by the Normans. About three centuries later, the 11th Earl of
Warwick expanded the Norman stronghold into the enormous walled and turreted
fortress that visitors see today. When James I granted the castle to Sir Fulke Greville
in 1604, the new owner spent a fortune converting the inner buildings into a luxurious
mansion. Extensive restorations were made after a disastrous fire in 1871. Lord Brooke,
the most recent owner, sold the ancestral mansion to the owners of Madame Tussauds
wax museum, who have added some entertainment features.
Architecturally, the castle marks the transitional period between the formidable but
dreary strongholds of medieval England and the more domestic fortified houses that
replaced them. The massive outer walls and defense towers date to the 14th century.
From the Porter’s Lodge (1800), a winding path cut in the solid rock leads to a double
gateway between two massive towers. In the grassy inner court, you can see the Bear
and Clarence Towers on the right, a castle/mound (all that’s left from Norman times)
rising in front, and the domestic buildings on the left.

Dining at Warwick Castle
Being robbed by a highwayman wasn’t an uncommon experience for
travelers 200 years ago. At Warwick Castle’s Highwayman’s Supper,
guests hear the highwayman’s side of the story. The themed event’s 
setting is the castle in the 18th century on a night when the Earl of
Warwick is away, and the castle housekeeper gives the guests a private
viewing of the staterooms. Afterward, in the coach house, a five-course
meal is served (with unlimited wine, ale, or soft drinks), accompanied by
18th-century music, dancing, and bawdy tall tales. The castle holds a
Highwayman’s Supper most Fridays and Saturdays throughout the year
and nightly (except Sun) in December until Christmas. The supper costs
£45 ($90) per person (slightly higher during Dec). For reservations and
further information, call % 0870/442-2372. Note: This event is unsuit-
able for guests under 18 years of age.
Exploring Warwick Castle
You can explore the entire castle complex, but save most of your time —
at least one hour — to wander through the Private Apartments. In these
rooms, you encounter lifelike figures that are part of an exhibition called
the Royal Weekend Party. In 1898, the Countess of Warwick hosted a week-
end party for Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. A century later, the
wax artists at Madame Tussauds created likenesses of the guests, includ-
ing a 20-something Winston Churchill (seen leafing through a book in the
Library) and the Duke of York, later George V (seen lighting a cigarette in
the Card Room). Upstairs, their hostess (known to her friends as Daisy) is
dressing for dinner, and so are some of her guests, including Consuelo,
Duchess of Marlborough (a member of the Vanderbilt family); Lord Curzon
(Viceroy of India); and the Countess’ special guest, the future King Edward
VII. All the room settings are meticulous re-creations that use original
furniture from the time of the party. The Chapel and State Rooms are
next to the Private Apartments. The 16th-century Great Hall is the longest
(99m/330 ft.) and largest of the rooms on view. The hall overlooks the river
and has a collection of arms and armor. The other rooms were mostly dec-
orated from 1770 to 1790. The Cedar Room has Van Dyke portraits, and
paintings by Velasquez and Rubens hang in the Red Drawing Room.
Several exhibitions use sound and light effects and wax figures to tell sto-
ries about the castle. Death or Glory regales you with the story of former
resident Richard Neville, “the Kingmaker,” preparing for battle. Another, in
the Ghost Tower, tells of the murder of Fulke Greville, one of the castle’s
owners. After visiting the very depressing dungeon, you may want to walk
along the castle ramparts for a breath of fresh air. The castle overlooks
beautiful parkland and gardens laid out by Capability Brown, one of the
greatest landscape gardeners of 18th-century England. Peacocks roam
freely through the grounds, and the River Avon runs through them.
Warwick. % 0870/442-2000. www.warwick-castle.co.uk. Admission (price is
slightly less in low season and when booked online): £16 ($32) adults, £12 ($24) 
seniors, £13 ($26) students, £9.95 ($20) children 5–15, £48 ($96) families (2 adults, 
2 children). Open: Daily Apr–Sept 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Oct–Mar 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Chapter 19: Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Castle 329

Finding more to see and do in Warwick
I don’t recommend staying overnight in Warwick, but you may want to
stroll through town to check out the buildings in this list:
 Lord Leycester Hospital (% 01926/491-422): Established in 1571
by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (a favorite of Queen Elizabeth I),
this marvelous grouping of half-timbered almshouses leans against
the old West Gate. The hospital buildings, some dating from around
1400, give you a good picture of what buildings in the town looked
like before a fire destroyed most of them in 1694. If you spot some-
one wearing a black cape with a silver pendant in the shape of a
boar, he’s one of the Brethren (retired servicemen) who live at the
hospital and welcome visitors. Inside, you can visit the beautiful
galleried courtyard, the Great Hall and magnificent Guildhall,
and the Chaplains’ Dining Hall. In the wonderfully atmospheric
Brethren’s Kitchen, with stone floors and exposed oak beams, you
can get a good afternoon tea for about £5 ($10). Admission costs
£3.20 ($6.50) adults, £2.70 ($5.50) seniors, and £2.20 ($4.50) chil-
dren. The hospital is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. (5 p.m. in winter).To get to the hospital from Warwick Castle,
follow Castle Street up the hill to High Street, and turn left.
 St. Mary’s Church (% 01926/403-940): This church (on Church
Street) had to rebuild its tower and nave after the great fire of 1694.
Spared by the fire was the Beauchamp Chantry, the location of a
famous gilded bronze tomb effigy of Richard Beauchamp, a power-
ful Earl of Warwick who died in 1439. (A chantry, by the way, is a
chapel endowed by a family for the chanting of Masses, usually for
the chapel’s principal founder.) The tomb of Robert Dudley is
against the north wall. The church, less than a five-minute walk
from Warwick Castle, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Nov–Mar
until 4 p.m.).

Bath and the Best 
of the Cotswolds
In This Chapter
 Basking in Bath
 Checking out Cheltenham
 Exploring charming Cotswolds villages
 Strolling through Cirencester
T
he Cotswold Hills occupy a region in central England that’s been
inhabited for some 6,000 years. Tucked into this gentle landscape,
you can find prehistoric mounds, the remains of Roman villas, magnifi-
cent gardens, old manor houses, and amazingly preserved towns that
grew rich on Cotswold wool during the Middle Ages. For hundreds of
years, merchants came from London and as far away as Florence to buy
Cotswold fleeces for shipment around the world.
This area of grassy limestone hills, woodlands, cool green ravines, 
and high open plateaus (known as wolds) is roughly bordered by Bath 
to the south, Oxford to the east, Stratford-upon-Avon to the north, and
Cheltenham to the west. This area isn’t large: From north to south, the
Cotswolds stretch some 126km (78 miles). More than 80 percent of the
land is still farmland; a network of distinctive dry stone walls marks 
the fields.
Many people enjoy touring the Cotswolds, visiting the medieval villages
just to stroll around, shop (the Cotswolds have more antiques stores than
anywhere else in England), and have an afternoon cream tea. Although
the region has many lovely villages, in this chapter, I include only the
ones that hold the most interest for casual village-hoppers: Bourton-
on-the-Water, Upper and Lower Slaughter, Broadway, and Chipping
Campden. Bath, which starts this chapter, is a must-see city even if you
don’t plan to tour the Cotswolds. Other worthwhile stops include the
smaller cities of Cheltenham and Cirencester.
Visitors on a tight schedule won’t find the public transportation options
in the Cotswolds very useful. You can best explore this area by car.
Otherwise, getting from one village to the next is difficult.

Bath: Hot Mineral Springs and 
Cool Georgian Splendor
Bath, 185km (115 miles) west of London, sits on the doorstep of the
Cotswolds but not quite in them (see the “Bath” map on p. 333). Plan to
devote at least a day to this beautiful spa town on the River Avon. Bath
makes a good base for exploring the region, though you can also easily
visit on a day trip from London.
In ancient times, the area was known far and wide for its hot mineral
springs, which drew the Celts and later the Romans, who settled here in
A.D. 75 and built a huge bath complex to soak their weary bones. Cen-
turies later, in 1702, Queen Anne dipped her royal bod into the soothing
sulfurous waters and sparked a trend that transformed Bath into an ultra-
fashionable spa. Aristocrats, socialites, social climbers, and flamboyant
dandies like Beau Nash held sway. Jane Austen, a demure visitor, used
Bath as an upwardly genteel setting for her class-conscious novels.
Filled with remarkable curving crescents (row houses built in a long,
curving line) and classically inspired buildings built of toffee-colored
stone, the town you see today is a fabulous legacy from the Georgian
era. Its architectural legacy is so important that UNESCO named Bath a
World Heritage Site. For more on the city’s architecture, see the sidebar
“Building blocks of history: Bath,” later in this chapter.
Getting to Bath
Trains for Bath leave from London’s Paddington Station every 30 minutes,
and the trip lasts about 90 minutes. Standard round-trip fare costs about
£47 ($94). National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.
com) runs frequent buses from London’s Victoria Coach Station. Depending
on departure time, the trip takes three to four hours; round-trip (“day
return”) fare costs about £16 ($32). By car, take the M4 to Junction 18 and
then drive a few miles south on A46.
Bath is one of the most convenient places for renting a car to tour the
Cotswolds. Car-rental agencies in or near town include the following:
 Arrows Self-Drive Hire, Claverton Buildings, Widecombe, 
% 01225/422-262
 Avis, Riverside Business Park, % 01225/446-680

Dining in Bath
Bath’s sophisticated dining scene features many cuisines. Here are my
favorite places to eat.
Le Petit Cochon
$–$$$
FRENCH
Le Petit Cochon (The Little Pig) is Bath’s only French brasserie and offers
about a dozen dishes each day based on traditional French cafe cooking
(such as steak and pomme frites, coq au vin, and boeuf Bourguignon). You
can stop in for a morning espresso and croissant or drop by for a leisurely
lunch or dinner with a glass of wine. The atmosphere is casual and fun,
the food great. The fixed-price lunch is a good value.

SEAFOOD
Loch Fyne is a seafood restaurant chain, and quite a good one. You can

seafood main courses such as Cornish monkfish Caesar salad, roast fillet
of cod, poached smoked haddock, and traditional fish pie. The menu 
also features vegetarian dishes. With its high ceilings, marble pillars, and

Exploring Bath
Bath’s legacy of architecture from the Regency era (1811–1830) is so impor-
tant that the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. To view the historic
buildings and visit the sights, you can easily walk everywhere in this
compact town. If you’re interested in guided walks or a bus tour, see the
section “Finding information and taking a tour of Bath,” earlier in this
chapter.

Assembly Rooms and Fashion Museum
A classic building worth visiting is the Assembly Rooms, the site of all the
grand balls and social climbing in 18th-century Bath. The complex houses
the excellent Fashion Museum, where you can see just what those dandies
and their ladies wore. You can walk through the Assembly Rooms in just
a few minutes; allow a half-hour if you’re also visiting the Fashion Museum.
See map p. 333. Bennett Street. % 01225/477-785. www.fashionmuseum.co.uk.
Admission: Assembly Rooms free; museum £6.75 ($14) adults, £5.75 ($12) seniors and
students, £4.75 ($9.50) children 6–18, £19 ($38) families (2 adults, 2 children). Open:
Museum daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m.; closed Dec 25 and 26; Assembly Rooms sometimes
closed for private functions.
Bath Abbey
The 18th-century abbey dominates the adjacent town square. Step inside
for a look at the graceful fan vaulting; the great east window; and the unex-
pectedly simple memorial to Beau Nash, the most flamboyant of the
dandies who frequented Bath in its heyday.
See map p. 333. Abbey Church Yard. % 01225/422-462. Admission: £2.50 ($5). 
Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m. (Nov–Mar until 4:30 p.m.); Sun 1–2:30 p.m. and 4:30–
5:30 p.m.

Building blocks of history: Bath
Queen Anne sparked the royal enthusiasm for Bath’s healing waters, but it wasn’t until
a few years later, during the Georgian and Regency eras (1714–1830), that Bath
became one of the social hot spots of England. In about 100 years, what had been a
small provincial spa town was transformed into one of Europe’s most elegant cities.
The extraordinary building boom created Bath’s famous curving crescents of sump-
tuous town houses, garden squares, and dozens of beautifully proportioned detached
homes and public buildings. This period’s architecture was unusually restrained (unlike
many of the personalities); it’s based on classical models and motifs that present har-
monious and well-proportioned facades.
If you’re interested in the architecture, stop in and spend an hour or so at the Building
of Bath Museum, The Countess of Huntingdon’s Chapel, The Vineyard (off Paragon
Street; % 01225/333-895; see map p. 333). The museum examines the city’s Georgian
and Regency architecture and interiors. Exhibits detail the crafts used in the course
of construction and introduce the architects who contributed to Bath’s remarkable
development. The museum is open mid-February through November Tuesday through
Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is £4 ($8) for adults, £3.50 ($7) for seniors
and students, and £2 ($4) for children 5 to 15. To reach the museum from the Assembly
Rooms, head east on Alfred Street and north on Paragon Street; you can see the
museum on your left.

Bridges, Crescents, Circuses, and Parades
Bath was built for promenading. Filled with beautiful squares and sweep-
ing residential crescents, it remains a wonderful town for walking. Stroll
along the North Parade and the South Parade, Queen Square (where Jane
Austen lived), and The Circus. Built in 1770 and inspired by Florence’s
Ponte Vecchio, Pulteney Bridge spans the River Avon a few blocks south
of the Assembly Rooms. The bridge is one of the few in Europe lined with
shops and restaurants.
Jane Austen Centre
Truth be told, Jane Austen didn’t really like Bath very much, but she was
a keen observer and drew on it for her witty portraits of 18th-century soci-
ety. In a Georgian town house on a street where she once lived, text-heavy
exhibits and a video tell you more about the life and times of this brilliant
daughter of a country pastor and convey a sense of what life was like in
Bath during the Regency period. If you’re an Austen fan, allow about 30
minutes for your visit. If you’re not a fan, this rather dull place won’t con-
vert you. The Regency Tea Rooms on the second floor, however, are a nice
spot for afternoon tea (£6.95/$14).
See map p. 333. 40 Gay St. % 01225/443-000. www.janeausten.co.uk.
Admission: £6.50 ($13) adults, £4.95 ($10) seniors and students, £3.50 ($7) children,
£18 ($36) families (2 adults, 2 children). Open: Daily 9:45 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (July–Aug
Thurs–Sat until 8:30 p.m.;Nov–Feb 11 a.m.–4:30 p.m.).
No. 1 Royal Crescent
The Royal Crescent is a magnificent, curving row of 30 town houses
regarded as the epitome of England’s Palladian style (a classical style
incorporating elements from ancient Greek and Roman buildings). John
Wood the Younger designed the crescent in 1767. No. 1 Royal Crescent is
a gorgeously restored 18th-century house with period furnishings. A tour
of the interior gives you a vivid picture of how the elite lived during the
Regency era. Allow about 30 minutes.
See map p. 333. Royal Crescent. % 01225/428-126. Admission: £5 ($10) adults; £4 ($8)
seniors and students, £2.50 ($5) children 5–16; £12 ($24) families (2 adults, 2 children).
Open: Mid-Feb–Oct Tues–Sun 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Nov Tues–Sun 10:30 a.m.–4 p.m.;
last admission a half-hour before closing. Closed Dec–mid-Feb.
Pump Room
The Pump Room overlooks the Roman baths, and it was here in the late
18th century that the fashionable congregated to sip the waters. You can
enter and taste the supposedly healthful liquid for yourself (but it’s 
not Perrier). You can use the amusingly old-fashioned Pump Room 
for elevenses (morning coffee or tea), lunch, or afternoon tea, usually with
live musical accompaniment. Main courses go for £11 to £15 ($22–$30);
Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 339

fixed-price lunch or dinner ranges from £14.95 to £21 ($30–$42); and after-
noon tea for two costs £15.50 ($31).

Admission: Free. Open: Daily Mar–June and Sept–Oct 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., July–Aug
9:30 a.m.–10 p.m., Nov–Feb 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Roman Baths Museum
Ancient British tribes considered the hot, healing waters of Bath’s mineral
springs sacred, but the Romans built the enormous complex that forms
the nucleus of this subterranean museum, one of Bath’s most important
attractions. Upon entering, you take a portable, self-guided audio tour
keyed to everything on display, including the original Roman baths and
heating system; the tour is informative, well done, and fun for children and
adults. Give yourself about one hour to see the museum.
In July and August, you can visit the atmospheric Roman Baths Museum
at night with a torch (Britspeak for flashlight).

Cheltenham: A Little Bath
Like Bath, its more glamorous neighbor 64km (40 miles) to the south,
Cheltenham was once a spa town. Mineral springs were discovered in
1716, and people came to sip the healthy (but not very tasty) water. The
first pump room was installed in 1742, but Cheltenham didn’t become
fashionable until 1788, when George III came to take a five-week “course”
of the waters. The town still has its wide, leafy promenades; public gar-
dens; and pretty Regency-era architecture. Although technically falling

A new royal bath for Bath
Visitors to Bath can once again soak in the city’s famous warm, mineral-laden waters.
The newly opened Thermae Bath Spa, Hot Bath St. (% 01225/335-678; www.thermae
bathspa.com; see map p. 333) offers spa sessions in the New Royal Bath, a strik-
ing mixture of historic architecture and contemporary design just a few steps from the
ancient Roman baths. You can soak and swim in the Minerva Bath, a large open-air
pool on the roof with views over the city, or in the Cross Bath, a smaller open-air pool
where a 90-minute soak costs £12 ($24) and no reservation is required. All manner of
other spa treatments are available, from Vichy showers to facials. Check the Web site
for more info.

just outside the boundaries of the Cotswolds, Cheltenham is a good town
in which to base yourself for exploring the region. Here, you find plenty of
hotels, cafes, and some fine restaurants, plus good shopping and far fewer
tourists than in Bath. Considered the cultural center of the Cotswolds,
Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 341
Wells: England’s smallest (and prettiest)
cathedral city
Wells, less than an hour from Bath, is England’s smallest cathedral city, but what it
lacks in size it more than makes up for in picturesque charm. Dominating the town is
Wells Cathedral (% 01749/674-483; www.wellscathedral.org.uk), a stunning
example of Early English Gothic architecture, its facade decorated with six tiers of
medieval sculptures. The interior is notable for its 14th-century stained glass and for
the unique and strikingly beautiful inverted arches built in the 14th century to help sup-
port the weight of the central tower. You’ll better appreciate the history and architec-
tural details of the cathedral if you book one of the free, 45-minute guided tours
available every day except Sunday. Try to time your visit so that you can hear the
cathedral’s famous choir singing the afternoon service of Choral Evensong (Mon–Sat
5:15 p.m., Sun 3 p.m.). The history of this renowned choir goes back some 800 years,
and hearing it sing is an unforgettable experience. The cathedral is open daily from 
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Nov–Mar until 6 p.m.). Admission is free but a donation of £5 ($10) 
is suggested. The cathedral’s restaurant, built in one of the original stone cloisters, is
an affordable and atmospheric spot for coffee, lunch, or afternoon tea (open Mon–Sat
10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun Mar–Oct 1–5 p.m).
After visiting the cathedral, spend some time exploring its precincts, where you’ll find
the Vicar’s Close, a medieval street of houses constructed for the canons and cho-
risters, and rows of ancient almshouses built to house the poor and elderly. You can
also stroll through the grounds of the Bishop’s Palace, surrounded by a moat where
swans glide and ring a bell when they want to be fed, and visit the wells (natural
springs) that gave Wells its name. Pick up a copy of the self-guided Wells City Trail
map and walking tour from the Tourist Information Centre in the Town Hall, Market
Place (% 01749/252-552), open daily 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (winter 10 a.m.–4 p.m.).
Wells has a way of quietly casting a spell that may make you want to linger. If that hap-
pens, I recommend that you stay at The Swan Hotel, 11 Sadler St., Wells, Somerset
BA5 2RX (% 800-528-1234 in the U.S., or 01749/836-300; www.swanhotelwells.
co.uk), a 15th-century former coaching inn that backs onto the grounds of the cathe-
dral. Double rooms with breakfast in this cozy and atmospheric inn, now a Best
Western property, go for £134 to £170 ($268–$340). The Swan has a top-rated restau-
rant, or you can dine on fine international cuisine at Anton’s in The Crown Hotel, Market
Place (% 01749/679-792), where special fixed-price meals range from £9.50 to £12.50
($20–$25).
Buses operated by First (% 0870/608-2608; www.firstgroup.com) provide fre-
quent daily service from Bath to Wells. If you’re driving from Bath, take the A37 south
to Shepton Mallet, then A371 west to Wells.

Cheltenham hosts two major international events: the Cheltenham
Festival of Literature in May and the International Festival of Music in
early July (% 01242/227-979; www.cheltenhamfestivals.co.uk).
Getting to Cheltenham
Trains run frequently from London’s Paddington Station to Cheltenham
Spa, Cheltenham’s small train station. Some trains run direct; others
require a change at Swindon or Bristol Parkway. The trip on a direct train
takes two hours and costs about £45 ($90) for a round-trip. For train infor-
mation, call % 08457/484-950. The train station is about 1.6km (1 mile)
from the town center. You can walk everywhere or call a taxi (% 01242/
580-580). National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.
com) runs several buses a day from Victoria Coach Station in London to the
Royal Well bus station in the center of Cheltenham. The trip takes three to
five hours; round-trip fare costs about £25 ($50). National Express also
runs buses to Cheltenham from Oxford (a 90-minute trip) and Stratford-
upon-Avon (a one-hour trip). If you come by car, Cheltenham is close to
Junction 11 of the M5; the town is 66km (41 miles) west of Oxford on A40.
Traveling among the local villages
You can get from Cheltenham to several of the Cotswolds villages on
buses; ask for the pamphlet “Getting There by Public Transportation” 
in the Cheltenham tourist office (see the following section). Pulhams
Coaches (% 01451/820-369) is the area’s most useful bus service, run-
ning daily between Cheltenham and Bourton-on-the-Water (see the section
“Bourton-on-the-Water: Bridges on the Windrush,” later in this chapter).
Finding information and taking a tour of Cheltenham
The Tourist Information Centre, 77 Promenade (% 01242/522-878;
www.visitcheltenham.gov.uk), has many useful brochures on the
town and Cotswolds region. You can book accommodations in the office
or by calling % 01242/517-110. The center is open Monday to Saturday
from 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.
From late June through mid-September, the Tourist Information Centre
offers guided walking tours of Regency-era Cheltenham, pointing out the
best of the town’s fine architecture and floral decorations. The tours
depart at 11 a.m. Monday to Friday, last about one-and-a-quarter hours,
and cost £3 ($6).

Dining in Cheltenham
Cheltenham has several good restaurants. Here are three of the best.
Brasserie Blanc
$$–$$$$
FRENCH
A stylish cafe/restaurant that welcomes kids (and has a kids’ menu),
Brasserie Blanc is the best place in Cheltenham for French food. The nice
bar menu includes items such as country pâté, salads, and hearty soups,
or you can dine in the more formal restaurant. For a main course, try
seared salmon trout fillet, lamb’s liver, roast duck breast, or slow-cooked
beef and red wine. On weekends, the brasserie is open all day, so you can
stop in for a morning espresso and croissant.
In Macdonald Queen’s Hotel, The Promenade. % 01242/266-800. Reservations
required on weekends. Main courses: £9.50–£18 ($20–$36), fixed-price lunch or
dinner: £11.50–£15 ($23–$30). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–3 p.m. and 6–

Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 343

The Daffodil
$$–$$$
MODERN BRITISH
This very hip restaurant was created from an Art Deco movie palace and
looks like the gleaming set of a Busby Berkeley musical. The food is good
but not surprising, and sometimes the ambience trumps the meal. For
main courses, you may find lamb cutlets, wild mushroom risotto, or
chicken and black pudding terrine.
18–20 Suffolk Parade. % 01242/700-055. Reservations recommended for dinner. Main
courses: £11–£17 ($22–$34); fixed-price meals: £12–£30 ($24–$60). AE, DC, MC, V.
Open: Mon–Sat noon–2:30 p.m. and 6:30–10 p.m.
The Retreat
$
INTERNATIONAL
The Retreat’s been around since 1981 and is one of the most popular spots
in town for lunch (the restaurant becomes a bar at night). You can order
a simple sandwich or something much more substantial from a menu that
changes every day. You can always order fish, pasta, and steak; the restau-
rant doesn’t fat-fry anything. The place also has a nice courtyard garden.
10–11 Suffolk Parade. % 01242/235-436. Main courses: £7–£13 ($14–$26). AE, DC,
MC, V. Open: Meals served Mon–Sat noon–2:15 p.m.
Exploring Cheltenham
The main sights in Cheltenham serve as pleasant reminders of a genteel,
bygone era. You won’t find anything truly extraordinary here, however,
so you may want to save your valuable time for exploring the nearby
Cotswolds villages, such as Bourton-on-the-Water, Upper and Lower
Slaughter, Broadway, or Chipping Campden. (I detail all these villages
later in this chapter.) In less than two hours, you can see Cheltenham’s
main sights, all free, including:
 Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum, Clarence Street (% 01242/
237-431; www.cheltenhammuseum.org.uk): Notable for its collec-
tion of 19th-century Arts and Crafts furniture, silver, jewelry, ceram-
ics, carvings, and textiles. (Cheltenham was a center of the Arts
and Crafts movement started by William Morris.) You also find
exhibits on local history and a small 20th-century gallery with a
Stanley Spencer painting. The gallery and museum are open Monday
to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:20 p.m. A cafe is on site, open Monday
to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 Imperial Gardens: Cheltenham’s gardens often win first place in
the national “Britain in Bloom” contest. The gardens are in an open
square and seasonally planted. To reach them, walk south from the
Tourist Information Centre on Promenade until the street becomes
Montpellier Walk.
Part VI: England’s Heartland 
344

 The Pittville Pump Room, Pittville Park (% 01242/523-852): The
Pump Room opened in 1830 and remains the city’s most notable
remnant of spa days, when health-conscious people came to Chel-
tenham to sip the alkaline water (for the digestion), take carriage rides
(for the air), and promenade (for the exercise). Inside the Pump Room
is a ballroom and an area where you can taste the water (the only nat-
ural, consumable alkaline waters in Great Britain). On Sunday from the
end of May until the end of September, the Pump Room is open for
lunch and afternoon cream teas, accompanied by classical music.
Shopping in Cheltenham
Cheltenham is a regional hub, so you find many appealing shops.
Antique stores cluster in the Suffolk quarter along Suffolk Road, Great
Norwood Street, and Suffolk Parade. You can find boutiques, art gal-
leries, and crafts and specialty shops in the Montpellier quarter along
Montpellier Walk and the Promenade.
Bourton-on-the-Water: Bridges on 
the Windrush
Like other villages in the Cotswolds, Bourton-on-the-Water grew rich
from the wool trade during the medieval era. But its history actually
dates to Roman times, when the town served as an outpost along the
Fosse Way, a strategic Roman road that cut across England from the
North Sea to St. George’s Channel. (Today, the road is A429.) The “water”
in the village’s name is the River Windrush, which flows gently through
the village’s heart, its narrow channel lined with low, graceful stone
bridges. Virtually all the village buildings are made of a local honey-
colored stone that gives off a soft, mellow glow. When the wool trade
ended, Bourton became a forgotten backwater, which helped preserve
its wealth of medieval buildings. Today, this town, with an almost end-
less succession of shops, tearooms, and tourist attractions, is perhaps
the most commercialized of the Cotswolds villages. You probably want
to visit during spring or fall, avoiding the summer influx of tourists. The
Tourist Information Centre is on Victoria Street (% 01451/820-211).
Getting to Bourton-on-the-Water
By car from Cheltenham, 24km (15 miles) to the southeast, take A40. 
The village doesn’t have parking; you find car parks on Station Road 
and Rissington Road. Trains run from London’s Paddington Station to
Moreton-in-Marsh; from Moreton-in-Marsh, you can take a Pulhams
Coaches (% 01451/820-369) coach 9.5km (6 miles) to Bourton. The
same company runs about four buses a day from Cheltenham.
Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 345

Stopping for a spot of tea in Bourton-on-the-Water
The Mad Hatter Tearoom, Victoria Street (% 01451/821-508), serves
hot meals all day, including fish and chips, for about £6 ($12); cream teas
cost £3.50 ($7).
Exploring Bourton-on-the-Water
Many people come here just to stroll leisurely through the village, shop,
and have an afternoon cream tea. If you’re looking for additional activi-
ties, check out these attractions:
 Birdland Park & Gardens, Rissington Road (% 01451/820-480;
www.birdland.co.uk): This series of aviaries has some 1,200 birds
representing over 350 species, including penguins, cranes, storks,
and waterfowl. You find a picnic area, cafe, and children’s play-
ground. Admission costs £5.25 ($11) for adults, £4.25 ($8.50) for
seniors, and £3.25 ($6.50) for children 4 to 14. Birdland is open
daily April through October from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and November
through March from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Cotswold Motoring Museum and Toy Collection, The Old Mill 
(% 01451/821-255; www.cotswold-motor-museum.co.uk): Housed
in an 18th-century water mill, this museum displays a collection 
of vintage cars, toys, motorbikes, advertising signs, and nostalgic
memorabilia. Admission costs £3.60 ($7.25) for adults and £2.30
($4.50) for children. It’s open daily early February to early
December from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 The Cotswold Perfumery, Victoria Street (% 01451/820-698;
www.cotswoldperfumery.co.uk): This perfume factory, one of
only three in Europe to manufacture and sell its own perfumes, has
an on-site shop. Half-hour tours of the facility, including the com-
pounding room, perfume laboratory, and perfume garden, cost £5
($10) for adults and £3 ($6) for seniors and children. Call or stop 
in to reserve a spot on the tour. The perfumery is open daily from
9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.).
 The Cotswold Pottery, Clapton Row (% 01451/820-173): This
small country pottery exhibits and sells hand-thrown pots of excep-
tional quality. Hours are Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m. and Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 The Model Village at the Old New Inn, High Street (% 01451/820-
467): Opened in 1937, this miniature re-creation of the village remains
the town’s most popular attraction. Local stone was used to re-create
a pint-size version of the entire village of Bourton-on-the-Water; you
can walk through and see everything at one-ninth its actual height.
Kids get a kick out of feeling like a giant. Admission costs £2.75 ($5.50)
for adults and £2 ($4) for children. Summer hours are daily from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; in winter, it’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 St. Lawrence’s Church: In the center of the village, this church was
constructed in the 12th century. The tower dates from 1784.

Upper Slaughter and Lower Slaughter: 
Quiet and Atmospheric
Just 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) northwest of Bourton-on-the-Water sits Lower
Slaughter, the prettiest village in the Cotswolds. With the River Eye run-
ning through it, Lower Slaughter is a picture of quiet, commercial-free
elegance. There’s really nothing to “do” here except stroll through the
peaceful country lanes with their stone houses. You can stop in at The
Old Mill, a working mill on Mill Lane (% 01451/820-052), and have tea
in its riverside tearoom. The mill is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in
the summer and until 4 p.m. in the winter.
If you fall under the spell of Lower Slaughter, you can stay here — in 
a pretty place that costs a pretty penny. A double room with breakfast 
at the Washbourne Luxury Country House Hotel, Lower Slaughter,
Gloucestershire GL54 2HS (% 01451/822-143; www.washbourne
court.co.uk), goes for £225 to £325 ($450–$650).
A 1.6km (1-mile) country footpath known as Warden’s Way connects
Lower Slaughter with Upper Slaughter, the next village. A leisurely walk
between the two takes about an hour each way. The well-marked foot-
path skirts the edge of the River Eye, passing meadows with grazing
sheep and old cottages surrounded by gardens. (The trail actually begins
in Bourton-on-the-Water, along the ancient Roman footpath known as the
Fosse Way.) Upper Slaughter is a small, peaceful, commercial-free village
where you can stroll and savor the Olde English atmosphere.
Broadway: Village Shopping
Located 29km (18 miles) northeast of Cheltenham, Broadway is a picture-
perfect Cotswold village. Saxons first settled the village in the sixth cen-
tury. In the 16th century, Broadway became an important stagecoach
stop. During the Victorian age, Broadway’s charm and tranquillity drew
painters and writers. Today, visitors come to bask in the ambience of 
the golden-yellow stone buildings, which mostly date from the 16th cen-
tury through Georgian times. Broadway doesn’t have the kind of tourist
attractions that Bourton-on-the-Water has, but day-trippers still pack the
village during the summer tourist season. Visitors come here to stroll,
shop, and have lunch or afternoon tea. High Street has so many upscale
shops that you sometimes hear it called “the Bond Street of the
Cotswolds” (a reference to London’s chic shopping street).
Getting to Broadway
Broadway is 93km (58 miles) north of Bath and 24km (15 miles) southwest
of Stratford-upon-Avon. Trains run daily from London’s Paddington Station
to Moreton-in-Marsh, 13km (8 miles) away; call % 08457/484-950 for train
information. A taxi can take you from Moreton-in the-Marsh to Broadway;
call Bourton (% 01481/820-972) or Shipston (% 01608/661-592).
Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 347

Finding information about Broadway
The small Tourist Information Centre, 1 Cotswold Court (% 01386/
852-937), is open February through December, Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m.
Staying in Broadway
You can find one lodging option in the village at the 16th-century Lygon
Arms, High Street, Broadway, Worcestershire WR12 7DU (% 01386/852-
255; www.thelygonarms.co.uk). Doubles in this full-service luxury
hotel go for £119 to £319 ($238–$638). The 69-room hotel has acres of
grounds, a health spa, and every amenity you can think of.
If you want to stay in an exceptionally beautiful house in the Cotswold
countryside, try Mill Hay, Snowshill Road, Broadway, Worcestershire
WR12 7JS (% 01386/852-498; www.millhay.co.uk). The house, with
only three guest rooms, is a spacious, golden-stoned Queen Anne with
three acres of extraordinary gardens. Doubles with English breakfast go
for £140 to £180 ($280–$360).
Stopping for a spot of tea in Broadway
For an informal lunch or old-fashioned cream tea in Broadway, try Small
Talk, 32 High St. (% 01386/853-676; www.broadway-cotswolds.co.
uk/smtalk.html), next to the Lygon Arms hotel. The cafe is open daily
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Lunch costs a reasonable £5 to £8 ($10–$16); a
cream tea with homemade scones goes for £4.50 ($9). Buy sandwiches
here if you want to have a picnic. Small Talk rents out six charming guest
rooms, all with private bathrooms; prices start at £50 ($100).
Exploring Broadway and vicinity
Soak up the atmosphere of this Cotswold village by taking a leisurely
stroll along High Street. Along the way, you pass little antiques shops,
boutiques, galleries, and pubs. You may want to spend a few minutes
looking at the antique toys and 100-year-old teddy bears on display in
the Broadway Teddy Bear Museum, 76 High St. (% 01386/858-323). In
an 18th-century shop called Broadway Bears and Dolls, the museum is
open Tuesday through Sunday and costs £2.50 ($5) for adults and £1.75
($3.50) for seniors and children under 14.
If you want to savor a bit of Elizabethan ambience, stop in for a meal, a
drink, or afternoon tea at the half-timbered Lygon Arms (% 01386/852-
255; see the section “Staying in Broadway,” earlier in this chapter). This
wonderfully atmospheric hotel, in business since 1532, has crackling
fires, exposed beams, and paneled lounges.
On Snowshill Road, 1.6km (1 mile) south of town, sits St. Eadburgha’s,
a lovely medieval church built of the characteristic local stone. Another
.5km (1⁄2-mile) brings you to a local landmark and one of England’s out-
standing viewpoints: Broadway Tower (% 01386/852-390) was built in
Part VI: England’s Heartland 
348

the early 19th century as a folly (a picturesque building evoking an earlier
age) high atop Broadway Hill. From the hilltop, you can see 12 surrounding
counties. The tower and surrounding land are now a country park. In the
tower, you can find exhibits connected with its past as a retreat for William
Morris, founder of the Arts and Crafts movement; red deer and Cotswold
sheep roam the grounds, and children can visit an animal park and play-
ground. Stop in at the restaurant on the premises, or bring a picnic. Admis-
sion to the park is free. The Tower and park are open daily April through
October from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; winter hours are daily 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The countryside to the northwest of Broadway, near the town of Evesham,
is known as the Vale of Evesham. The area has some of England’s most
productive fruit-growing land. For a few weeks between mid-March and
mid-May, the roadsides blaze with the soft pinks of cherry, apple, and
pear blossoms, and the white of flowering plums.
Chipping Campden: Picture Perfect
Have your camera ready as you enter this village, because you can see a
picture everywhere you turn. Chipping Campden was a wool town in the
Middle Ages. Here, you find thatched-roof cottages with walls of mellow
yellow Cotswold stone and beautiful High Street with Tudor and
Elizabethan buildings.
The Tourist Information Centre, 2 Rosary Ct., High Street (% 01386/
841-206), is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting to Chipping Campden
By car from Broadway, take B463 east 6.5km (4 miles); from Cheltenham,
32km (20 miles) to the west, head north on A435 and A46 and then turn
southeast on A44. The closest train service is from London’s Paddington
Station to Moreton-in-Marsh, 11km (7 miles) away; from Moreton-on-Marsh,
you can take a taxi to Chipping Campden. Call Bourton (% 01481/820-
972) to reserve a cab.
Staying and dining in Chipping Campden
Head to the Noel Arms Hotel, High Street, Chipping Campden, Glouces-
tershire GL55 6AT (% 01386/840-317; www.noelarmshotel.com), for a
fine meal and a comfortable bed. This 14th-century coaching inn has a
modern wing, but the original section retains many original features,
such as stone fireplaces and beamed ceilings. A double room with full
English breakfast costs £130 to £220 ($260–$440). You probably want to
make reservations for the restaurant, which offers a classy international
menu with meat, fish, and vegetarian choices. Lunches cost £16 to £18
($32–$36); fixed-price dinners go for £23 to £26 ($46–$52); and a sumptu-
ous afternoon cream tea served in one of the lounges costs £19 ($38).
For good, unfancy lunches and teas, try The Bantam Tea Rooms, also on
High Street (% 01386/840-386; www.thebantam.co.uk). A traditional
Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 349

lunch of cottage pie or steak and kidney pie costs about £6 ($12), and a
cream tea costs under £5 ($10). The place is open daily from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. (Sun from 11 a.m.). The Bantam also rents out charming, inexpen-
sive rooms nestled up under the eaves, all with private bathrooms; dou-
bles cost £75 ($150), full English breakfast included.
Exploring Chipping Campden
You can walk through the village and see everything in about 30 minutes.
First, at the north end of town, visit St. James’s Church, which prosper-
ous wool merchants built in the 15th century. The church is a fine exam-
ple of the Perpendicular Gothic style, a medieval building style in which
vertical lines dominate. Nearby is a grouping of medieval almshouses,
built to house six poor men and six poor women. High Street contains
many beautiful Cotswold stone buildings dating from the 14th to the
17th centuries. The imposing Market Hall was built in 1627 for the
town’s local produce market.

Kiftsgate Court and Hidcote 
Manor Gardens
The Cotswolds are blessed with many beautiful gardens, two of which, near Chipping
Campden and Broadway, you’ll want to see if you’re at all interested in English gar-
dens. The two gardens, Kiftsgate Court and Hidcote Manor, are only about a mile apart.
Just east of the village of Mickleton off the B4632 from Broadway, Kiftsgate Court
Gardens (% 01386/438-777; www.kiftsgate.co.uk) is the creation of three gen-
erations of women gardeners. Heather Muir started Kiftsgate in the 1920s. Her daugh-
ter, Diany Binny, added to the gardens in the 1950s. Diany’s daughter, Anne, now looks
after them. Kiftsgate was designed as a series of connecting gardens, each with its
own distinct character. The newest addition is a contemporary water garden. You can
get a light lunch or homemade tea from June to August. Admission costs £5.50 ($11)
for adults and £1.50 ($3) for children under 16. In April, August, and September, the
garden is open Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday from 2 to 6 p.m. In May, June, and
July, it’s open Saturday through Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m. Allow at least an hour.
One of the great gardens of England, Hidcote Manor (% 01386/438-333), lies 6.5km (4
miles) northeast of Chipping Campden and 14.5km (9 miles) south of Stratford-upon-
Avon. Set on 10 acres, Hidcote Manor is comparable in beauty, skill, and ingenuity to
Sissinghurst in Kent (see Chapter 15). In 1907, Major Lawrence Johnstone began to
create a series of hedged outdoor rooms linked by the corridors of its main vista. The
rooms are furnished with all sorts of topiary and an amazing variety of plantings that
add color, texture, and contrast. Give yourself at least an hour to see this garden, a
National Trust property. A restaurant serves lunch from noon to 2:30 p.m. and teas from
3 to 5:30 p.m. Admission is £7.25 ($15) for adults, £3.70 ($7.50) for children 5–15, and £18
($36) for families (2 adults, 2 children). The gardens are open mid-March through
October Saturday through Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 5 p.m. in Oct; also
open Fri in July and Aug). Access for visitors with disabilities is limited in parts.

Cirencester: Market Town with a Roman Past
Regarded as the unofficial capital of the Cotswolds, Cirencester (pro-
nounced Sih-ren-ses-ter) is a bustling market town 26km (16 miles) south
of Cheltenham. During the Middle Ages, Cirencester was a center of the
great Cotswold wool industry. But long before that, in Roman times,
Cirencester was the second-largest town in Britain. Known then as
Corinium Dobunnorum, the town stood at the crossroads of five major
roads. Like Bath and Cheltenham, Cirencester makes for a good touring
base in the Cotswolds. Londoners in search of weekend and summer
homes in the Cotswolds have recently “discovered” the town, and many
good restaurants and quality shops have opened.
Getting to Cirencester
The nearest train station is at Kemble, 6.5km (4 miles) to the southwest.
Trains run from London’s Paddington Station; it’s an 80-minute trip, which
may involve a transfer at Swindon, depending on the train that you take.
For train information, call % 08457/484-950. Bus no. 51 runs to Cirences-
ter from Cheltenham via Stroud Valley Monday through Saturday. National
Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) offers direct
service from London’s Victoria Coach Station; the trip takes two hours
and 15 minutes.
Finding information about Cirencester
The Tourist Information Centre, Corn Hall, Market Place (% 01285/654-
180), sells an inexpensive town map with a walking tour. The center also
has a room-booking service. From April through September, the center 
is open Monday from 9:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Tuesday through Saturday
from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
You can exchange money at Lloyds Bank on Castle Street.
Staying in Cirencester
Cirencester doesn’t offer many hotel or B&B choices. Here are two options.

rooms come in all shapes and sizes, and they’re furnished in traditional

Exploring Cirencester
Two millennia ago, only London was larger and more powerful than
Cirencester, then called Corinium Dobunnorum. The town was a Roman
administrative center for the area around the southern Cotswold hills,
one of the most prosperous regions in Roman Britain. You can still see
the remains of the Roman amphitheatre, constructed in the second cen-
tury A.D. to accommodate some 8,000 spectators. The entrance is on
Cotswold Avenue, on the south side of town (free admission).
Reopened in 2004 after a two-year, multimillion-pound refurbishment, the
Corinium Museum, Park Street (% 01285/655-611), is one of England’s
best small museums. The museum focuses entirely on the history of
Cirencester from the Iron Age through the medieval wool era. In the
antiquities on display, the Roman era predominates. You can see an out-
standing collection of mosaic floors and re-created Roman-era interiors.
In the dramatic Anglo-Saxon Gallery, the museum has re-created the
grave of a wealthy sixth-century Anglo-Saxon princess. You can easily
while away an hour here. The museum is open Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. Admission is £3.90
($8) for adults and £2 ($4) for students and children.
If you look south across Park Street from the museum, you see an enor-
mous yew hedge, reputedly the highest in Europe. Planted in 1720, the
hedge is now 40 feet high. The yew hedge is part of Cirencester Park, the
Earl of Bathurst’s 3,000-acre estate designed by the poet Alexander Pope.
The park is open to the public; use the entrance gates on Cecily Hill.
Cirencester’s importance as a wool town during the Middle Ages reflected
in the size of its Parish Church of St. John the Baptist (% 01285/653-142), 
Chapter 20: Bath and the Best of the Cotswolds 353

which dominates the Market Place. Special details include the fan-
vaulted porch and a rare 15th-century pre-Reformation pulpit. The
church displays a silver-gilt cup made for Anne Boleyn in 1535.
Shopping in Cirencester
Cirencester is a local market town, which means that people come from
miles around to do their shopping. A street market, one of the oldest in
the country, is held on Monday and Friday in the central Market Place in
front of the parish church. On Friday, you can shop in an antiques
market in Corn Hall next to the Tourist Information Centre; on Saturday,
you can find a crafts market in the same space.
If you’re looking for antiques or local crafts, you can also try these shops:
 Brewery Arts Centre, Brewery Court (% 01285/657-181): Resident
craft workers sell everything from baskets to handmade porcelain,
glass, jewelry, and leather goods. A good cafe is on the premises.
 Rankine Taylor Antiques, 34 Dollar St. (% 01285/652-529): This
shop sells silver, 17th- to 19th-century glass, and furniture.
 William H. Stokes, The Cloister, 6/8 Dollar St. (% 01285/653-907):
This place specializes in furniture, tapestries, and items from the
16th and 17th centuries.
If you need to pick up some swanky groceries, head to the Cirencester
Waitrose, an upscale supermarket on Sheep Street. Gloucestershire
Royals, such as Princess Anne (who lives in the countryside nearby) and
Princess Michael of Kent, have been seen stocking up in this store.
Admission is £5.45 ($11) for adults, £3.15 ($6.25) for children 5 to 15, and
£14 ($28) for families (2 adults, 2 children); audio tours cost £1.50 ($3). The
site is open daily March to mid-November (Mar 11 a.m.–4 p.m.; Apr–Oct
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov 11 a.m.–4 p.m.). Call % 01242/890-250 for more infor-
mation. To get there from Cirencester, head north on A429, turn west at
Fossebridge, and follow the signs for 5km (3 miles) to Chedworth.
Part VI: England’s Heartland 
354
Chedworth Roman villa
You can see the remains of one of the largest and finest Roman villas in Britain about
a half-hour’s drive from Cirencester. The villa sits at the end of a green, wooded valley.
The National Trust administers the site, which includes the excavated remains of a
water shrine, two bathhouses, and even a lavatory. Shedlike roofs protect fine fourth-
century mosaics. Start your tour with the short introductory video and then wander at
will. No one knows if this complex of buildings was a religious center or a giant Roman
farm. Maybe it was both. You can see the entire site in under an hour.

Part VII
Way Up North

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces you to Yorkshire and Cumbria, large
counties “way up north,” close to Scotland. Scenically,
the region has a quite different appeal from central and south-
ern England, which is softer and greener. Gray-stone villages
and mile upon mile of open moorland, rocky shoreline, small
lakes, and treeless mountains ﬁll the ﬂinty northern land-
scape. Yorkshire and Cumbria are places of rugged character
and independence. Local accents are sometimes closer to
Scots than to the “Oxbridge” accents heard in the south.
Chapter 21 covers Yorkshire in the northeast. York, with its
vast cathedral and medieval walls, is one of England’s great
cities. Magniﬁcent Castle Howard and Scarborough, a fun-
loving resort town on the North Sea, are close by. In this chap-
ter, I also tell you about Yorkshire’s two national parks: North
York Moors, extending over a vast tract of heather-covered
moorland and North Sea coastline, and Yorkshire Dales, a
peaceful world of rolling farmland and traditional villages.
Many people forever associate the Yorkshire moors with the
novels Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. Haworth, where you
can visit the home of the authors Emily and Charlotte Brontë,
is a literary shrine second only to Stratford-upon-Avon.
Chapter 22 visits Cumbria, also known as the Lake District, in
the northwest corner of England. Lake District National Park,
which encompasses the entire county, protects a hauntingly
beautiful world of lakes, bracken-covered mountains, and
lovely stone villages. Tourists from around the world come to
this remote part of England to hike, boat on Lake Windermere,
bask in the glorious scenery, and visit the homes of William
Wordsworth in Grasmere and Beatrix Potter near Lake
Windermere. Keswick, on a pretty lake called Derwentwater,
is another Lake District town that’s well worth visiting.

Chapter 21
Yorkshire
In This Chapter
 Visiting York and its great cathedral
 Having some fun in Scarborough
 Seeing North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales National Parks
 Stopping at the Brontës’ Haworth
A
land of great and varied contrasts, Yorkshire is blessed with some
of the most dramatic landscapes in England, and some of the most
tranquil. (See the “Yorkshire” map on p. 358.) This northern region’s
windswept moors, sheltered dales, rocky coastline, and rushing streams —
or becks, as people call them up north — draw walkers from around the
world to the countryside. But Yorkshire was an industrial powerhouse
during the 19th century, and many of its cities and towns are pretty grim
reminders of those Industrial Revolution days. (Don’t worry; I’m not
taking you to any industrial heritage towns.) In Yorkshire, you can attune
your ears to the broad, Scotslike accents of the North.
I begin this chapter with York, Yorkshire’s most visited city. Ringed by
medieval walls, with a stupendous cathedral and winding medieval
streets, York is one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities in
England. From York, you can make an easy trip by train and taxi to the
splendor of Castle Howard and the haunting Eden Camp, a World War II
prisoner-of-war camp. Scarborough, on the 160km (100-mile) stretch of
Yorkshire coast, is a resort town on the North Sea, also easily accessible
by train from York. If you want to explore Yorkshire’s two national parks
and the Brontë country in and around Haworth, you may want to rent a
car in York rather than depend on public transportation. North York
Moors National Park is known for its unspoiled coastline and vast
stretches of heather-crowned moorland. Farther inland to the west lies
Yorkshire Dales National Park, with its old stone villages, rolling farm-
land, and dramatic limestone formations. This chapter ends in Haworth,
where the Brontës created their evocative masterpieces of moorland
passion, Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.

York: Ancient Walls and Snickelways
York is only 314km (195 miles) north of London, close enough for a day
trip but worlds apart in character. York is the capital of the North and
one of England’s most historic cities. Under the Romans, who built a
major fort here, the city was known as Eboracum. For hundreds of years
after that, York was a thriving Viking settlement called Jorvik. And
finally, after the Norman Conquest, it became York, queen of the North.
Interesting museums, historic buildings of all kinds, good hotels, excel-
lent shops, and fine restaurants make York a popular tourist city, and
rightly so. Enormous York Minster, the largest Gothic structure north of
the Alps, dominates the city. And, amazingly, the old town’s 800-year-old
walls and fortified gateways still girdle the old town center.
York is considered the best-preserved medieval walled city in England.
(A bloody history reputedly makes York the most haunted city in

England, too.) You can soak up the city’s history while exploring its
maze of ancient streets and snickelways (hidden alleyways). You can get
everywhere on foot and see many attractions in just a day. York makes a
good base for exploring the rest of Yorkshire, with Castle Howard just a
few miles to the east.
Getting to York
Direct trains leave frequently throughout the day from London’s King’s
Cross Station for the two-hour trip to York’s Rougier Street Station. The
round-trip fare costs £75 ($150), but much lower fares often are available
on this route. For train schedules and information, call National Rail
Enquiries at % 08457/484-950. The train station is a five-minute walk
from York’s historic center. Buses cost you considerably less than trains
(about £30/$60 round-trip) but take a minimum of five hours. National
Express (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) has service
throughout the day from Victoria Coach Station in London. If you’re driv-
ing from London, take the M1 expressway north to Junction 45, east of
Leeds, and from there, continue northeast on A64 to York.
Renting a car or calling a taxi
You don’t need a car if you’re traveling to York by train and staying in
the city. But if you want to explore more of the fascinating Yorkshire
countryside, you can rent a car in York. Practical Car & Van Rental
(% 01904/624-828; www.practical.co.uk) has good rates, a city-
center location, and weekend specials. Hertz has an office on Station
Road, near the railway station (% 01904/612-586; www.hertz.com).
If you need a taxi, contact Station Taxis (% 01904/623-332).
Finding information about York
At both of the following places, you can get an inexpensive guidebook
with a map, book a room, and obtain information on guided tours:
 A convenient branch of the Tourist Information Centre (no phone)
is right in the train station. The office is open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer) and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (until 5 p.m. in summer).
 The main Tourist Information Centre, De Grey Rooms, Exhibition
Square (% 01904/550099; www.visityork.org), near York
Minster, has the same open hours as the train-station branch (see
preceding bullet).
Exchanging money and locating ATMs
Both Tourist Information Centres (see the preceding section) have a cur-
rency exchange. You can also try HSBC, 13 Parliament St. (% 01904/
884-001); and Royal Bank of Scotland, 6 Nessgate (% 01904/642-961).

Taking a tour in York
More guided tours are offered in York than in just about any other city in
England, excluding London. You can explore the city by foot, bus, or
boat. The city is small enough that you can easily get around and see
everything by yourself, but you may find a guided tour useful because
you can see parts of the town that you may otherwise miss.
During the summer, you can hire a horse-drawn carriage in front of 
the Dean Court Hotel near York Minster. A 15-minute ride around the

Boat tours
What could be more fun than cruising down the River Ouse through the
middle of England’s most historic walled city? Departing from the pier
below Lendal Bridge, York Boat (% 01904/647-204; www.yorkboat.co.
uk) provides a 45-minute tour with live commentary that nicely comple-
ments a walking tour. From mid-February through November, at least
four boats depart each day; you can buy your ticket on board. The tour
costs £7 ($14) for adults, £6 ($12) for seniors, £3.50 ($7) for children 5 to
15, and £20 ($40) for families (2 adults, 3 children).
Bus tours
City Sightseeing (% 01904/625-618) runs open-top, double-decker tour
buses on a circuit of all the main sights in York (one hour total). The
ticket, valid all day so you can hop on and off as you want, costs £9 ($18)
for adults, £7 ($14) for seniors and students, £4 ($8) for children 5 to 15,
and £20 ($40) for families (2 adults, 2 children). The buses run year-
round from about 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; you can get on at the train station
and buy your ticket from the driver.
Walking tours
Thumbs up to the York Association of Voluntary Guides (% 01904/
640-780) for its free two-hour guided tours of the city. The tours depart
daily at 10:15 a.m. year-round from Exhibition Square in the city center.
Additional tours start at 2:15 and 6:45 p.m. in summer. You don’t need to
make a reservation; just show up.
Yorkwalk (% 01904/622-303; www.yorkwalk.co.uk) offers a series of
two-hour walks on intriguing subjects on different days of the week. All
walks start at the Museum Gardens Gates on Museum Street just north
of Lendal Bridge; the cost is £5 ($10) for adults and £2 ($4) for children.
Essential York, Roman York, Romantic York, and the Jewish Heritage
Walk are some of the offerings; I’m sorry that I didn’t have time for the
Historic Toilet Tour. Call or visit the Web site to find out times and topics
or pick up the leaflet at the Tourist Information Centre.

Special events in York
York celebrates its Viking heritage with feasts, music, and pageantry during the Jorvik
Viking Festival(%01904/636-668), held in mid-February. The acclaimed York Early Music
Festival (% 01904/658-338; www.ncem.co.uk) has special programs at Easter and in
July. York has one of Europe’s most prestigious horse-racing courses; York Racecourse
(%01904/620-911; www.yorkracecourse.co.uk) holds meets from May to October.

Staying in York
The largest city in northern England, York has a fine array of hotels and
B&Bs. My recommended choices are listed here.
The Bar Convent
$
This convent building is an inexpensive, unusual, and convenient place to
stay. The accommodations are in a Georgian building on the corner of
Nunnery Lane and Blossom Street, a five-minute walk from the train sta-
tion. The seven rooms, refurbished in 2005, are comfortable but nothing
fancy; only one has a private bathroom. The convent, which houses a neo-
classical chapel and a museum, was founded in 1686 and was active as a
school until 1985. The on-site cafe serves inexpensive meals.

Dean Court Hotel
$$–$$$$
You can’t get any closer to York Minster than this full-service hotel almost
directly beneath the towers. The building, originally used to house clergy,
dates from 1850 and was converted into a 39-room hotel after World 
War I; it’s now part of the Best Western chain. The rooms are comfortable,
although some are quite small, and they’re decorated with traditional pat-
terned fabrics and wallpapers. The restaurant serves traditional English
and international fare at lunch and dinner.

elegant hotel close to the city walls and a few minutes’ walk from York
Minster. The 30 individually designed rooms use antique furniture and
convey a comfortable English charm. Bathrooms are nicely done. The hotel
offers room service and two good restaurants: The Ivy, serving classic
French and Modern British cuisine, is considered one of the best restaurants
in York; the Brasserie offers informal dining in the old brick vaulted cellars.

South of York
One of the country’s finest hotels sits in a 26-acre park 2.5km (11⁄2 miles)
south of York. Middlethorpe Hall is an elegant country house that was built
in 1699. It was the residence of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, a famous
diarist of the early 18th century. The hotel offers a high standard of per-
sonal service and comfort, and features beautifully restored rooms, lovely
gardens (with a 350-year-old cedar tree), a health spa, and a fine restau-
rant. Some of the 30 guest rooms are in the main house; others are in the
remodeled stable house. The furnishings are traditional, and each roomy
bathroom has a tub and shower. At dinner, served in the hall’s original pan-
eled dining room, men are requested to wear a jacket and tie.

in town (a ten-minute walk to York Minster or National Railway Museum)
and has ten nicely furnished bedrooms, all with private bathrooms. The
B&B is completely non-smoking. Children are welcome.

Dining in York
York suffers no shortage of good restaurants. Here are my recommen-
dations.
Chapter 21: Yorkshire 363

Betty’s
$–$$
TRADITIONAL ENGLISH/SWISS/TEAS
Founded in 1919, Betty’s is a wonderfully old-fashioned Art Nouveau 
tearoom–patisserie–restaurant. Sandwiches, salads, and a dozen or so hot
dishes, both fish and meat, are available. Specialties include smoked
salmon muffins, Yorkshire rarebit, locally made sausages, and haddock
and prawns in white-wine cream sauce. The pastries, all made according
to secret recipes, are superb. At the shop in front, you can buy specialties,
such as Yorkshire fat rascals: warm scones with citrus peels, almonds, and
cherries.

MODERN BRITISH/INTERNATIONAL
If you’re looking for atmosphere and good food, try this appealing restau-

Exploring York
York is a delightful city to explore, full of old streets, lanes, snickelways,
and many tourist attractions. Keep a map with you, because you can
easily get lost on the city’s medieval streets.
The City Walls and Micklegate Bar Museum
Almost 5km (3 miles) of medieval walls enclose the center of York. Fortified
gateways (or bars) still serve as entrances to the old part of town. A path
(open daily 8 a.m. to dusk) runs along the top of the walls, with plenty of
great views along the way. You find stairways up to the top of the walls at
the four gates.
Micklegate, the southern entry used by royalty, is a good place to start
your wall walk. Housed in the 800-year-old fortified tower, the tiny
Micklegate Bar Museum (% 01904/634-436) looks at the social 
history of the gate in a quirky, humorous light. From February through
October, the museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; in November and
December, it’s open weekends from 9 a.m. to dusk (closed in Jan).
Admission costs £1.50 ($3) for adults, £1 ($2) for seniors and students, and
50p ($1) for children 5 to 15. You can see it all in about 15 minutes.

Jorvik Viking Centre
If you want to revisit the Viking Age, hop into one of the time cars here to
be transported back to A.D. 948, when Eric Bloodaxe was king and York was
Jorvik, a thriving Viking port and trading town. The scenes you see — of
village life, market stalls, crowded houses, and the wharf — are meticu-
lous re-creations based on archaeological finds in this area; even the heads
and faces of the animatronic characters you see were modeled on Viking
skulls. You can see artifacts unearthed on this site on display. Give your-
self about an hour.

children 5–15. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (winter until 4 p.m.).
Merchant Adventurers’ Hall
In the medieval era, guilds ran English towns. This 14th-century stone and
half-timbered guildhall belonged to York’s most powerful guild, the
Merchant Adventurers (it controlled trade into and out of the city). This
building, one of the largest and best-preserved guildhalls in the country,
has a great hall for business, a hospital for charitable work, and a chapel
for worship. Allow half an hour for a tour with an audio guide.
See map p. 360. Fossgate. % 01904/654-818. Admission: £2.50 ($5) adults, £2 ($4) sen-
iors and students, £1 ($2) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Sept Mon–Thurs 9 a.m.–5 p.m.,
Fri–Sat 9 a.m.–3:30 p.m., Sun noon to 4 p.m.; Oct–Mar Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
National Railway Museum
As you probably guessed, this museum is devoted to England’s railroad
system. The great exhibits appeal to both adults and children. The earli-
est train cars on display date from the 1840s and look like stagecoaches on
tracks. You can peek into the windows of private royal coaches, from
Queen Victoria’s of 1869, with its bulky furniture (the engineer had to 
stop when the queen wanted to move from one car to the next), to 
Queen Elizabeth’s streamlined, functional carriage, used until 1977. You
see a replica of the first steam locomotive (1830) and a display of the
Eurostar high-speed train. You need at least an hour for a thorough visit

York’s big wheel
York’s newest attraction is a giant ferris wheel located at the National Railway
Museum. Rising 54 meters (114 feet), the Yorkshire Wheel offers great views of the
city center, York Minister, and the River Ouse from enclosed, air-conditioned pods simi-
lar to those of the British Airways London Eye observation wheel (see Chapter 12). The
wheel operates daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. in summer). Cost is £6 ($12) for
adults, £4 ($8) for children.

The Shambles
Until 150 years ago, The Shambles was a street where butchers displayed
their finest cuts in open windows on wide shelves called shammels. Today,
this narrow, winding lane, with buildings so close that they shut out the
light, is England’s most famous medieval street. Gift shops have replaced
the butcher shops, so you can get in a bit of retail therapy as you stroll. No.
35 The Shambles is a shrine to St. Margaret Clitheroe, a butcher’s wife exe-
cuted during the Reformation for hiding Catholic priests in her attic; she
was canonized in 1970.
Treasurer’s House
This elegant town house in Minster Yard was originally the home of the
Treasurer of York Minster. Built in 1620, the house was extensively remod-
eled during the Victorian era by an eccentric Yorkshireman who cared so
passionately about interior décor that he threatened to return to haunt
the place if anyone ever moved any of his furniture. The furniture hasn’t
been moved, and the house features beautiful period rooms with collec-
tions of 17th- and 18th-century furniture, glass, clocks, and china. You can
see the entire collection in about 30 minutes. Stroll through the pretty
walled garden, even if you don’t visit the house. The tearoom downstairs
is a good place for lunch or tea.

children 5–15. Open: Mid-Mar to Oct Sat–Thurs 11 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Nov 11 a.m.–3 p.m.;
closed Dec to mid-Mar.
York Art Gallery
The city’s art museum, with freshly refurbished galleries and a cafe, is in an
Italian Renaissance-style building completed in 1879. The collections on
view span seven centuries of Western European painting and include pic-
tures by Parmigianino, Bellotto, Lely, and Reynolds, and a small collection

Ghostly legions
In 1953, apprentice heating engineer Harry Martindale was working in the basement
of the Treasurer’s House when he heard what sounded like marching feet. As he
watched in amazement, a battalion of ghostly Roman soldiers marched right through
the cellar. As it turns out, the Treasurer’s House was built over the main Roman road.
You can check out the haunted cellar of Treasurer’s House yourself on one of the daily
cellar tours, which cost £2 ($4).

York Castle Museum
You can see 400 years of social history at York’s top museum, which hap-
pens to be England’s most popular folk museum. Using a treasure trove of
now-vanished everyday objects, the exhibitions re-create slices of life from
past historical eras. The museum took over York’s 200-year-old prison
buildings, with graffiti still on the walls of the dingy cells. You can walk
down a reconstruction of Kirkgate, a cobbled Victorian shopping street;
see a Jacobean dining room; visit a moorland cottage and a gypsy cara-
van; and call in at a Victorian police station and an Edwardian pub. You
can check out the Jane Austen Costume Collection’s fashion and fabrics.
Kids love the giant dollhouses. Allow at least an hour.

York Minster
Awesome York Minster, the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe,
was built between 1220 and 1472. Architecturally, it spans the entire range
of Gothic style: Early English (1220–1260), Decorated (1280–1350), and
Perpendicular (1361–1472). The chief cathedral in the north of England,
York Minster contains half of all the medieval stained glass in the country.
The Five Sisters’ Window from 1260 is the oldest complete window in the
Minster. (Minster, by the way, means a church, usually with cathedral
status, attached to a monastery.) The Great West Window, painted in 1338
and set in heart-shaped tracery, is known as the “Heart of Yorkshire.”
Above the south door, a magnificent Rose Window (1500) commemorates
the union of the royal houses of Lancaster and York. Painted in 1310, the
Jesse Window in the south nave depicts Jesus’s family tree. The Minster’s
Decorated Gothic nave (the main central space in the interior), begun in
1291 and finished in the 1350s, is one of Europe’s widest. A 15th-century
Choir Screen decorated with statues of 15 kings of England, from William I
(the Conqueror) to Henry VI, separates the nave from the choir. In the
south transept, you can descend into the Undercroft (the rooms under
the church), where excavations have revealed the Roman basilica (an
assembly hall, not a Christian church) that stood here nearly 2,000 years
ago. You can take a well-designed “time walk” to see Roman, Anglo-Saxon,
and Norman remains. The walk leads to the 12th-century Crypt and the
Treasury, where silver plate and other church treasures are on display.
From the nave, a separate entrance leads to the 13th-century Chapter
House, filled with fine stone carvings and medieval glass. You can also
ascend the minster’s soaring tower for a bird’s-eye view of York and the

the cathedral.

sion: Everything ticket (Minster, undercroft, treasury, crypt, tower) £9 ($18) adults,
£7.50 ($15) seniors and students, £3 ($6) children. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun

Yorkshire Museum
The Yorkshire Museum is somewhat old-fashioned and heavy on the text
panels, but if you start in the Roman section and walk through to the end,
you get a sound presentation of Yorkshire’s history from two millennia ago
through the 16th century. You can view elegant Roman jewelry, mosaics,
and Anglo-Saxon silver. Viking treasures include swords and battleaxes.
The Middleham Jewel, a 15th-century pendant decorated with a large sap-
phire, was found in 1985 in North Yorkshire. The museum lies in 10 acres of
landscaped gardens amid the ruins of St Mary’s Abbey, once the wealthiest

Shopping in York
High-end shops, including designer clothes boutiques and fine jewelry
stores, are on Swinegate, a street that was once — you guessed it — a
hog market. The Quarter area around Swinegate is known for its inde-
pendent, one-of-a-kind shops. At Newgate Market, between Parliament
Street and The Shambles (% 01904/551-355), you can find York’s
biggest open-air market, open daily with more than 100 stalls selling
crafts, clothes, candles — you name it. If you’re looking for antiques,
head over to The Red House Antiques Centre, 1 Duncombe Place (the
street runs south from York Minster; % 01904/637-000), where more
than 60 dealers sell quality, time-touched merchandise in a beautiful
Georgian building. The Miniature Scene, 42 Fossgate (% 01904/
638-265) is one of the U.K.’s biggest and best-stocked specialist doll-
house accessories stores.
Stepping out at night in York
York has an active nightlife scene, especially during the summer, when
the air is warmer and the light lingers longer. You may want to take a
special nighttime tour or head out to a pub.
Ghost walks
Apparently, plenty of supernatural activity takes place in York, which
some claim is England’s most haunted city. Evening ghost walks, with
entertaining commentary and sometimes a bit of spookery thrown in,
are a regular year-round industry. You have several tours from which to
choose. You can buy your tickets on the spot. Tours cost £4 to £5 ($8–$10)
for adults, £2 to £3 ($4–$6) for seniors, students, and children 5 to 15.
 The Ghost Hunt of York (% 01904/608-700): “Andy Dextrous,”
ghost hunter, leads this fun, one-hour walk and performance. 
Walks leave nightly at 7:30 from The Shambles, York’s medieval
street.
 The Ghost Trail (% 01904/633-276): You get more traditional
ghost-storytelling on this walk, which leaves nightly at 7:30 from
the front entrance of York Minster.
 Original Ghost Walk of York (% 01759/373-090): This walk began
in 1973 and features really good storytelling, exploring the area’s
folklore, legend, and dreams. Walks leave nightly at 8 from The
King’s Arms Pub, Ouse Bridge.

The best pubs and bars
The Cross Keys, Goodramgate (% 01904/686-941), close to York 
Minster, is a popular pub with a beer garden and live music. Also on
Goodramgate, you can find Old White Swan (% 01904/540-911), with 
a warm-weather courtyard, three bars, and home-cooked food. The
Punchbowl, 7 Stonegate (% 01904/615-491), is a 300-year-old pub serv-
ing traditional Yorkshire ales and filling pub food. The half-timbered
Black Swan, Peasholme Green (% 01904/686-911), dates from the 15th
century and is known for its folk-music performances. The modern Bar
38, Coney Street (% 01904/674-428), is a hip hangout with a riverside
terrace, cocktail happy hour, and a good bar menu.
Performing arts
Theatre Royal, St. Leonard’s Place (% 01904/623-568; www.theatre-
royal-york.co.uk), and the Grand Opera House, Cumberland Street
(% 01904/671-818; www.york-operahouse.co.uk), offer a year-round
schedule of plays and concerts.
Day-tripping from York: Castle Howard 
and Eden Camp
If you’re staying in York or the vicinity, you may want to visit Castle
Howard and Eden Camp, both easily accessible from York by car, train,
or taxi. The two places are close to each other but worlds apart: Castle
Howard gives you a glimpse of the wealth and power of the English aris-
tocracy, and Eden Camp tells the story of ordinary men and women
living under extraordinary circumstances.
Castle Howard
Set against a backdrop of North Yorkshire’s Howardian Hills, anyone who’s
seen the television series Brideshead Revisited will instantly recognize
Castle Howard. The castle is a truly magnificent sight — not really a castle,
but certainly one of England’s grandest stately homes. The largest house
in Yorkshire, Castle Howard has been the home of the Howard family since
the 17th century.
Sir John Vanbrugh designed Castle Howard (assisted by Nicholas
Hawksmoor) and built it for the third Earl of Carlisle. The castle was
Vanbrugh’s first project; his second was Blenheim Palace (see Chapter 13).
The facade showcases elegant architectural details, including statues, long
arched windows, and a beautiful cupola crowning the center of the house.
The castle doesn’t offer any guided tours; you’re free to walk through at
your own pace. Guides staff every room and can fill you in on the history.
The marble entrance hall, lit by the dome, is particularly impressive, as is
the Long Gallery, but the house has many superb rooms, all filled with fine
furniture, statues, and china. The collection of paintings includes works
by Rubens, Tintoretto, Van Dyke, Canaletto, and Reynolds, as well as a
Chapter 21: Yorkshire 371

famous portrait of Henry VIII by Hans Holbein. Brideshead memorabilia
fills one room.
The 1,000-acre park is landscaped with lakes, fountains, rose gardens, and
shady woodland gardens. On the grounds, at the end of a short walk, you
can find Vanbrugh’s classically inspired Temple of the Four Winds and a
circular mausoleum by Hawksmoor. You can choose among three restau-
rants: The Hayloft Cafe in the Stable Courtyard and The Fitzroy Room in
the main house, both open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and The Lakeside
Cafe, open weekends and holidays only, near the Great Lake. To see the
house and gardens, you need a minimum of two hours, preferably three. 
Castle Howard is 24km (15 miles) north of York off A64 (20 minutes by car).
From York, you can get a train to Malton (local Scarborough line), and then
take a taxi (about £10/$20) 14.5km (9 miles) to the castle; to reserve a 
taxi, call Station (% 01653/696-969). In the summer, Coastliner Coaches
(% 01653/692-556) operates buses from York and Scarborough.
Malton. % 01653/648-333. www.castlehoward.co.uk. Admission: £10 ($20)
adults, £9 ($18) seniors, £6.50 ($13) children 5–15. Open: Mar–Oct and mid-Nov–mid-
Dec daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m. (grounds open at 10 a.m.).
Eden Camp
In 1942, Malton became the site of the Camp Eden prisoner-of-war camp.
The first inmates, 250 Italians captured in North Africa, worked con-
structing the 35 wooden huts that you see today. The Italians left in 1944
and were followed by Germans, who remained until 1948. While at the
camp, the prisoners worked on local farms under the control of the War
Agriculture Officer.
Eden Camp’s huts have now been re-equipped to tell about life in Britain
during World War II (1939–1945). Realistic scenes, sounds, and smells have
been created to help you imagine life at a time when food was strictly
rationed, blackouts were a nightly occurrence, and 80,000 civilians were
killed in bombing raids over England. Each hut covers a different aspect of
the story, starting with the rise of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, and
the outbreak of war. The sound of Vera Lynne singing “We’ll Meet Again”
is a haunting reminder of a time when people didn’t know what the next
day would bring. Eden Camp has much to see, so give yourself at least two
hours.
Eden Camp is just north of the Malton train station, 8km (5 miles) east of
Castle Howard off A64 York-Scarborough Road at the junction of A169 to
Pickering. From York, take a train to Malton (local Scarborough line) and
then take a taxi (about £10/$20) to Eden Camp; to reserve a taxi at the
Malton train station, call Station (% 01653/696-969).

Scarborough: Cliffs and Arcades
The first and largest resort town on the Yorkshire coast, Scarborough is
famous for its giant curving swath of sandy beach on the North Sea. The
town clusters around two splendid bays (North Bay and South Bay), with
a headland in between. South Cliff, the neighborhood around South Bay
and the harbor with its Esplanade, is the main part of town. Scarborough
is a fun place to visit for a day or to stay overnight if you’re exploring
North York Moors National Park (see the section “Yorkshire’s Two
National Parks: Moors and Dales,” later in this chapter).
The seafront in Scarborough is a gaudy hodgepodge of noisy arcades, fish
and chips shops, and tourist traps; its cheesiness is part of what makes
the area fun. The town that covers the cliffs and hills above is more
Victorian in character. Victorian-era cliff lifts still convey people up and
down from the cliffs to the beach, just as they did when Scarborough was
a pre-eminent Victorian spa town (people came to drink the mineral waters
and to swim in the sea). In the end, Scarborough isn’t a town where you
go for heavy doses of culture. Popular with families, Scarborough is a
good place to hang out on the beach, breathe the fresh sea air, and have
a good time.
Getting to Scarborough
Scarborough is 56km (35 miles) northeast of York and 407km (253 miles)
north of London. Local trains run all day between York and Scarborough.
Trains leave London’s Victoria Station almost every hour for York, where
you change trains for the one-hour trip to Scarborough. For train infor-
mation, call % 08457/484-950. Yorkshire Coastliner (% 01653/692-
556; www.yorkshirecoastliner.co.uk) operates two to four buses a
day from York to Scarborough. By car from York, take A64 northeast.
Getting around Scarborough
The town is small enough that you can walk everywhere, but the hills from
beach to town can make for a steep climb. For taxi service, call Streamline
Taxis (% 01904/638-833) or Station Taxis (% 01904/366-366).
Finding information and taking a tour of Scarborough
The main Tourist Information Centre, Unit 15A, Brunswick Shopping
Centre, Westborough (% 01723/383-636; www.discoveryorkshire
coast.com), has maps, a room-booking service, and information on
local attractions. The center is open Monday to Saturday from 9:30 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. A smaller Tourist Infor-
mation Centre (% 01723/507-302) is along the beach at Harborside;
this center is open from Easter through October daily from 9:30 a.m. 
to 5:30 p.m. and from November to Easter on Sunday only.
Step Back in Time (% 01723/859-466; www.scarboroughguidedtours.
ic24.net) is a local guide service that conducts guided walks on request.

Staying in Scarborough
Scarborough has plenty of hotels and B&Bs to choose from. I recom-
mend the following choices.
Beiderbecke’s Hotel
$$
Town center
Beiderbecke’s, in an 1835 building at the end of a Victorian crescent (row
houses built in a long, curving line), is Scarborough’s most stylish hotel.
The 27 guest rooms are comfortable and well furnished, with good-size
tiled bathrooms (most with tub-shower combinations and bidets). Even if
you don’t stay here, stop in for a drink at the Red Square Cocktail Bar,
with its blue and orange walls, contemporary furniture, and giant poster
of Lenin. The bar is the hippest hangout in town. I describe the hotel
restaurant, Marmalade’s, in the section “Dining in Scarborough,” later in
this chapter.

Raincliffe Woods, a part of North Moors National Park (see “Exploring
North Moors National Park,” later in this chapter). The setting is gorgeous
and the hotel, with rooms divided between the main house, a town house,
and around a garden courtyard, is a haven of quiet luxury. The rooms, all
with private baths, are spacious and handsomely decorated. The hotel has
a fine restaurant and a comfy bar.

Bradley Court Hotel is a good, moderately priced hotel without sea views
but within walking distance of town and beach. The 40-room hotel is
Victorian with somewhat dowdy English modern furnishings. You find
some nice connected rooms that families can put to good use up in the
former attics and a few larger “premier” rooms. All rooms have private
bathrooms with tubs and showers. You get a good breakfast with your
room. Request a room in back if traffic noise bothers you.

If you want a spacious room that has a big bathroom with tub and shower
and panoramic sea views, you can’t beat The Esplanade. The hotel is a
large, old-fashioned place, created a century ago from three mid-19th-
century houses on the top of the South Cliff above The Esplanade. A won-
derful roof terrace overlooks South Bay and the town.

Exploring Scarborough
Scarborough consists of an upper town and a lower area beside the
beach. The town has always been more about enjoying the pleasures of
the seaside than anything else.
Art Gallery
The most interesting works in Scarborough’s small art gallery relate to the
Scarborough area during the Victorian age. You can see everything in
about 15 minutes.
The Crescent. % 01723/374-753. Admission £1 ($2) adults, free for children under 16.
Open: June–Sept Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Oct–May Thurs–Sat 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Rotunda Museum
The history and architecture of this small, circular museum are more inter-
esting than its collections. Built in 1829 to contain the rock collections of
William Smith (known as the father of English geology), it was one of
England’s first purpose-built museums. You don’t need more than a few
minutes to wander through; the second floor, with its original painted
frieze and curving wall cabinets, is worth checking out. Note: As of press
time, the museum was closed for redevelopment and a re-opening date
had not been set.
Vernon Road. % 01723/374-839. Admission £1 ($2) adults, free for children under 16.
Open: June–Sept Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Oct–May Tues, Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Scarborough Castle
The headland between Scarborough’s North and South bays was originally
the site of a fourth-century Roman signal station. The castle here, built in
the 12th century, is partially in ruins, but you get panoramic views of the
coastline from its battlemented walls. An audio tour (included in the
admission price) fills you in on the castle’s turbulent history. Give yourself
an hour, but add more time if you want to enjoy the headland walks.
Castle Road. % 01723/372-451. Admission: £4 ($8) adults, £3 ($6) seniors, £2 ($4) 
children 5–15. Open: Mid-Mar–Sept daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Oct–Mar Thurs–Mon 
10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Sea Life & Marine Sanctuary
Northeast England’s leading marine animal rescue center, this place also
operates as an aquarium, with fish, seals, sea otters, sea turtles, and other
denizens of the deep. More than 30 multilevel viewing areas allow you to
get close to various sea creatures, from sharks to shrimps and otters. Kids
enjoy the touch pools, where they can pick up velvet crabs, starfish, and
anemones. You can watch feeding demonstrations and many marine-
themed presentations.
Scalby Mills, North Bay. % 01723/376-125. Admission: £11 ($22) adults, £8.95 ($18)
children 5–15, £33 ($66) families (2 adults, 2 children). Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.

Seeing the performing arts in Scarborough
The Stephen Joseph Theatre (% 01723/370-541; www.sjt.uk.com),
opposite the train station on the corner of Westborough and Valley
Bridge Road, was created from an Art Deco movie theater. The space is
known as “Alan Ayckborne’s theatre” because the British playwright–
director opens his plays here before doing so in London. Troupes from
around the country present a full season of offerings. The theater
restaurant (% 01723/368-463), a good place for a preshow meal, serves
traditional and Modern British main courses, salads, and desserts.
Yorkshire’s Two National Parks: 
Moors and Dales
Two national parks have helped preserve Yorkshire’s famous moors,
dales, and coastline. Using York or Scarborough as a base, you may want
Chapter 21: Yorkshire 377
The fishing village of Whitby
The old fishing, whaling, and smuggling village of Whitby, with its quaint cobbled
streets and picturesque houses, is 32km (20 miles) up the Yorkshire coast from
Scarborough, in North York Moors National Park. Smaller and less touristy than
Scarborough, Whitby makes a pleasant day trip from York or Scarborough. The port at
Whitby has been in use for more than 1,000 years. Nowadays, people come to stroll the
town’s winding maze of streets and enjoy the coastal scenery, with its cliffs, coves,
and bays. (The beaches are clean, but the North Sea is pretty cold for swimming, or
“bathing,” as the Brits call it.)
The River Esk divides the town into east and west sections. From Tate Hill Pier on the
east side, Church Lane climbs up to the 199 steps leading to the Church of St. Mary,
whose churchyard was one of the inspirations for Bram Stoker’s Dracula. The impos-
ing ruins of Whitby Abbey, founded in the seventh century, dominate the clifftop above.
On the beachfront on the west side of town, you can find a monument to Captain Cook,
who left Whitby in locally made ships for his circumnavigation of the globe. (Cook
claimed Australia and New Zealand for Great Britain.)
You can see all the sights in Whitby on The Whitby Tour (% 0191/521-0202), a 50-
minute, open-top-bus tour that operates daily from April to October. The tour costs £4
($8) for adults and £3 ($6) for seniors and students. Tours begin at about 10 a.m. (from
Langborne Road, near the Tourist Information Centre) and depart hourly until 4 p.m.
For a map and more information, stop in at the Tourist Information Centre, Langborne
Road (% 01947/602-674), open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer).
Daily bus service goes from Scarborough to Whitby, but you can’t find any easy train
connections. The Tourist Information Centre in Scarborough can give you up-to-the-
minute bus schedules. If you’re driving from Scarborough, take A171 north.

to explore the vast heather-covered moors and Yorkshire coastline that
make up North York Moors National Park. York also makes a good base
for touring Yorkshire Dales National Park, as does Windermere in Cumbria
(see Chapter 22), at the park’s northwestern corner. Both parks attract
hordes of summer ramblers and long-distance hikers. Visitors on a lim-
ited schedule can rent a car in York (see the section “Renting a car or
calling a taxi,” earlier in this chapter) for touring one or both of the parks.
North York Moors National Park
Vast stretches of heather moorland — the largest expanses in England
and Wales — make the North York Moors unique. In late summer, the
countryside turns into a great flowing sea of purple. Wonderful views cut
across dales (rich farmland, where people have worked for centuries)
and sweep out to the North Sea. Old crosses and standing stones remind
you of the moorland’s ancient human heart. The 1,434 sq. km park (554-
sq.-mile) is also an important protected area for birds and wildlife.
From Scalby Mills near Scarborough to Saltburn in the north, pictur-
esque, cliff-clinging villages such as Whitby (see “The fishing village of
Whitby” sidebar, earlier in this chapter), where fishing boats tie up at
the harbors below, dot the coastal section. Commercial development
along the coast and throughout the moors has been limited, so the area
retains much of its rugged, down-to-earth character.
Getting to North York Moors National Park
Motorways encircle the park: A170 skirts the southern boundary; A19
and A172 traverse the western edge; and A171 follows the eastern coast-
line and then cuts across the park’s northern boundary. The only major
road through the park is A169. Within the park, you find small roads, so
having a good map is essential (you can pick one up at a visitor center).
If you’re traveling by car from York, head northeast on A64; you can cut
north on A169 at Malton to the Visitor Centre at Pickering or continue on
A64 to Scarborough and there pick up A171, the coastal road. See the
sections “Getting to York” and “Getting to Scarborough,” earlier in this
chapter, for train and bus information from London.
Getting around North York Moors National Park
The popular North Yorkshire Moors Steam Railway (% 01751/472-508;
www.nymr.co.uk) chugs along a wonderfully scenic 29km (18-mile)
route through the heart of the park between the village of Grosmont
(near Whitby) and the market town of Pickering. All-day Return Rover
tickets let you hop off at any of the train’s five restored stations for a
walk through a village or the surrounding moors. The ticket costs £12
($24) for adults, £10 ($20) for seniors, and £8 ($16) for children 5 to 15.
Trains run daily from April through October.
Walking is the best way to discover this area’s beauty. More than 3,220km
(2,000 miles) of public paths allow you to explore even the remotest
parts of the countryside. If you do go walking (or even if you drive),
Part VII: Way Up North 
378

make sure you get Ordnance Survey Outdoor Leisure maps 26 and 27,
which show every path and road. The National Park publishes “Walks
Around . . .” booklets for various sections of the park, including Robin
Hood’s Bay, The Moors Centre, Goathland, Rosedale, and Sutton Bank.
You can pick up the maps and booklets at the park information centers
listed in the following section.

Bank National Park Centre, Sutton Bank, Thirsk (% 01845/597-426). All
these centers are open daily in March, November, and December from 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m., April through October daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and
in January and February on Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Exploring North York Moors National Park
North York Moors National Park was home to three great medieval reli-
gious houses. At Mount Grace Priory, near Osmotherley off A19, you
can see how the Carthusian monks lived, each with his own cell and
garden. Farther south, between Thirsk and Helmsley off A170, is Byland
Abbey, which was the home of a Cistercian order. The majestic ruins of
Rievaulx Abbey, oldest and most famous of the three, housed more
than 600 monks. This National Trust property is located in the south-
west section of the park, 3km (2 miles) west of Helmsley off B1257. You
can reach all these sites in easy day trips from York if you have a car.
The patchwork of fields and open moorland in the Esk Valley exudes an
aura of timelessness. Near Lealholm and Glaisdale, old stone tracks
mark the routes walked by generations of farmers and travelers. The
watermill in the farming hamlet of Danby was the village’s most impor-
tant building; the mill is more than 350 years old and still working.
Nearby, you can see the ruins of Danby Castle, built in the 14th century
as a fortified home. A short stroll down to the river takes you to Duck
Bridge, first used 600 years ago. For the locations of all these sights,
consult Ordnance Survey Outdoor Leisure maps 26 and 27 or the book-
let “Walks Around . . .”, both available at the park information centers
(see the preceding section).
Yorkshire Dales National Park
Covering some 1,813 sq. km (700 sq. miles), Yorkshire Dales National
Park is home to a collection of varied landscapes: heather-capped
moors, swift moorland rivers, colorful hay meadows, and rugged lime-
stone crags. Bustling market towns and traditional sandstone villages
nestle among fields and rolling farmland dotted with stone barns and
stacked dry-stone walls. Yorkshire Dales has different moods, wild and
windswept in one place, quietly pastoral and rustic in another.

667-165), open year-round; and Malham (% 01729/830-363), open 
daily from April through October and on Saturday and Sunday the rest 
of the year.
Exploring Yorkshire Dales National Park
The Yorkshire Dales are ideal for walking — paths crisscross the entire
park. For the best walking areas and towns to explore, check out the fol-
lowing (for maps and information, visit any of the National Park Centres,
listed in the preceding section):
 Aysgarth: Where the river cascades down a series of waterfalls,
this place is one of the park’s scenic highlights.
 Dales Way: This popular footpath passes through the village of
Grassington, in the scenic Upper Wharfedale section.
 Hawes: In Upper Wharfedale, is said to be the highest market town
in England. In this lively place, you can find shops selling local
crafts and famous Wensleydale cheese. Hawes’s old train station,
next to the National Park Centre, is now the Dales Countryside
Museum (% 01969/667-494), where you can find out more about
the 10,000-year human history of the Yorkshire Dales.
 Malham: This town closest to the park’s remarkable limestone for-
mations has more good hiking. During the summer, up to half a mil-
lion visitors swamp this 200-person village.
Haworth: On the Trail of the Brontës
Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights or Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre may
have sparked your interest in Yorkshire and the moors. Emily and
Charlotte lived with a third sister, Anne, also a novelist (The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall), and their brother Branwell in the West Yorkshire town of
Haworth, 72km (45 miles) southwest of York. Grim industrial cities (such
Part VII: Way Up North 
380

as Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, and Keighley) surround Haworth, which
wouldn’t be on anyone’s radar if not for the Brontë clan. For more than 
a century now, people from around the world have trekked up the cob-
bled Main Street of Haworth to see the house where these three women,
daughters of a local parson, wrote their compellingly passionate novels.
Although Branwell’s failed career as a portrait painter led him to drink
and drugs, he did paint the famous portrait of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne
that now hangs in London’s National Portrait Gallery.
Getting to Haworth
The nearest train station with service from a major city is Leeds. From
Leeds, you can take the West Yorkshire Metrotrain to Keighley, 5km 
(3 miles) south of Haworth. The Keighley and Worth Valley Railway runs
steam trains between Keighley and Haworth (year-round on the week-
ends and from late June to early Sept daily). There’s regular bus service
to Haworth from Keighley and Bradford (13km/8 miles away). For local
train and bus information, call % 01535/645-214; for national train
information, call National Rail Enquiries % 08457/484950. If you’re driv-
ing from York, take A64 west to Leeds and A6120 to Shipley; from there,
take A650 to Keighley and B6142 to Haworth.
Finding information and taking a tour of Haworth
For information on the town, stop at the Tourist Information Centre,
Main Street (% 01535/642-329; www.haworth-village.org.uk), open
daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (until 5 p.m. Nov–Mar; closed Dec 24–26).
Well-marked walks lead from the town into the heather-covered moors
so memorably evoked in the Brontë sisters’ works. At the center, you
can pick up a leaflet describing the most popular walks.
Dining in Haworth
If you want a well-prepared dinner, try Weaver’s Restaurant, 15 West
Lane (% 01535/643-822). You absolutely have to make reservations,
because this restaurant is the best (and busiest) in town. The menu 
features both traditional and Modern British cooking. Set-price lunch 
or dinner costs £13 to £16 ($26–$32). The restaurant is open Tuesday
through Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and Tuesday through
Saturday from 7 to 9:30 p.m. If you want a casual lunch, check out the
offerings — pubs, tearooms, and cafes — lining Main Street and West
Lane. A pub lunch averages around £8 to £10 ($16–$20).
Exploring Haworth
Haworth really should rename itself Brontëville, because the Brontë
name is on everything from tea shops to trinket outlets. The one must-
see literary shrine is the Brontë Parsonage Museum (% 01535/642-323;
www.bronte.org.uk), the house where the literary-minded siblings
spent most of their lives. Built in 1778 at the top of the village behind the
parish church, the house is furnished much as it would have been when
Chapter 21: Yorkshire 381

the Brontës lived there. The museum displays a collection of personal
memorabilia, manuscripts, and even some of Charlotte’s clothes (she
was tiny). The museum is open daily April through September from 
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and October through March daily from 11 a.m. to 
5 p.m.; it’s closed December 24 to 27 and all of January. Admission 
costs £5.50 ($11) for adults, £4 ($8) for seniors and students, £2 ($4) for
children age 5 to 15, and £13 ($26) for families (2 adults, 3 children).
Depending on your interest, allow 30 to 60 minutes to visit the museum.
After visiting the house, you can stop in at the parish church, which
looks much different than it did in the Brontë sisters’ days. Charlotte,
the only one to wed, was married here in 1854 and buried here a year
later, aged 39. Emily, who died in 1848 at age 30, also rests in the family
vault. Anne died in Scarborough at age 29 and is buried there.

 Savoring the spectacular countryside around Keswick
I
n 1974, the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland joined with a
bit of Lancashire to officially create Cumbria in the northwest corner
of England. But actually, Cumbria existed about 1,000 years before that
as an ancient Celtic kingdom. And before that, about 5,000 years ago, the
region was the home of Neolithic tribes that manufactured stone axes
and erected stone circles. Today, this area, roughly 435km (270 miles)
northwest of London and covering some 2,300 sq. km (885 sq. miles), is
protected as the Lake District National Park. The largest national park
in the United Kingdom, it’s also one of the most popular.
If you can, give yourself at least a couple of days in the Lake District. I
cover three towns and lakes in this chapter: Bowness and Grasmere on
Lake Windermere, and Keswick on Derwentwater. You find good hotels
and restaurants in all three, and all are convenient for exploring this fas-
cinating region, which stretches from Lancashire north to the Scottish
border, east to the counties of Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland,
and west to the Irish Sea. (See “The Lake District” map on p. 384.)
Odes and bunny rabbits
The Lake District’s two most famous residents were the poet William Wordsworth and
Beatrix Potter, who wrote and illustrated children’s books. The landscape inspired both
writers, and they used it in their work. Wordsworth composed his poetry outdoors,
often in the area around Grasmere. Potter used Lakeland settings for her tales about
Peter Rabbit and Jemima Puddle-Duck.

The Lake District: Natural Beauty 
and Literary Treasures
The Lake District, or Lakeland as it’s also called, is a hauntingly beautiful
place with a distinct personality. Treeless peaks covered with bracken
(large, coarse ferns) surround a series of tranquil, jewel-like lakes radiat-
ing like spokes around 3,210-foot-high Scafell Pike, England’s highest
mountain. Having a sense of wide-open spaces is rare in England, and
that’s why the Lake District is so popular with hikers. Wonderful hiking
trails lace the entire region, passing fern-fringed streams, stands of
purple foxglove, hedgerows bursting with dog roses, ancient stone cir-
cles, and cottages made of gray-green Lakeland slate.
The weather in the Lake District is unpredictable — squalls can sud-
denly appear. Be prepared for fine, thin rains; vapory mists; and blustery
winds. If you’re thinking about hiking, bring waterproof boots and rain
gear. To check on the rapidly changing weather conditions, call the
Weatherline at % 01787/75757.
Getting to the Lake District
Bowness-on-Windermere, Grasmere, and Keswick all make good bases
for exploring the region. Several trains a day operate between London’s
Euston station and Oxenholme, the nearest main-line station to Lake
Windermere. The trip takes three to four hours and costs £71 ($142) for
an advance-purchase round-trip ticket. From Oxenholme, local train
service runs to Windermere. National Express (% 08705/808-080;
www.nationalexpress.com) runs buses from London’s Victoria Coach
Station to Windermere, but the trip by bus takes more than six-and-a-half
hours. The closest airports are Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle.
Driving from London, the fastest route is the M1 to Birmingham, where
you pick up the M6 heading north. From the M6, take A590 and then
A591 northwest to Windermere.
Chapter 22: The Lake District 385
Lake District lingo
The Lake District and northern England in general have a unique topography. Nowhere
else in the country can you find the mixture of mountains, lakes, and streams that char-
acterizes this area. These natural features even have special names. Here are a few
words that you may encounter:
 Tarn: A steep-banked mountain lake or pool
 Beck: A mountain stream
 Mere: A small, still lake
 Fells: Mountains

Getting around the Lake District
Having a car opens up the entire region, but you may run into heavy
(and sometimes aggravating) traffic in the summer. You may want to rent
a car in York (see Chapter 21) and drive west through Yorkshire Dales
National Park to the Lake District. (Otherwise, you can rent a car in
Leeds or Manchester.) But boats and local buses (this area has no train
service) can get you to all the towns and tourist sites that I describe in
this chapter without too much difficulty. The distances aren’t great; in
some cases, you can even walk. For all public transport questions — to,
from, and within Cumbria — call the Cumbria Traveline at % 0870/
608-2608 (daily 7 a.m.–8 p.m.; www.traveline-cumbria.co.uk). You
can also check the district’s Web site at www.golakes.co.uk.
Stagecoach Northwest (% 0870/606-2608; www.stagecoachbus.com)
operates buses between all the towns I describe in the following sec-
tions. A one-day Explorer pass, good for unlimited travel, is £9 ($18) for
adults and £6 ($12) for children 5 to 15. You can buy the Explorer and
longer-term tickets on the bus or at any tourist information center (see
the sections about finding information for each region, later in this chap-
ter, for locations).
Taking a tour of the Lake District
If you don’t have a car, why not consider taking a guided tour of the Lake
District? You have many options, including the following:
 Countrywide Holidays, Miry Lane, Wigan, Lancashire WN3 4AG
(% 01942/823-456; www.countrywidewalking.com): Offers safe
and sociable walks led by experienced guides from different
Lakeland locales; prices vary according to the walk you choose.
 Tours of Discovery, Mickle Bower, Temple, Sowerby, Penrith CA10
1RA (% 01768/362-201; www.toursofdiscovery.co.uk): Arranges
tailor-made tours on foot, by car, and by minibus. Prices depend on
your itinerary.
 Lakes Supertours, 1 High St., Windermere LA23 1AF (% 01539/
442-751; www.lakes-supertours.co.uk): Picks you up at your
hotel for minibus trips to Beatrix Potter’s house, Wordsworth’s
Dove Cottage, and Lakeland beauty spots. Prices depend on the
type and length of your tour.
Lake Windermere: The Largest Lake 
in England
Glinting like a long, thin blade within its surrounding fells, 16km-long 
(10-mile) Windermere is England’s longest lake. Windermere is also the
region’s most popular lake, a center for sailing, rowing, and yachting.
(You can swim here, too, but the water’s pretty brisk.) The town of
Part VII: Way Up North 
386

Windermere (right around the train station) blends into Bowness-on-
Windermere (also called Bowness) on the lake’s eastern shore. Both
towns are busy tourist-resort centers and good central spots to base your-
self. You can walk from Windermere to Bowness in about 15 minutes; a
local bus runs frequently from the train station at Windermere to Bowness
Pier, a departure point for lake cruises. People come to Lake Windermere
to hike, take boat trips, and visit the sites associated with Beatrix Potter.
Finding information and exchanging 
money near Lake Windermere
A few steps from the train station, Windermere’s Tourist Information
Centre, Victoria Street (% 015394/46499), sells maps and local guides
and has a hotel-booking service. The center is open daily from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. Apr–Sept and until 7:30 p.m. July–Aug). A National
Park Information Centre (with a bureau de change) is at Bowness Bay
(% 015394/42895), next to the boat landing. See also the listing for the
Lake District Visitor Centre in the section “Exploring around Lake
Windermere,” later in this chapter.
Barclays, Crescent Road, Windermere (% 015394/46111), changes
money weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and has an ATM.
Touring by boat or foot
You can explore the lake and the dramatically beautiful countryside
around it relatively easily — and you don’t need a car to do it.
Lake cruises
Various boat trips are available year-round on Lake Windermere. From
the piers at Bowness, ferries make regular trips to Waterhead (near
Ambleside) on the north shore and Lakeside on the southern end; others
make a circular tour, stopping at points all around the lake. The boats
are fitted out for sightseeing, with big windows and open decks. From
mid-May to mid-August, you can also take an evening wine cruise. A round
trip from Bowness to Ambleside is £7.70 ($15) for adults, £4.10 ($8.25)
for children 5 to 15, and £21.50 ($43) for families (2 adults, 2 children).
For more information, contact Windermere Lake Cruises (% 01539/
531-188; www.windermere-lakecruises.co.uk).
Windermere Ferry (% 0860/813-427), which shuttles passengers,
cyclists, and cars between Bowness and Far Sawrey, on the western shore,
is the cheapest way to get across the lake. Ferries depart about every 30
minutes throughout the day from Ferry Nab, south of the excursion-boat
piers. The one-way passenger fare costs 50p ($1); a car costs £3 ($6).
A Freedom of the Lake pass is valid on all scheduled boats — including
Windermere Lake Cruises and Windermere Ferry — on Lake Windermere
for 24 hours. The pass costs £14 ($28) for adults, £7 ($14) for children 
5 to 15, and £36.50 ($73) for families (2 adults, 2 children).
Chapter 22: The Lake District 387

Walks and rides
You won’t find much solitude around Lake Windermere during the summer
months, but some good, nonstrenuous walks can give you some memo-
rable views. One of the easiest, and a good choice if you have older kids
in tow, is the 4km-round-trip (21⁄2-mile) trail from the Windermere Tourist
Information Centre on Victoria Street to Orrest Head (234m/784 ft.). The
trail gives you plenty of photo-op panoramas of the lake and the villages
along the shore.
The Lake District is wonderful biking country, but be aware that cars can
jam the local roads during the summer. You can rent bikes at Country
Lanes Cycle Centre (% 015394/44544), in the Windermere railroad 
station. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Easter through October. 
Bike rental is £18 ($36), plus deposit, per day for a front-suspension
mountain bike.

Windermere
Miller Howe is one of those great country-house hotels that can turn a holi-
day into heaven. The hotel sits on a hill amid acres of landscaped gardens
and enjoys a spectacular view of Lake Windermere. The restaurant is one
of the most famous in the country (see the review in the section “Dining
near Lake Windermere,” later in this chapter), and guests come specifi-
cally to dine here. (The rates look high, but a masterful six-course dinner
comes with the room.) The house is warm and sumptuous, with fires, cozy
lounges, and pampering service. The spacious and beautifully furnished
rooms (12 in all) have big bathrooms with tubs and showers. If you don’t
stay, consider dining here.

Here’s a good, quiet spot for an inexpensive lunch or tea. You can get
homemade soup; toasted sandwiches; and a couple of hot main courses,
such as steak and kidney pie, meat and potato pie, or a Cornish pasty (usu-
ally meat and onions baked in a crust). If you’ve never had hot sticky toffee
pudding with cream, try it here. You can also choose from an assortment
of homemade pastries.

The Hole in’t Wall

Bowness-on-Windermere
PUB/INTERNATIONAL
Back in 1612, one side of this building was an alehouse (it still is), and the
other was a blacksmith’s shop. A hole in the wall connected the two. Now
the place has a dark, wood-paneled interior with a fireplace. The food runs
the gamut from whole roast pheasant to fisherman’s pie, a daily curry, and
daily specials listed on the blackboard. The menu always includes some-
thing that kids can enjoy. Set off a bit from the main tourist track in
Bowness, it’s an atmospheric spot to sample Cumbrian ales.

Dinner at this fine hotel restaurant is a somewhat ritualistic affair. It has
only one seating, at 8 p.m., and the six-course menu is the same for every-
one (with a la carte options). A typical meal may start with a trio of
canapés (with á ballontine of foie gras) and advance to a first course of
seared scallops wrapped in cabbage followed by champagne sorbet. The
main course may be local lamb in red wine and rosemary sauce, with veg-
etables, followed by dessert. The elegant, two-tiered, candlelit dining room
overlooks Lake Windermere, and you definitely find it a culinary high point
of the Lake District. If you’re staying at the hotel, your room rate includes
dinner.

Exploring around Lake Windermere
You probably don’t want to spend too much time in the town of Winder-
mere itself. The lake and surrounding countryside are what make this
part of England so special.
Beatrix Potter Gallery
Hawkshead
You can see ample evidence of Beatrix Potter’s skills as an illustrator of
her own children’s stories in this National Trust collection of her original
drawings and watercolors. You also can find an exhibition about Potter’s
life. The gallery is in what was the office of Potter’s husband, a local attor-
ney. After visiting the gallery, spend a little time wandering around
Hawkshead, one of the region’s prettiest villages. If you’re a Potter fan,
allow at least 30 minutes; add another 30 minutes if you want to wander
around Hawkshead.
Part VII: Way Up North 
390

The poet William Wordsworth was a student at Hawkshead Grammar
School, founded in 1585 (no phone). It’s open Easter through October
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m.; admis-
sion costs £2 ($4) for adults and 50p ($1) for children.

June–Aug closed Fri).
Hill Top
Near Sawrey
Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated many of her famous children’s tales in
this 17th-century stone cottage. She was born in London but spent
summer holidays in the Lake District with her family. The international
success of The Tale of Peter Rabbit allowed her to buy this small, pretty
house and move permanently to the Lakeland village of Near Sawrey.
Potter deeded her house to the National Trust before she died in 1943, and
the interior — one of the darkest you’ll ever see — remains as she left it,
complete with her furniture, bone china, and garden. Because the house
is so small, only a certain number of visitors are allowed in at any one time.
Hill Top uses a timed-entry admission policy, which may keep you waiting
in the summer. After you go inside, allow about 15 minutes to visit the
house. You can get a pub lunch at the Tower Bank Arms (% 015394/
36336) in front of the house.
Between April and October, you can take bus no. 505 or 506 from the
train station in Windermere to Hill Top.

Chapter 22: The Lake District 391
From Peter Rabbit to preservation
You can thank the creator of Peter Rabbit for some of the beautiful landscapes you
see in the Lake District today. Beatrix Potter treasured the beautiful scenery and
invested the earnings from her best-selling children’s books in buying parcels of land
and ensuring its preservation when she bequeathed it to the National Trust. In case
you’re interested, The Tale of Peter Rabbit has never been out of print since it was first
published in 1902; to date, it has been reprinted more than 300 times, translated into
35 languages, and sold some 40 million copies worldwide. Miss Potter, a movie based
on the life of Beatrix Potter, was released in 2006, starring Rene Zellweger.

The Lake District Visitor Centre
Brockhole
Housed in a lakeside mansion with terraced gardens, this visitor center
presents an extensive overview of the national park and its special fea-
tures. It offers all sorts of activities: Kids can go wild on an adventure play-
ground; visitors can enjoy interactive exhibits and daily guided walks, too.
The gardens and grounds, with views down to Lake Windermere and
beyond, are home to a wide variety of unusual shrubs and plants. The
Cafe, which specializes in traditional Cumbrian recipes, serves meals daily
from noon to 2 p.m. From the visitor center’s jetty, you can hop on one of
Windermere Lake Cruises’ circular cruises (see the section “Touring by
boat or foot,” earlier in this chapter). From April to October, a boat from
Bowness can take you to the Lake District Visitor Centre.

Windermere Steamboat Museum
Windermere
This small lakeside museum displays a unique collection of boats used on
Lake Windermere during the last 150 years. The oldest boat is a steam
launch from 1850. You also can find exhibits on the history of boating and
racing on the lake. You can see the boats and displays in under 30 min-
utes. The center offers a fun, 50-minute cruise around Belle Isle (an island
in Lake Windermere) in an Edwardian steam launch; call ahead to reserve
a seat. The cruise costs £5.50 ($11) for adults and £2.50 ($5) for children
5 to 15. Note: In 2007, the Steamboat Museum announced a major rede-
velopment plan for its collection; some of the information in this descrip-
tion may therefore not be accurate in 2008.

Bowness-on-Windermere
If you grew up on Beatrix Potter stories and think that her illustrations are
cute, you may enjoy this miniature theme park — having a child along
helps, too. The attraction is a series of small, skillfully re-created scenes
related to those famous Potter characters Peter Rabbit and Jemima
Puddle-Duck. You can have tea in the Tailor of Gloucester (another Potter
story) tearoom, and of course, you can shop for Potter-inspired merchan-
dise. You can see everything in under an hour.

Grasmere: Wordsworth Territory
Grasmere Village draws fans of William Wordsworth in the way that Near
Sawrey draws Beatrix Potter-holics. High fells surround this lovely
Lakeland village with the River Rothay running through it. The village is
13km (8 miles) north of Windermere on its own jewel of a lake, Lake
Grasmere. Wordsworth called the area “the loveliest spot that man hath
ever found.” By bus, the trip from Windermere to Grasmere Village takes
less than 30 minutes. You can also take the ferry to Ambleside, at the
north end of Lake Windermere (the stop is called Waterside), and con-
tinue by bus. Keep in mind that this is an extremely popular tourist
route, and summer traffic includes tour buses. Grasmere Village is about
a quarter-mile from Dove Cottage and Lake Grasmere.
Rydal, the village where Wordsworth lived out his final years in relative
affluence as England’s poet laureate, is about midway between
Ambleside and Grasmere.
Finding information about Grasmere
The Waterhead Tourist Information Centre (% 015394/32729), next 
to the ferry landing at Waterhead, has books and maps, and can advise
you on good walks in the area. The center is open April through Septem-
ber daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Grasmere Tourist Information
Centre (% 015394/35245), across from the parish church and behind
the Grasmere Garden Centre, is another good resource for local informa-
tion (open summer only). Both have a bureau de change.
Touring on foot
Several pleasant short walks begin in Grasmere. Check with the Grasmere
Tourist Information Centre (see the preceding section) for maps and
suggestions. More experienced hikers may want to tackle the 5.5km (31⁄2-
mile) round-trip trail to the rocky summit of Helm Crag; the walk takes
about two hours. You can also walk east on Easedale Road to the nearby
peaks known as “The Lion and the Lamb” and “The Lady at the Organ.”
Staying in and around Grasmere
Grasmere is a small village with a good selection of accommodations.

Picturesque 400-year-old Dove Cottage was the home of William
Wordsworth (1770–1850), one of England’s most famous Romantic poets
and the one most identified with the Lake District. Wordsworth composed
most of his greatest poems in Dove Cottage, where he lived between 1799
and 1808 with his wife; his children; and his sister Dorothy, whose jour-
nals chronicle their daily lives. A guide takes you through the entire house,
which has been altered little over the years. You can view some of the
family’s personal possessions. Tours are limited to about 20 people at a
time, so you may have to wait. A few steps away is the Wordsworth
Museum, which documents the poet’s life and works with manuscripts,

30 minutes for the museum — twice that if you’re a Wordsworth fan.

The Grasmere Gingerbread Shop
Grasmere
You smell this place before you see it, and I recommend that you stop in.
This famous shop, in a tiny cottage next to the parish church, sells a mar-
velous gingerbread made from a 150-year-old secret recipe developed by
Sarah Nelson and kept in a local bank vault. You can buy the gingerbread
fresh or in sealed packs (a great gift idea). The shop also sells Kendal Mint
Cakes, a supersweet mint bar that Sir Edmund Hilary used to raise his
blood sugar while climbing Mount Everest.

Wordsworth: The silent nightingale
William Wordsworth is considered one of England’s great poets. The sights and scenes
of the Lake Country, where he was born, spent most of his mature years, and died,
influenced much of his poetry. Traveling in France after his graduation from Cambridge,
Wordsworth fell in love with Annette Vallon, who gave birth to his daughter Caroline.
He never married Annette, apparently because the French Revolution prevented his
return to France.
In 1798, Wordsworth co-authored Lyrical Ballads, a volume that included “Tintern
Abbey,” the work that introduced Romanticism, with its love of nature, to England. In this
poem, Wordsworth extolled not the great but the ordinary man: “That best portion of a
good man’s life, / His little, nameless, unremembered acts / Of kindness and of love.”
In 1802, the poet married Mary Hutchinson, an old school friend. With Mary, he had five
children. The Prelude, completed in 1805, is a long autobiographical poem. Some of
his other famous poems include “Daffodils” and “Intimations of Immortality” (“Though
nothing can buy back the hour / Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower”). From
1847 until his death in 1850, Wordsworth was England’s poet laureate, appointed by
Queen Victoria. He was called “the silent nightingale” because during those years he
never composed a poem.

Rydal Mount
South of Grasmere
In 1813, Wordsworth moved his family to Rydal Mount, a much grander
house between Ambleside and Grasmere. From here, the man who immor-
talized the Lake District countryside had commanding views of Lake
Windermere, Rydal Water, and the surrounding fells. The house still
belongs to the poet’s descendants, but they have opened much of it to the
public, and you can wander through the dining room, drawing room, family
bedrooms, and study. Take time to stroll through the gardens Wordsworth
designed; Dora’s Garden, ablaze with daffodils in the spring, was planted
in memory of his daughter Dora. You can easily spend 30 minutes here,
longer if you wander in the garden.

Keswick: Lakeland Central
Compared with tiny Grasmere, Keswick (pronounced Kes-ick) is a large,
bustling market town. Situated on a lovely lake (Derwentwater), Keswick
is a lively regional hub that turns into a busy resort on weekends and
during the summer (see the “Keswick” map on p. 398). The town, with
its narrow streets and sturdy gray stone buildings, stands on the banks
of the River Greta beneath the slopes of the Skiddaw Range. Some of the
most beautiful walking country in England lies around Keswick.

Exploring in and around Keswick
You may find the indoor tourist attractions in and around Keswick inter-
esting, but they’re not all that important. The landscape itself makes the
place special, and invites walks and boat rides.
Castlerigg Stone Circle
Near Keswick
If you have time for only one walk in the Lake District, make it this one,
which appeals to older kids as much as to adults. The walk leads to the
best preserved of the 40 or so prehistoric stone circles found throughout
Cumbria. The circle’s unrivaled setting, on the flat top of a low hill above
Keswick, surrounded by high fells, adds greatly to its appeal. Castlerigg
consists of 33 standing stones forming a circle, with another 10 stones
arranged as a rectangular enclosure. The circle was probably constructed
about 3000 B.C. No one can say definitively what its purpose was, but it
may have served as the focal point for a scattered tribe of Neolithic people
involved in making stone axes. Although much smaller than Stonehenge
(and lacking the lintels that cap the stones there), Castlerigg conveys the
same sense of timeless mystery.
See map p. 398. From the National Park Information Centre in Keswick, follow the
signposted trail that leads 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) east along A591 to Castlerigg Stone Circle;
walking to the circle and back takes about 21⁄2 hours. You can drive here following
A591; a parking lot is across from the stones.
Cumberland Pencil Museum
Keswick
This museum devoted to the humble pencil is worth 30 minutes of your
time. The exhibits inevitably pique the interest of children and their par-
ents. The Elizabethans used pure graphite, discovered near Keswick in the
early 1500s, to make cannonball molds, and local farmers used it to mark
their sheep. In 1832, the precious carbon became the source of lead for a
thriving local pencil industry. After watching an introductory video, you
can wander past the displays (oldest pencils in the world and so on) and
discover the answer to that burning question: How do they get the lead

into the pencil? If you’re looking for high-quality colored pencils, the shop
is an excellent source.

Derwentwater
Southwest of Keswick
Many folks consider Derwentwater, studded with islands and enfolded 
in a landscape of low, bare hills with craggy peaks, the prettiest of all 
the lakes. The lake is about 5km (3 miles) long and 22m (72 ft.) deep. At 
its northern end, closest to Keswick, is a popular park. Keswick Launch
(% 017687/72263; www.keswick-launch.co.uk), located at the lake’s
north end, operates 50-minute cruises from Easter through November
daily starting at 10 a.m. (Sat and Sun only Dec–mid-Mar). The small
launches make a circuit of the lake and stop at several docks, where you
can get out and walk. The cruise costs £8 ($16) for adults, £4 ($8) for chil-
dren 5 to 15, and £19 ($38) for a family (2 adults, 3 children). During the
summer, an evening wine cruise is available. See map p. 398.
Keswick Museum and Art Gallery
Keswick
This small Victorian museum has nothing of major importance, but a look
at the paintings, manuscripts, crystals, and bric-a-brac collected over the
years is fun. The most famous exhibit is a 500-year-old mummified cat
found in the roof of Clifton Church, Penrith, in 1842; kids find this desic-
cated feline absolutely fascinating.

Shopping in Keswick
My favorite shop in Keswick is Ye Olde Friars, 6–8 Market Square

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
E
verything in this part is extra. You can have a great time
in England without even looking at these chapters. But if
you do read this part, I can turn you on to some extra-special
places that you may otherwise miss. I describe everything 
in this part elsewhere in the guide, but these top ten lists
present an easy, added way to ﬁnd out about some special-
interest areas that you may want to explore further.
Literature is one of the great links between England and other
parts of the world. So, in Chapter 23, I give you the lowdown
on ten famous English writers, from William Shakespeare to
Beatrix Potter, and tell you how you can visit places where
they lived and worked.
Then, because more and more people are interested in gar-
dens and gardening, in Chapter 24, I introduce you to ten
great English gardens that you can visit.
In Chapter 25, I point out some magniﬁcent English cathe-
drals and churches that you may want to include on your 
itinerary.
And no book about England would be complete without at
least a few pages devoted to the monarchy. After all, the kings
and queens of England take on almost mythic status in British
history, whether they accomplished heroic feats or suffered
humiliating losses. In Chapter 26, I introduce you to a few
notable royals, past and present, to give you a glimpse of how
the rulers of England — and the rule of England — has
changed over the past 2,000 years.

Chapter 23
Ten Writers and the 
Places They Lived
In This Chapter
 Seeing the England of Austen, the Brontës, and Henry James
 Visiting the London museum of Dickens
 Discovering the Lake District of Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter
 Venturing into the gardens of Vita Sackville-West
 Making a literary pilgrimage to Shakespeare’s Stratford-upon-Avon
I
don’t know about you, but some of my earliest “memories” of
England came from literature. Long before I ever visited the Lake
District, I had seen the distinctive landscape in Beatrix Potter’s illus-
trated children’s tales. Peter Pan, who lived in Kensington Gardens,
made me curious about London. As I grew older, I read English novels
and went to plays written by Shakespeare. If you’re literary minded, you
can track down several places in England associated with your favorite
authors. Even if you stay in London for your entire trip, you can do some
literary sleuthing. Blue plaques on London buildings identify the abodes
of famous writers and artists. Some of England’s most famous poets,
novelists, and playwrights are buried or commemorated in Poets’
Corner, Westminster Abbey (see Chapter 12).
Jane Austen
One of England’s most enduringly popular writers is Jane Austen
(1775–1817). Her highly polished novels depict social and domestic life
in Regency England — that is, the period just before Dickens and the
Victorians. Austen’s fictional world is full of wit and romance. She never
married. When she was 21, her father, a minister, retired and moved his
family to Bath, where you can see the house she lived in and visit the
Jane Austen Centre, a museum dedicated to her life and times.
After her father’s death, Austen lived in the quiet village of Chawton
with her mother and sister Cassandra. The Jane Austen House, which

you can visit, is a small red-brick dwelling that her wealthy brother
Edward gave her. In this house, she began revising her earlier drafts of
Sense and Sensibility (published in 1811) and Pride and Prejudice (pub-
lished in 1813). Austen continued writing and publishing novels until
1817, when illness forced her to move to Winchester for medical help.
You can pay your respects at Austen’s grave in Winchester Cathedral.
You can find information on the Jane Austen sites in Chapter 16.
Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë
A trip to Haworth in Yorkshire (see Chapter 21) brings you to the
Brontë Parsonage Museum, home of that trio of sibling scribes,
Charlotte (1816–1855), Emily (1818–1848), and Anne (1820–1849) Brontë.
The windswept moors that figure so prominently in Emily’s Wuthering
Heights and Charlotte’s Jane Eyre surround the town, which markets the
Brontë name in every conceivable way. Like Jane Austen, the Brontës
were the children of a minister. They were educated (in grim schools,
like the one called Lowood in Jane Eyre) but had no independent means
of support, so all three had to work as governesses. Anne’s The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall and Charlotte’s Jane Eyre both have governess heroines.
Charlotte and Emily spent a brief time at a school in Brussels (where
Charlotte fell in love with her married teacher), but otherwise, the
Brontës stayed close to the parsonage, writing the novels that would
make them famous. Tragedy struck when Anne, 29, and Emily, 30, died in
quick succession of tuberculosis. Charlotte eventually married one of
her father’s curates but died at age 39.
Charles Dickens
Charles Dickens (1812–1870) was one of the most prolific and best-loved
novelists of the Victorian era. When Dickens was a boy, his father was
thrown into debtor’s prison, and young Charles was forced to work in a
factory. His subsequent rise to fame as a reporter, editor, and novelist is
as remarkable as anything in his fiction. David Copperfield is Dickens’s
most autobiographical novel.
Dickens didn’t flinch at exposing the horrors of the day and tackling
social issues, such as child labor and London’s teeming slums. Some of
his characters (Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, to cite just one
example) have become as famous as Shakespeare’s. Dickens moved
around constantly, but in London, you can visit the Charles Dickens
Museum, located in the house where he penned Oliver Twist, The
Pickwick Papers, and Nicholas Nickleby. The museum contains the
world’s most comprehensive Dickens library, plus portraits, illustra-
tions, and rooms furnished as they were in his lifetime. See Chapter 12
for more details on the museum.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
406

Henry James (and E. F. Benson)
Novelist Henry James (1843–1916) was an American, but he loved
England so much that he became a British citizen. In his long career,
James wrote 20 novels, 112 stories, 12 plays, and literary criticism. The
son of one of the best-known intellectuals in mid-19th-century America,
he grew up in Manhattan. (William James, his brother, was one of the
earliest psychologists.)
An Irish grandfather provided the wealth that endowed the family with the
privileges of culture, travel, education, and social affluence — attributes
found in Henry James’s fictional characters, many of whom are Americans
living in England or Italy. After living in Paris, James moved to England,
living first in London and then in Sussex. Lamb House, his last home, is
just one of many reasons to visit the beautiful Sussex town of Rye. (E. F.
Benson, who wrote the Mapp and Lucia novels, later owned Lamb
House.) For more about Rye, see Chapter 14.
Beatrix Potter
The life of famed children’s-book writer and illustrator Beatrix Potter
(1866–1943) is singularly lacking in drama and tragedy. Born in South
Kensington, London, she was an only and lonely child but had many pets
that she carefully observed and sketched. When Beatrix was 16, her par-
ents rented a summer house in the Lake District. They returned every
year afterward, and Beatrix fell in love with the beautiful countryside.
Many years later, when The Tale of Peter Rabbit, her first published book,
sold 50,000 copies, she bought Hill Top, her house in Near Sawrey, close
to Lake Windermere. The house is now open to the public. Potter’s illus-
trations and watercolors are on display at the Beatrix Potter Gallery in
nearby Hawkshead. The gallery is in a building that held the law offices
of William Heelis, whom she married when she was 47. Over the years,
Beatrix Potter used her earnings to buy thousands of acres in the Lake
District (and became a prize-winning sheep farmer). She wanted the
countryside that had so inspired her to be preserved for future genera-
tions, and she left it all to the National Trust. Here’s one little-known fact
about Potter: She discovered the process by which fungi reproduce, but
the scientific world didn’t acknowledge her research until the 1990s. You
can read more about the Lake District and its Potter sites in Chapter 22.
Vita Sackville-West
Not many people read the novels and poems of Vita Sackville-West
(1892–1962) anymore, but many people know about her life. She was born
at Knole, an enormous house in Kent, and she later wrote an entertain-
ing book called Knole and the Sackvilles. Virginia Woolf (1882–1941) used
Vita as the inspiration for the gender-bending hero/heroine in her brilliant
Chapter 23: Ten Writers and the Places They Lived 407

novel Orlando, which also has Knole as a setting. Vita, famous for her
lesbian affairs, married the diplomat Harold Nicholson and had two chil-
dren. Nigel Nicholson, one of their sons, wrote about his parents in
Portrait of a Marriage, later filmed for television. Vita and Harold worked
together to create the magnificent gardens at Sissinghurst Castle, now
one of the world’s most famous gardens. Check out Chapter 15 for more
about Knole and Sissinghurst. Vita’s garden books still sell; her best
novel is The Edwardians.
William Shakespeare
England’s most famous literary pilgrimage site is Stratford-upon-Avon,
where you can visit the homes occupied by William Shakespeare (1564–
1616) and his family. Before visiting Shakespeare’s Birthplace, on Henley
Street, spend a few minutes in the adjacent Shakespeare Centre, where
exhibits illustrate the life and times of this Elizabethan genius. Anne
Hathaway’s Cottage, about a mile south of Stratford, was the home of
the woman Shakespeare married when he was 18 and she was 25.
A relatively prosperous Shakespeare retired to New Place on Chapel
Street; the only part that remains is the garden. Nash’s House, next door,
belonged to Thomas Nash, husband of Shakespeare’s granddaughter.
Nearby Hall’s Croft is a magnificent Tudor house where Shakespeare’s
daughter Susanna probably lived with her husband, Dr. John Hall. Shake-
speare and his family are buried in Holy Trinity Church. About 5.5km (31⁄2
miles) north of Stratford is Mary Arden’s House. For decades, this Tudor
farmstead was assumed to be the girlhood home of Shakespeare’s mother,
but scholars have recently suggested that Shakespeare’s mum probably
lived in the house next door. I cover Stratford-upon-Avon in Chapter 19.
William Wordsworth
When William Wordsworth died in 1850 at the age of 80, he was poet lau-
reate of England and perhaps the world’s most famous poet. His fame
rests on the poems in Lyrical Ballads and The Prelude. A champion of the
Romantic Movement, which emphasized imagination and emotion and
extolled nature, Wordsworth is closely associated with the Lake District,
where he lived most of his life.
Born in Cumberland (today’s Cumbria) in 1770, Wordsworth was the son
of a lawyer. He attended Hawkshead Grammar School in the village of
Hawkshead (also the location of the Beatrix Potter Gallery) and studied
at Cambridge. Wordsworth composed most of his greatest poems in
Dove Cottage, Grasmere, where he lived between 1799 and 1808. In 1813,
Wordsworth moved his family to Rydal Mount, a much grander house
between Ambleside and Grasmere. He and other family members are
buried in the churchyard of Grasmere Parish Church. For more details
on all these sites, see Chapter 22.

beguile your senses and refresh your spirit. Most, but not all, of the gar-
dens I describe in this chapter are planted around grand stately homes
and castles, which may be part of your visit. Four of the gardens are in
or near London, and the rest are scattered throughout the country.
If you plan to visit gardens on your trip, May and June are probably 
the prime months, but the flowering season continues into September.
Britain’s Gardens, a map with brief descriptions of 100 gardens in England,
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, is available free from VisitBritain (see the
Appendix for contact info for VisitBritain).
Castle Howard
Gardens are never static. Plants grow and die; styles change; and new
owners make their own marks on the landscape. The 1,000-acre park at
Castle Howard in Yorkshire is an example of how a garden can change
over time.
The castle is famous for its 18th-century landscape, dotted with orna-
mental temples and follies (ornamental buildings that serve as focal
points in a landscape). John Vanbrugh’s classically inspired Temple of
the Four Winds and the circular mausoleum by Nicholas Hawksmoor are
particularly notable. When the South Parterre was laid out between 1715
and 1725, the house’s architectural drama was extended into the sur-
rounding landscape with obelisks, urns, statues, and a 50-foot column.
Most of that visual drama was removed in the 1850s, when the Atlas
Fountain and a parterre (an ornamental garden with paths between its
beds) of boxwood, plants, and gravel were installed. In the late 19th 
century, grass and yew hedges replaced the parterre. The walled Rose

Garden and Ray Wood, full of rare rhododendrons and plants that survive
in their own protected microclimate, were planted only in the last half-
century. And the work goes on today, allowing visitors to stroll through
fields and woodland, over bridges, and beside lakes. You can get to Castle
Howard in an easy day trip from York; see Chapter 21 for more information.
Chelsea Physic Garden
This 31⁄2-acre gem, hidden behind the high brick walls surrounding Chelsea
Royal Hospital, is the second-oldest botanical garden in England. When
the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries founded the garden in 1673, physic
referred to medicine and medicinal agents. The goal of the apothecaries
was to develop medicinal and commercial plant species. Seeds from this
garden, for example, were used to start the cotton industry in the British
colony of Georgia, first settled in 1733. Planted in the garden are some
7,000 exotic herbs, shrubs, trees, and flowers. This garden also boasts
England’s earliest rock garden. See Chapter 12 for more details.
Eden Project
Located on the south coast of Cornwall, the Eden Project is a garden of
the 21st century. It’s not an old-fashioned pleasure ground like the other
gardens I mention in this chapter, but an intriguing educational showcase
meant to stimulate an awareness of the Earth and humanity’s dependence
on plants and all living things. Already a major tourist attraction, the Eden
Project consists of two giant geodesic conservatories sunk in deep craters.
One dome covers the rainforest; and the other dome features the fruits and
flowers of the Mediterranean, South Africa, and California. Outside, on the
acres of landscaped grounds, plants from all sorts of terrains grow in spe-
cially created microhabitats. You can find more information in Chapter 18.
Hever Castle
In the early 16th century, when Anne Boleyn was growing up at Hever
Castle, the grounds looked nothing like they do today. The superb land-
scaping was created about a century ago, after the American millionaire
William Astor bought Hever in 1903. Astor, who’d been American ambas-
sador to Italy, created the castle’s magnificent Italian Garden between 1904
and 1908. This garden combines the formal structure and design elements
of Italian Renaissance gardens with English plantings. A remarkable col-
lection of Roman to Renaissance statuary and sculpture collected in
Italy fills Astor’s creation.
In other parts of the grounds, you find a maze, a 35-acre lake, and the oblig-
atory English rose garden. The Tudor herb garden, built close to the castle
in 1994, gives you an idea of what gardens were like in Anne Boleyn’s day.
You can visit this garden as a day trip from London; see Chapter 15.

410

Hidcote Manor
When you see a garden such as Hidcote Manor’s, you have to marvel at
the patience and love that went into creating it. An American officer,
Lawrence Johnstone, bought the Cotswold estate in 1907. What this
amazing gardener did with a high, windswept limestone scarp is nothing
short of amazing. Johnston created a series of terraces and planted
unusual hedges (as windbreaks) to form compartments off a long central
axis. Rare and exotic plants — including rhododendrons, camellias, and
magnolias that are lime intolerant — are planted in beds of sawdust.
Hidcote is in some ways the forerunner of Sissinghurst because it com-
prises a variety of garden “rooms.” Anyone touring the Cotswolds must
stop here. For more information on Hidcote, see Chapter 20.
Kew Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew — more commonly known as Kew
Gardens — are perfect for a half-day trip from London. (Getting there
takes about a half-hour on the Underground.) The 300-acre gardens 
date to 1730, when Frederick, Prince of Wales, leased the property and
helped lay out the grounds. His widow, Augusta, and his son, George III,
really developed Kew. They enlisted botanists who began to bring plants
from all over the world. Capability Brown later redesigned the gardens
and destroyed many of the earlier buildings, but the 163-foot-high Chinese
pagoda remains. The Palm House, a great glass-house conservatory, 
was completed in 1848. On the grounds, you can find picturesque Kew
Palace, used by King George III (who went temporarily insane), and
Queen Charlotte’s Cottage, a royal summer retreat. From April through
September, you can reach Kew by boat from London’s Westminster Pier.
See Chapter 13 for more details on Kew Gardens.
Lanhydrock
Gardens are usually meant to beautify and set off a house, and this
garden is no exception. The beautiful gardens of Lanhydrock surround
one of the largest stately homes in Cornwall. Here, different kinds of gar-
dens — from Victorian parterres to woodland gardens where camellias,
magnolias, and rhododendrons grow in dappled shade — embellish the
great house and overlook the Fowey River valley below. An avenue of
ancient beech and sycamore trees runs from the 17th-century gatehouse
down to a medieval bridge across the Fowey. You can find details about
Lanhydrock in Chapter 18.
Sissinghurst Castle Garden
This world-famous garden in Kent represents what many people consider
the most beautiful example of an English garden. The sheer profusion
Chapter 24: Ten Great English Gardens 411

and abundance of plants gives Sissinghurst a romance uniquely its own.
The writer Vita Sackville-West and her diplomat husband, Sir Harold
Nicolson, bought the ruined castle in 1930 and jointly created the gar-
dens. Harold designed the various “compartments” or “rooms” of the
garden, and Vita “furnished” them with plants, trees, and shrubs that
provide color all year round. See Chapter 23 for more about Vita
Sackville-West.
The White Garden, with foliage and blossoms that are entirely white or
silver, is the most famous garden area at Sissinghurst. This area uses
typical English plants, such as primroses and daffodils, extensively.
Roses, many of them fragrant old varieties that were nearly lost, were
planted by the hundreds and now climb through trees and over walls.
You can visit Sissinghurst as a day trip from London, but be aware that
you get in by timed ticket; see Chapter 15 for more information.
Stourhead
Stourhead in Wiltshire represents a new kind of gardening style that
swept through England starting in the early 1700s. Before that, the wealthy
based their show-off gardens on French models, with strictly geometric
and low-to-the-ground designs. The new style favored a natural look,
with flowing, irregular lines; plantings of trees and shrubs; and ornamen-
tal lakes rather than giant fountains.
The architect Henry Flitcroft laid out the gardens at Stourhead in 1741
for Henry Hoare, a wealthy merchant banker who’d already built a man-
sion on the site in the Palladian style (a classical style incorporating ele-
ments from ancient Greek and Roman buildings). Flitcroft transformed
small ponds into lakes spanned by a bridge and used classically inspired
buildings as architectural ornaments along the edges. Picturesque views
and tranquil vistas are what Stourhead is all about. For more details on
Stourhead, see Chapter 16.
Warwick Castle
Lancelot “Capability” Brown (1716–1783) was one of the most famous
landscape gardeners in 18th-century England. In the 1750s, Brown intro-
duced what has since become known as the English landscape garden,
which is meant to look like an enhanced and perfected natural landscape.
You can see his work in the park at Warwick Castle in Warwickshire. The
grounds, sloping down to the River Avon, have winding paths and are
planted with giant trees. One unusual feature at Warwick is the peacock-
shaped topiary in front of the conservatory where a flock of peacocks
freely roams. See Chapter 19 for details on visiting the castle.

Ten (or So) Great 
English Churches
In This Chapter
 Visiting England’s most important churches and cathedrals
 Discovering the magnificent architecture of these sacred places
C
hurches and cathedrals are special places where you can come in
direct contact with England’s long history. Enter a church in just
about any village, no matter how quiet and tiny, and you’re in the place
where countless generations have gathered to worship, celebrate, and
grieve. Within the church, you may find a 900-year-old baptismal font,
elaborate tombs with reclining figures, memorial stones, medieval
brasses, ancient stained glass, and medieval carved figures and orna-
ments in wood and stone.
Over the centuries, even the smallest churches become fascinating
almanacs of changing styles. The country is also blessed with an amaz-
ing assortment of magnificent cathedrals, huge places where monarchs
have been crowned and famous people are buried. No matter how great
or small, England’s churches are architectural treasures, and I urge you
to visit some of those I describe in this chapter.
Canterbury Cathedral: Pilgrim Central
Throughout the Middle Ages, pilgrims from throughout Europe flocked
to this great cathedral in Kent. Their goal: to see the shrine of Saint
Thomas à Becket, an archbishop killed in the cathedral in 1170 by
henchmen of Henry II. (People believed if they prayed at the shrine, 
they would receive special indulgences after death.) The popularity of
Becket’s shrine, which added enormous wealth to the monastery at
Canterbury, rankled the absolutist monarch Henry VIII (who reigned

from 1509–1547). Becket’s shrine was destroyed when Henry abolished
all monasteries. Declaring himself the head of the Church of England,
Henry VIII outlawed loyalty to the pope as the head of the church, and
monasteries were closed, destroyed, or converted.
In the cathedral, you can still see where the shrine stood, behind the
high altar. In Canterbury, you can also visit St. Martin’s, which may be
the oldest church in England, and the ruins of St. Augustine’s Abbey,
established in A.D. 597. For more about Canterbury, see Chapter 14.
Exeter Cathedral: A Medieval 
Sculpture Gallery
The twin towers of Exeter Cathedral in Devon date from Norman times
(12th century), but the entire church was remodeled in the 14th century.
The ornamentation and architectural detailing both outside and in are
representative of the aptly named Decorated Gothic style. Check out the
cathedral’s most remarkable exterior feature: the image screen on the
west end. The screen contains row upon row of niches filled with won-
derfully carved figures of saints and kings dating from the late 14th and
early 15th centuries. This screen is the largest collection of medieval
sculpture in the entire country. Inside, the cathedral’s 300 feet of unin-
terrupted fan vaulting is the longest in England. You can find more infor-
mation on Exeter Cathedral in Chapter 17.
King’s College Chapel: Unparalleled Lightness
When entering this tall, thin church in Cambridge, you immediately
notice how light and airy it feels. The building’s style, called Perpendicular
Gothic, emphasizes the vertical, carrying the eyes upward to a roof of
beautiful fan vaulting. Enormous windows, glowing with stained glass,
add to the sense of lightness. Hearing the famed King’s College boys’
choir sing in this chapel is an unforgettable experience. For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 13.
St. Martin-in-the-Fields: West End Landmark
St. Martin-in-the-Fields is a London landmark. Prominently sited on
Trafalgar Square, the 18th-century neoclassical church with its raised
portico and graceful steeple served as the prototype for dozens of
churches in New England. St. Martin’s is a lively social center in the West
End. The crypt holds a popular cafe and a brass-rubbing center, and the
church itself hosts weekly concerts by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-
Fields. See Chapter 12 for more details.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
414

St. Paul’s Cathedral: Wren’s 
Crowning Achievement
When the old St. Paul’s burned down in London’s Great Fire of 1666, the
architect Christopher Wren designed a new cathedral on the same site.
Wren was responsible for dozens of churches throughout the city, but
none so grand as St. Paul’s. Started in 1673 and completed in 1711, the
cathedral is considered his masterpiece, and he’s buried in the crypt
along with national heroes like the Duke of Wellington and Admiral Lord
Nelson. German bombers blitzed the entire area during World War II, but
St. Paul’s survived with only minor damage. In 1981, the cathedral was
the site of the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. Today,
the mighty dome of St. Paul’s, a famous London landmark, rises high
above a sea of bland office buildings. You can find details on visiting St.
Paul’s in Chapter 12.
Salisbury Cathedral: High in the Sky
Rising some 404 feet, the spire of Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire is the
tallest in England. What is unique about this cathedral is that its struc-
ture was planned and built as a single unit. In other cathedrals, building
usually went on for centuries, often incorporating portions of earlier
structures and changing styles along the way. But at Salisbury, the work
began in 1220 and was completed just 40 years later. (The one exception
is the spire, which was added in 1334.) As a result, Salisbury Cathedral is
probably the most beautiful and harmonious example of the Early
English style. See Chapter 16 for details.
Westminster Abbey: England’s Crowning Glory
London’s Westminster Abbey holds a hallowed place in English history
because nearly all the kings and queens of England since William the
Conqueror have been crowned there. The Coronation Chair, made of
English oak, has been used since 1307. The present cathedral, begun
under Henry III in the 13th century, was built in French Gothic style. Be
sure to check out the architectural highlight of the Henry VII Chapel,
raised above the general level of the abbey and roofed with intricate 
fan vaulting; the Florentine sculptor Torrigiani created Henry VII’s black-
and-white touchstone tomb. The abbey is also the final resting place of
Queen Elizabeth I; her Catholic half-sister Mary Tudor; and Mary, Queen
of Scots, Elizabeth’s one-time rival for the throne.
Approximately 3,300 people are buried in Westminster Abbey, including
the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer Dr. Samuel Johnson, the scientists
Charles Darwin and Sir Isaac Newton, the composers George Frederic
Chapter 25: Ten (or So) Great English Churches 415

Handel and Henry Purcell, and the actor Sir Laurence Olivier. For more
information on Westminster Abbey, refer to Chapter 12.
Winchester Cathedral: Saxon Power Base
Winchester was the capital of England before William of Normandy
arrived in 1066 and won the English throne. Before 1066, Saxon kings
were crowned not in London but in Winchester Cathedral, a tradition
that William continued — although he had himself crowned in London’s
Westminster Abbey as well. To this day, the caskets of some of the pre-
Conquest Saxon rulers of England rest in Winchester Cathedral. You also
can find the grave of the early-19th-century novelist Jane Austen here.
Winchester Cathedral boasts the longest nave (the main central space in
the interior) in Europe, at 556 feet, but its massive foundations were
built on nothing more than a raft of logs laid on a bog. By 1900, the build-
ing was sinking. William Walker, an underwater diver, worked beneath
the foundations for five years (in water so black he couldn’t see his
hands), removing the decayed wood handful by handful so that the
cathedral could be underpinned with concrete. For more about
Winchester Cathedral, see Chapter 16.
York Minster: England’s Largest Gothic Church
When missionaries from Rome arrived in the late sixth century to con-
vert England, York in the north, like Canterbury in the south, was estab-
lished as an archbishopric. The importance of York as a city is reflected
in the overwhelming size of its church. The largest Gothic church in
England, York Minster has more rare medieval stained glass than any
other church in the country. Many English cathedrals are built on the
sites of earlier churches, but York Minster was built over a Roman mili-
tary headquarters. If you visit, go down into the undercroft (the rooms
below the church), where excavations have revealed Roman walls and
streets. I describe York and its magnificent church in more detail in
Chapter 21.

Ten Important Royals —
Past and Present
In This Chapter
 Meeting a few notable royals
 Noting the changes over two millennia
I
am not a royalist, but the kings and queens of England fascinate me.
These are people who lived lives of penultimate power and humiliat-
ing defeat, people who killed to stay on the throne and were killed by
others who wanted it, people who inspired their subjects and treated
them like dirt, people who sometimes changed the course of history and
sometimes disgraced the nation they ruled.
Choosing just ten is difficult, but in the thumbnail sketches that follow,
you can get a glimpse of how the rulers of England — and the rule of
England — has changed over the past 2,000 years.
Queen Boudicca (A.D. 30?–60): 
Braveheart of the Britons
I’ve always thought Boudicca’s story would make a fantastic film, but
who would play this fierce Celtic queen who painted her face blue and
led 100,000 British troops against the invading Romans in A.D. 60?
Angelina Jolie?
Boudicca’s story goes back to the earliest period of Britain’s recorded
history. She was probably born about A.D. 30. In A.D. 48, she married
Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, and bore him two daughters. The Iceni were
a Celtic tribe that had been made a Roman client state in A.D. 43. When
Prasutagus died, he left his kingdom — as required by Roman law — to
the Roman emperor. But hoping to provide for his two daughters, he 
left a portion of his personal estate to them. For the Romans, that was a

perfect excuse to confiscate all of Prasutagus’s belongings and punish
the Iceni for “disobeying” Roman law. Just days after her husband’s
death, Boudicca was publicly whipped, and her teenaged daughters
were raped by Roman soldiers.
The outrages committed by the invading foreigners changed Boudicca’s
life forever. As more Roman troops arrived to begin the job of conquer-
ing all the native Britons, Boudicca managed to raise an army among for-
merly warring local tribes. The Celts were much feared by the Romans
because Celtic women fought alongside the men, painting their faces
blue to frighten the enemy and uttering terrifying shrieks as they attacked
with swords, axes, and clubs. Boudicca and her army destroyed Roman
forts and killed their inhabitants. Finally, at a site that was probably
somewhere in the West Midlands, Boudicca faced the army of Suetonius
Paulinus, the Roman governor of Britannia. She had more troops, but
Suetonius and his legionnaires had the discipline that helped Rome 
conquer the Western world. The Romans slaughtered the Celts under
Boudicca. It’s not known what happened to Boudicca herself. Some
accounts say she took poison. The alternative, had she lived, would
have been worse. She would have been paraded in chains at a public 
triumph in Rome and then publicly tortured in the Coliseum.
The next time you cross Westminster Bridge in London, look up, and 
you can see a bronze statue of Boudicca on the north side. Thomas
Thornycraft’s mid-19th-century work shows a wild-haired superwoman
in a horse-drawn chariot with her two daughters.
Alfred the Great (849–899): 
A Warrior and a Scholar
You can see a statue of Alfred the Great on Bridge Street in Winchester,
the capital of the old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Alfred is the only
English monarch to carry the title “the Great,” and that alone makes him
an intriguing character. His story goes back to the ninth century A.D.
when England was being relentlessly attacked and terrorized by the
Danes, more commonly known as the Vikings.
Youngest son of King Æthelwulf, Alfred became King of Wessex in 871.
Wessex was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom patched together in southern and
southwestern England after the departure of the Romans in A.D. 410.
Alfred finally and decisively defeated attacking Danes led by Guthorm at
the Battle of Eddington. As a condition of the peace treaty, Guthorm
withdrew his forces from Wessex while Alfred recognized Danish control
over East Anglia and parts of Mercia. This partition of England became
known as the Danelaw, and though the Anglo-Saxon kings soon brought
the Danelaw back under their rule, they did not attempt to interfere with
the laws and customs of the area, many of which survived until after the
Norman Conquest in 1066.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
418

Alfred created a series of fortifications to surround his kingdom and pro-
vide security from invasion. Burh, the Anglo-Saxon word for these forts,
is still recognizable in the modern English place-names ending in -bury.
The reign of Alfred was known for more than military success, however.
He promoted better education and helped make learning important in an
age when education had gone into a decline because of Danish looting of
monasteries and churches, the traditional centers of learning. Alfred was
also a codifier of law and a patron of the arts. A warrior and a scholar, 
he translated Latin books into the Anglo-Saxon tongue. With the kind of
leadership he provided, it’s no wonder he was proclaimed “the Great.”
William the Conqueror (1028–1087): 
Winner Takes All
The illegitimate son of the Duke of Normandy, William received the
duchy of Normandy upon his father’s death in 1035. He spent the next
several years consolidating his strength on the continent through mar-
riage, diplomacy, war, and savage intimidation. By 1066, the disputed
succession in England offered William an opportunity for invasion.
When Edward the Confessor died childless, the English crown was
offered to Harold Godwinson (an Anglo-Saxon), even though Edward 
had purportedly promised the throne to William of Normandy, his
second cousin. Insisting that Harold had sworn allegiance to him in 
1064, William prepared for battle. But as the new King Harold anxiously
awaited William’s arrival on England’s south shores, Harold Hardrada,
the King of Norway, invaded England from the north. Harold’s forces
marched north to defeat the Norse at Stamford Bridge on September 25,
1066. Two days after the battle, William landed unopposed at Pevensey,
forcing Harold to move south to a new battle. The Battle of Hastings took
place on October 14, 1066. Harold and his brothers died fighting, thus
removing any further organized Anglo-Saxon resistance to the Normans.
The Anglo-Saxon earls and bishops soon submitted and crowned him
William I on Christmas Day 1066.
William’s acquisitive nature never left him. Uprisings were ruthlessly
crushed until, by 1072, the whole of England was conquered and united.
Lands were confiscated and reallocated to the Normans. In 1085, William
commissioned the Domesday Book to survey land ownership, assess
property, and establish a tax base. Although he began his invasion with
papal support, William refused to let the church dictate policy within
English and Norman borders. Ruthless and cruel, the Conqueror exacted
a high toll from his subjects, but he also laid the foundation for the eco-
nomic and political success of England. Buildings from his reign include
Windsor Castle and the Tower of London (see Chapter 12), but perhaps
the most atmospheric reminder of William the Conqueror is at Battle
(see Chapter 14), where you can visit the battlefield that was William’s
first conquest in England.
Chapter 26: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 419

Henry II (1133–1189): Family Plots
Henry II, the first of the Plantagenets, was one of the most effective
English kings. He refined Norman government and created a self-standing
bureaucracy that could keep the country running even if it had a weak
or incompetent ruler. But Henry’s personal life was one unending soap
opera, with more plots and counterplots than I can possibly detail here.
Henry was raised in the French province of Anjou. His vast continental
possessions more than doubled with his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitane,
the ex-wife of King Louis VII of France. Crowned King of England in October
1154, Henry was technically a vassal of the king of France, but in reality, he
owned more territory and was more powerful than Louis.
Throughout his reign, Henry instituted reforms meant to weaken tradi-
tional feudal ties and strengthen his own position, but in the process, he
became involved in the murder of his best friend, Thomas à Becket. The
church courts instituted by William the Conqueror had become a safe
haven for criminals, and Henry wanted to transfer sentencing to the
royal courts. Becket, named Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, vehe-
mently opposed such a weakening of church courts. He also angered
Henry by opposing the coronation of Henry’s eldest son. When an exas-
perated Henry publicly voiced his desire to be rid of the contentious
archbishop, four thuggish knights took the king at his word and mur-
dered Becket in his own cathedral on December 29, 1170. (You can see
the exact spot if you visit Canterbury Cathedral; see Chapter 14.)
Henry’s sons, with the encouragement of their mother, repeatedly rebelled
against their father and his plans for dividing his many lands and titles.
Eleanor, equally ruthless and scheming, was kept a virtual prisoner for
16 years. Henry died in 1189, two days after his son Richard, with the
assistance of Philip II Augustus of France, attacked and defeated him,
forcing Henry to accept a humiliating peace.
Henry VIII (1491–1547): 
Take My Wife — Please!
The significance of Henry’s reign is generally overshadowed by his six
marriages. There is something pathological about Henry’s many mar-
riages, even if they were in pursuit of an elusive male heir.
Henry’s first wife was Catherine of Aragon (widow of his brother, Arthur)
whom he married in 1509 and divorced in 1533; the union produced one
daughter, Mary. Henry married his pregnant mistress Anne Boleyn in 1533;
she gave him another daughter, Elizabeth. But Anne was executed in 1536
on trumped-up charges of infidelity, a treasonous charge for the king’s
consort but never for the king. The same month Anne was beheaded, the
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
420

lusty monarch married Jane Seymour, who died giving birth to Henry’s
lone male heir, Edward, in October 1536. After viewing Hans Holbein’s
beautiful portrait of the German princess Anne of Cleves, Henry arranged
to marry her early in 1540. When she arrived, however, Henry found her
so homely that the marriage was never consummated. In 1540, with Anne
of Cleves scratched off the list, he married Catherine Howard, who was
executed for infidelity two years later and reputedly haunts Hampton
Court Palace to this day. Catherine Parr became Henry’s sixth and last
wife in 1543, and provided for the needs of both Henry and his children
until his death in 1547.
So what did Henry do besides bed and wed? Most notably, he altered
England as well as the whole of Western Christendom by separating the
Church of England from Roman Catholicism. The separation was actually
just another byproduct of Henry’s obsession with producing a male 
heir. When Catherine of Aragon failed to produce a prince, Henry sought
an annulment from the pope in order to marry Anne Boleyn. When
Cardinal Wolsey failed to secure a legal annulment, Henry summoned
the Reformation Parliament, which passed 137 statutes in 7 years, influ-
encing political and ecclesiastical affairs in a way previously unknown.
By 1536, all ecclesiastical and government officials were required to
approve publicly of the break with Rome and take an oath of loyalty.
Henry’s dissolution of the Catholic monasteries filled royal coffers, as
revenues from the sale of church lands went either to the crown or the
nobility. The break with Rome, coupled with an increase in governmen-
tal bureaucracy, led to royal supremacy that lasted until the execution 
of Charles I and the establishment of the Commonwealth a century after
Henry’s death.
Elizabeth I (1533–1603): Heart and
Stomach of a King
In contrast to her much-married father, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I never wed
and was known as the Virgin Queen. When she ascended the throne in
1558, the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants tore at the very
foundation of English society. Elizabeth’s Catholic predecessor and half-
sister, Mary, along with her advisors, had bled the royal treasury dry
trying to restore the Catholic Church’s authority in England.
Instead of being a fanatic like Mary, Elizabeth was strong willed, tolerant,
and intelligent. In religious matters, she devised a compromise that basi-
cally reinstated her father’s Protestant reforms. Another volatile prob-
lem was her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who gained the loyalty of
Catholic factions and instituted several plots to overthrow Elizabeth.
After irrefutable evidence of Mary’s involvement in such plots came to
light, Elizabeth sadly succumbed to pressure from her advisors and had
the Scottish princess executed in 1587.
Chapter 26: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 421

The persecution of continental Protestants forced Elizabeth into war,
which she desperately tried to avoid. She sent an army to aid French
Huguenots (Calvinists who had settled in France) after a 1572 massacre
in which over 3,000 Huguenots lost their lives, and she assisted Belgium
in its bid to gain independence from Spain. After Elizabeth rejected a
marriage proposal from Philip II of Spain, the indignant Spanish monarch,
incensed by English piracy and exploration in the New World, sent his
much-feared Armada to attack England. “I know I have but the body of a
weak and feeble woman,” Elizabeth told her troops, “but I have the heart
and stomach of a king.” England won the sea battle and emerged as the
world’s strongest naval power.
In many ways, Elizabeth’s reign has come to be regarded as a Golden Age.
Literature bloomed in the works of Spenser, Marlowe, and Shakespeare.
Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh expanded English influence in the New
World. Elizabeth’s religious compromise laid many fears to rest and
sought to prevent murderous strife. Fashion and education came to the
fore because of Elizabeth’s thirst for knowledge, courtly behavior, and
extravagant dress. Good Queen Bess, as she came to be called, main-
tained a regal air until the day she died, at 70 years of age and after a very
successful 44-year reign. Few English monarchs have enjoyed such politi-
cal power while maintaining the devotion of the whole of English society.
George III (1738–1820): “My Lords 
and Peacocks . . .”
George III was in no way an exemplary ruler, but I’ve long been fascinated
by him because he was king at the time of the American Revolution and
because he went mad. The only thing he really excelled at was procre-
ation. He married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and the pro-
lific couple produced 15 children.
George was descended from the Hanoverian (German) line of succession
that first came to the English throne in 1714. Determined to recover
royal prerogatives lost to the Whig Party by George I and George II,
George III methodically weakened the Whigs through bribery, coercion,
and patronage, hand-picking yes-men of mediocre talent and servile
minds to serve as Cabinet members.
George’s commitment to taxing the American colonies to pay for military
protection led to hostilities in 1775. The colonists proclaimed independ-
ence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final
American victory at Yorktown in 1781. Bouts with madness (attributed
to a disease called porphyria) and the way he handled the American
Revolution eroded the king’s support. The Peace of Versailles, signed in
1783, established British acknowledgment of the United States of America.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
422

Other major events and people marked George III’s reign. The British
Army under the Duke of Wellington (whose London residence, Apsley
House, you can visit; see Chapter 12) and the British Navy under Lord
Horatio Nelson (honored by Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar
Square; see Chapter 12) defeated French forces under Napoleon.
England also went to war again with the United States between 1812 and
1814, this time over the British practice of pressing American seamen
into service in the British Navy.
It’s safe to say that by the time he began an address with “My Lords and
Peacocks,” it was time for George to step down. Personal rule was given
to his son George, the Prince Regent, in 1811. George III died blind, deaf,
and mad at Windsor Castle (see Chapter 13) on January 29, 1820. You
can see Kew Palace, his favorite residence, on a visit to the Royal
Botanic Gardens (also known as Kew Gardens; see Chapter 13).
George IV (1762–1830): A Dandy King 
for the Regency
George IV, eldest son of George III and Charlotte, was the opposite of 
his father (are we starting to see a pattern here?): conservative in his
infrequent political involvement and licentious in affairs of the heart. 
As Prince Regent, he had many mistresses until he secretly married the
Catholic widow Maria Fitzherbert in 1785. When George III found out
about it, he had the marriage declared illegal because his son would
have been ineligible to reign with a Catholic wife. In 1795, George IV 
married again, this time to his cousin Caroline of Brunswick, who was
something of a slob and whom he detested. Caroline took their only
child and moved to Italy, returning to England to claim the rights of
queen when George succeeded his father in 1820. George created one 
of the greatest scandals of his reign when he had Caroline barred from
his coronation.
Bright, witty, and able on the one hand, indolent, spoiled, and lazy on
the other, George was in some ways the psychological forerunner of
many modern royals. Although he was scandalous with his mistresses
and extravagant in his spending, he was also a patron of the arts and
donated his father’s immense book collection as the foundation of the
British Museum Library. His support for building projects inspired the
Regency style of architecture, at its most fanciful in the Royal Pavilion in
Brighton (see Chapter 14). But his extravagances came at a time of
social distress and general misery following the Napoleonic Wars and
the tremendous changes brought forth by the Industrial Revolution. He
was basically a party boy who couldn’t overcome his sense of royal enti-
tlement to provide true leadership.
Chapter 26: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 423

Queen Victoria (1819–1901): 
Mother of Monarchs
Victoria, who gave her name to an era, was the daughter of Edward,
Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Her
father died when she was an infant, and her mother enacted a strict 
regimen that turned its back on the scandal-ridden courts of Victoria’s
uncles, George IV and William IV. Popular respect for the Crown was at a
low point at her coronation in 1837, but the modest and straightforward
young queen, just 18 years old, eventually won the hearts of her sub-
jects. She refused any further influence from her domineering mother,
and though she had no direct input in policy decisions, she wanted to be
informed of political matters. (After the Reform Act of 1832, legislative
authority resided in the House of Lords, with executive authority resting
within a cabinet formed by members of the House of Commons; the
monarch was essentially powerless.)
Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg in 1840, a marriage that
was apparently happy and certainly fertile: She bore nine children. The
public, however, was not fond of Victoria’s German prince, and Albert
was excluded from holding any official political position, was never
granted a title, and was named Prince Consort only after 17 years of mar-
riage. Victoria did nothing without her husband’s approval. His interests
in art, science, and industry spurred him to organize the Crystal Palace
Exhibition in 1851, a highly profitable industrial convention whose pro-
ceeds were used to purchase lands in Kensington for the establishment
of several museums (one of which is the Victoria & Albert Museum; see
Chapter 12). Following his death from typhoid in 1861, Victoria went into
seclusion for more than 25 years, not emerging until the Golden Jubilee
of 1887. An entire generation had never seen the face of their queen. In
that period, she had the Albert Memorial erected in Kensington Gardens
(see Chapter 12).
During her reign, the British Empire doubled in size, encompassing
Canada, Australia, India, and various lands in Africa and the South Pacific.
Victoria was named Empress of India in 1878. England’s success in avoid-
ing European conflicts for almost a century (1815 through 1914, the
Crimean War of 1853 to 1856 being the major exception) was due, in large
part, to the marriages Victoria arranged for her children. Either directly
or by marriage, she was related to the royal houses of Germany, Russia,
Greece, Romania, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Belgium. Nicholas II 
of Russia was married to Victoria’s granddaughter Alexandra, and the
dreaded Emperor of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was her grandson “Willy.”
The era we now call Victorian England was one in which the queen’s
rigid ethics and uninspired personal tastes generally reflected those of
the middle class. When she died of old age, an entire era died with her.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
424

Queen Elizabeth II (1926–
): 
Monarchy Amid Media
Elizabeth II, who became queen in 1952, is the best known of the seven
remaining monarchs in Europe. The eldest daughter of George VI and
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, she married a distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten,
in 1947 and had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne; Andrew;
and Edward. (For an account of some recent royal scandals involving
Elizabeth’s kids, see the “Recent royal events” sidebar in Chapter 2.)
In the modern world, where wealth and celebrity take the place of actual
accomplishment, monarchs are basically privileged show dogs whose
pedigrees allow them to amass enormous fortunes, live in a rarified world,
and be newsworthy for no reason other than they are royal. Seen in the
unflattering light of her children, Elizabeth shines like an old-fashioned
beacon of virtue and traditional values. She has never embarrassed her
nation, and she is a hard and disciplined worker, the most widely trav-
eled head of state in the world. She celebrated her Golden Jubilee in
2002 and appears determined to remain on the throne for quite some
time — perhaps as long as Victoria.
Yet overall, the popularity of the English monarchy is in sharp decline. 
In large part, this is because the disliked and derided Windsor children
have tarnished the royal name (Princess Diana was the only recent royal
to reach the hearts of the public). But it also has to do with a growing
sense that the monarchy is simply irrelevant. It provides an enormous
boost to tourism and sells lots of books and newspapers, but in a world
of democratic models and historical amnesia, how can an elitist monar-
chy achieve any meaningful relationship with the modern public?
But it’s hard to imagine England without a king or a queen and the tradi-
tions associated with royalty. And perhaps the monarchy is worth pre-
serving for that reason alone.
One of my favorite stories about Elizabeth II appeared in Paul Burrell’s
book, A Royal Duty. One night, the queen asked if he would like to accom-
pany her as she viewed the latest likeness sent from Madame Tussauds
for her approval. The queen and her butler walked through the hallways
and corridors of Buckingham Palace until they came to an enormous,
dark drawing room. When the lights were switched on, a lifelike effigy 
of the queen was seen standing in the center of the room. Elizabeth
slowly circled her wax twin, carefully scrutinizing her image. Then she
pronounced herself satisfied, turned off the lights, and left herself in 
the dark.

If you’re a U.S. citizen, you may bring home
$800 worth of goods duty free, provided
you’ve been out of the country at least 48
hours and haven’t used the exemption in the
past 30 days. This limit includes not more
than 1 liter of an alcoholic beverage, 200
cigarettes, and 100 cigars. Antiques more
than 100 years old and works of art are
exempt from the $800 limit, as is anything
you mail home from abroad. You may mail up
to $200 worth of goods to yourself (marked

Appendix: Quick Concierge 427
“for personal use”) and up to $100 worth 
to others (marked “unsolicited gift”) once
each day, as long as the package doesn’t
include alcohol or tobacco products. You
have to pay an import duty on anything
over these limits. You’re charged a flat rate
of 10 percent duty on the next $1,000 worth
of purchases. For more specific guidance,

Doctors
See “Hospitals,” later in this Appendix. 
For a doctor in London, see “Doctors and
Dentists” in the “Fast Facts” section of
Chapter 12.
Electricity
British current is 240 volts, AC cycle—
roughly twice the voltage of North American
current, which is 115–120 volts, AC cycle.
You won’t be able to plug the flat pins of
your appliance’s plugs into the holes of
British wall outlets without suitable con-
verters or adapters (available from an elec-
trical supply shop). Be warned that you’ll
destroy the inner workings of your appliance
(and possibly start a fire) if you plug an
American appliance directly into a European
electrical outlet without a transformer.
Embassies and High Commissions
All embassies, consulates, and high com-
missions are in London, the capital of the

England For Dummies, 4th Edition 
428
U.K. In case you lose your passport or
have some other emergency, here’s a list
of addresses and phone numbers:
Australia: The high commission is 
at Australia House, Strand, WC2 
(% 02073/794-334; Tube: Charing Cross),
open Monday through Friday 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m.
Canada: The high commission is at
MacDonald House, 1 Grosvenor Square,
W1 (% 02072/586-600; Tube: Bond St.),
open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.
Ireland: The embassy is at 17 Grosvenor
Place, SW1 (% 02072/352-171; Tube:
Hyde Park Corner), open Monday
through Friday 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
2:15 to 5 p.m.
New Zealand: The high commission is at
New Zealand House, 80 Haymarket at
Pall Mall, SW1 (% 02079/308-422; Tube:
Charing Cross or Piccadilly Circus), open

United States: The embassy is at 55–56
Upper Brooke St., W1 (% 02074/999-
000; Tube: Bond Street), open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to noon
and 2 to 4 p.m. (the embassy has no
afternoon hours on Tuesday).
Emergencies
For police, fire, or an ambulance, dial 
% 999 (you don’t need to pay when calling
from a public phone).
Holidays
Americans may be unfamiliar with some
British holidays, particularly the spring and
summer Bank Holidays (the last Monday in
May and in August), when everyone takes
off for a long weekend. Most banks and
many shops, museums, historic houses,
and other places of interest are closed on
Bank Holidays, and public transport serv-
ices are reduced. The same holds true for
other major British holidays: New Year’s
Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day
(the first Monday in May), Christmas Day,
and Boxing Day (Dec 26). London crowds
swell during school holidays: mid-July to
early September, three weeks at Christmas
and at Easter, and a week in mid-October
and in mid-February.
Hospitals
Visitors to the U.K. can get free emergency
care in Emergency Outpatient Centers of
National Health hospitals, but you have to
pay for any in-patient or follow-up care.
Check with your insurance company or
HMO to find out whether medical expenses
are covered while you’re out of the coun-
try. If you need a doctor, ask your hotel,
consulate, or embassy to recommend one.
If you find yourself in a life-threatening
emergency situation, dial % 999 for an
ambulance. For a list of hospitals offering
24-hour emergency care in London, see
“Hospitals” in the “Fast Facts” section of
Chapter 12. See Chapter 10 for insurance
and medical matters.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information,” later
in this Appendix, to find out where to get
visitor information before you leave home.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
For Internet access in London, see the “Fast
Facts” section of Chapter 12. For the rest
of the country, check at local Tourist Infor-
mation Centres to find out if you can get
public Internet access. Cybercafes are
found only in larger cities; public libraries in
smaller towns often have Internet access.
Liquor Laws
No alcohol is served to anyone under 18.
Children under 16 aren’t allowed in pubs

except in certain rooms and then only when
accompanied by a parent or guardian.
Restaurants can serve liquor during the
same hours as pubs (see “Business Hours,”
earlier in this Appendix, for these hours);
however, only people who are eating a meal
on the premises can get a drink. In hotels,
liquor may be served 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. to
both guests and nonguests; after 11 p.m.,
only guests may be served.
Mail
At press time, postcards and airmail letters
to North America cost 54p ($1.10) for ten
grams; letters generally take seven to ten
days to arrive from the United States.
Travel time for letters to the United States
from the United Kingdom varies wildly but
usually takes between seven and ten days
as well. You can send mail within the
United Kingdom first or second class. See
“Post Offices,” later in this Appendix.
Maps
London A to Z, which you can find in vari-
ous formats from news agents and book-
stores, is the best street directory to
London. You can obtain a London bus and
Underground map at any Underground 
station. If you drive through England, get
one of the best road atlases: the large-
format maps produced by the Automobile
Association (AA), Collins, Ordnance Survey,
and Royal Automobile Club (RAC). The best
maps for walkers are the detailed Ordnance
Survey maps; check out their selection,
including digital maps, online at www.
ordsvy.gov.uk. London’s Stanfords,
12–14 Long Acre, WC2 (% 02078/361-321;
Tube: Leicester Square), is the world’s
largest map shop.
Newspapers/Magazines
The Times, Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail,
Guardian, and Evening Standard are all
dailies carrying the latest news. The
International Herald Tribune, published in
Paris, and an international edition of USA
Today, beamed via satellite, are available
daily. Copies of Time and Newsweek are
also sold at most newsstands.
Pharmacies
Pharmacies are called chemists in the
United Kingdom. Boots is a chain of
chemists with outlets all over the country.
Make sure that you bring generic pre-
scriptions with you, not brand names. 
Be aware, however, that an existing pre-
scription from another country cannot be
refilled in England without authorization
from a U.K. doctor. For a list of pharmacies
in London, see “Pharmacies” in the “Fast
Facts” section of Chapter 12.
Police
In an emergency, dial % 999 (you don’t
need to pay when calling from a public
phone).
Post Offices
In London, the Main Post Office, 24 William
IV St., WC2 (% 02079/309-580; Tube:
Charing Cross), is open Monday through
Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Other post
offices and sub-post offices (windows in
the back of news-agent stores) throughout
the country are open Monday through
Friday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 9
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Many sub-post offices
and some main post offices close for an
hour at lunchtime. A red sign identifies
post offices.
Restrooms
The English often call toilets loos. In
London, they’re marked by PUBLIC TOILETS
signs on streets, parks, and Tube stations.
You also find well-maintained lavatories
that anybody can use in all larger public
buildings, such as museums and art gal-
leries, large department stores, and rail
stations. Toilets are always available at
Appendix: Quick Concierge 429

England For Dummies, 4th Edition 
430
major tourist attractions. Public lavatories
are usually free, but you may need a 20p
coin to get in or to use a proper washroom.
In some places (like Leicester Square in
London), you find coin-operated toilets that
are sterilized after each use.
Safety
In London, as in any large metropolis, use
common sense and normal caution when
you’re in a crowded public area or walking
alone at night.
Smoking
As of July 2007, smoking is prohibited in all
public areas throughout the U.K., including
restaurants and pubs. Nonsmoking rooms
are available in more and more hotels, and
many B&Bs are now entirely smoke-free.
Taxes
The 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) is
added to all hotel and restaurant bills and
is included in the price of most items you
purchase. You can get a refund if you shop
at stores that participate in the Duty-Free
Shopping scheme (signs are posted in the
window). See Chapter 5 for details on get-
ting your VAT refunded.
Taxis
In London, you can hail a cab from the
street; if the “For Hire” light is lit, it means
the cab is available. You can phone for a
London radio cab at % 02072/720-272.
Elsewhere, you can often find taxis waiting
outside train and bus stations, although it’s
a good idea to reserve a taxi in advance at
smaller stations in the country.
Telephone
For information on using your cellphone in
England, or renting one when you arrive,
see Chapter 10. Cellphones are called
“mobiles” (mo-biles) in England.
For directory assistance, dial % 192. The
country code for the United Kingdom is 44.
To call England from the United States, dial
011-44, the area or city code, and then the
6-, 7-, or 8-digit phone number. If you’re in
England and dialing a number within the
same area code, the local number is all
you need.
Three types of public pay phones are avail-
able in England: those that take only coins;
those that accept only phone cards; and
those that take coins, phone cards, and
credit cards. Phone cards are available in
various values — from £3 ($6), £5 ($10), 
£10 ($20) up to £20 ($40) — and are
reusable until the total value has expired.
You can buy the cards from newsstands
and post offices. At coin-operated phones,
insert your coins before dialing. The mini-
mum charge is 40p (80¢). The credit-call
pay phone operates on credit cards:
Access (which is interchangeable with
MasterCard), American Express, Diners
Club, and Visa. You find these types of pay
phones most commonly at airports and
large rail stations.
To make an international call from England,
dial the international access code (00),
then the country code, then the area code,
and finally the local number. Or call through
one of the following long-distance access
codes: AT&T USA Direct (% 0800/890-
011), Canada Direct (% 0800/890-016),
Australia (% 0800/890-061), and New
Zealand (% 0800/890-064). Common coun-
try codes are United States and Canada, 1;
Australia, 61; and New Zealand, 64.
Time Zone
England follows Greenwich mean time
(five hours ahead of eastern standard
time). Clocks move forward one hour on
the last Sunday in March and back one
hour on the last Sunday in October. Most

Appendix: Quick Concierge 431
of the year, including summer, Britain is
five hours ahead of the time observed on
the East Coast of the United States. Because
the United States and Britain observe day-
light saving time at slightly different times
of year, Britain is only four hours ahead of
New York for a brief period (about a week)
in autumn, and it’s six hours ahead of New
York for a brief period in spring.
Tipping
In restaurants, they often add service
charges of 15 to 20 percent to the bill.
Sometimes, this tip is clearly marked; other
times, it isn’t. When in doubt, ask. If serv-
ice isn’t included, adding 15 percent to the
bill is customary. Sommeliers get about £1
($2) per bottle of wine served. Tipping in
pubs isn’t done, but in cocktail bars the
server usually gets about £1 ($2) per round
of drinks. Tipping taxi drivers 10 to 15 per-
cent of the fare is standard. Barbers and
hairdressers expect 10 to 15 percent. Tour
guides expect £2 ($4), although this tip isn’t
mandatory.
