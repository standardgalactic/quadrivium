Creating code
A typical coder’s 
screen is filled with 
code like this.
What is a coder?
Coders, or programmers, are people who write 
the code for computer programs—a set of 
instructions that tell computers what to do. 
Many coders teach themselves how to code, 
others learn at school. Coders need a variety of 
different skills in order to build good programs. 
Code in teams 
While many coders work 
alone, most of them work in 
teams. Working in teams 
means programs are finished 
faster and with fewer errors. 
Teamwork also helps  
coders learn new skills  
from others.
Logical thinking 
Computers follow rules  
and logic when running 
programs. Coders need  
to be able to think like a 
computer when writing 
code, and build in all 
the steps necessary 
for the program 
to work.
Many 
languages
Being able to code in different 
computer languages is a valuable 
skill. It is important for programmers 
to keep learning new coding languages 
in order to create modern programs.
Coders working together

Accuracy 
Coders must always check 
and recheck code to make 
sure programs will work 
correctly. The instructions 
need to be clear, detailed, 
and broken down into small 
chunks that are easy  
to follow.
How do you  
become a coder?
You’re never too young to learn 
how to code. There are many 
books that teach coding, as well as 
plenty of information online. You 
can also learn to code at school, or 
you could find out if there are any 
coding clubs near you.

Staying up to date
Technology is constantly 
changing. Coders must stay up to 
date with the latest programming 
languages and techniques. This 
can help them find jobs and 
build programs for the 
latest devices.

Codes around us
When we think of coding, we think of computers, 
but codes are all around us. Throughout history, 
humans have created many different codes for 
communicating. Some codes are used to send 
secret messages, while others deliver information 
across long distances. People who cannot see or 
hear can use codes to speak to each other.
Picture language
Ancient Egyptians didn’t 
have an alphabet system. 
Instead, they used a 
series of pictures called 
hieroglyphs to represent 
sounds and words.
Morse code
Morse code sent messages long 
distance along electric wires. 
Each letter was represented by a 
series of dots and dashes tapped 
out on a special machine.

raised dots represent letters and numbers.
Semaphore flags
Semaphore is a system of signaling 
with hand-held flags. It is often used 
by ships at sea because the flags are 
easy to see from far away. The flags 
are held in different positions to 
signal letters and numbers.

As deaf people can’t hear 
sounds, they can use sign 
language to communicate. 
Letters, numbers, and words 
can be shown using a variety 
of hand signs.

Coding before 
computers
Even before the invention of the modern 
computer, people were creating code. Many 
early programs took the form of cards 
punched with holes, which represented a 
set of instructions. These cards were read 
by machines to perform different tasks.
Jacquard loom
This weaving machine was made by Joseph Jacquard. 
It could weave patterns in fabric by following 
instructions from cards punched with holes.
Census machine
Herman Hollerith invented this 
machine to record data for the 1890 
US census. It used punched cards  
to record information 
such as age  
and gender.

French mathematician Blaise Pascal. 
It was a simple calculating device 
that could add and subtract.
Sums were 
calculated by the 
movement of 
drums and gears 
inside the box.
A clerk would sit at 
the desk and insert

Player piano
From the 1850s, a number of pianos 
were invented that played themselves. 
They were called player pianos. Many 
used a paper music roll with holes to 
control which notes were played.

from 1840
Coding pioneer
In 1842, English mathematician Ada Lovelace 
became the world’s first computer programmer. 
She is best known for her work on an early 
mechanical computer made by Charles Babbage. 
She helped to pave the way for the future of 
computers. This is an imaginary conversation  
with the clever countess.
Q: Ada, when did you find out you 
were good at math? 
A: Very early on. Even as a child,  
I remember being good at solving 
mathematical problems.
Q: Do you come from a family  
of mathematical geniuses?
A: Not at all!  However, my father  
was the celebrated poet, Lord 
Byron. I had tutors to teach me 
science and mathematics and 
although it was unusual for  
a young girl to learn these 
subjects, I soon found I was  
good at them. 
Q: How did you meet computer 
genius Charles Babbage?
A: I was lucky enough to meet him  
in 1833 while he was teaching at 
Cambridge University in England.

Interview with Ada Lovelace

The Analytical Engine 
(1837) was designed 
by Charles Babbage  
to solve more complex 
math calculations than 
ever before.
Modern-day 
laptop computer
He showed me a version of his  
machine called the Difference Engine.  
It was designed to stop people getting  
math calculations wrong. 
Q: Is it right that Charles has given  
you a nickname?
A: Yes! Charles calls me the “Enchantress 
of Numbers” and he is called the “Father 
of Computing.”
Q: Tell us about the 
machine that you worked 
on with Charles. 
A: The Analytical Engine 
was the second machine 
designed by Charles,  
and it was fascinating! 
Charles gave me the 
designs for the machine.  
I realized that it could 
use codes made up of 
letters, symbols, and 
numbers to solve 
problems. It was the first 
computer that could  
be programmed. 
Q: When did you actually write 
your computer program?
A: In 1842, I wrote a set of  
instructions and showed  
they could be used by the  
computer to solve a  
mathematics problem.  
A science journal  
in England published  
my findings. 
Q: So you are the first computer 
programmer? 
A: Well, yes, but I don’t like to brag!  
What excites me most is this machine’s 
potential. It is more than a calculator. 
The possibilities are endless! I believe  
all types of different things can be 
converted into computer code. Who 
knows what the future of computer 
coding will bring!

Top secret
The word “code” refers to a set 
of rules. Coders use these rules 
to tell computers what to do. 
However, codes can also be used 
to keep secrets. Throughout 
history, people have created 
codes to hide what a message 
says. A coded message can only 
be read if you know the secret 
rules to decode it.
Polybius Square
The Greek historian Polybius worked for the 
Romans. He created a new code for their 
armies, using a square grid which matched 
each letter in the Greek alphabet to a pair of 
numbers. People with the same square could 
exchange messages written only in numbers.
Alberti formula
In 1467, the Italian architect Leon Alberti 
invented a disk with two wheels, which could 
be rotated to swap one letter in a message for 
another. To swap the letters back and decode 
the message, you needed to know how the two 
disks had been rotated.
Caesar shift
The Roman general and emperor Julius 
Caesar swapped each letter in his secret 
messages with a different one. Every letter 
moved a set number of spaces forward in the 
alphabet, so in a one-shift code, “A” would 
become “B.”
Scytale
The Ancient Greeks of Sparta would scramble 
their messages by writing them on leather or 
parchment wrapped around a rod or stick. 
Then they added extra letters, so when the 
message was unwrapped from the rod, it 
became a meaningless jumble.
Hail, Caesar!
Julius Caesar’s code was very simple, but it 
worked for centuries. Most of his enemies could 
not read very well, so they thought he was 
writing his messages in a foreign language.

13
How it works 
Find the letter you want 
to encode. Then, 
connect the number 
above it and the 
number to the left  
of it. On the grid here,  
A is 11, while CAR is 31, 
11, 24.
How it works 
The letters of the 
message only lined up 
correctly if the reader 
wrapped the strip of 
paper around a rod the 
same size as the one 
used to create it.
How it works
To decode a two-shift 
Caesar shift, move each 
letter in your message 
two spaces back in the 
alphabet. DCA would 
become BAY. Check  
the two rows on the  
left for examples.
How it works
Find each letter, 
number, or symbol  
you need on the inner 
wheel, and replace it 
with the matching 
letter on the outer 
wheel. The wheels must 
be in the same position 
to decode the message.
The wheels are 
rotated at 
random.
Four wheels are 
more secure 
than two.

The Enigma code
In the 1930s, Germany wanted to control other 
countries. In 1939, it invaded Poland. Britain and 
France declared war in response, and World War II 
began. The war was fought with new technology 
like tanks, radar, and the top-secret Enigma machine.
These secret orders made it impossible 
to track down the deadly German 
submarines, called U-boats.
The Germans used a machine called Enigma to encode 
their messages. This allowed them to surprise their 
enemies, and communicate with their spies.
Enigma machine
In World War II, armies fought on land, air, and sea, and 
moved between battles quickly. Telegraph and radio were 
used to send orders across huge distances. 

15
Hurray!
Victory!
Some of the world’s first computers  
were used at Bletchley Park, designed  
by top scientists and engineers like 
Alan Turing.
In Britain, more than 10,000 people worked to  
break the Enigma code at a top-secret base called 
Bletchley Park, or “Station X.” 
Germany’s control of the sea was broken. 
On May 7, 1945, Germany surrendered. 
On October 30, 1942, three 
British sailors rescued a working 
Enigma machine from a sinking 
German U-boat.
These machines helped Britain 
break Enigma, and control  
the sea.
We got the 
codes!

16
Alan Turing
Englishman Alan Turing was a math and 
science genius. When World War II started, he 
joined Bletchley Park, a top-secret base, where 
he worked to break enemy codes and uncover 
Germany’s plans. His inventions and ideas 
began the age of modern computers.
Secret work
Turing’s work on codes and computing was so 
secret that few people were allowed to know 
about it, even after the war ended. Today, he 
is recognized as “the father of computing.”
Turing machine
In 1936, Turing wrote about 
an imaginary machine that 
could perform any task, 
if it was given the right 
set of instructions. 
He never built one, 
but we call the idea 
a Turing machine.
Hidden voices
In 1944, Turing helped 
develop SIGSALY, a secure 
way of encrypting radio 
messages using random 
noise. It was also called the 
Green Hornet, because 
anyone listening in would 
only hear buzzing.
The Turing Award is a 
yearly computing prize. 
Google gives the winner
$1,000,000.
!
REALLY?
Each Bombe was 7 ft  
(2 m) wide, and weighed 
1 ton (0.9  m tons).

17
Bombe machine
In 1939, Turing designed the 
Bombe. This early computer cracked 
enemy codes by testing every 
possible combination the Enigma 
machine could use. Over 200 ran 
day and night at Bletchley Park.
Tiger stripes
After the war, Turing used 
math to explore new kinds of 
science. In 1951, he created 
an equation to explain how 
patterns form in living 
creatures, like stripes on 
tigers, or the number of 
fingers on a hand.
Turing test
In 1950, Turing imagined  
a test to decide if a computer 
was “intelligent.” A human 
would communicate with a 
hidden partner and try to 
decide if they were 
really human, or 
a computer.
Computer chess
Turing published the world’s 
first chess-playing program, 
Turochamp, in 1951. No 
computer had enough power 
to run it, so Turing used the 
program’s rules to 
decide his moves in a 
real chess game.

18
The first computer
In 1943, engineers in the US began designing a machine 
that could be programmed to solve different math 
problems. This was the Electronic Numerical Integrator 
And Computer (ENIAC, “en-ee-ack”)—the first computer. 
The ENIAC could follow 5,000 instructions per second, 
which was 1,000 times faster than the calculators of the 
time. It was huge and filled a whole room.

19
The ENIAC weighed  
30 tons (27 m tons)— 
 the same as five 
elephants.
!
REALLY?
How it worked
The ENIAC did not have “insides”  
as modern computers do. Instead, 
its parts were fixed to 40 panels. 
Each panel had hundreds of wires, 
switches, and tubes attached to it. 
Men and women worked side by side  
to program the ENIAC.
Programming the ENIAC
Each time the ENIAC was programmed, everything 
had to be moved around by hand. Setting it up to 
perform a single task could take weeks.
Vacuum tubes
Vacuum tubes look a bit like light bulbs. 
They act like on/off switches, making or 
breaking electrical circuits.
The ENIAC  
had more  
than 17,000 
vacuum tubes

20
Multitasking 
machines
The more tasks a computer can handle at 
once, the faster it can complete them all. 
The first computers could only handle one 
task, but these days a laptop or cellphone 
can perform thousands of separate tasks, 
called processes, at the same time. 
The heaviest 
computer ever was 
the SAGE system, at 
250 tons 
(226.8 m tons).

Z3
The Z3, built in Germany, was the world’s first 
programmable computer. Older computers 
needed to be rewired to run new programs, but 
the Z3 stored its programs on paper tape. It was 
destroyed by bombs during World War II.

21
SSEM
The Small-Scale Experimental Machine 
(SSEM) was built at Manchester 
University, UK. It was the first computer 
to store programs on its own memory, 
instead of on tape.
IBM System/360
The IBM 360 was the first series of 
computers to use programs that worked 
on more than one machine. They were 
designed to be affordable, so businesses 
could buy or rent them.
UNIVAC I
The UNIVAC I was the first 
computer to be sold to the 
public in the US. Its name 
stood for “Universal 
Automatic Computer.” 
The UNIVAC I’s memory 
used seven large tanks of 
liquid mercury, which picked 
up electrical signals from 
pulses of sound sent by 
quartz crystals.

Think like  
a computer
Computers cannot think for themselves. 
They follow very specific instructions 
given by programmers. These 
instructions must be exact but simple. 
Programmers often break down complex 
instructions into smaller steps that are 
easier to follow.
Follow the rules
This robot must get across the maze, 
following set steps like a computer does. 
It must follow the rules below. The 
algorithm has the same information as 
the rules, but written so that a computer 
(the robot) can follow them.

turning left or right.
Computers do 
not “think,”  
they follow

Each time the robot hits an 
obstacle, it follows the rules 
again, starting at the beginning 
of the algorithm.

called an algorithm before 
they write any code. For 
example, programming a 
robot to put on a pair of 
socks might follow this 
simple algorithm.
Locate the sock
Pick up the sock
Place sock on 
one foot
Repeat steps 1-3 
for other foot

Early 
games
Coders have been making  
games since the early days of 
computing. All the games we  
play need code, whether played 
on a computer, a television,  
or a cellphone. These images  
look simple now, but when  
they were created they  
were groundbreaking!
The Atari 2600 was one of the earliest 
and most popular gaming systems sold 
for home use, from 1977. Games were 
small, rectangular plastic boxes that 
slotted into the box, called a console. 
The controls had joysticks for 
movement and a single “fire” button.
Atari 2600
PONG
Pong was created in 1972 by Atari. Two 
players used paddles with rotating knobs to 
bounce a “ball” back and forth. A point was 
scored when the other player missed the 
ball. There were two versions: an arcade 
game and one that attached to a television. 
One of the earliest arcade games was  
Space Invaders, released in 1978. Aliens 
moved across the sky, and the player 
fired missiles up at them to try to stop 
the aliens from landing.

Created for the Atari 2600 in 1979, 
Adventure allowed the player to fight 
dragons and hunt treasure. It was the 
first game to feature an Easter Egg—a 
hidden secret added by the programmer.
Some early games had no graphics. 
Instead, players read descriptions and 
typed in commands. Zork I, released in 
1977, was one of the most popular 
text-adventure games. Players explored 
tunnels beneath a house, fighting 
monsters and trying to survive.
In the mid-1980s, the Nintendo NES 
was the most popular gaming console 
in the world. Its games came in plastic 
boxes, and players used a chunky gray 
controller with a handful of buttons.
PAC-MAN
In this game from 1980, players used a 
joystick to direct Pac-Man, a small yellow 
circle, around a maze. Pac-Man ate dots to 
get points and had to avoid being eaten by 
four ghosts that chased him.

Inside a 
computer
The physical parts of a computer  
are called hardware. Coders need to 
understand how computer hardware 
works so that they can write the code 
that tells computers what to do.
Hard drive
This is where most of the 
computer’s data is stored.
RAM
Random Access Memory is 
short-term memory that 
stores information only 
when the power is on.
Storage
Computer data needs to be saved 
so that it can be shared and used 
again. This is done using storage. 
Today, we save data using “clouds,” 
a form of Internet storage. Here 
are some physical storage devices, 
some of which we still use.
Floppy disk
From the 1970s, data  
was stored on thin disks 
protected by plastic covers.
Punched tape
Early computers in the 1950s 
and 60s stored data as holes 
on punched tape.

27
Processor
This is the “brain” of the 
computer. It performs  
most of the calculations that 
make the computer work.
Motherboard
This large circuit board  
holds the processor. 
Everything connects  
to it, so that different  
parts of the computer  
can communicate.
Screen
Text and images 
are displayed here.
Battery
Computers need power to 
work. The battery powers  
a laptop when it is not 
plugged in.
CD
A CD uses a laser to write data 
onto a disk. It can store much 
more data than a floppy disk. 
USB
Memory sticks hold more data 
than DVDs. They plug straight 
into a computer.
DVD
DVDs have better sound and 
more space than CDs, so are 
used to store video files.
The first laptop 
computer was 
released in 1981.

USBs are smaller than 
other storage devices, 
but can hold much 
more data.

The keyboard featured 
three switches used to 
run programs, record 
data, and print results.
The Programma 101 could print 
30 characters (numbers, letters, 
or symbols) per second.
The blue light meant the 
machine was running and 
ready for input, while the 
red light indicated an error.
Then and now
Computers have changed a lot over the years. 
Early computers were large enough to fill whole 
rooms, but modern computers are small enough 
to fit into a backpack. By the 1960s, people were 
able to buy their own personal computer for 
their home. 
Programma 101
In 1965, the Italian company, Olivetti, made 
history by creating the world’s first personal 
desktop computer, Programma 101. This 
groundbreaking piece of technology was 
designed to work out complicated math 
calculations. It was easy to use and could  
fit comfortably on a desk.

The display screen is clear 
and sharp, allowing users 
to view and edit images, 
create documents, play 
games, and access  
the Internet.
Data that is typed on 
the keyboard appears 
immediately on the 
display screen. 
 
A handheld, movable 
device called a mouse  
is used to move around 
the screen.
Modern machine
Compared to the Programma 101, modern computers 
are much lighter and have a wider range of functions. 
These devices can be used at home and some can also 
be used on the move. Modern computers use smaller 
processors, called microprocessors, to store, process, 
and display huge amounts of data.

Talk like a 
computer
The English language has 26 letters in its 
alphabet, but computers and other digital 
devices only “speak” in 0s and 1s. Can you 
imagine having to talk to a friend using 
only 0s and 1s? 
Binary
All computers communicate 
using two values called binary. 
“1” means a signal is “on” and  
“0” means the signal is “off.” 
Think of a light switch; by 
turning the light on, you can 
send the message “1” to a friend 
in the distance, while off sends  
the message “0.”
All computer  
information  
is stored as  
0s and 1s. 
!
REALLY?
Bytes
A byte of data is made up of 
eight bits. Each bit is a 0 or 1. 
One byte of data can represent 
one of 255 different letters, 
numbers, or symbols. 
Bits
A single bit 
is a 0 or 1.
Byte
Eight bits are grouped together  
to create one byte of data, which 
translates to a letter, number, or 
symbol. This is A.

Communication
The devices that make up a 
computer all communicate  
in binary by moving bytes  
of data. Everything they “say” 
to each other is made up of  
a string of 0s and 1s. 
STORING DATA
How many bytes?
Computer storage is described using 
bytes. These units show how many 0s 
and 1s the computer has space for.

1 terabyte is 1,024 Gigabytes
5 
1 petabyte is 1,024 Terabytes
6 
1 exabyte is 1,024 Petabytes
ASCII
To turn binary numbers into characters 
people recognize, computers use ASCII 
(“askey”), the American Standard Code 
for Information Interchange. Each set  
of eight binary numbers represents a 
number, letter, or symbol in ASCII code. 
Hard drive
The hard drive is 
the main storage area 
for billions of 0s and 1s. 
This stores the bytes 
even while the 
computer is off.
RAM
RAM means 
Random Access 
Memory. Bytes of data 
are stored here while the 
computer is on. The data 
is lost if the user has 
not saved it.
Processor
The central 
processing unit (CPU) is 
the “brain” of a computer, 
sending and receiving 
bytes of data. This carries 
out calculations and 
instructions. 
All data stored is a 
series of electrical 
pulses that are either 
on, “1” or off, “0.”
Bytes of data move 
back and forth 
constantly.

Match the computer language to the code!
Computer languages
A programming language is a set of instructions that tell a 
computer what to do. Hundreds of languages have been made 
for different types of programs. The six bubbles of code below 
all tell a computer how to say “Hello, World!” Can you match 
each one with its language, using the clues to help?

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
 
printf(“Hello, World!”);
}
10 PRINT “Hello, World!”
20 GOTO 10
print(“Hello, World!”)
Clue:
The Java program begins 
with the word “class.”
Clue:
Python is the easiest and 
shortest code to read.
Clue:
The name of the language 
is in the actual code.

BASIC
BASIC is one of the oldest 
programming languages.  
It stands for Beginner’s 
All-Purpose Symbolic 
Instruction Code.
C
C is one of the world’s most 
widely used languages, but it 
can be tricky to learn. It is 
often used to make software 
that needs to run fast. 
Scratch
Scratch was created to teach 
beginners how to code. 
Instead of typing out code, 
readymade blocks are used 
to build instructions.

words. These are “Ook.,” “Ook!,”  
and “Ook?.” They can be put together 
to make commands.

Programs
Whether you say program, app, or code, what you’re describing 
is a special set of instructions called “software.” Most modern 
devices are controlled by software. This includes cellphones, 
tablets, satellites in space, cars, planes, and even robots on Mars. 
Software is all created by programmers, who are also known  
as coders.
Apps
Each app on a phone or tablet is a 
tiny program that works by itself. 
Apps can do all sorts of things. They 
let you take photos, send messages, 
and play music and games.
Drones
Drones are devices that do not  
need a pilot to make them fly. 
Instead, a person uses a remote 
control and special software.  
They are used to take photos  
and videos.

35
From coder to user
There’s more to apps than just code. Coders 
spend a lot of time making their apps work 
smoothly, but they need to get the app out 
to all the people who might use it. Someone 
has to create instructions for using the app. 
Sometimes the app needs some help in the 
forms of advertising and marketing, and 
word of mouth is a great way to do this. 
Sharing and talking about the app means 
that it can get a lot more users, and could 
even go viral. This means that it has been 
spoken about and shared between  
many people.
There’s an 
app for that!
Mars Rover
The Mars Exploration Rover B  
is exploring the surface of Mars.  
It uses special code that allows  
it to work over 140 million miles  
(225 million km) away  
from Earth.
Surgical robots
Some surgeons rely on robots  
to help with the most delicate 
operations. The robot has special 
code for each of its arms that help  
the surgeon with important tasks.

36
Backdoor programs
Backdoor programs ignore your computer’s 
normal security and allow hackers to break  
in without a password. 
Trojan horse
A Trojan horse is a file that pretends to be 
harmless. Once opened, however, it loads a 
program that takes control of your computer.
Computer hackers
Hackers are people who write bad 
programs, called malware, to gain 
illegal access to a computer. They 
can then steal information, like 
passwords or personal details. They 
can also damage or delete important 
data on the computer.
Computer virus
A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself 
to a program on a computer and runs 
automatically, destroying files.
Worms and bugs
Computers don’t always run smoothly. Some people 
spread bad code, such as worms, to damage or steal 
information on a computer. Programs may also stop 
working if there are errors in the code. These are 
called bugs. Anti-virus programs and “firewalls” are 
software that can protect computers from bad code.
Computer errors 
have been called 
bugs since 1945, 
when a university 
computer in the 
US was found  
to have a moth 
inside it.

37
Sniffers
Sniffers monitor information traveling over a 
computer network. They capture the passwords 
and user IDs of anyone using the network.
Computer worms
Computer worms infect networks by sending copies 
of themselves to all the machines in the system. They 
are harder to stop than viruses because they do not 
have to attach themselves to a program.
Bugs
A bug is a mistake or fault 
found in a computer 
program or system. Bugs  
can cause a program to run 
incorrectly—for example,  
by showing strange text or 
objects on the screen. They 
can also cause a program to 
stop working completely.
Vulnerability scanners
Hackers use programs called vulnerability scanners 
to look for weaknesses in a computer’s “firewall” 
(protection) system.
Keylogging
Keylogging lets hackers monitor every key that 
is pressed on someone’s keyboard without 
them knowing. This lets them see the user’s 
passwords or other private information.
switch (i) {
  case 1:
    do_something(1); break;
  case 2:
    do_something(2); break;
  case 3:
    do_something(1); break;
  case 4:
    do_something(4); break;
  default:
    break;
}
This is an error in  
the code—a bug.  
Case 1 has incorrectly 
been copied under  
case 3.

38
Slow information
We use the Internet to find 
things out almost instantly. 
Without it we would have to 
find a book about what we 
wanted to know, and then  
look it up, which would take  
a lot longer.
The Internet
The Internet is a network that links together 
computers all over the world. It was first thought 
of in the 1960s, but was only used by a handful 
of people in universities. Now, millions of people 
use it every day, to communicate with each other, 
to find things out, and for entertainment. It lets 
us do many things quickly and easily that would 
otherwise take much longer.
Snail mail
We send around 2.4  
million emails every second. 
To send that many messages 
by mail would cost about 
$165 million, and  
the letters would  
take several days  
to arrive!
Map reading
Cellphones use satellites in 
space to show positions on 
maps. Without the Internet, 
phones would not be in touch 
with satellites, so wouldn’t  
be able to show you  
where you are.

39
What to watch?
The Internet lets us watch 
movies instantly. We can 
download whatever we 
want at the click of a 
button instead of having  
to find and watch DVDs.
Social not working
Social networking apps  
let you talk with your friends 
all the time.
You can chat, arrange to  
meet up, and share the latest 
news with large groups of 
friends at once. 
Sending files
The Internet lets us  
share and download files 
instantly. Without it we 
could only share using 
wires between computers 
or by putting copies in  
the mail.
Shopping
You can buy almost anything 
you want using the Internet, 
from food and drink to giant 
plastic elephants! Everything 
is put in the mail to you,  
so you don’t have to go to  
the shops.

40
What is an app?
Apps are sets of instructions written in code. They are mostly 
used on phones and tablets, to do lots of different things, from 
playing games to making video calls. There are plenty of apps 
designed especially for kids.
Idea
People have ideas for new 
apps. These apps often try to 
do something useful, for which 
an app doesn’t already exist.
Design
The look of an app and how 
people use it is important. 
Popular apps usually look good 
and are easy to use.
App building
Apps on your phone or 
computer don’t just 
appear fully formed. It 
takes a lot of work to get 
them from a first idea to 
a finished program. 
Here’s how it’s done. 
Gaming 
Quizzes, races, and puzzles are all fun, 
popular types of game apps. Some are free, 
but others charge money for things within 
the game, so be careful!
Shopping 
Shopping apps let people buy things without 
leaving the house. Most big stores have apps. 
You can also bid against other people to buy 
things in auctions.

Smartphones
Smartphones are mini computers that 
you can carry around. Unlike a desktop 
computer, they are small enough to use 
on the go. Smartphones have an 
operating system. This is a built-in set of 
instructions that lets apps work. Apple’s 
iOS and Google’s Android are the two 
most popular operating systems.
Smartphones in action
Programming
Every app is made up of code. 
The code is tested many times 
before the app is released, to 
make sure it works properly.
Feedback
Once the app is in use, people give 
feedback about what does and 
doesn’t work. Programmers tweak 
the code until it works perfectly.
Maps 
These apps use the Internet to pinpoint your 
location on a map. They can show you where 
you are, and help you find where you want  
to go quickly and easily.
Communication 
Phones aren’t just for making calls.  
Apps let people talk in lots of different 
ways, including using video calls, picture 
messages, and group chats.
In 2016, over two 
million apps were 
available for 
smartphones.

Everyday coding
Although we can’t see them, codes are all around us, helping  
us every day. Computers use code to make modern technology  
run smoothly. Here are some examples of coding in everyday life.
Traffic lights
Coding is used to 
control the flow of 
traffic in many towns 
and cities. A 
computer sends 
coded instructions  
to the traffic lights  
to tell them when  
to change color. 
Drivers and people 
on foot then know 
when to stop and 
when to go. 
Vending machines
After you have inserted money and 
made your selection from a vending 
machine, the code will figure out how 
much change you need, and then drop 
your item down to a tray for you to  
pick up.
Computer games
Computer games can take players  
to imaginary worlds. Every game has code 
working behind the scenes that becomes 
instructions to make your character jump 
high or your car go faster. 
Microwaves
Simple coded instructions control the 
timer on your microwave and the 
temperature your food is cooked at. 
The code starts working when you 
press the buttons on the microwave.

43
Vehicles
Cars use computer code to monitor their 
engines and make sure they run well.  
Code also controls things like the blinkers 
on the dashboard and windshield wipers.
Smartboard
These giant screens use computer coded instructions 
to let students choose and control what information 
is shown. All they have to do is touch the screen.
Calculator
Calculators use code to figure out the answers 
to mathematical questions. They display  
the results immediately on the screen.
Beep!
Barcode 
scanner
Every item in a store 
has a unique code of 
lines to identify it. These 
lines, or barcodes, are read by  
a computer that finds the item and 
its price in a database so you can buy it.

Scratch
One of the easiest programming languages to learn is 
Scratch. Programs are made by joining together colored 
blocks that tell characters on screen what to do. Scratch 
lets you make your own stories, games, music, and art.

Characters in 
Scratch are called 
sprites.
You can change the 
background picture 
to suit your project.
The blocks contain 
many different 
instructions.
The blocks of 
instructions are 
called scripts.
This is the stage, 
where you will see 
what you create.
Scratch layout
The screen layout has space for your 
instructions on the right. On the left is the 
“stage,” where your code is put into action.

Sprites
Sprites are the characters that are used 
in Scratch. They are controlled by coded 
sets of instructions called scripts. 
Sprites can move around, talk in speech 
bubbles, and appear and disappear.
Leg 
moves 
out.
Sword moves  
down.
Draw your own sprites
Scratch has many sprites that you can 
choose from. There’s also a drawing 
tool so you can create your own.
Pirate costume 1
Costumes are pictures of 
sprites in different poses. 
Swapping costumes can 
make this pirate move.
Pirate costume 2
When switching from 
costume 1 to costume 2, 
the pirate’s leg and sword 
appear to move.

SCRATCH FACTS
1 
Scratch was invented at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT).
2 
Scratch is available in more than

Key coders
Computing has changed a lot 
since the first computers were 
invented, and programmers 
across the globe are working on 
new technology all the time. 
Some people create things that 
change our world. How many  
of these famous coders do you 
know about?
English computer programmer Tim 
Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 
1989. The World Wide Web links Internet 
web pages together, and is now used by 
millions of people across the globe.
University student Mark Zuckerberg 
became one of the youngest billionaires in 
the world when he created social media 
website Facebook in 2004. The site had one 
million users within ten months.
A Rear Admiral in the US Navy as well as a 
computer scientist, Grace Hopper created 
the world’s first computer compiler—a 
program that converts ordinary language 
into code that a computer can understand.

American computer programmer Margaret 
Hamilton worked for the US space agency, 
NASA. She was responsible for developing 
the on-board flight software that landed 
the first people on the Moon in 1969.
Founders of technology company Apple, 
Americans Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak  
built one of the earliest home computers 
in 1976. Now the Apple brand is one of the 
most successful in the world.
Google, the world’s most popular search 
engine, was created by Sergey Brin and 
Larry Page in 1998. Today, around 80 to 85 
percent of all Internet queries are typed 
into Google’s search engine.
American Bill Gates co-founded Microsoft, 
a computer software company, in 1975. 
Ten years later, Microsoft created Windows, 
now the most widely used operating 
system in the world.

Meet the expert
Coder and author Jeff Atwood co-created Stack 
Overflow, a website for answering questions 
about coding, and Discourse, a program for 
communicating online. 
Q: We know it is something to do with 
coding, but what is your actual job?
A: My job is to write commands that tell the 
computer what to do, and to give it 
commands that make it do a better job.
Q:  What made you decide to become  
a software developer?
A:  I’ve always loved computers and 
computer games, and once I saw that I 
could build my own games—not just play 
games other people create—I was hooked.
Q:  Do you have a favorite thing that you 
have developed?
A:  We built Stack Overflow, which is like a 
Wikipedia for programmers!
Q: Do you use any special equipment?
A:  We use fast computers, with lots of 
memory. We also use multiple monitors 
and nice chairs.
Q: What do you love most about coding?
A: Software is easy to change to make it 
better, and software can also encourage 
people to do better things and help others.
Q: What is a usual work day for you?
A: I work from home, so I get up and head 
to my home office. I talk to my team via 
the Internet.
Q:  What are the best and worst things 
about your job?
A:  The best thing about my job is that 
software can touch so many people—
through their smartphones, through their 
laptops and computers. The worst thing 
about my job is that I spend a lot of time 
talking to the computer. It can be 
unforgiving when you make mistakes, 
even tiny ones!

Q: We know it is something to do with 
coding, but what is your actual job?
A: I travel all over the place, showing  
students and teachers how to think like  
a computer scientist. 
Q:  What made you decide to become a 
computer scientist?
A:  My dad taught me to program when I was 
a little girl. I enjoy the problem solving and 
creativity of computer science.
Q:  Do you have a favorite thing that you 
have worked on?
A:  The project that I’m working on right now 
teaches computer science using books, 
games, and craft projects. It’s a new way of 
introducing kids to coding.
Q: Do you use any special equipment?
A: I get to play with computers, tablets, 
3D printers, learning games, and robots 
like Dot and Dash! 
Q: What do you love most about coding?
A: Computer science is a lot like ballet, 
poetry, or painting. It takes practice, but 
it’s a wonderful way to express yourself.
Q: What is a usual work day for you?
A: I don’t really have a usual work day. I 
work from home a lot, so a lot of my work 
happens in my pyjamas!
Q:  What are the best and worst things 
about your job?
A:  The best thing about my job is that I’m 
always working on something new. The 
worst thing is that technology and 
education move at very different speeds. 
Technology changes all the time!  Schools 
change very slowly.

Games console
Video game consoles like Xbox or 
PlayStation are also computers, but 
their hardware is dedicated to playing 
games. This allows them to offer 
advanced graphics and sound. They 
become more powerful each year.
Mobile gaming
Games consoles get smaller 
all the time. Games that used 
to be too advanced for a 
computer can now be played, 
often for free, on phones or 
tablets. Some even use 
cameras to set the game in 
the world around the player.
Gaming
Although they were once a rare hobby, 
people now spend more money on video 
games than music or movies. They can be 
played on your own, or together with 
friends, and range from fast-paced action 
games to story-focused roleplaying games.
Competition is fierce between 
different brands of console
Mobile phones let you play games 
wherever you are
Tetris is 
the most popular 
video game ever, 
with 500 million  
copies sold.

Special controls
Not all game controllers use buttons. 
Some look like instruments, dance 
mats, or even steering wheels. 
Motion controls allow gamers to play 
without a controller at all, as the 
game “watches” the player and 
responds to their movements.
Online gaming
Early computer games had only 
one player. These days, online 
gaming means millions of people 
can play together in “massively 
multiplayer” games, or share 
their gaming experience online. 
Some famous gamers attract an 
audience of millions.
Virtual reality
The next big step in gaming is 
virtual reality. A headset can 
surround players with lifelike 
graphics that respond to their 
movements, so they feel like 
they are inside the game.
A guitar controller helps gamers 
rock out in rhythm games
Online gaming means you can play with 
people all over the world

Application coders
One or more coders are usually  
in charge of creating the look of an 
app, and how people use it. These 
application coders often work closely 
with customers to make sure an 
app gives them what they want.
Web coders
Websites generally have code 
running behind the scenes that 
controls things like online 
payments and video loading. 
Web coders create this code. It 
is used by millions of Internet 
users every day.
Graphic coders
Today’s apps are colorful and 
eye-catching with incredible 
details. Graphic coders work on 
apps, as they are skilled in areas 
such as font design, movement 
(for games), and making art.
Teamwork
Many coders work in teams. Teams are 
useful for dividing up work, coming up with 
new ideas, and solving problems. A coder 
may be given a job due to special skills they 
bring to the team. Teams are also a great way 
for coders to share their knowledge and 
learn new skills. 
Code for a website is 
often built based on 
design requests from 
application coders.
Graphic coders receive 
instructions and feedback 
on their designs from 
application coders.
Application coders advise 
system coders of any 
problems with the way the 
apps run by talking to the 
customers who use them.

55
Game coders
Games are one of the most 
popular types of app, and entire 
teams consist of coders who 
understand how to create the 
special code for things like 
scoring, levels, and 
explosions.
Audio coders
Sound is important for many 
types of app, especially games. 
Audio coders create code for 
the sounds you hear when 
you are using an app.
System coders
Cellphones, tablets, and 
computers run software that 
allows apps to communicate with 
them. System coders regularly 
have to create code so that apps 
can run on each different 
operating system.
Web coders often 
need special code 
made by system 
coders for different 
web browsers.
Game coders need to 
understand audio coding 
in order to create the 
sounds in games.
Game coders use 
application coding when 
designing how the game 
will look and how players 
will use it.

56
Learning to code
You can use books or online videos to get you 
started with coding. The most important thing is 
to code as much as you can—practice makes 
perfect. Code won’t always be right the first time. 
It takes a lot of problem solving, but it is exciting 
when you get it right and your code works. 
Build your  
own computer
Building a computer 
teaches you what the 
different parts are and 
how they work together. 
It’s not as hard as you 
might think!
Coding programs
Simple programs, like 
Scratch, let you practice 
writing basic code. For 
example, you might 
write instructions that 
move a character around 
the screen.
Play!
Using coding games to 
learn is a great way to 
start coding. This is 
because you can work at 
your own pace. You can 
choose easy or difficult 
games that let you learn 
as much as you want.

Code together
You don’t have to learn coding by yourself. 
It is taught in schools all over the world. 
One of the most fun ways to code is with a 
partner or as a member of a team. Once you 
know your stuff, you could even teach 
someone else to code.
Speak Code
There are many different coding 
languages, such as Python, 
Ruby, and C++. Learn as many 
as you can so you can write code 
for different things.
Be a robot master
Robot kits let you build a robot 
quite easily. You can then tell the 
robot what to do by writing 
instructions in code.

different parts of the 
computer.
You can use code to
