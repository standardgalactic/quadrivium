About the Author
Charles Wohlforth is a lifelong Alaskan who has been a writer and
journalist since 1986. Wohlforth lives in Anchorage with his wife,
Barbara; sons, Robin and Joseph; and daughters, Julia and
Rebecca. His book about Eskimos experiencing warming in the
Arctic is titled The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern
Front of Climate Change (North Point Press). A forthcoming book
from St. Martin’s Press is tentatively titled Hidden Waters: Human
Nature and the Fate of the Oceans, and explores the history, ecol-
ogy, and anthropology of Prince William Sound. Wohlforth can be
reached through his Web site, www.wohlforth.net.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This is my fourth edition of Alaska For Dummies and, more than
ever, it is the product of teamwork. From the very start, I received
enormous help from friends, colleagues, and my family — the size
and diversity of Alaska would otherwise make the project impossi-
ble. I want to acknowledge them all, but I need to give special note
to the remarkable professionals who assisted with this edition.
Karen Datko is more than my right hand; without her creative and
journalistic talents, the book would have been greatly diminished.
Researchers and writers around the state contributed as well,
bringing new life to the book and giving it the insider’s insider
information that I couldn’t have produced alone, even as a lifelong
Alaskan; they include: Eric Troyer, Charlotte Glover, Kris Capps,
Matt Hawthorne, Martha Robinson, and Charles Homans.

Alaska For Dummies, 4th Edition

Introduction
Years ago, I was on Kodiak Island, a ten-hour ferry ride from the
Alaskan mainland, when three chic Italian women walked into the
visitor center, their fashionable black outfits wet, their manner confused.
In beginner’s English, they explained they had boarded the boat in
Homer thinking it would be an afternoon lark, a short ferry ride like
those at home. Instead, the ship had plunged onward through the night
in the stormy North Pacific, and here they were, a day later, marooned.
The folks in Kodiak took care of the visitors, and they ended up having a
good time. But before leaving, one of them asked me discreetly about
what was missing: snow and ice. They had arrived looking for Jack
London’s Alaska, but that summer everything was green.
They could’ve used this book. It’s an instruction manual for a place
that’s probably unlike anything you’ve ever experienced.
Alaska is a world apart from the rest of the United States, or, for that
matter, most other peopled places. It is, quite simply, wild. Many stereo-
types about Alaska do not hold. For example, during the summer, the
weather is pleasant, and short sleeves get plenty of use. But other
clichés are quite accurate: Wildlife roams freely across vast spaces,
unfettered by fences or roads. Grand scenery, on equal footing with the
most awesome sights on Earth, is within reach in every part of the state.
Opportunities to experience real wilderness are plentiful.
Alaska isn’t just what you expect. It’s probably much better.
About This Book
You didn’t pick up this book because you wanted to read; you got it
because you want to go to Alaska. So my job as a writer is to deliver 
the information you need in the most efficient and straightforward way
possible.
Because itinerary planning is one of the primary challenges of an Alaska
trip, I’ve organized some material according to the routes you’re most
likely to follow. However, you don’t have to use the book that way: It’s
also designed as a handy reference for you to dip in and find the one
piece of information you’re looking for at the moment you need it. You
can refer to a single chapter on a visit to a region, jump to the section
about traveling with children, or just grab the facts you need right now
to find a good restaurant.

I don’t expect you to end up knowing who Tagish Charlie was (if you
want to know, check out the gold rush primer in Chapter 21), and you
won’t be tested on anything after you’re done reading. Forgetting every-
thing between these pages is okay as long as your trip to Alaska is a
memorable one.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. So, I suggest that you write
or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The
authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the 
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
Think of this as a reference book. I’ve organized material to help you
quickly find the information you need, without wading through extra
information or secondary options. Use the table of contents and index to
jump to the topic you want to read about.
In this book I’ve included lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As
I describe each, I often include abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I’ve divided hotels and restaurants into two categories — my personal
favorites and those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get
my hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these
Alaska For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2
Dummies Post-it
® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it
® Flags included in this book to
help make your trip planning easier!

“runner-up” hotels and restaurants if you’re unable to get a reservation
at one of my favorites or if your preferences differ from mine — the
amenities that the runners-up offer and the services that each provides
make all these good choices to consider as you determine where to dine
and rest your head at night.
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I’ve used
a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel
or a meal at a restaurant. Hotel prices are for a standard room for two
people during the high season. (Off-season prices are as little as half of
the high-season prices.) For more information about high and off sea-
sons, be sure to check out Chapter 3. Meal prices are for a dinner with a
main course that constitutes a full meal and does not include appetizers,
dessert, or alcohol. For restaurants that don’t serve dinner, the prices
are for lunch. The following table explains the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$100 or less
$12 or less
$$
$101–$130
$13–$18

$131–$165
$19–$25

$166–$210

$36 or more
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs might be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t been to Alaska and
wants expert advice when you finally get a chance to go.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Alaska and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Alaska or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on
the places that will give you the best or most unique experiences.
If you fit any of these criteria, Alaska For Dummies has the information
you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
With the straightforward organization of this book, finding what you’re
looking for should be intuitive. But just in case, here’s the blueprint.
Introduction 3

Part I: Introducing Alaska
In this part, I introduce you to what Alaska has to offer and help you
decide when and where to go. You’ll find chapters listing some of
Alaska’s highlights; a bit of background on Alaska’s natural history, cul-
ture, and history; and advice on where and when to go (including timing,
weather, and special events). I also provide five great itineraries that
touch on Alaska’s best destinations.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska
This part gets into the details of setting up your trip. I begin by covering
budgets and other money considerations. Next, I cover the issues of get-
ting to Alaska and getting around the vast state — a bit more compli-
cated than some other destinations, but also part of what makes Alaska
interesting and exotic. One long chapter covers options for visiting by
cruise ship, and another provides details for going to Alaska for an out-
door adventure. I get into finding the right accommodations at the right
price and offer specialized information for families, seniors, travelers
with disabilities, and gays and lesbians. Finally, this part provides you
with less-fun details that you can’t do without: health and safety, airline
security, insurance, and so on.
Part III: Anchorage and Environs
Now you’re into the meat of it! Anchorage is the gateway to Alaska, its
largest and most diverse city. It also lies at the threshold of some excel-
lent outdoor destinations, including Girdwood (for skiing), Whittier and
Prince William Sound (for sea-kayaking, wildlife-watching, and glacier
cruises), and the Mat-Su area (for hiking).
Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage
The easiest way for most independent travelers to see the bulk of Alaska
is by flying or taking a cruise ship to Anchorage and then driving a
rented car in big loops from there. Adhering to this simple premise, I
cover much of Alaska as road trips from Anchorage: the Kenai Peninsula,
including Seward, Kenai Fjords National Park, Kenai, and Homer;
Fairbanks and its environs; Alaska’s long rural highways; and Denali
National Park.
Part V: Southeast Alaska
Southeast Alaska is a mountainous strip of rain forest and narrow ocean
channels full of islands and quaint, historic towns. In this part, I focus on
Juneau, the area’s travel hub, the state capital, and an outdoor gateway;
on the gold-rush destinations at Skagway; and on the rich Russian and
Alaska Native cultural history at Sitka.
Alaska For Dummies, 4th Edition

Part VI: The End of the Road and Beyond: 
Bush Alaska
If you’re ready to go way out to the end of the earth, here’s how to do it.
I cover remote and fascinating places in the Arctic, along with the giant
bears of Kodiak Island and Katmai National Park.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Skip the rest and jump here for ten Alaska experiences not to miss on
walks and hikes, ten questions to ask an Alaskan, and ten ways to be an
Alaska know-it-all.
In back of this book I’ve included an appendix — your Quick Concierge —
containing lots of handy information you may need when traveling in
Alaska, such as liquor laws, time zones, and weather reports. Many
handy phone numbers and addresses are included, too. Just flip to the
pages on yellow paper in the back of the book.
Icons Used in This Book
While skimming through these pages, the icons help attract your eyes to
the information you’re looking for. This section tells you what each icon
means.
I’ve placed this icon where I note special values and money-saving tips.
The Best of the Best icon highlights my top picks in all categories —
hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife. You’ll
find some of these picks described in more detail in Chapter 1.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify potential rip-offs or annoyances,
time-wasting errors, tourist traps, and other such travel pitfalls.
These little nuggets of hard-won knowledge — information you probably
wouldn’t otherwise stumble upon — may make life easier or more 
interesting.
I have four kids ages 7 to 17. Believe me, when you see this icon next to
an attraction, hotel, restaurant, or activity, the place has passed a very
rigorous test, indeed.
Where you see this icon, be on the lookout for critters. I also use it to
mark some of the best wildlife-viewing destinations.
Introduction 5

Where to Go from Here
Be not afraid! True, you go to Alaska for adventure. True, the essence of
Alaska is untamed wilderness, wild animals, and uncontrollable nature.
But Alaska is a popular visitor destination with every comfort you’re
looking for, and no harm is likely to come to you that you wouldn’t face
on any other vacation.
I sometimes hear from readers through my Web site (www.wohlforth.
net). One common thread is the fear of the unknown, a hidden expecta-
tion that heading to Alaska is like leaving the planet. Maybe it is, a little.
But with too much trepidation, you may miss out on the adventure.
Relax and get out into the wilderness.
My advice: Go bravely northward!

T
his book is designed to make planning a trip more like
putting together a jigsaw puzzle than painting a picture
on a blank canvas. This part helps you get those all-important
puzzle-edge pieces into place so that you can start to ﬁll in
the picture of what your journey to Alaska will look like.
Before you decide where you want to go and what you want
to do, ﬁgure out why you want to go to Alaska in the ﬁrst
place. Skip this step, and you risk getting lost in a search of
stereotypical images from media mythology that don’t have
much to do with the reality of the place you’re visiting. I aim
to help by suggesting some of the best Alaskan experiences
you can pursue; surveying the history and culture of the
state; and explaining the places, times, and routes that make
for a good trip.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Alaska
In This Chapter
 Discovering the best spots to see glaciers and bears
 Exploring indigenous Alaskan culture and gold-rush history
 Hiking Alaska’s most beautiful day trails
 Checking out Alaska’s top one-of-a-kind lodgings
S
atellite photographs taken at night show much of the populated
world as a thick network of lights. Cities and highways stand out
clearly. The same view of Alaska, however, reveals just a couple of bright
spots; the rest of the land appears as a vast, velvety blackness. It’s as
though this great subcontinent were an undiscovered country that
extends beyond the web of civilization. Indeed, although Alaska has
been completely mapped, immense areas are still unexplored. Not only
do thousands of mountains remain unclimbed, but most have never
even been named. Just to give you an idea of the scope, Alaska has
100,000 glaciers and 10 million lakes.
So this chapter’s goal is to pick out the best of all that? Uh-oh.
A trip to Alaska should not be like one to Paris or the San Diego Zoo.
Don’t come to see certain sites or objects. It’s silly to focus on a particu-
lar mountain or glacier when a practically infinite number are available.
You never know when you may encounter wildlife — these meetings
can’t be scheduled. Moreover, each of the regions you’re likely to visit
boasts fabulous mountains, glaciers, wildlife, hikes, boating, rafting, sea-
kayaking — all of it.
As a travel writer, I’ve visited a majority of the nation’s great, crowded
national parks, yet every summer in Alaska I see vistas as impressive, or
even grander, that have no special designation. After a lifetime of such
travels, I’m not even close to exhausting this wonder of discovery. I
don’t think I ever will be. Those are my “bests.”

Although this chapter can provide reference points, stepping-off places
from which you can get your bearings, don’t get too caught up in ticking
off a list of “the best.” Instead, focus on the experience. Launch your
own exploration and open yourself to discovery. Get out into all that
vastness on foot, in a boat or kayak, in a small aircraft, or in a car. Do
whatever you can to experience Alaska’s unlimited expanse for yourself,
and in doing so you’ll find your own unique “best” that belongs to no
one else.
I discuss each of the places and experiences described in this chapter in
detail later in this book. You can find them in their indicated chapter,
marked with — what else? — a Best of the Best icon.
The Best Big Ice
A glacier is a strange and unfamiliar thing. It looks like land, but it flows
like water. Glaciers can be larger than a city or even a state, and yet they
move constantly, sometimes suddenly, and they can bulldoze straight
through mountains. Nothing else looks like a glacier. They’re white, gray,
and fluorescent blue. They drape gracefully through the mountains, but
they also crack in enormous shards.
 Prince William Sound Glaciers (Whittier): Less than two hours
from Anchorage, the port town of Whittier provides access to
northwestern Prince William Sound, one of Alaska’s most beautiful
and heavily glaciated waterways. Day cruises from Whittier, easy to
do as a day trip from Anchorage, compete on price, food service
onboard, and number of glaciers you see in a few hours (up to two
dozen). See Chapter 15.
 Kenai Fjords National Park (Seward): Here you’ll find Exit Glacier
(one of the few glaciers you can walk right up to) and the magnifi-
cent glaciers still carving the fjords, reached only by boats from
Seward. This forbidding and untouched area, where mountains
shoot a mile high straight out of the sea, is also among the best for
seeing marine mammals and birds. See Chapter 16.
 Ruth Glacier (Denali National Park): Forget the traditional image
of glacier ice falling into the ocean — this is a chance to land on
one of Mount McKinley’s glaciers in a ski plane, get out, and look
around. These flights, mostly going from Talkeetna, are among the
most spectacular experiences a visitor to Alaska can have. See
Chapter 19.
 Juneau Ice Field (Juneau): Helicopters from Juneau fly over the
immense ice field that lies beyond the mountains bordering the
town. Visitors can just look, or join guided hikes on the ice, or even
get in a dog sled and go mushing on the glaciers. See Chapter 20.
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
10

 Glacier Bay National Park (Juneau): This park encompasses fjords
released from the grip of ice over the last century. Passengers on
cruise ships and tour boats going to the head of the bay often see
humpback whales before arriving at huge walls of ice. Sea kayakers
get a much closer and more intimate view of the land and wildlife.
See Chapter 20.
The Best Bear Viewing
Bears can turn up almost anywhere in Alaska — even in a city park.
Trails sometimes close in Anchorage’s Far North Bicentennial Park
because of the enormous brown bears that feed on salmon in a creek
there, and black bears can show up almost anywhere in the state’s
largest city. Alaska’s thriving populations of black, brown (grizzly), and
polar bears can be reliably found for viewing at the right places and
times. See Chapter 9 for more details.
 Homer: The salmon-filled rivers in this part of Alaska, south of
Anchorage, attract fish-loving brown bears through much of the
summer. Homer is among the best places to board a float plane to
head out into that wilderness to see them. See Chapter 16.
 Denali National Park: Even more remarkable than the scenery is
Denali’s status as the site of one of the greatest and least expensive
wildlife safaris you can experience. Thanks to the limited-access
bus system that is the only motorized way into the park, every
shuttle passenger has an excellent chance of seeing brown bears.
See Chapter 19.
 Pack Creek (near Juneau): For decades, the brown bears of
Admiralty Island that converge here to feed on the salmon have
nonchalantly allowed humans to watch them from nearby viewing
areas. It’s a short flight from Juneau, but a different world. See
Chapter 20.
 Kodiak Island and Katmai National Park: These remote lands host
some of the biggest salmon runs and, therefore, the biggest and
most plentiful brown bear population anywhere on Earth. Catch the
season right, and you could see large groups of enormous bears
fishing and feeding. See Chapter 24.
 Barrow: Point Barrow, the farthest north you can go in the United
States, is among the best places to see polar bears in the country;
bears congregate to feed on waste from Eskimo whale hunting.
However, this choice is an adventurous one: Tours in four-wheel-
drive vehicles, offered casually by locals, don’t always see bears;
indeed, they don’t always operate. See Chapter 23.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Alaska 11

The Best Places to Encounter 
Indigenous Culture
Alaska is home to many distinct peoples. The cultural heritage and ways
of life of Alaska’s indigenous people remain largely intact in many areas
of the state, and Alaskan Natives are often interested in sharing their 
traditions with visitors who bring needed economic support to their
communities.
 Alaska Native Heritage Center (Anchorage): Native peoples from
all over Alaska joined together to create this magnificent cultural
center and living museum. Here you can taste many cultures at
once, see live performances and exhibits, meet artisans, and walk
through traditional dwellings. See Chapter 14.
 Sitka: Tlingit people who made Alaska’s great totem poles and clan
houses present their own culture at three venues in Sitka (see
Chapter 22):
• The Sitka National Historic Park, where you can see extraor-
dinary historic totem poles and meet today’s carvers
• The Sheldon Jackson Museum, with a unique collection of
Alaska Native art
• Sitka Tribe’s magnificent community hall, where authentic
dance performances take place in the summer
 Iñupiat Heritage Center (Barrow): Eskimo culture is alive and well,
and in Barrow you can often see subsistence hunters preparing or
returning from hunts for whale, caribou, or polar bear. At the
town’s fascinating cultural center and living museum, you can also
see exhibits and dance performances and meet craftsmen selling
authentic Iñupiat artwork. See Chapter 23.
The Best Gold-Rush Towns
The Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, when the non-Native population arrived
all at once in search of riches, is the biggest event in Alaska’s short his-
tory. Many towns owe their existence to it, and some have made that lin-
eage a major attraction (see Chapter 16).
 Fairbanks: These days, Fairbanks is a city, but it still acts like a
town, with lots of fun and corny activities for visitors (and one of
the state’s best museums, at the University of Alaska Fairbanks).
Gold-mining goes on today, and you can see it demonstrated and
tour historic gold-mining museums. See Chapter 17.
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
12

 Juneau: The gold discoveries in Juneau predated the Klondike Gold
Rush, and led to the construction of massive hard-rock mining
works. Check out the remains on outdoor trails, at indoor muse-
ums, and even on a tunnel tour at an old mine. See Chapter 20.
 Skagway: This may be America’s best preserved gold-rush boom-
town, the scene of legendary Wild West times when Klondike stam-
peders got off the boat here bound for the gold fields. Although
overrun with cruise-ship visitors, the town is well preserved by the
National Park Service. See Chapter 21.
 Nome: Nome’s gold-rush stories top all. Although most of the his-
toric structures are gone, the town retains a free-wheeling frontier
spirit, making it feel more like a gold-rush boomtown than other
more tourist-oriented places. Small-time prospectors are still at
work here, too. See Chapter 23.
The Best Day Hikes
Every town in Alaska is surrounded by wilderness, even Anchorage.
That means every town in Alaska has routes into beautiful, wild places.
Go a little farther — in the national parks, or along hundreds of miles of
remote highways — and you can hike in some of the biggest open coun-
try in the world. For more walking ideas, see Chapter 25.
 Glen Alps Trailhead (Anchorage): Drive above Anchorage into the
rocky Chugach Mountains, and park your car well above the tree-
line, where views extend far beyond the city, over the ocean waters
of Cook Inlet, and to the mountain ranges beyond. From this point,
a wide choice of trails leads up mountains or across valleys; or you
can take off on your own over open tundra. See Chapter 14.
 Caines Head (Seward): Hike all the way from town or take a water
taxi partway to a boulder-strewn beach; from there, climb gradually
through the woods to the ruins of a mountaintop World War II
artillery fort with weird underground corridors and stupendous
views across Resurrection Bay and beyond. See Chapter 16.
 Granite Tors (near Fairbanks): This challenging hike east of
Fairbanks leads beyond the forest to the broad, tundra-clad Plain of
Monuments, where strange natural towers of solid granite poke the
sky at apparently random spots, defying the eye to determine their
size in the absence of scale or reference points. See Chapter 17.
 Toklat River (Denali National Park): In the heart of Denali National
Park, few trails exist; the best of the park is discovered beyond
trail’s end. You’ll find easy walking along the braided river chan-
nels, including the Toklat, where you can go far without struggling
over tundra and see more wildlife than people. See Chapter 19.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Alaska 13

 Perseverance Trail (Juneau): Hard-rock gold-mining built Juneau in
the 1880s; at one time, it was one of the most industrially advanced
cities on the West Coast. Although that’s no longer the case, this
historic mountain trail goes back in time to the Silverbow Basin,
where much of it happened. Across from the trailhead is a fascinat-
ing gold-rush museum. See Chapter 20.
The Best One-of-a-Kind Lodgings
When I travel, I want to feel as though I’ve gone somewhere. I try to eat
with the locals and stay in lodgings with local character. In Alaska, I’ve
sought out these authentic places for visitors. This list includes some of
the best (and most unique).
 Oscar Gill House (Anchorage): It’s not grand, but this is the oldest
house in Anchorage. In fact, it predates the city — it was moved
here by one of the early mayors. Lovingly restored, yet retaining 
a homey, lived-in feel, the house now offers bargain bed-and-
breakfast accommodations. See Chapter 13.
 Alyeska Prince Hotel (Girdwood): Alaska’s grandest luxury hotel,
an hour from Anchorage, has a one-of-a-kind location in an
unspoiled mountain valley among huge spruce trees. Skiers can go
right from the door to Alaska’s best slopes; in the summer, the
aerial tram is an easy way for anyone to experience the crisp air
and magnificent views of an Alaska mountaintop. See Chapter 15.
 Land’s End Resort (Homer): The hotel is charming, but the loca-
tion is what makes it unique. Land’s End Resort sits at the very end
of a 5-mile-long point of land into Kachemak Bay, one of Alaska’s
most beautiful and ecologically productive bodies of water. You can
walk from your room to fish for salmon, or sit back and watch sea
otters swim by. See Chapter 16.
 Aurora Express Bed & Breakfast (Fairbanks): A family hauled a
collection of railroad cars — plus a locomotive and caboose — up a
mountain south of Fairbanks and remodeled the interior into a col-
lection of accommodations, some too cute for words, others heav-
ily nostalgic for those who remember the golden age of rail. See
Chapter 17.
 Pearson’s Pond Luxury Inn & Adventure Spa (Juneau): This
remarkable inn, tucked away in a residential subdivision near the
Mendenhall Glacier, is so full of amenities and attractions, it would
take pages to describe it all. But the essence of it is simple: a sen-
sual retreat for romantic stays when your goal is to be utterly pam-
pered. See Chapter 20.

ews flash: There are people here. That’s right, although the tourist
come-ons mostly show pictures of mountains, glaciers, and
wildlife, Alaska’s cultural landscape is at least as diverse and exotic as
its physical landscape, if far less extensive.
Scores of indigenous languages are spoken here by Native peoples
adapted to climates and environments as different as the icy Arctic
Ocean and the rain forest of Southeast Alaska. Their ways of life are
largely intact, and they own much of their homeland.
Alaska’s non-indigenous people, representing the majority of the popula-
tion, all arrived within the last century, after the 1898 Klondike Gold
Rush. They have a culture of their own — or at least an image and a way
of doing things — reflecting youth, mobility, and links to Alaska’s
resources. If you take your eyes off the glaciers for a few minutes, you
may find some interesting people around here.
On the other hand, it’s perfectly reasonable to focus purely on the land-
scape. If you want to skip straight to the animals and outdoors, jump
ahead to Chapter 9.
Understanding Alaska’s Native Cultures
The indigenous people of North and South America arrived about 10,000
years ago. They may have walked from Siberia over ground that’s now
the seabed beneath the Bering Sea, which was exposed at the time by the
lower sea level of those Ice Age years — or maybe not. Archaeologists
are less sure now than they have been in years about exactly how these
indigenous people arrived. New theories keep cropping up, each with an
apparent claim on the evidence.

However they arrived, communication among Native peoples continued
long after the Ice Age. For example, the Eskimo or Inuit people (the two
words mean the same thing, with Eskimo the preferred term by most of
those in Alaska) scattered across Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada, and
Greenland share ties of language, legend, and lifestyle. Archeologists
believe this connection was forged about 1,000 years ago, when the cli-
mate was warmer for a few hundred years and travel and migration was
easier. When the weather got colder, people lost track of each other, but
upon being reunited in the 20th century, a millennium of separation had
left their language, stories, and cultural patterns still recognizable to one
another.
Alaska’s Eskimos include two peoples: the Iñupiat of the Arctic coast
and the Yupik of the west and southwest. These are the legendary
marine mammal hunters and users of the sea ice. In addition to Eskimos,
there are several Alaskan peoples more properly called Indians: the
Athabascan of interior Alaska, who are river dwellers and hunters of
caribou and moose, and the Tlingit of southeastern Alaska, who were
the richest of the Native people, thanks to the plentiful salmon, game,
and wood of their rain forest home. The Aleuts, seafarers of the Aleutian
Archipelago, are neither Eskimos nor Indians. Within these peoples,
there are many villages, which are analogous to tribes elsewhere in the
United States, each with its own dialect and traditions. Almost half of

Who moves to Alaska?
At the end of Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita, the title character breaks for good from
her pedophile stepfather to move to Alaska. That’s one classic reason for going to
Alaska: getting away. Alaska is off the map (literally, most of the time), a place so far
away you can reinvent yourself. This fact makes for an odd irony in Alaskans’ attitudes
about each other. We tend not to ask questions about where people came from —
everyone is accepted when they arrive. (This has led to a series of scandals in which
politicians turned out not to be who they said they were.) On the other hand, the length
of time a person has lived in Alaska is a powerful point of pride. It’s one of the first pieces
of information acquaintances exchange, even before they ask, “What do you do?” (I’ve
lived here since 1966; my family moved from Brooklyn when I was 3 years old.) I suppose
they don’t do that in places where more of the population is native born.
Fewer than four in ten Alaskans were born in Alaska, and two of those four are Alaska
Natives. (Nationally, 60 percent of people live in the same state where they were born.)
Alaskans are young, mobile, well-educated, high-paid, active, and outdoorsy. And also
ethnic: Alaska is more diverse than the average state. Many military members who
rotate through Alaska end up retiring here. Many others possessed of an adventurous
spirit move to Alaska to take a job for a few years and stay long-term. And plenty of
people who come on vacation fall in love with the place and never leave.
Maybe that will be you.

America’s federally recognized tribes are in Alaska — more than 220 of
them. Altogether, Alaska’s indigenous people are called Alaska Natives
(always capitalized), not American Indians.
If all this seems complicated, don’t worry about it. No one expects you
to know the details. Visitors only need to be respectful and willing to
learn.
Being courteous among Alaska’s first people
It should come as no surprise that people from cultural traditions com-
pletely independent of Europe or Asia have different ways of behaving,
but many visitors to rural Alaska assume that the manners they bring
with them are automatically the right ones. It’s a common mistake, and
most Natives probably aren’t offended by faux pas committed in this way.
But if you really want to get to know people, you should know something
about how they relate to each other and how to show respect as they
do. Here are some tips:
 Slow down and listen. If you talk fast, interrupt, or don’t wait for
an answer, you may never hear anyone else speak. In Native com-
munities, people speak slowly and carefully; a long pause means
the person is thinking about what has been said. It does take time
to catch the nuances; people speak indirectly to avoid contradic-
tion or conflict.
 Show respect. Being demanding, pushy, or argumentative places
you completely on the outside. Alaska Native culture calls for
respect to be paid to every person: deferring to others’ wishes,
helping, listening, offering and accepting small gifts (such as a cup
of coffee), and always, always avoiding conflict.
 Don’t be shy. Native people you meet, especially in places that
tourists frequent, will respond to friendly approaches, conversa-
tion, and respectful questions. Tell people about yourself and
where you’re from; family ties are of special interest — anything
that will create a connection.
 Think about how you would feel. What if visitors came to your
town from a foreign land? How would you want to be treated? 
When I see visitors treating Native people as if they were objects, I
wonder if the tourists ever asked themselves that question.
Finding Native culture
Here are some terrific places to see Alaska Native art and artifacts or to
meet Native people who want to teach about their culture:
 Alaska Native Heritage Center (Anchorage): Indigenous people
from all cultures join together where visitors can discover more
about their ways of life. See Chapter 14.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Alaska 17

 UAF Museum of the North (Fairbanks): Alaska’s most modern
museum features Native art and demonstrations. See Chapter 17.
 Alaska State Museum (Juneau): Stop here for an overview using
some of Alaska’s best examples of Native art. See Chapter 20.
 Sitka National Historic Site and other sites (Sitka): The historic
site operated by the National Park Service contains the best collec-
tion of historic totem poles and offers a chance to see artists at
work. Elsewhere in Sitka, see Tlingit dance. See Chapter 22.
 Iñupiat Heritage Center (Barrow): The northernmost community
in the United States has its best living museums of Eskimo culture.
See Chapter 23.
Alaska History: Not an Oxymoron
Alaska’s population tends to be young and transient. People come and
go following a pattern originally set by the northward flow of gold-rush
prospectors that first brought non-indigenous Americans. Everyone
seems to assume history began with their own arrival, but it happens
that many people came before the gold rush, and not only the Alaska
Natives who arrived 10,000 years ago, but also the Russians, the first
Europeans to come to Alaska, in 1741.
Searching for Russian America (1741–1867)
That first visitor to Alaska set the pattern for short visits. Vitus Bering
claimed the region while on a mission for Czar Peter the Great. Bering
crossed Asia, sailed to and crossed the Kamchatka Peninsula, built new
ships, and sailed across the North Pacific (the part now known as the
Bering Sea). He made the journey twice, in fact, before he actually found
Alaska and landed a man there for a few hours. It turns out that Bering’s
goal was to say he had made it there, and he didn’t stay long enough to
do anything. (Don’t you make the same mistake!) In the end, he didn’t
even accomplish that goal — he died before making it back home.
Russian fur traders followed, and what became known as Russian
America survived as a sea-otter exporting colony until the Czar sold
Alaska to the United States in 1867. After the sale, all the Russians left,
and their history in Alaska essentially stopped.
To see the remains of Russian America, head to Sitka (see Chapter 22)
and Kodiak (see Chapter 24). The site where Russia handed over Alaska
to the United States is preserved in Sitka, the former Russian capital.
Rushing for gold (1867–1940)
I have a hilarious Thomas Nast cartoon dated 1877, showing the last
American soldiers abandoning the wasteland of Alaska, being bid good-
bye by a horde of polar bears. The caption notes that the government
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
18

had taken the sensible cost-saving measure of withdrawing its small
Alaska garrison, because there was nothing worth guarding. Americans
believed for many years that the Alaska purchase was a fiasco after it
was engineered at a cost of $7 million (less than 2¢ an acre) by Secretary
of State William Seward in 1867.
Americans suddenly changed their minds about the value of their pur-
chase one day in 1897, when a ship arrived in Seattle from Alaska carry-
ing a bunch of brand-new millionaires with trunks and gunnysacks of
gold. These penniless prospectors had found gold in the Yukon’s
Klondike River, reachable only through Alaska. The population of Seattle
emptied out as people stampeded to get their own gold — even the
mayor went. The find was large enough to affect the U.S. economy, and
more than big enough to jumpstart the nation’s interest in Alaska.
Although the latecomers to the gold fields found few riches of their own,
they spread out to new gold strikes that were located every few years
for the next two decades. By the time of World War I, gold-rush prospec-
tors had established many of Alaska’s existing towns and cities.
To see the legacy of the gold rush, go to Juneau, Skagway, Fairbanks,
or Nome. (See Chapter 1 for my list of gold-rush bests.)
The last major piece in the pattern of development we see on today’s
map of Alaska fell into place with the construction of the Alaska
Railroad, built by the federal government between 1914 and 1923. The
rail line runs from Seward, set on the water south of Anchorage, to
Fairbanks, in the center of the state. To build it, the government set up a
work camp on upper Cook Inlet, near the village of Knik, at the mouth of
Ship Creek. The camp probably got its name from a notation on the nau-
tical chart of the area: “Anchorage.”
The Alaska Railroad is still a great way to see the state. You can find
more information in the sections on Seward (see Chapter 16) and Denali
National Park (see Chapter 19).
Defending the United States (1940–1968)
With the advent of World War II, Alaska became a key to the nation’s
defense, a role it still maintains. The military buildup in Alaska began
even before the Japanese attacked the United States in 1941. Farsighted
military planners realized that the state commanded a strategic polar
and Pacific position in an age of aviation, and air bases were built as
pilots ferried aircraft through Alaska to Russia and points west.
When the United States entered the war, Alaska became the site of some
of its most bitter fighting. In 1942, the Japanese attacked and held Kiska
and Attu, two islands in the outer Aleutian archipelago, the only portion
of U.S. homeland ever held by a foreign power since the War of 1812. The
invaders were dislodged only a year later after the 18-day battle of Attu,
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Alaska 19

one of the most ferocious and costly battles of the Pacific war. After the
war, Alaska became a critical element of the nation’s Cold War defenses,
and large bases and advanced radar outposts were installed here.
Fighter aircraft from Alaska used to scramble to intercept Russian strate-
gic bombers in a frequently repeated game of nuclear chicken that was
still being played as recently as the 1980s. A missile defense system,
intended to protect the U.S. from North Korea, was recently constructed
at Fort Greely, southeast of Fairbanks.
Discovering oil (1968 to the present)
Although military spending remains an important component of Alaska’s
economy, it no longer sets the pace. Oil took that role in 1968, when the
largest oil field in North America was found at Prudhoe Bay, at the north-
ern edge of the state. Because the oil was found on state-owned land,
Alaska’s state government suddenly became fabulously wealthy. The
spending of the oil industry — including for construction of the $9 bil-
lion trans-Alaska oil pipeline, completed in 1977 — supercharged the
economy and put cities such as Anchorage and Fairbanks on a path of
explosive growth.
During this period, the cities seemed to change at the pace of a video-
tape on fast-forward, with new roads and buildings sprouting up like
weeds. These were the years that made cities such as Anchorage and
Fairbanks look like the grubby outskirts of any prosperous western U.S.
urban area, with the same kinds of chain stores and wide highways you
would find throughout the country. More than 30 years later, the ugly
boomtown development has only partly been softened by more gracious
cityscapes.
One of the most exciting times in Alaska history is happening right now.
The output of Alaska’s oil fields is in decline, but rising oil prices have
more than offset that for now, leading to big government surpluses.
However, oil industry influence took a big hit when the FBI uncovered
widespread bribery of legislators and other political leaders to hold
down oil taxes and win other favors. Amid the turmoil, Sarah Palin rock-
eted to prominence from small-town mayor to governor with an anti-
corruption message. And then she became Senator John McCain’s run-
ning mate, nominated for vice president by the Republican Party.

Speaking Alaskan
Alaska has its own language — and I’m not talking about Native lan-
guages, of which there are dozens. Alaskan lingo has words for things
that people don’t necessarily need to talk about in other places. Here is
a partial glossary:
 Breakup: When God set up the seasons in Alaska, He forgot one:
spring. While the temperate United States enjoys new flowers and
baseball, Alaskans are looking at melting snowbanks and mud.
Then, in May, summer miraculously arrives. Breakup officially
occurs when the ice goes out in the Interior’s rivers, but it stands
for the time period of winter’s demise and summer’s initiation.
 Bunny boots: If you see people wearing huge, bulbous, white
rubber boots in Alaska’s winter, it’s not necessarily because they
have enormous feet. Those are bunny boots, super-insulated
footwear originally designed for Arctic air-force operations — and
they’re the warmest things in the world.
 Bush: A region defined not by boundaries but by a way of living,
the Bush is that part of Alaska (actually, the great majority of the
state) off the road network, where life is dominated by nature
rather than civilization, and where the traditions of Alaska Native
people remain strong.
 Cheechako (chee-cha-ko): A newcomer or greenhorn. Not used
much anymore, because almost everyone is one.
 Damp: Used to describe a town or village that outlaws the sale of
alcohol, but not the possession of it.
 Dry: Used to describe a town or village that outlaws alcohol 
completely.
 Lower 48: The contiguous United States (everything but Alaska and
Hawaii).
 Native: When capitalized, the word refers to Alaska’s indigenous
people. The term American Indian isn’t used much in Alaska, Alaska
Native being the preferred term.
 Native corporation: In 1971, Congress settled land claims with
Alaska’s Natives by turning over land and money; corporations
were set up, with the living Natives as shareholders receiving the
property. Most of the corporations still thrive.
 Oosik (ooh-sik): The huge penile bone of a walrus. Knowing this
word could save you from being the butt of any of a number of
practical jokes people like to play on cheechakos.
 Outside: Anywhere that isn’t Alaska. This is a widely used term in
print, and it’s capitalized, like any other proper noun.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Alaska 21

 PFD: No, not personal flotation device. It stands for Permanent Fund
Dividend. When Alaska’s oil riches started flowing in the late 1970s,
the voters set up a savings account called the Permanent Fund. Half
the interest is paid annually to every man, woman, and child in the
state. With more than $35 billion in investments, the fund now
yields roughly $2,000 in dividends to each Alaskan annually.
 Pioneer: A white settler of Alaska who has been here longer than
most other people can remember — 25 or 30 years usually does it.
 Southeast: Most people don’t bother to say “southeastern Alaska.”
The region may be to the northwest of everyone else in the coun-
try, but it’s southeast of most Alaskans, and that’s all they care
about.
 Tsunami: Earthquake-caused sea waves are often called tidal
waves, but that’s a misnomer. The destructive waves of the 1964
Alaska earthquake were tsunamis caused by underwater landslides
and such.
 Village: A small, Alaska Native settlement in the Bush, usually
tightly bound by family and cultural tradition.
Ordering Dinner: Hope Ya Like Fish
Fresh Alaskan seafood is the best in the world. Period. Don’t argue
unless you’re prepared to defend yourself.
Okay, that’s established. Now, a legitimate question: Do you want to eat
salmon and halibut for every meal? Many Alaskans would say, “Sure.”
After all, our seafood consumption, per capita, is vastly greater than
other Americans. However, I’ve noticed a certain fatigue on the part of
some visitors when I announce that I’m throwing a few salmon filets on
the grill for dinner, thinking I’m offering a great treat. The cruise ship or
landside restaurants where they’ve been eating for a week or two have
given them plenty of it.
On the (likely dubious) theory that more information will solve this
problem, here are some tips on dining on Alaska’s wonderful seafood:
 Try the seafood that is Alaskan, instead of ordering what’s flown
in from elsewhere. Pacific salmon, halibut, cod, sablefish (black
cod), rockfish, clams, oysters, mussels, shrimp, and crab are all
Alaskan. Atlantic (farmed) salmon, lobster, tuna, swordfish, and so
on are not.
 Order what’s in season. Fresh, wild Alaska salmon is available all
year, but it’s much more plentiful in the summer and fall. In the
winter and early spring, fresh troll-caught salmon is served in the
best restaurants. Other restaurants may serve farmed salmon off-
season in order to say it’s fresh. That fish comes from somewhere
else and lacks the taste, texture, and purity of wild Alaska salmon.
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
22

Bottom fish such as halibut, cod, and rockfish are in season almost
all year.
 If you’re ordering salmon, go for the best salmon varieties. You
can be as much a connoisseur of salmon as you can of wine. There
are five species of Pacific salmon, each with two names. The rank of
tastiness I would put them in, starting with the best, would be king
(chinook), red (sockeye), silver (coho), pink (humpy), and chum
(dog). You shouldn’t find the last two in any good restaurant,
except perhaps in a salad or burger, but any of the first three can
be fantastic as a fresh filet. The best king and red salmon come
from the Copper and Yukon rivers, which produce fish with lots of
healthy fat — the stuff that makes the fish taste so good.
 Consider the environment. Generally, Alaska’s fisheries are well
managed and in good shape. Eating Alaska salmon is good for your
health and good for the environment, because stocks are plentiful
and need to be used. It’s all good with halibut and cod, too.
Rockfish is a long-lived fish and can be depleted but is being care-
fully managed. Shellfish mostly come from family-owned coastal
farms. Crab is okay, too, although some species have been over-
fished. The major environmental controversy surrounding Alaska
fishing relates to the big factory trawlers that produce fake crab 
or fish sticks for fast-food and other such restaurants nationally.
 Know how salmon should be prepared. The best chefs know that
they can’t improve much on good, fresh Alaska salmon. They grill
filets over alder wood with just some soy sauce, pepper, and dill,
serving it when it’s barely done. Baking and poaching can also be
delicious, and I’ve had some wonderful exotic preparations. It’s a
question of the chef’s skill when they try to get fancy. Blackened
salmon? Why?
 Know how halibut should be prepared. Halibut and rockfish have
a delicate flavor that’s easily ruined by sauces. Grilled, pan seared,
or baked preparations are best. Deep-fried halibut, such as halibut
and chips, is good with a thin, tempura batter, but many places
glob so much batter on that you can’t tell fish is inside. The best
restaurants use nuts, sesame seeds, or soy sauce to accent the
flavor without burying it; the worst restaurants use cheese.
Background Check: Recommended Books,
Movies, and TV Programs
You probably already have your favorite books and movies about
Alaska. The state’s mythical existence is more firmly entrenched in our
collective consciousness than its reality. The fact that so much of this
mythical knowledge is grossly inaccurate attests to the poor quality of
much of what is put out about Alaska — because the place is exotic and
far away, writers and directors don’t feel a need to be accurate.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Alaska 23

Here are some recommendations for getting the straight scoop:
 Coming into the Country, by John McPhee (Noonday Press):
Although the 1970s world it describes is long gone, McPhee’s book
remains the essential Alaska classic for the way it captures the
spirit of the place within profiles of the people here.
 The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern Front of
Climate Change, by Charles Wohlforth (North Point Press): Yes,
I’m recommending my own book. I know I’m biased, but it’s the
only available book focusing on how Alaska and its Native people
are responding to the biggest issue of the day: the warming
weather.
 Ordinary Wolves, by Seth Kantner (Milkweed Editions): Credibly
called the best novel about Alaska since Jack London, this autobio-
graphical tale of a boy coming to manhood in an Arctic sod hut is
both harrowing and extraordinarily enlightening.
 Grizzly Man (2005): Probably the best movie yet made about
Alaska, Werner Herzog’s documentary explores humanity’s relation
to nature using film shot by Timothy Treadwell, a misguided animal
lover who ultimately was eaten by the bears he befriended.
 Into the Wild (2007): Director Sean Penn’s dramatization of the
true story of Christopher McCandless, a young wanderer who died
in the Alaska wilderness. The movie is packed with spectacular
scenery and was filmed on location.
 The Simpsons Movie (2007): This summer blockbuster cut uncom-
fortably close to home with its portrayal of greedy Alaskans eager
to destroy the environment. Homer seemed so darned at home
here, a place where “you can never be too fat or too drunk.”
 Northern Exposure (1990–95): Alaskans laughed about the silly
inaccuracies in this popular TV series, which is available on DVD
and is shown periodically in reruns on cable. In spirit, however, the
show got it right, depicting the freedom and oddity of small-town
Alaska life.
 Deadliest Catch: Crab Fishing in Alaska (2005 to the present):
This surprise hit on the Discovery Channel records the real-life 
hazards and conflicts of hard-driving fishermen as they battle the
notoriously bad weather of the Bering Sea.

Deciding Where and 
When to Go
In This Chapter
 Getting your bearings in Alaska
 Sorting out the seasons
 Reviewing a calendar of local events
 Focusing on the purpose of your trip
F
iguring out where to go in Alaska need not be daunting. For one
thing, you’re not likely to go wrong with anywhere you choose to
visit. For another, in this chapter I lay out the options simply, along with
the best times of year to visit, the most noteworthy events in the state,
and some tips I’ve developed from a lifetime of traveling in Alaska and
advising travelers who visit here.
Narrowing Your Destination Options
Did I mention that Alaska is large? Well, it is. (We Alaskans put down
Texans by telling them that Alaska could split in half and make Texas
only the third-largest state.) That being true, covering every town or
even every region in the state in this book would be a hopeless task.
Some parts of Alaska are so sparsely populated and rarely visited that
telling each potential visitor about them, one by one, would take less
time than writing a book covering it all. Other places receive a reason-
able number of visitors but don’t have as much to offer as other similar
places. To simplify your choices, in this section I focus on the best loca-
tions, where you’ll find the full range of what Alaska offers.
Anchorage
They say that Anchorage isn’t Alaska, but you can see it from there.
They’re wrong: Any city with moose, bears, and eagles in its parks and
neighborhoods is part of Alaska. But what they’re hinting at is true. With
42 percent of the state’s population (283,000 out of 670,000 in the state),
Anchorage dwarfs all other towns, has little in common with typical

remote Alaskan communities, and serves as the overwhelming hub of
Alaskan activities, with services and an urban feel that you’d expect to
find only in a much larger city.
As a visitor, taking advantage of these qualities can make your trip easier
and less expensive. For example, plane fares to Anchorage are relatively
inexpensive because of heavy competition, but flying to many other
Alaskan towns costs a fortune. Many cruises end in Anchorage, too, after
docking in Seward and taking a 124-mile bus or train ride into town, or
docking in Whittier and riding the road or rail for less than two hours.
Car and RV rentals are plentiful in Anchorage, and flight services fan out
for day trips as far north as the Arctic Ocean and as far south as Katmai
National Park.
Anchorage was built by the federal government in 1915 on a site chosen
for its location along the best route for a rail line from the coast to
Alaska’s Interior. It grew because of its strategic location as an interna-
tional crossroad for air travel and national defense. The city sits in
Southcentral Alaska in a bowl of mountains at the head of Cook Inlet,
handy to the Kenai Peninsula to the south and the entire Interior region
to the north.
Because of its central location, I structured this book around the idea
that your visit to the main part of the state (everything but the
Southeast panhandle) should begin and end in Anchorage.
The city has much to offer, indoors and out, including the state’s largest
museum, the most extensive Native cultural center, and several other
sites of interest. Chugach State Park, the city’s backdrop, contains some
of Alaska’s best day hikes and backpacking routes; and in town, you find
superb bike and cross-country ski trails.
Just outside of town, Girdwood is a hip little skiing town with beautiful,
steep slopes overlooking the waters of Turnagain Arm, a glacier-carved
fjord. A bit farther, and through a tunnel, Whittier, less than two hours
from Anchorage, is the jumping-off point for day trips and longer voy-
ages into Prince William Sound by ship, boat, or sea kayak.
For information on the city and all the locations listed in this section,
see Part III of this book.
The Kenai Peninsula
The Kenai Peninsula is Anchorage’s playground. It’s a big area, a five-
hour drive from one end to the other, with three distinct parts you
should consider for a visit.
 Seward and nearby Kenai Fjords National Park: About 124 road
miles from Anchorage, this is a prime area for sea-kayaking, whale-
and bird-watching, and ocean salmon-fishing. Visiting the park as a
day trip from Anchorage is possible, but staying a night or two is a
better idea. In the fjords, you’ll see some of the world’s most
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
26

extreme scenery: Rock mountains rise straight up from the sea a
mile high.
 Kenai and Soldotna: A prime area for fishing, the king salmon in
the Kenai River grow to world-record size. Silver and red salmon
and enormous trout run in the river, too.
 Homer: Sitting on the edge of the panoramic and fish-rich
Kachemak Bay, Homer offers some of Alaska’s best opportunities
for outdoor exploration, with a guide or on your own, using serv-
ices that make it easy for beginners to get into the wilderness for
the first time. The town and its satellite waterfront communities
also are home to many of Alaska’s best artists and several of its
best restaurants.
To get the inside scoop on the Kenai Peninsula, check out Chapter 16.
Fairbanks and the Interior Highways
Long rivers and two-lane highways connect the central part of Alaska.
These highways are worth exploring, when you have the time. The
center of the region is Fairbanks, Alaska’s second-largest city, sitting on
the banks of the muddy Chena River. It’s known for its gold-rush history,
river floating, hot spring soaks, and in winter, dog-mushing and the
Northern Lights (the aurora borealis — see Chapter 17 for more on this
phenomenon and the region in general).
Denali National Park
Partway between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Denali National Park (see
Chapter 19) is home to North America’s tallest mountain (Mount
McKinley) and some of its most expansive alpine scenery. It’s also the
place for the least expensive wildlife safari you’ll ever take, a $30 bus
ride that usually encounters brown bears and other animals: While
riding the park’s buses, I’ve seen wolves, caribou, moose, Dall sheep,
beavers, and much more.
Southeast Alaska
The Panhandle, as this relatively narrow strip of land is called, is an
extension of the Pacific Northwest, a region of big spruce, hemlock, and
cedar trees, deep fjords, crashing glaciers, and islands full of wildlife.
Almost the entire region is part of Tongass National Forest, and the
opportunities for sea-kayaking, ocean fishing, whale-watching, bear-
viewing, and hiking are almost limitless.
The best hubs to visit are Juneau and Sitka, cities with interesting
museums and historic sites. Skagway is a center of gold-rush history. In
planning your trip, however, choosing to visit either the Southeast or the
balance of the state is wise, unless you have two weeks or more. No
roads connect most Southeast towns, and the distances between
Anchorage and other towns are so great that getting to those places
costs as much as getting to Alaska in the first place.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 27

For details on hotels, attractions, and dining in this region, head to 
Part V of this book.
The Bush
Many people come to Alaska with an itch to see the Arctic, or simply to
get beyond the roads into deep wilderness full of wildlife. That describes
most of the state, yet getting to the outlying areas takes extra money,
planning, and time. In Part VI of this book, I discuss some of the best
Bush destinations and details for making the trip.
Understanding the Secrets of the Seasons
Although Alaska actually spans five time zones, its residents tell time
squeezed into just two of them: Alaska time for most of the state, and
Hawaii-Aleutian time for a few Aleutian Islands. Similarly, Alaska has at
least five distinct climates, ranging from temperate in the Southeast,
with precipitation as heavy as any in the world, to the frigid Arctic, with
skies as dry as any desert. (The distance north to south is the same as
the distance from Bangor, Maine, to Miami, Florida — a little over 1,700
miles.) The seasons aren’t simple, and another factor weighs in on the
calculation: light. In the state’s middle latitudes, the sun rises for only a
few hours in December, but in June, the sky is light all night. In the
Arctic, one winter night can last two months.
To help plan, Tables 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 show the average temperature
highs and lows and the number of days per month with rain or snow for
three major Alaska destinations (Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau,
respectively). These tables also offer the hours of daylight on the 21st
day of every month.

The seasons from Anchorage north
The area of the state from Anchorage north, including Fairbanks, the
Interior, and the Arctic, is significantly drier and colder in winter than
areas nearer the Pacific Ocean, making it better than the state’s coastal
areas for winter and fall visits.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 29

Summer is the peak season because:
 Temperatures are comfortable from mid-May through August,
although fall rains usually start in mid-August.
 Salmon-fishing is strong from early June through mid-September.
 The visitor season is in full swing, so you’ll find plenty to do and
everything open. Traditionally, in fact, this is the only time of year
when visitors come to Alaska.
But keep in mind:
 Prices are highest, reservations are hardest to get, and crowds are
most common from mid-June through mid-August (when weather is
best).
 Alaska’s mosquitoes are worst when the weather is best.
 Cool, rainy weather can occur at any time, but the driest summer
months are June and July.
 As you travel north, the season shortens. Ice often doesn’t leave
the Arctic until July and hiking trails can be wet and muddy
through June almost everywhere in the state. At Denali National
Park, frosty nights and fall colors start in late August.
Winter is paradise for outdoor enthusiasts because:
 Skiing, both downhill and cross-country, peaks in February and
March, with plenty of light and snow.
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
30
Shedding light on all the light
You may have “always wanted to know but were afraid to ask” why summer days are
so long in the north and winter days are so short. The short answer is geometry. Seasons
are controlled by the way the Earth leans on its axis: toward the sun in summer and
away from the sun in winter. (Seasons are opposite in the northern and southern hemi-
spheres.) As the Earth spins, any particular spot on the globe, such as Anchorage, trav-
els a certain circle every day. On a globe, that circle is depicted as a line of latitude.
When the northern hemisphere leans closer to the sun in summer, light hits more of that
circle, so daylight lasts longer at any point along that line. As you travel farther north,
each circular line of latitude becomes smaller and is shadowed less by the top of the
earth, so summer daylight lasts longer each day.
Heading north, the Arctic Circle is the first latitude where the sun doesn’t set at least
one day of each year. During winter the reverse is true: The sun doesn’t rise at least one
day each year at the Arctic Circle. By comparison, every day at the equator has 12 hours
of light (and 12 hours of darkness) all year. The poles aren’t affected by days, because
they sit right on the Earth’s axis. There the sky is light all summer and dark all winter.

 Dark winter skies mean the Northern Lights shine frequently.
 Sled-dog racing season peaks in February and March, great times
for your own dog-mushing adventures.
 With a few exceptions, prices are as low as half-off and reservations
are easy to make.
But keep in mind:
 Most tourist attractions and even some roads are closed for the
season.
 A road trip requires special safety preparations in extreme cold
conditions.
 Wildlife-viewing is generally impossible.
Spring and fall are promising because:
 Prices are low and weather, although chilly, is not extreme.
 Fall colors are spectacular on the Arctic tundra of northern Alaska
and in the boreal forests (the relatively sparse northern woods of
Alaska’s Interior). Depending on latitude, colors peak from late
August through early October.
 Spring weather can be dry and bright.
But keep in mind:
 Most summer and winter attractions are closed.
 Weather is unpredictable and can be bad; visits in April, October,
and November are probably not worth the risk of potentially rotten
conditions.
 Not much wildlife is visible in spring or late fall.
The seasons in coastal Alaska
The climate of Southeast Alaska, Prince William Sound, and the Kenai
Peninsula — the entire arc of the southern Alaska coastline, in fact — is
controlled by the warmth and dampness of air from the Pacific Ocean.
That’s why rain forests grow here, why winters stay warm and summers
cool, and why a waterproof raincoat is never a bad idea.
Summer is the time to come because:
 The region comes alive with outdoor activities, attractions, events,
fishing, and wildlife-viewing.
 Weather is never dry, but it’s much drier than in fall or winter.
Temperatures are comfortable.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 31

But keep in mind:
 Crowds can close in; reservations are a necessity.
 Because of the season’s popularity, prices are high.
Fall and winter are impractical because:
 Attractions close or post short hours, outdoor activities become
difficult, and most fishing shuts down.
 Heavy precipitation and chilly temperatures prevail beginning in
mid-September.
Spring is an intriguing possibility because:
 March, April, and May are the driest months of the year, and com-
fortable temperatures arrive at least a month earlier than farther
north, with some nice days in late March or early April.
 In areas with heavy higher-elevation snow and developed skiing
(Juneau for downhill or Homer for cross-country, for example), visi-
tors can combine spring skiing with ocean fishing and often pleas-
ant, cool weather.
 The tourist season doesn’t begin until mid-May or later, leaving
more than a month of lower prices and friendly hosts eager to
please; prices are low and reservations easy.
But keep in mind:
 Many attractions and guided outdoor activities don’t start until
mid-May.
 Most salmon-fishing hasn’t started yet.
Perusing Alaska’s Calendar of Events
Something is always going on in Alaska, but I list only the cream of the
crop here — the kind of events that you can plan part of your trip
around. Ironically, many of these events take place during the time of
year when Alaska doesn’t play host to as many visitors. In summer,
when most tourists arrive, Alaskans are too busy fishing, getting out-
doors, and serving visitors to be able to organize many community
events. But whenever you arrive during the off season, getting involved
in one of the truly local happenings can give you a special entrance into
the heart of these communities.
March
The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race (% 907-376-5155; www.iditarod.com)
is Alaska’s biggest cultural and sporting event, drawing throngs of visi-
tors, especially from overseas. The 1,000-mile race starts with fanfare
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
32

from Anchorage and follows the historic gold-rush trail to Nome. The
city’s largest community celebration accompanies the start of the race
in Anchorage, with ski-racing, parades, fireworks, and the like. For the
finish, the little town of Nome turns into one huge party with days of
silly happenings, such as a golf tournament on the sea ice. The editors of
this guide have noted that some animal-rights activists outside Alaska
oppose the race on the grounds that it’s cruel to the dogs. Race support-
ers maintain that sled dogs love running and thrive on cold, and they
believe that rigorous dog-care rules have addressed the activists’ con-
cerns. The race begins the first Saturday in March.
The World Ice Art Championships (% 907-451-8250; www.icealaska.
com) take place in Fairbanks. Carvers from around the world come to
sculpt immense chunks of clear ice cut from a Fairbanks pond. Among
ice carvers, Fairbanks’s ice is famous for its clarity and the great size of
the chunks. Some spectacular ice sculptures stand as tall as a two-story
building. Carving commences at the end of February, with best viewing
in mid-March.
May
The Kachemak Bay Shorebird Festival (% 907-235-7740; www.homer
alaska.org/shorebird.htm) in Homer celebrates the annual influx of
thousands of migrating birds with guided bird-watching hikes and boat
excursions, natural-history workshops, art shows and performances,
and other events. Early May.
June
The Sitka Summer Music Festival (% 907-277-4852; www.sitkamusic
festival.org) offers chamber-music concerts and other musical
events, presenting top performers from around the world. Three weeks
in June.
The Summer Solstice is celebrated in many ways in communities around
Alaska. In most of the state, the longest day of the year means the sky is
never dark. The oldest continuously observed event is the Midnight Sun
Baseball Game, hosted by the semipro Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks
(% 907-451-0095; www.goldpanners.com), which begins at 10:30 p.m.
on the solstice and is played without artificial lights. The game began
with a pair of pickup teams in 1906. The ’Panners have hosted since
1960. On or near June 21.
July
You’ve never experienced a small-town Fourth of July until you’ve joined
the throngs on the streets of Seward for its Independence Day celebra-
tion. Besides the parade and many other festivities, the main attraction
is the Mount Marathon Race (% 907-224-8051; www.sewardak.org), an
insane 31⁄4-mile scramble from the middle of town straight up the rocky
mountain that is the race’s namesake to its 3,022-foot peak and down
again in less than an hour. July 4.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33

August
The Alaska State Fair (% 907-745-4827; www.alaskastatefair.org) is
in the Anchorage suburb of Palmer. The region’s biggest event of the
year, it features rides, musical performances, and country competitions.
The biggest news of each year’s fair is the winning cabbage; the area’s
good soil and long days produce cabbages the size of beanbag chairs.
Mere beach ball–size cabbages are laughed off the stage. Stop here, too,
to see a mammoth rutabaga or kohlrabi. World records are broken every
year. Runs the 12 days leading up to Labor Day.
November
In Anchorage, the University of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves play host
to the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout (% 907-786-1250; www.go
seawolves.com). The event features a roster of the nation’s top-ranked
NCAA Division I men’s and women’s basketball teams for a weekend-long
tournament. Thanksgiving week.
Focusing on the Purpose of Your Trip
When you’re planning a trip, it’s easy to get lost in the details and forget
the most important thing — such as why you wanted to go to Alaska in
the first place. When you’ve forgotten that all-important fact on a trip
you find yourself thinking, “What am I doing here?” Because I see too
many Alaska visitors with that thought on their faces, I’ve put together
some ideas here to keep you on track:
 If you’re visiting Alaska for scenery and wildlife, plan plenty of time
outdoors, rather than in towns at museums and such.
 Getting out to see the wilderness takes planning and time; be sure
to contact guides and tour operators in advance and allow plenty
of money in your budget and time on your schedule for these activ-
ities. (See Chapter 12 to find out how early you need to make reser-
vations for each kind of activity.)
 Schedule plenty of extra time in your itinerary, not only for the
unexpected things that make travel more fun, but also for bad
weather, which frequently postpones activities, flights, and boat
rides in Alaska. Flexibility is a must.
 Don’t try to see widely separated regions of the state unless you
have plenty of money and time to spend. Distances between
regions are truly extraordinary, and you can see most of the same
highlights in either the Southeast or Southcentral/Interior regions.
 Try not to get hung up on bagging the big-name sights. Alaska has
incredible experiences and scenery in many lesser-known places
where you can make your own discoveries. Besides, weather may
not cooperate at headline attractions you’re hoping to see, so you
should be ready to enjoy what you can see.

R
eality is such a drag. It dictates that you won’t have unlimited time
for a trip to Alaska. In fact, most people’s reality requires negotiat-
ing with a boss or co-workers to be able to get a week or two off for a
trip. (You really should consider being a travel writer!) With reality in
mind, then, I’ve designed the itineraries in this chapter so that you can
make the most of the time you spend in Alaska. I don’t think you need to
jet or drive around to the four corners of the state, the way some com-
mission-hungry travel agents seem to think is best. Instead, these itiner-
aries put you in some of the very best places, where you have a chance
of seeing and doing a great deal without spending too much money or
time on the road.
Don’t take my word for it — simply use these itineraries as a basis for
putting together your ideal trip with your own interests in mind. People
often ask me, “What’s the best way to spend a week in Alaska?” I gener-
ally respond by asking whether the travelers are interested in scenery,
wildlife, or cultural attractions, and whether they’re athletic, disabled,
adventurous, or averse to discomfort. Readers can be sturdy backpack-
ers, inquiring elders, or families with kids in diapers. Without knowing
anything about you, I can give you advice, but it’s based on my own pref-
erences and interests. I’m not a complete oddball, so most people will
find something that interests them here. But we’re all different, so use
these itineraries as examples to consider as you tailor your own travel
plans to fit your interests.

These itineraries also show the complexity and diversity that await you
when traveling among Alaska destinations. Alaska has trains, planes,
boats, and automobiles, but not all go to each destination. Most commu-
nities in Alaska aren’t even connected by roads — including the state
capital, Juneau. (Of Alaska’s ten largest cities, only five can be reached
by driving.) As it happens, this isn’t a bad thing, because authentic
charm grows best in isolation. On the other hand, isolation makes trip
planning a bit more complicated than jumping in the car. For a chart that
shows the modes of transportation you can use to access the state’s
major destinations, see Chapter 7.
Touring Southeast Alaska in One Week 
without a Cruise Ship
The overwhelming majority of tourists to Southeast Alaska come on
cruise ships; plenty of prospective visitors ask me if it’s possible to see
the region any other way. Of course it is! In fact, I wonder if it’s even 
possible to see the Southeast region — to really see it — from the deck of
a cruise ship larger than the towns it visits.
It is true that Southeast Alaska is a part of the world where people travel
from town to town mostly in boats rather than in cars and buses.
Boating, to them, is no inconvenience, and it’s what makes this itinerary
so appealing. The lack of highways continues to keep towns in this area
quaint and the wild lands surrounding them remote.
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
36
Cruising and being independent
The simplest way to build an Alaska itinerary is to cruise through Southeast Alaska’s
Inside Passage, and join an escorted tour offered by the cruise line to see land-based
attractions by tour bus. If that’s your goal, then the itineraries in this chapter won’t be
much help. (Choosing a cruise is more about the boat than the destinations.) Instead, see
Chapter 6 to find out about choosing a package tour and Chapter 8 to review your
choices for cruising.
Before you skip ahead, however, consider a third course: Many cruise-ship passengers
decide to go it alone after getting off the boat. Cruising offers some significant advan-
tages to visitors who want to explore Southeast Alaska but dislike public transportation
and its inherent unpredictability — the only other option for travel in this region is by air
and ferry. But after your cruise ship arrives in the Southcentral region — including
Seward, Whittier, or Anchorage — you can tour by private car. If you wouldn’t normally
sign on for a package tour on a bus, don’t do it here. Instead, link your cruise with the
independent itineraries listed in this chapter. Driving your own car and finding your own
way makes the trip yours, tailoring it to your spontaneity and pace, and gives you a
greater chance to find your own unique Alaskan experiences.

Everything on this itinerary is covered in Chapters 20 and 22.
Day 1 begins with a flight to Juneau, where you grab a cab to your hotel
in the downtown area; you have no need for a rental car at this stage.
After settling in, explore the charming downtown streets on foot, stop-
ping at the State Museum for an overview and orientation to Alaska’s
history and culture. In the evening, relax with a low-key dinner at one of
the casual restaurants downtown, or, if you’re in the mood for a celebra-
tion, at the Gold Room in the Baranof Hotel.
If you’re blessed with good weather on Day 2, hike the Perseverance
Trail, visiting the Last Chance Mining Museum at the trailhead. If your
preference is for a less strenuous outing, then ride the aerial tram up
Mount Roberts for its amazing views and the nature walks you can take
while up top. Consider filling out the day with a helicopter ride to the
Juneau Ice Field, perhaps for a dog-sled ride or just a walk on the snow.
In the evening (again, when the weather is good), attend the Gold Creek
Salmon Bake for outdoor dining and folksy entertainment, or enjoy a fun
and tasty indoor meal at the Twisted Fish Company Alaskan Grill on
the waterfront.
Day 3 is good for a daylong boat ride to Tracy Arm to see glaciers, high
fjord cliffs, and wildlife. If you’re more interested in whale-watching, join
one of the Juneau-based charters, perhaps adding some salmon-fishing
to the experience. Those who like to plan ahead may be able to obtain
one of the scarce reservations to fly to the Pack Creek Bear-Viewing
Area on Admiralty Island to see lots of feeding brown bears. After seeing
the bears, you can dine at the Hanger for a jolly end to the day.
On Day 4, check out of your Juneau hotel for an early 40-minute flight to
Sitka on Alaska Airlines. Settle in there for a couple of days of walking
amid historic sites, making sure that you visit the Sitka National
Historic Park with its Tlingit battlefield and totem poles, exquisite
Native art in the Sheldon Jackson Museum, and Russian-American
architecture and treasures at the Russian Bishop’s House and St.
Michael’s Cathedral. In the evening, dine at Ludwig’s, a charming
restaurant run by a local gourmet, and attend a traditional Sitka Tribal
Dance Performance at the community house, before turning in at your
Sitka hotel.
Staying in the Sitka area for Day 5, you can join a sea-kayaking outing to
see the wildlife of Sitka Sound, including sea otters, sea lions, eagles,
and possibly even whales. Fishing charters are also popular; less active
travelers can take one of the excellent boat tours offered on a variety of
large or intimate vessels. Dine at the Shee Atika Hotel.
Day 6 starts aboard an Alaska Marine Highway System ferry for the
spectacular 150-mile ride back to Juneau, where you take a cab from the
docks to the airport so that you can rent a car for 24 hours and drive to
your accommodations, dining along the way at one of the outlying
restaurants, such as Chan’s Thai Kitchen.
Chapter 4: Great Alaska Itineraries 37

On Day 7, before your evening flight back home, use the car you rented
yesterday to see the Mendenhall Glacier and the Shrine of St. Therese,
and to enjoy the scenery “out the road” (which is how locals refer to
the lovely 40-mile drive on the Glacier Highway).
Seeing the National Parks: Denali and 
Kenai Fjords in One Week
This itinerary and its variations are probably the most popular in Alaska
for independent travelers. Some arrive in Anchorage by air to see the
parks while others disembark from cruise ships in Seward or Whittier
before renting a car. What makes the trip great for first-time visitors is
the opportunity to see the best of the state’s outdoor highlights: the
amazing scenery and abundant wildlife of inland Denali National Park
and maritime Kenai Fjords National Park.
On Day 1, fly to Anchorage, where you spend your first night and rent a
car. (Chapter 7 offers information about car rentals in Alaska.) If you
arrive early enough, you can take in some of the city, with a visit to the
Anchorage Museum of History and Art or the Alaska Native Heritage
Center. Or, if the weather is good, rent a bike and ride along the Tony
Knowles Coastal Trail. In the evening, eat at Simon and Seafort’s
Saloon and Grill, which overlooks the waters of Knik Arm. (Part III of
this book offers much more detail about the greater Anchorage area.)
On Day 2, drive 124 miles south on the Seward Highway to the Kenai
Peninsula and Seward, your overnight destination for the next couple of
nights. (For details about the sights and services available during this
part of the itinerary, check out Chapter 16.) This drive is one of the
world’s most spectacular. Scope out some of the places you’d like to
stop, but don’t actually stop until your return trip. You need to arrive in
Seward in time to board a reserved tour boat into Kenai Fjords National
Park, where you’ll see mountains jutting a mile out of the water, big blue
glaciers, thousands of sea birds, and many marine mammals, often
including humpback or orca whales. Dine tonight at Ray’s Waterfront.
Remaining in Seward for Day 3, paddle a sea kayak into Resurrection
Bay among sea otters and (possibly) spawning salmon, or join a fishing
charter. You should still have time to see the charming downtown and
visit the Alaska SeaLife Center, a research aquarium. If, on the other
hand, you want to spend more time outdoors, make the short side trip
to see Exit Glacier, just north of town. Try the Apollo Restaurant or
Resurrection Roadhouse for dinner.
Driving back to Anchorage on the morning of Day 4, don’t forget to stop
at some of those beautiful or intriguing spots you noted on the way
down along the Seward Highway, and don’t miss the Portage Glacier
Visitor Center. You can have lunch in Girdwood at Chair 5 or the Hotel
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
38

Alyeska, and you may even want to take the aerial tram up to the top of
Mount Alyeska for its mountaintop views or for a hike on one of the
trails near here in Chugach National Forest or Chugach State Park. On
the drive into Anchorage, keep your eyes open for beluga whales and
Dall sheep. With plenty of time left, you have a good opportunity to 
try either the Marx Brothers Cafe or Sacks Cafe & Restaurant in
Anchorage, two of Alaska’s best restaurants, yet still turn in early in
preparation for a long day on the road.
Get an early start on Day 5 for the four-and-a-half-hour drive north to
Denali National Park (see Chapter 19). Stop in Talkeetna along the way
for a flightseeing tour of Mount McKinley (preferably with a landing on
the mountain itself) before continuing on to the park, where you still
have time for a hike or raft ride in and around the park’s entrance area.
The best place to eat is 229 Parks Restaurant & Tavern, south of the
park. Check into a hotel in Healy or near the park entrance for tonight
and tomorrow night.
On Day 6, board a shuttle bus into Denali for wildlife-viewing and day-
hiking. Try to make your shuttle bus reservations a month or more in
advance; choose the earliest departure time that you can stand. Arriving
back at your lodging after a very long day, eat at your hotel or one of the
low-key places near the park.
Reserve Day 7 to drive back to Anchorage and catch your plane home.
Covering a Lot of (Alaskan) Ground 
in Two Weeks
One option for a two-week trip to Alaska is simply linking the preceding
two one-week itineraries. Although that’s a good trip, you may end up
spending more time looking at sea otters and glaciers than you need. A
better plan is padding those one-week itineraries with more days, more
activities, and more side trips within the regions you’re already cover-
ing. Doing so saves time and gives you a better chance to dig in and
really get a better feel for the destinations. I’ve designed this two-week
itinerary to show you how to use your additional time to add on to the
basics. Some days overlap with the “Seeing the National Parks” itinerary
earlier, because I assume you’ll still want to see some of those name
attractions.
For Days 1 and 2, follow the first two days of the “Seeing the National
Parks” itinerary, earlier in this chapter.
On Day 3, from Seward, get back in the car and drive about four hours to
Homer. That gives you plenty of time to visit the galleries and the Pratt
Museum and to find out why Homer is the art center of Alaska. Dine on
the water at Land’s End (see Chapter 16).
Chapter 4: Great Alaska Itineraries 39

Head outdoors on Day 4 by paddling a sea kayak out into Kachemak
Bay to view seabirds and otters and other marine mammals, and to land
on a lovely pebble beach in the wilderness. Less active travelers can
choose a wildlife boat tour through some of these same waters or join a
fishing charter. Before heading back to your hotel for your second of
three nights in Homer, have dinner at The Homestead (see Chapter 16).
Day 5 is for adventure on your own. Take a water taxi to Kachemak Bay
State Park for a day of self-guided hiking far from any road or settle-
ment; you’ll be on your own on the beaches and in the woods until your
water taxi picks you up in the evening. If that sounds too scary, consider
a day trip for lunch or dinner to Halibut Cove, a roadless arts commu-
nity built on docks and boardwalks with a restaurant that offers great
sushi (see Chapter 16).
You leave Homer on Day 6, driving back toward Anchorage, stopping
along the way at the places you spotted on the way down. Don’t miss
the Portage Glacier Visitor Center. Stop in Girdwood, a half-hour short
of Anchorage, and check in at the wonderful Hotel Alyeska. Ride the
aerial tram to the top of Mount Alyeska for the mountaintop views, or, if
time permits, hike the Glacier Creek/Winner Creek Trail. Eat at the
hotel or at Chair 5 (see Chapter 15).
On Day 7, briefly retracing your steps, drive about 15 miles back to the
south to the Whittier Tunnel, wait your turn, and go through the 2-mile-
long, single-lane tunnel to Whittier, where you can put your car on the
Alaska Marine Highway System ferry to Valdez for passage through the
sublime rain-forest scenery of Prince William Sound. With any time
that’s left, visit the fascinating Valdez Museum and its annex, which
houses a scale model of the town as it existed before destruction by the
1964 earthquake and tsunami (see Chapter 18).
On Day 8, drive the Richardson Highway to Fairbanks (364 miles). A
long haul, yes, but I suggest this drive on purpose because it’s one of the
most awesome rides I’ve ever experienced. For up to six hours, you pass
through unpopulated wilderness, rising from tidewater steeply into
rocky mountains, passing the face of a glacier, and climbing still higher
into the vast, treeless country of the Alaska Range. The road is a paved
two-lane highway, but you’ll encounter little other traffic. Find your
room in Fairbanks and then relax as you dine at Gambardella’s (see
Chapter 17).
Day 9 is an indoor day, taking in the sights of Fairbanks, including the
extraordinary UAF Museum of the North and other on-campus sites, the
historic riverboat at Pioneer Park, and perhaps the gold-panning tour
at Gold Dredge No. 8. Or, when the weather’s right, go outside and rent
a canoe to float down part of the Chena River, landing at the Pump
House Restaurant & Saloon for dinner (see Chapter 17).
Part I: Introducing Alaska 
40

You head out for the Arctic on Day 10. Board an Alaska Airlines jet
bound for Barrow, the northernmost community in North America, on
the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Through the airline, you can join a
guided tour that includes a bus tour, Eskimo dancing, and a visit to the
cultural center, or you can try the self-guided approach, and in the
proper season, ride a Humvee to the extreme northern end of Alaska to
see polar bears (see Chapter 23). After your visit to Barrow, simply fly
back to Fairbanks for the night or stay over and fly back in the morning,
giving you more relaxed time for exploration.
You’ve been traveling hard, so Day 11 is for relaxation. Drive an hour
from Fairbanks to Chena Hot Springs Resort and spend the day soaking
in the hot pond or indoor and outdoor pools. If you have the energy, you
can enjoy a little horseback riding or one of the many other recreational
activities. Spend the night here or back in Fairbanks (see Chapter 17).
For Days 12 and 13, drive to Denali National Park, which is less than
two hours south of Fairbanks on the George Parks Highway, and follow
the suggestions for Days 5 and 6 in the “Seeing the National Parks” itiner-
ary, earlier in this chapter.
On Day 14, drive four and a half hours back to Anchorage to catch your
plane home.
Planning a Kid-Friendly Week in Alaska
An adult-paced trip to Alaska isn’t easy with kids. The distances are
great (“Are we there yet?”) and activities are expensive. Nevertheless, I
have four children of my own, and we spend entire Alaskan summers
having fun outdoors and reminding ourselves that this really is our life;
it’s often too wonderful to believe that it’s real. The key for us is discard-
ing the idea of set goals. We hope to see wildlife, but we never plan to.
We set out for a long drive, but we’re ready to stop — overnight if neces-
sary. When we’re outdoors, usually on the water, we often abandon any
plan at all. We give our extended family a general outline of where we’re
going, but after we’re on our way, any of the kids can say, “Let’s land
here,” and we do. These randomly chosen places have often inspired us
to stay for days, and have turned out to be the highlight of our summer.
This sort of spur-of-the-moment travel is much easier when you live in a
place and know it well than when you’re visiting for the first time. Even
first-timers, however, can design a less goal-oriented trip that favors
more of an experiential itinerary. Here are some suggestions for a family
trip that uses Anchorage as home base.
On Day 1, fly into Anchorage. After getting your bearings, explore the
downtown area. Don’t miss the Imaginarium, a small children’s science
museum that’s fun and has a tide-pool touch tank. If you have time, rent
Chapter 4: Great Alaska Itineraries 41

bikes for a roll along the Coastal Trail (see Chapter 14). Try the
Downtown Deli or City Diner for dinner — both are kid-friendly (see
Chapter 13).
Take a day trip by boat on Day 2 to see the glaciers and wildlife of
Prince William Sound from Whittier. The tour-boat company arranges
your transfer from Anchorage, or you can drive a rented car or take the
train. Every kid enjoys the 2-mile-long tunnel to Whittier and the weird
town itself, where everyone lives in one huge, concrete building. If your
children are old enough (depending on the child, 9–12), you can instead
choose a guided sea kayaking outing from Whittier as a day trip (see
Chapter 15). Back in Anchorage, try the Lucky Wishbone for a zero-
stress dinner (see Chapter 13).
On Day 3, go hiking in Chugach State Park. The mountains behind
Anchorage comprise one of the nation’s greatest alpine parks. For the
easiest access to doable mountain climbs, mountain-biking above the
tree line, and tundra rambles beyond trails, start at the Glen Alps park-
ing lot. The Alaska Zoo is right on the way there, if you have energy left
for it (see Chapter 14). Eat at the Moose’s Tooth Pub & Pizzeria, with
the best pies and brews in town and a noisy dining room where manners
aren’t required (see Chapter 13).
For Day 4, drive to Talkeetna, on the south side of Mount McKinley.
Although it’s 112 miles from Anchorage, that’s still about 120 miles less
than a trip to the mountain’s main park entrance. From Talkeetna you
can take a flight with a real glacier pilot over the mountain and, in
season, land on a glacier high on its flanks. Although expensive, the gla-
cier flight unquestionably becomes the highlight of your trip. Eat and
spend the night at the Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge (or, on a budget,
choose a less expensive lodging and meal option in Chapter 19).
Leaving Talkeetna on Day 5, you head for Hatcher Pass, exploring the
old mine buildings in a high mountain valley and staying in one of the
cozy A-frame cabins at the Hatcher Pass Lodge. It’s just short of camp-
ing, and you can walk from your door across a wide expanse of tundra.
The tiny lodge dining room serves good burgers (see Chapter 15).
Day 6 offers an opportunity for a white-water raft ride. A company
called Nova invites children as young as 5 on rides that start in front of
the impressive Matanuska Glacier (see Chapter 14), located up the
Glenn Highway about two hours north of Anchorage and about 90 min-
utes from Hatcher Pass. After your adventure, you can spend your last
evening at the Glacier Brewhouse, a fun place for a final dinner in
Anchorage (see Chapter 13).
On Day 7, rent bikes to use up energy on Anchorage’s paved and dirt
trails before boarding a flight for home.

Experiencing Alaska in White: 
A Week of Real Winter
If you enjoy winter and winter sports, few places compare to Alaska.
Even if you don’t, winter is when the state is most beautiful. The scenery
is purified by snow, and the aurora borealis brightly illuminates velvety
skies. Travel is a bit trickier, however, and most of the attractions that
pack in people during the summer are closed for the season.
Here is a weeklong itinerary that assumes you have an interest in skiing.
Two of the destinations on the schedule are resorts where skiers nor-
mally spend more time than I’ve listed, so adjust the schedule to your
liking.
On Day 1, arrive in Anchorage in early March, in time for the winter fes-
tival surrounding the start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race (see
Chapter 3). If you enjoy cross-country skiing, take advantage of one of
the nation’s best trail systems at Anchorage’s Kincaid Park. Or, if you
prefer skating, try one of the groomed lakes, the best of which is
Westchester Lagoon (see Chapter 14).
On Day 2, go to the Alyeska Resort for downhill skiing on Mount
Alyeska and stay in the resort’s grand Hotel Alyeska. You can ski 1,000
acres of mostly steep terrain right from the hotel’s back door and dine
on either side of the mountain — or on top of it. If you don’t want to ski,
you can spend time in the magnificent pool (see Chapter 15).
Day 3 offers another day of skiing at Mount Alyeska, or you can go 
backcountry skiing or join a snowmobile outing into the Chugach
Mountains from the resort.
On Day 4, catch the Alaska Railroad’s weekly, one-car winter train from
Anchorage to Fairbanks, a 12-hour journey through Alaska’s most spec-
tacular scenery, with no sign of human activities. With any luck, you’ll
see plenty of moose and a stunning view of Mount McKinley (see
Chapter 7).
In Fairbanks for Day 5, visit the UAF Museum of the North and, in
March, see the ice sculptures of the World Ice Art Championships. Save
time for a dog-sled ride in this, the world’s center of mushing.
On Day 6, head out to Chena Hot Springs Resort, enjoying the hot
pond, the indoor and outdoor pools, and the aurora-viewing facility;
go cross-country skiing, dog mushing, or snowmobiling to explore the
surrounding wilderness (see Chapter 17).
Day 7 offers time for one last soak or ski before you head back to the air-
port in Fairbanks for the trip home.

Part II
Planning Your Trip 
to Alaska

In this part . . .
You’ve planned your trip in your daydreams; now it’s
time to plan it on paper. This is the challenging part. The
same aspects of Alaska travel that make the state an exotic
destination — the extremes of weather and distances, the lack
of roads, and the remoteness of the greatest attractions —
also complicate planning a trip there. Fortunately, you won’t
be the ﬁrst to address these issues: All you have to do is make
selections, not blaze trails.
This part covers the big choices, including critical decisions
about picking a cruise ship, setting up an outdoor adventure,
and traveling independently or with a group, as well as many
of the smaller details about how to get where you’re going,
book your room, keep within your budget, and so on.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Estimating how much your trip will cost
 Keeping an eye on hidden expenses
 Picking up a few money-saving tips
A
laska is expensive. Hotels and meals cost more than comparable
choices elsewhere in the United States, especially during the time
when most visitors come to the state. The peak season is short and
operators charge all that the market will bear during the three or four
months of active business.
With careful planning and some compromises, you can keep costs under
control — the trick is knowing where to economize. You can’t cut the
cost of getting outdoors to see and do the things that make Alaska a spe-
cial place to visit. Unless you’re an expert sea-kayaker, you can’t get out
on the water cheaply; you need a guide to find out where and how to
fish; and without your own wings, you can’t see what Alaska looks like
from above.
In this chapter, I explain when to save and when to splurge so you can
hold down costs without sacrificing the whole point of the trip.
Planning Your Budget
I know the impulse well. After adding up the costs of your vacation in
your head, you shave a figure or two here, leave out a detail there, and
convince yourself that you can’t afford not to go! If you want to do that,
skip this section and ask your boss for a raise. If you want to go in with
your eyes open, however, use these pages to make sure that you don’t
miss accounting for any costs in your planning. (See Chapter 8 for the
costs of traveling to Alaska by cruise ship.) Also, see the “Creating a real
budget” sidebar in this section for how I calculate travel costs myself.

Transportation
Airline competition makes getting from Seattle to Anchorage by far the
cheapest way to travel to the main part of Alaska (even cheaper than driv-
ing). It’s useless for me to predict what you’ll pay because, in the age of
high fuel prices, airfares change rapidly. Obtain current price listings by
checking a travel Web site such as Travelocity (www.travelocity.com).
As a general rule, you pay about $100 more to fly from Seattle to
Anchorage than you would pay to fly from coast to coast. As this is writ-
ten, round-trip fares of $450 usually are available. Seattle to Juneau costs
more than Seattle to Anchorage, despite being a third shorter.
Flying within the state is substantially more expensive than flying into
the state, because Alaska Airlines is the only jet carrier in these markets,
and distances over the great expanse of the state are such that many
routes are served only by jet. At times, flying from Anchorage to some
Alaska Bush communities costs as much as flying from Anchorage to
Europe. (An exception is the Anchorage–Fairbanks route, which is com-
petitive and relatively cheap.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
48
Creating a real budget
As a writer of travel books and a freelance journalist, I travel a lot, and how much money
I take home at the end of a project depends in large part on how much I’ve spent on the
road. Sometimes I travel rough, and certainly I go at a pace that wouldn’t interest any
vacationer. But the tools I use to figure out how much a trip will cost me may help you
with yours, if budget is a critical issue.
Many travelers try to figure the cost of the trip by coming up with a per-day budget that
seems reasonable and then multiplying that by the length of the trip. But on a real trip,
one day may cost three times as much as another — and that’s as it should be, because
you should save up to spend a lot on major activities.
When I plan a trip, I use a spreadsheet program on my computer (Microsoft Excel, but
any other will work as well). Each row is an actual expenditure I expect on a trip: a cer-
tain day’s lodging or rail ticket, for example. Wherever possible, I include the actual cost.
Using this book, you can get exact prices for hotels and most activities, and you can get
a good ballpark figure for meals and transportation. You can narrow these down even
more using the Internet. When you have an exact price, add 20 percent for taxes, tips,
and price changes.
Use the spreadsheet’s SUM function to add up the column of costs to come up with your
total cost at the bottom. If you can afford that bottom line, go ahead and start booking.
(You can use this same sheet as your itinerary by adding times, dates, and confirmation
numbers in new columns and then printing it out.) If the bottom line is too large, start
eliminating days or finding ways to cut costs on individual items.

Again, the Web is the best place to check for current prices; www.alaska
air.com is a good place to start. (For more information on getting to
Alaska, see Chapter 6.)
The cheapest and most convenient way to travel within the part of the
state that has roads is by rental car ($200–$250 a week in Anchorage).
But in Southeast Alaska, where most towns aren’t linked by highways, a
car is usually just an inconvenience. In that part of the state, it makes
more sense to rely on the Alaska Marine Highway System ferries (cheap
travel at $45 for a 9-hr., 150-mile trip) or to fly short hops by jet or pro-
peller aircraft (pricey, but more affordable than the high fares for longer
hauls within the state). The Alaska Railroad runs from Seward, south of
Anchorage, to Fairbanks. Trips along this line are beautiful and reminis-
cent of the golden days of rail, but they’re priced as tours, not as trans-
portation and, as such, they cost far more than any other mode of travel.
For many more details and contact information about getting around
Alaska, see Chapter 7.
Lodging
During the high summer season, lodging prices in Alaska’s cities are
comparable to high-price destinations such as New York City. A comfort-
able standard hotel room without luxuries goes for around $170 a night,
while a room in a high-rise or resort runs over $250. In smaller towns,
you can find more reasonable rates, but rarely is a decent room avail-
able in the high season for under $100. In the shoulder season, when
most tourist attractions are still open but off the peak, rates drop by 25
percent or more. Off season, you’ll typically pay half the high-season
rate, or even less. Some skiing and other winter destinations, however,
have a winter peak when high prices return.
You can reduce what you pay for lodging by staying in bed-and-
breakfasts (B&Bs); most such accommodations have moved beyond 
the spare bedroom and now are like personal little inns. I prefer them
anyway, because you meet real Alaskans. With a private bath, expect 
to pay about $135 for a small room. The breakfast saves you time and
money, too.
Dining
A couple can easily spend $120 for dinner in Alaska’s best restaurants,
and you should splurge at least once so that you can sample the great
regional cuisine that’s based on the state’s wonderful seafood trade.
Most of the time, however, it makes more sense to dine at midrange
places where a main course costs under $20. Traveling that way, a
couple can budget $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch, and $55 for dinner, 
or an average of $100 per day.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 49

Sightseeing and outdoor activities
Don’t pinch your pennies when planning what to see and do in Alaska;
otherwise, you may end up spending your time simply looking through
museums or walking around towns. Although the towns are worth
seeing, they don’t contain the sights and experiences most visitors come
to Alaska for, such as the glaciers, mountains, and whales. To estimate
how much to budget for your Alaska adventures, here are some typical
activities and prices (exact prices are in the destination chapters):
 In-town attractions, such as museums and tours: $10 to $40.
 Boat tours: $100 to $200.
 A five-hour guided excursion by sea kayak or raft: $90 to $180.
 An extensive flightseeing tour: $150 to $350; up to $450 by 
helicopter.
 Wilderness lodges and multi-day all-inclusive outdoor adven-
tures: At least $125 per person per day (for a rough tent experi-
ence) and up to $500 a day (for the best). The typical outdoor
adventure is $350 a day.
The high cost of outdoor activities is one reason why Denali National
Park is such a bargain; the bus ride there is one of the state’s best
wildlife safaris for around $30 per person. For more on the park, see
Chapter 19.
For more details on outdoor activities, see Chapter 9.
Shopping
Finally, a break after all those big numbers! You don’t have to spend a
penny shopping on your trip to Alaska. When you get home, and you
meet the expectant gaze of your grandchildren or significant other, you
can just tell them about all the money you saved by not buying gifts, and
they’ll, of course, be thrilled by your thriftiness.
If skipping the gift-buying part of the program won’t work, here are some
options:
 T-shirt and gift shops: They’re everywhere, full of inexpensive
tourist items from Taiwan and other foreign lands. You can find a
plastic totem pole that may satisfy the less discriminating on your
list, such as children 5 and under, or a funny T-shirt, without spend-
ing much.
 Shops that have real Alaskan gifts: This is the next level of sou-
venir shopping. I mention these locations throughout the book.
Expect to pay more for fabric, ceramic, or wooden crafts, but you
can still find items under $75. Items that originate in Alaska cost
more but mean more, too. A symbol of two bears that says MADE IN
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
50

ALASKA (www.madeinalaska.org) indicates that a state contractor
has determined that the item was at least substantially made in
Alaska.
 Authentic Alaska Native arts and crafts shops: If authenticity is
what you seek, be ready to spend money. Small toys may be under
$50, but authentic Native items such as handmade clothing, woven
grass baskets or jewelry usually sell for $150 to $500, and larger or
more lasting pieces, such as masks or fine art, often are priced in
the thousands of dollars. See the “Help Alaska Natives: Don’t buy
fakes” sidebar, for tips on identifying authentic crafts.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 51
Help Alaska Natives: Don’t buy fakes
Much of the “Alaska Native art” sold in the shops that line tourist areas is, in fact, carved
by low-wage workers in Asia and then deceptively labeled as having been made by
indigenous people. Estimates vary regarding the amount of counterfeit Alaska Native
art sold annually, but authorities have put it at close to $100 million. That’s money taken
from Alaska Bush villages, where jobs in the cash economy are virtually nonexistent
and prices for essentials such as fuel and housing are astronomical. Buying fake Alaska
Native art is cultural and financial theft from subsistence hunters and fishermen who
can least afford it. Besides, who wants to go home with an Eskimo mask made in Bali?
Federal enforcement has proved ineffective and officials have instead turned to edu-
cating the consumer as the solution. Here is what you need to know to do your part:
 Find out who made the piece. Any reputable art dealer will provide you with a biog-
raphy of the artist who created an expensive work. Ask specifically whether that
artist actually carved the piece. Some Alaska Native artists have sold their names
and designs to wholesalers who produce knockoffs. Even craftwork that is less
expensive should have the name of the person who made it attached, and the shop
owner should be able to tell you how he acquired the item.
 Consider the cost. Price is a key tip-off. An elaborate mask, if authentic, is more
likely to cost $3,000 than $300.
 Check the material. Most soapstone carvings are not made in Alaska. Authentic
materials include wood, ivory, bone, and animal furs and skin.
 Look for the silver hand. The Alaska State Council on the Arts (% 907-269-6610)
authenticates Native arts and crafts with a silver-hand label, which assures you
that an item to which it is affixed was made by the hands of an Alaska Native with
Alaskan materials. The program isn’t universally used, however, so the absence of
the label isn’t necessarily proof of a fake. Other labels aren’t worth much: An item
can legitimately say ALASKA MADE even when only insignificant assembly work hap-
pened within the state.
 Buy direct from the artist. In Bush Alaska, and in some urban shops and craft fairs,
you can buy authentic work direct from craftspeople. Buying in Native-owned co-
ops also is safe.

Nightlife
Nightlife in an Alaskan summer? Fly-casting for red salmon on the
Russian River under the midnight sun! But that’s certainly not all there
is. In summer, many communities play host to tourist shows; tickets are
around $20, or for dinner theater, $60. They’re often fun but always
corny, and I doubt you’ll want to attend more than one. Otherwise, per-
forming arts events, movies, and nightclubs cost about the same as they
do in the Lower 48 or anywhere else.
Keeping an Eye on Hidden Expenses
How is it that a final bill can be more than the sum of its parts? It may
have something to do with the little surprises that creep up on you
unawares. Add a contingency to your budget for the following extra
costs:
 Taxes: Most towns in Alaska (Anchorage is a notable exception)
have sales taxes, and all have bed taxes designed to soak the
tourists; together, these taxes can add 10 percent or more to the
cost of your room. Car-rental taxes and airport-concession fees can
add up to 30 percent, so make sure you include them when you
price your reservation.
 Baggage fees: Struggling airlines are imposing fees for everything
they can think of, and the most costly of these are for checking
bags. Alaska Airlines, the dominant carrier to and within Alaska,
allows only one free checked bag per passenger, charging $25 for 
a second checked bag, and $100 for a third. Also, bags over 50
pounds or 62 inches (length plus height plus width) cost $50 to $75
more. These limits aren’t generous, so plan what to pack well in
advance to avoid getting dinged. Campers may find that renting
sleeping bags and other equipment in Alaska is cheaper than bring-
ing your own.
 Tipping: All the tipping rules with which you’re familiar hold true
in Alaska: 18 percent in restaurants, $1 per bag for bell service, and
so on. When you get into the area of guides, fishing charters, tour
boats, and wilderness lodges, tipping becomes a little trickier. As a
general rule, tip guides and outfitters $10 to $20 per person per
day. For outings of less than a day, adjust the tip accordingly; a $20
tip for a family of four on a half-day sea-kayaking outing is reason-
able. At wilderness lodges, which normally have all-inclusive rates,
adding the tip to your final payment when you leave often is best,
because doing so allows the proprietor to distribute the gratuity to
the staff instead of your trying to do it at each meal. A blanket tip of
$15 per guest per day is acceptable. Tipping isn’t necessary when
you’re on a big tour boat with dozens of other guests, unless you
want to reward a particular crew member who helped you.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
52

 Taxis and transfers: Alaskan towns, especially the larger ones, can
be expensive to get around in when you don’t have your own car.
Allow $10 to $20 per person for each of your airport transfers,
unless you pick up a car at the airport or your lodging has a cour-
tesy van. If you plan activities out of the center of town, check
ahead of time how to get there to make sure that it isn’t too expen-
sive. (The listings I recommend in this book include descriptions
on how to get to particular locations.)
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
There are plenty of options for reducing the cost of your trip. Some are
as easy as finding money and should be a regular habit wherever you
travel; others require compromises that could mean you have to rethink
what you want to get out of your trip. General suggestions are listed
here. The Bargain Alert icons scattered throughout this book mark other
saving opportunities.
 Travel at off-peak times. Prices drop significantly during May and
September, yet these months still offer plenty to do. (See Chapter 3
for a discussion of what you gain and give up by traveling during
each of Alaska’s seasons.)
 Check out a package tour. For many Alaska destinations, you can
book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightsee-
ing just by making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price
much less than if you put the trip together yourself. (See the sec-
tion on package tours in Chapter 6 for suggestions, specific compa-
nies to call, and the downside.)
 Consider a cruise. When you add it all up, cruising can be less
expensive than independent travel in Alaska at the same comfort
level, especially if you snag a last-minute bargain. Similarly, the all-
inclusive price of a cruise protects against the budget creep that
often sneaks up on you when you pay as you go. (See Chapter 8 for
details on cruising.)
 Avoid cruise-line activity charges. Cruise lines usually add enor-
mous hidden charges to shore activities they sell onboard. You can
save 50 percent and get a better outing by booking shoreside activi-
ties directly using this book (while making sure to coordinate with
your port calls so you don’t get left behind). Make arrangements
before you leave home, as it will probably be difficult when you’re
traveling.
 Have some meals in your room. Some hotel rooms are equipped
with kitchenettes, giving you the comfortable and cheap option of
eating in. Even when you get a room with just a fridge and a cof-
feemaker, you can save time and money on breakfast and snacks.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 53

 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Choose rooms large enough for your entire family. A room with
two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a
queen-size bed. And even if you pay 50 percent more for a bigger
room or suite, it still saves you the difference of renting two rooms
(and you have more control over your kids). Most hotels won’t
charge you the additional-person rate if the additional person is
pint-size and related to you.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at a top restaurant,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties in smaller
portions.
 Know your telephone costs. Hotels often charge unreasonable fees
for using the phone, including fees for using the phone to make a
call you charge to a card. Cellphone roaming and long-distance fees
can add up quickly, too. If you have a nationwide roaming plan on
your mobile phone, and it includes Alaska, that will certainly be the
cheapest way to go, but check before leaving home to make sure
your phone will work and find out how much it will cost. The
second least-expensive choice is to purchase a by-the-minute
phone card at a grocery store after you get to Alaska.
 Take the Alaska Marine Highway System. The ferry system is a
fun and inexpensive way to travel from town to town and see the
scenery in coastal Alaska. (Chapter 7 includes more information
about getting around Alaska by ferry.)
 Go flightseeing on a commuter flight. If you can’t afford a spectac-
ular mountain or glacier flight — and many can’t — consider plan-
ning a short leg of your trip on a scheduled flight on a small plane,
and then let the pilot know you’re hoping to see plenty of scenery.
 Use pedal power. In all but only a few Alaska towns, bicycles are a
great form of transportation in the summer and are cheaper than
renting a car or using taxis.
 Buy a coupon book. Although The Great Alaskan TourSaver (% 907-
278-7600; www.toursaver.com) costs $100, it’s well worth the
price when you plan to travel as a couple, especially in the
Southcentral region. Among the more than 100 coupons, you’ll find
some freebies and many two-for-one deals on some of the best
activities and tours that are valuable enough to pay for the book
after only a couple of uses.

Handling Your Money
Alaska is as modern as any place in the United States, so you don’t have
to worry about relying on the barter system. Instead, pack your plastic,
and keep cash on hand for emergencies — or handle money whatever
other way you normally do. The only type of payment that won’t be as
available to you is your personal checkbook, although it, too, may come
in handy for some big expenses, such as wilderness lodges or outfitters,
which sometimes do not accept credit cards. In those rare situations,
you’ll know in advance, as those businesses typically require cash
deposits well before the trip.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an auto-
mated teller machine (ATM). ATMs are everywhere in Alaska, as else-
where in the United States. In the Bush, you can find one somewhere in
every town that has jet service at the airport. The Cirrus (% 800-424-
7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.
com) networks span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see
which network you’re on, and then call or check online for ATM loca-
tions at your destination. Be sure you know your personal identification
number (PIN) before you leave home, and be sure to find out your daily
withdrawal limit before you depart.
The only national bank with branches all over Alaska is Wells Fargo. Key
Bank also has branches, but not as many. If your own bank doesn’t have
branches in Alaska, you can call to find out whether it’s affiliated with a
bank that does business in the state. Doing so may save you a charge of
$2 or more for using a nonaffiliated ATM. (On top of this, the bank from
which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee.) You can also reduce
your withdrawal fees by taking out plenty of cash every time you use the
ATM, or by using your ATM card to buy something at the grocery store
and getting extra cash (with no extra fee).
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. Many credit cards also give you some form of insurance
against dishonest commercial behavior, and you can earn frequent-flier
miles or get money back for every dollar you spend. As long as you don’t
get in over your head and run up a balance that you can’t pay at the end
of the month, using a credit card is free.
You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit cards at banks or
ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours, or you
didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of your
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55

credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. Getting your PIN usually
takes five to seven business days, though some banks will provide the
number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or
some other personal information.
Don’t use a credit card to get cash from an ATM or from a bank teller
except in dire emergencies. The special fees and interest rates for this
service tend to be outrageous.
Virtually every Alaska business accepts a variety of credit cards, even
small B&Bs, convenience stores, and guys selling tourist junk from card
tables on the street. The only major exceptions are at the high end:
Wilderness lodges may insist on being paid in advance by check when
you reserve. Generally, you don’t need cash except for taxicabs and inci-
dentals too small to bother with a card.
Toting traveler’s checks
With the near-universal acceptance of credit cards and wide availability
of ATMs in Alaska, traveler’s checks make little sense. They’re inconven-
ient to use and not accepted by every merchant. And, though you’ll
avoid a fee for using an ATM belonging to a different bank than your
own, you’ll only save money by using traveler’s checks if the checks are
free and you don’t want to use credit cards for some reason. If you want
to use the checks anyway, you can get traveler’s checks in a variety of
denominations at almost any bank, where you’ll pay a service charge
ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks, in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the town
police department. Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police-report number or record of the loss. Card issuers have emergency
toll-free numbers to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be able to
wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit
card in a day or two. Visa’s U.S. emergency numbers are % 800-847-
2911 and 410-581-9994. American Express cardholders and traveler’s
check holders should call % 800-221-7282. MasterCard holders should
call % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111. For other credit cards, call the toll-
free number directory at % 800-555-1212.
If you need emergency cash and have no ATM card or access to a bank,
you can have money wired to you via Western Union (% 800-325-6000;
www.westernunion.com).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
56

Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; they might allow you to board the plane
if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.

Getting to Alaska
In This Chapter

 Going the long way: Alaska by land or by sea
 Finding planning help
 Getting the scoop on packages
T
he moment I put down a credit card for a plane ticket is, to me, like
the moment I leap off a diving board. That’s when I realize I really am
going. Getting to the edge of the board is hard, too, just like narrowing
down all your choices and taking the plunge on a trip. But delaying only
means that you’ll lose out on some of your best choices. When you buy
the tickets, you nail down your dates. You can then start filling in all the
days in between and line up all your other reservations.
I’m assuming you will buy a plane ticket (or passage on a cruise with a
flight home). You can get to Alaska otherwise, but except for the ferry,
they’re not practical for a typical one- or two-week vacation. (For more
information on cruising to Alaska, check out Chapter 8.) The real ques-
tions for you to examine, then, are how and from whom you should buy
your plane ticket, and whether you want it as part of a package or
escorted tour.
Flying to Alaska
Since the beginning of commercial aviation, Alaskans have used air-
planes as a primary means of transportation. Flights to Alaska are fre-
quent and sometimes cheap enough for Alaskans to take weekend trips
outside the state. This is the easy part.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Anchorage is the main entry hub served by several major domestic car-
riers, and sometimes flights from Europe or Asia. You can also fly into
Fairbanks or Southeast Alaska. Most passengers come into Anchorage
through Seattle, but for a bit more you can fly nonstop to Anchorage
from various major U.S. cities. You have many more options in summer
than in winter.

Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com) offers more
flights than all other airlines combined, as many as 20 a day to Seattle 
in summer, as well as summer nonstop flights to a scattering of cities
across the country. Alaska Airlines is the only jet carrier with more 
than token coverage anywhere in Alaska other than Anchorage and has
arrangements with commuter lines that fan out from its network to
smaller communities.
The complete list of other carriers serving Anchorage has been changing
rapidly in this era of uncertainty in the airline industry. Here are those
offering more than one or two flights a day as of this writing:
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com)
 Continental Airlines (% 800-523-3273; www.continental.com)
 Delta Air Lines (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com)
 Northwest Airlines (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com)
 United Airlines (% 800-864-8331; www.ual.com)
 U.S. Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com)
You can fly by jet to Alaska cities other than Anchorage, but Alaska
Airlines is the only carrier to most communities. It’s a good airline, but
the lack of competition and expensive operating conditions make for
high prices. Fares from Seattle to Juneau are more than for the hour
longer run from Seattle to Anchorage. And getting most anywhere else in
Alaska by jet from Anchorage costs as much as or more than fares to
Seattle. You’ll have a difficult time saving on fares to smaller communi-
ties. The only ways to save are to buy your ticket well ahead of your trip,
possibly catch a last-minute bargain on the Alaska Airlines Web site, or
buy a package from Alaska Airlines Vacations (see “Choosing a Package
Tour,” later in this chapter).
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
With airfares, you pay for flexibility. If you buy a ticket at the last minute
or choose to fly on premium days, such as Friday or Sunday, you often
have to pay the premium rate, known as the full fare. If, however, you
book your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, or travel on a
Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, you can qualify for the least expen-
sive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. Also, because Alaska is the
end of the line for most flights, many planes leave from Anchorage very
early in the morning. You save a lot by taking one of these red-eye flights
that leave between midnight and 3 a.m.
Chapter 6: Getting to Alaska 59

The airlines serving Anchorage add to the unpredictability of pricing by
engaging in fare wars. Alaskans fly so much that we talk about airfares
the way New Yorkers talk about real estate, including bragging about
outrageous bargains. Fares vary wildly, so watching for sales can pay off.
Changing planes in Seattle is almost always cheapest, due to the compe-
tition on the Seattle-Anchorage route. The competition also makes these
fares more volatile than the NASDAQ, and that’s increasingly true now.
Summer sales sometimes hit in April (but some years, they never hit).
To get a crazy fare, you have to book quickly and go along with some-
times weird restrictions about when you can fly and how long you have
to stay. Wait for these fare wars and then act fast before the airlines
change their prices (within a day or two for the best fares). If you can
make a last-minute decision, sign up for Web specials on the Alaska
Airlines Web site and other airline sites — there often are bargains to be
had that you can’t get any other way.
Booking your flight online
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel
agencies are Travelocity (www.travelocity.com); Expedia (www.
expedia.com); and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com). In the U.K., go to
Travelsupermarket (% 0845-345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.com),
a flight search engine that offers flight comparisons for the budget air-
lines whose seats often end up in bucket-shop sales. Other Web sites for
booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights (www.cheapflights.
com), Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), Priceline (www.
priceline.com), and Opodo (www.opodo.com).
Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to airline and hotel
Web sites for booking) include SideStep (www.sidestep.com) and
Kayak (www.kayak.com); the latter includes fares for budget carriers
like JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, as well as the major airlines. In addition,
most airlines offer online-only fares that even their phone agents know
nothing about.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
60
Alaska Airlines online
Alaska Airlines, the dominant carrier serving Alaska, was a pioneer in using electronic
tickets and check-in. The airline makes using the Internet worth your while, with a
sophisticated and easy-to-use Web site (www.alaskaair.com), discounts for buying
your ticket there, and technology at the airport that makes an E-ticket fast and easy to
use. You can check in for your flight at an electronic kiosk with no waiting (or even online
before you leave home) and then check baggage in the usually quick lines reserved for
those who already have boarding passes.

If you’re really looking to save money, don’t rely on a single Web site. For
an Alaska trip, it’s worthwhile to check a travel agency site, the site of
the airline that shows as the lowest cost, and the Alaska Airlines site
(www.alaskaair.com). Alaska’s site is especially useful, because it
shows the price of each leg of your flight separately.
Unless you really know what you’re doing, don’t use the Internet for a
complicated itinerary or special circumstances. There are tricks to get-
ting a good deal on multiple-layover or open-jaw itineraries (itineraries
in which the departure city is different on the way out than on the
return), and unless you know them, the Internet may not give you the
cheapest fare. For example, a good travel agent may figure out how you
can buy the tickets as pairs of round-trips and save money instead of
putting all your stops on the same ticket. You can spend hours on the
Internet figuring out something like that, but a good agent already
knows. Likewise, if you’re traveling with children or using a combination
of frequent-flier and paid-for tickets, you may miss companion fares or
other savings that you don’t know about. A skilled travel agent can beat
the system in these circumstances in ways that just aren’t obvious.
Getting to Alaska by Road, Water, or Rail
Cruise ships carry as many visitors to Alaska as any other means of
transport. Choosing a cruise is a big decision that will affect your whole
trip, so that option has its own chapter (see Chapter 8). You can also
drive or take a ferry to Alaska. Look to these alternatives — cruise, ferry,
or road — for the experience, not for savings. All of them take more time
and cost more money than a competitive plane fare to Anchorage.
Driving to Alaska
Before you contemplate a drive to Alaska, you need to understand the
distances involved. Driving from Seattle to Anchorage is 2,350 miles on
two-lane highways. That’s about the same as Seattle to Detroit. You’ll put
a lot of wear on your car and yourself, you’ll spend a lot of money on gas
and lodgings, and you’ll burn a week of vacation time each way (more if
you live in the eastern or southern states).
Crossing the U.S./Canadian border requires preparation even for U.S. cit-
izens. Starting in 2009, U.S. citizens will need passports to reenter the
country over the road, and Canadians will need passports but not visas.
(Check www.travel.state.gov for the latest, as these are controversial
requirements subject to change.) Besides a passport, children with their
parents should have a birth certificate; minors 17 or under unaccompa-
nied by parents need a notarized letter from a parent or guardian; and
children with a single parent should carry such a letter from the other
parent. If in doubt about any of these issues, call before you go, as the
border is a long way from anywhere: Canadian Customs in Whitehorse
(% 867-667-3943) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the high-
way (% 907-772-2252) or in Skagway (% 907-983-2325).
Chapter 6: Getting to Alaska 61

If you choose to drive to Alaska, get a mile-by-mile road guide called The
Milepost (Morris Communications).
Taking the ferry to Alaska
If you plan to tour Southeast Alaska, take the Alaska Marine Highway
ferry part of the way (% 800-642-0066; www.ferryalaska.com). From
the south, embark at Bellingham, Washington, or Prince Rupert, British
Columbia. Riding the ferry is fun, and you can stop over anywhere along
the way without paying much extra for your tickets.
You’re better off not bringing a car. The small towns of Southeast Alaska
are easy to tour on foot or by bicycle; you can rent a car for a day when
you want to go farther afield, which will likely cost less than the ferry
passage for your own car. I include car-rental agency suggestions in the
appropriate city chapters later in this book. If you do bring your car, you
need to reserve your ferry space at least several months ahead.
If you’re headed beyond Southeast Alaska, the best choice is to disem-
bark the ferry at Juneau and fly onward to Anchorage or Fairbanks. If
you’re determined to make the trip without flying, get off the ferry in
Haines or Skagway. From these cities, you’ll need a car or RV to get to
the rest of the state, and you’ll have a lot of road ahead of you: Skagway
to Anchorage is 832 miles. (Bus service from Skagway via Whitehorse is
irregular and requires overnight changes — that option is so unattrac-
tive I haven’t included the details.) You can rent a car or RV and drive it
one-way to Anchorage, but you’ll have to pay a drop-off fee that will add
hundreds of dollars to your rental cost. Car rentals in Skagway are avail-
able from Avis, in the Westmark Hotel at 3rd and Spring streets (% 800-
230-4898 or 907-983-2247; www.avis.com). Alaska Motorhome Rentals
(% 800-254-9929; www.bestofalaskatravel.com) rents RVs one-way
to Anchorage with a drop-off fee of up to $900, plus the cost of the
rental, mileage, and gas.
You can also take the ferry all the way across the Gulf of Alaska from
Juneau to Whittier, less than a two-hour drive from Anchorage. This is a
40-hour voyage in open ocean, and the ferry only runs once or twice a
month.
Riding the rails to Alaska — not!
You can’t get to Alaska by train, but you can get close. From the West
Coast of the U.S. you can take Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL [800-872-7245];
www.amtrak.com) to Bellingham, Washington; the dock for the Alaska
ferry is quite close to the railroad station. From the eastern United
States, using Canada’s Via Rail (% 888-VIA-RAIL [888-842-7245]; www.
viarail.ca) makes more sense. The transcontinental route starts all
the way back in Toronto; you change in Jasper to end up in Prince
Rupert, British Columbia, where you can catch the Alaska ferry north.

Finding a Travel Agent
Finding a good travel agent can really be a feat. If you find one, tell every-
one you know. They’re as rare as trustworthy auto mechanics. The prob-
lem is, the job is a very tough one, and the incentives — commissions on
the trip’s price — reward agents who make the trip cost more, not less.
At the same time, agents working on commission are struggling as the
airlines eliminate the payments they used to receive. Add to these pres-
sures the need to be universally knowledgeable about every place in the
world that your client may want to go, and you have a virtually impossi-
ble job.
I’ve seen the results of some well-off travelers simply calling their local
travel agent and asking for the perfect Alaska vacation. They end up
flying back and forth across the state, going to expensive places in quick
succession, with little consideration of their true interests. Even an
agent who is scrupulously honest but knows little about Alaska will
likely book visitors into only the best-advertised places. The defense
against these pitfalls is knowledge: Go to the agent with a good idea of
what you want to do (based on what you’ve discovered in reading this
book), not asking for the agent to fill in a blank slate. A good agent can
then take your preferences, shop for the best prices, and make your
reservations, saving you a good deal of work and sometimes finding bar-
gains you’d be hard-pressed to find on your own.
Some businesses in Alaska don’t pay agents any commission, especially
small operators such as bed-and-breakfasts and outdoors guides, while
some big operations have cut agency commissions to the breaking
point. So expecting an agent, especially an Alaska expert, to work with-
out charging you a fee is probably unreasonable these days. Some of the
best Alaska experts — the ones you really can trust to plan your whole
itinerary — charge clients $100 or more per person, on top of the com-
missions they receive from service providers. You get what you pay for,
and if you’re spending several thousand dollars on a trip, a couple hun-
dred more to ensure the best trip is probably a good investment.
Here are some agencies that specialize in setting up Alaska trips:
 Alaska Bound (% 888-ALASKA-7 [888-252-7527] or 231-439-3000;
www.alaskabound.com), is the only one I know of in the Lower 48
that specializes in Alaska with a staff of former Alaskans. The com-
pany started as a cruise planner, working primarily with Holland
America, but now plans many independent trips, too, charging fees
based on the length of the trip ($100 per person would be typical).
 Alaska Tour & Travel (% 800-208-0200; www.alaskatravel.com)
claims to be the largest custom vacation company in Alaska. The
same folks operate the Park Connection shuttle between Denali and
Kenai Fjords national parks, and that central part of the state is
Chapter 6: Getting to Alaska 63

what they know best and cover deeply. The Web site is remarkable,
including a search tool that brings up preset itineraries based on
criteria you specify, and a live availability-and-rate calendar for a
range of Denali National Park hotels.
 Alaska.org (% 888-ALASKA-8 [888-252-7528]) is a deep and well-
built Web site that allows users to shop and customize package
trips or design their own vacations in the Southcentral-to-Fairbanks
region with as much or as little structure and guidance as they
choose, and without a surcharge. When you’ve seen enough, call
the toll-free number for questions and booking. Or don’t. Unique
for this kind of site, you can use it just to get information and call
the listed operators yourself.
 Sport Fishing Alaska (% 888-552-8674; www.alaskatrip
planners.com), is a good choice for a fishing vacation. The owner,
former lodge owner Sheary Suiter, knows where the fish are from
week to week. She’ll also book the balance of your trip at fun and
interesting places. Compensation begins with a $95 upfront fee,
plus commissions.
 Viking Travel (% 800-327-2571; www.alaskaferry.com), special-
izes in Southeast Alaska trips, outdoor activities, and using the fer-
ries of the Alaska Marine Highway. It’s a friendly small-town
business with total knowledge of its own area.
Joining an Escorted Tour
Hundreds of thousands of visitors come to Alaska each year on escorted
tours, leaving virtually all their travel arrangements in the hands of a
single company that takes responsibility for ushering them through the
state for a single, lump-sum fee. Most of these visitors arrive on a cruise
ship and add a land-tour package with the same firm.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obliga-
tions either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell
you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 12.)
Finding out the basics
If you can’t relax and enjoy a trip knowing unforeseen difficulties could
happen, then take an escorted package tour. You’ll know in advance how
much everything costs, you don’t have to worry about making hotel and
ground-transportation reservations, you’re guaranteed to see the high-
lights of each town you visit, and you’ll always have a guide. Everything
happens on schedule, and you rarely have to touch your baggage other
than to unpack when it magically shows up in your room. Though you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
64

may sometimes feel like you’re a member of a herd, you’ll also meet new
people — a big advantage if you’re traveling on your own. Many passen-
gers on these trips are retired, over age 65.
Escorted packages have their disadvantages, too. They often travel at an
exhausting pace. Passengers get up early and cover a lot of ground, with
sights and activities scheduled solidly through the day. That may be
good if you’re short on time, but the stops last only long enough to get a
taste of what the sight is about. You typically don’t have time to dig in
and learn about a place you’re especially interested in.
Also, on an escorted trip, you meet few, if any, Alaska residents, because
most tour companies hire college students from Outside (a term
Alaskans use to refer to anyplace that’s not in Alaska) to fill summer
jobs. You stay in only the largest hotels and eat in the largest, tourist-
oriented restaurants — no small, quaint places loaded with local charac-
ter. Also, the big tour companies try to take visitors primarily to attrac-
tions they own, bypassing some terrific public attractions. For visiting
the wilderness, such as Denali National Park, the quick and superficial
approach can spoil the whole point of going to a destination that’s about
an experience, not just seeing a particular object or place.
Unfortunately, some people choose an escorted tour based on expecta-
tions that aren’t valid. Studies by Alaska tourism experts have found
that many visitors choose escorted packages to avoid risks that don’t
really exist. Alaska may still be untamed, but that doesn’t mean it’s a
dangerous or uncomfortable place to travel. Visitors who sign up for a
tour to avoid having to spend the night in an igloo or use an outhouse
may wish they’d been a bit more adventurous when they arrive and find
that Alaska has the same facilities found in any other state. Except for
tiny Bush villages that you’re unlikely to visit anyway, you’ll come across
the standard American hotel room almost anywhere you go.
Shopping for an escorted tour
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? Do you get a refund if they
cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
or shop? I sometimes see visitors sleeping through spectacular
scenery because they’re exhausted from early departures and
super-busy days.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
Chapter 6: Getting to Alaska 65

may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate, and they certainly
know the maximum they will take. Likewise, if the tour has a mini-
mum group size, the operator may cancel if they don’t book enough
people; ask how close they are to reaching any minimum.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion but drinks may be extra. How much flexi-
bility do you have? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
 Can I go off on my own? Can you ditch the group at times and do
your own thing? Often, the answer is no, because a big group with a
fast pace has to stick together. But you can look for a tour with
more on-your-own time.
Selecting an escorted-tour company
Two major tour and cruise-ship companies, both owned by the Carnival
cruise line, dominate the Alaska market with operations that allow them
to take care of everything you do while in Alaska with tight quality con-
trol. Each also offers tours as short as a couple of hours for independent
travelers who want to combine their own exploring with a more struc-
tured experience. You can book all tours through any travel agent. Note:
Outdoor-oriented escorted tours are covered in Chapter 9.
 Holland America Tours (% 800-544-2206; www.graylineof
alaska.com or www.hollandamerica.com), part of the Holland
America cruise line, is the giant of Alaska tourism. Thousands of
visitors do business with no one else when they come. The
Alaska/Yukon operation employs more than 2,100 workers operat-
ing 225 buses, 14 railcars, and two day boats. Most clients arrive in
the state on one of the company’s ships (see Chapter 8), but even
within Alaska, chances are good that a tour you sign up for will put
you on a Gray Line coach and exclusively in Westmark hotels, both
owned by Holland America. Some of the Westmarks are among the
best in town, including those in Juneau (called the Baranof),
Fairbanks, and Sitka, while others are unremarkable. But then, on a
group tour you don’t spend much time in the room, as schedules
generally are tightly planned and daily departures are early. The
company’s railcars on the Denali National Park run are like some-
thing from the Orient Express. Gray Line coaches are first-rate, too.
And the company goes more places than any other, with a catalog
that covers just about anything in the state that could possibly be
done with a group. Some of the tour excursions — on the Yukon
River between Dawson City and Eagle, for example — are entirely
unique. Prices depend on a variety of factors, but in general a tour
of a week is about $1,400 per person.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
66

 Princess Cruises and Tours (% 800-426-0550; www.princess
lodges.com), now owned by Carnival, built its tour operation from
the ground up, surpassing Holland America with the consistently
outstanding quality of its smaller list of offerings. That advantage
persists. The five Princess hotels are all among Alaska’s best. 
Two are near Denali National Park, and one each is in Fairbanks,
Cooper Landing (on the Kenai Peninsula), and Copper Center, near
Wrangell–St. Elias National Park. Princess operates its own coaches
and has superb railcars on the Alaska Railroad route to Denali.
Descriptions of each property can be found in the appropriate
chapter. Most people on the tours come to Alaska on a cruise ship,
but tours are for sale separately, too.
Choosing a Package Tour
Though most visitors choose to see Alaska by escorted tour, more and
more people are cutting the apron strings and exploring Alaska on their
own, either in whole or after a cruise, and in the process discovering a
more relaxed, spontaneous experience.
The big reason to book a package tour is to save money. In many cases,
a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to and
from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book your-
self. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, who
resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a buy-
in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-
count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time at a cost that
undercuts the local supermarket. Package tours can vary as much as
those garbage bags, too. Some offer a better class of hotels than others;
others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book flights on
scheduled airlines; others sell charter flights. In some packages, your
choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited.
Do some comparison-shopping before you commit to a package, how-
ever, because you may be able to undercut all package-tour prices using
my money-saving tips about airfare (earlier in this chapter) and lodging
(see Chapter 10). For more information on package tours and for tips on
booking your trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.
Airlines often package their flights with accommodations. To find a bar-
gain, you may need to be flexible. Prices vary significantly depending on
the time you travel and the kinds of hotels you pick. Several big online
travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and Lastminute.com —
also highlight packages. If you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller
packager, check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in the city where
the company is based, or go to www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell
you where it’s based, don’t fly with them. Several large-scale scams have
ripped off visitors to Alaska, so caution is well advised.
Chapter 6: Getting to Alaska 67

Within Alaska, certain hotels and destinations that are priced reasonably
as package tours cost much more if you book them separately. If you 
go to Barrow, Nome, or Katmai National Park, the package-tour price
offered by Alaska Airlines Vacations (% 800-468-2248; www.alaska
air.com) is sometimes less than the cost of the plane ticket by itself.
(Compare current prices on the Web site.) This pricing doesn’t make
much sense, but you might as well take advantage of it. These packages
are for day trips with a tour, or for the tour and an overnight stay. If
you’re not the escorted-tour type, you can still take advantage of the
bargain, stick around for as much of the tour as you want, and then do
your own thing, as long as you catch the return flight.
Traveling on the Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552 or 907-265-2494;
www.alaskarailroad.com) is also cheaper as a package. The railroad
sells a wide variety of its own packages, which it calls “Rail Tours,” spe-
cializing in the area the train reaches, from Anchorage to Fairbanks and
Seward. Check out the choices on the Web site, which allows travelers to
choose from vacation packages, design their own, or buy the railroad’s
excellent day trips a la carte. Some selections are geared as continua-
tions of cruises. Part of the appeal: This hybrid, independent/package
approach is the chance to have a trip with plenty of guided activities but
without having your hand held every minute. Prices are reasonable, too.
Alaska Highway Cruises (% 800-323-5757; www.bestofalaskatravel.
com) offers the unique option of traveling one-way on a Holland America
cruise ship, and then picking up an RV for a land tour. You can choose a
package that ends up back at Seattle by road or by air. The tours follow
set itineraries with reservations along the way — the service is designed
for first-time Alaska travelers and RV drivers who don’t want to worry
about the details — so some spontaneity is sacrificed. You get the secu-
rity and simplicity of a package without being marched around in a
group or cooped up in hotels.
Several travel agencies offer packages that resemble preplanned custom
tours, with details you can adjust but a basic plan with a standard total
price. Alaska Tour & Travel and Alaska.org (both of which are listed in
the “Finding a Travel Agent” section, earlier in this chapter) are two rep-
utable firms using this model. The concept is to start with a template
itinerary that covers what most people want to do, and then change it to
fit your particular interests and needs. The approach makes sense, espe-
cially for visitors making their first trip to Alaska, because it prevents
being overwhelmed with choices at the start of the process.

 Driving around Alaska
A
s I may have mentioned elsewhere, Alaska is big — and it’s rugged
and sparsely developed. So even in this modern age, some areas
are only accessible by certain methods of transportation. Airplanes are
the only means of transport that can take you everywhere (although, in
some cases, flying makes no sense); you can only get to the capital city
of Juneau by boat or air; and trains serve only a narrow region.
Almost every Alaska vacation combines at least two modes of trans-
portation, with air and car or air and cruise ship being the most
common. But in Southeast Alaska, you’re likely to need three: air, boat,
and car. Adding a little rail is a tasty seasoning to the mixture, because
the Alaska Railroad is quite luxurious. And don’t overlook the attrac-
tions of connecting to small towns by propeller-driven aircraft. Flying in
one of these little planes is as Alaskan as dog-mushing and gives you a
vivid, bird’s-eye perspective of the countryside that you can’t get any
other way.
This chapter is irrelevant for travelers visiting Alaska by cruise only
(with a flight at the beginning or end of the trip). Unless you’ll add a land
portion to your cruise vacation, you don’t really need this information.
(See Chapter 8 for cruise details.)
Table 7-1 lists the places I cover in this book and the ways to get there. 
I leave off choices that are possible but not advisable. The rest of this
chapter provides you with the details of getting from here to there in
Alaska.

Flying Around Alaska
Alaska has three levels of scheduled air service:
 Alaska Airlines jets: This airline (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.
com) serves most communities of 1,000 residents or more that can’t
be reached by road. This includes most towns in Southeast Alaska
and hubs around the Alaska Bush.
 Commuter-class airlines: Operating frequently scheduled service
with larger propeller-driven planes to towns that may or may not
have roads, these services fan out from Anchorage, Fairbanks, and
Juneau to smaller communities.
 Air services to the Bush: With planes carrying as few as three pas-
sengers, these services fly from hubs to tiny communities, wilder-
ness lodges, and fishing sites that can’t be reached any other way.
This mode of transportation serves more than 200 communities in
Alaska.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
70

Bush planes are scheduled, but operators don’t always get hung up
on strict definitions of time. I remember the surprise of some
tourists who walked into a flight service for the 4 p.m. flight. A guy
reading the newspaper behind the desk got up and said, “Okay, let’s
find a plane.” He eventually found one and flew them where they
were going.
I list the air services that go to each community in the appropriate chap-
ters in this book, with sample airfares. Fares change frequently, so use
these listings only as guidelines. Also, compare both the jet and the prop
options, if both exist — either one may be cheaper. Taking a prop saves
time on security. Sometimes, the larger commuter carriers have specials
that you can find only on their Web sites, as does Alaska Airlines. These
specials are usually last-minute deals, and they turn up less frequently in
the high tourist season. Otherwise, you rarely can save much money
over the regular, quoted fare on flying between Alaska communities.
Anyone who comes to Alaska should take at least one flight in a small
plane. Only then can you see for yourself how little civilization exists in
this vast place. Every part of the state has beautiful scenery, but the
very best flights go around Denali National Park from Talkeetna or the
park entrance, or fly over the glaciers and islands of Southeast Alaska
from Skagway or Juneau. If a flightseeing outing doesn’t fit into your
budget, try to travel between two towns on a small plane.
Flying around Southeast Alaska
Ferries are the most relaxing way to enjoy Southeast Alaska, but if you
don’t have time for a boat ride, you can combine a ferry with air travel
to make the most of your trip. For example, a ferry ride to Sitka from
Juneau takes most of a day and the adult fare is around $45. For around
$125, you can fly back in less than an hour and save a day that you
would otherwise spend taking the same boat ride back.
Flying around Southcentral Alaska and the Interior
Driving usually makes the most sense for this highway-connected por-
tion of the state, both because you save money and you get to see so
much between towns. But for winter trips, or to save time, you can hop
from town to town by plane and rent a car when you arrive. (I don’t rec-
ommend long wintertime highway drives for folks not used to driving on
ice; Alaska roads are icy all winter, help is often far away, and tempera-
tures can be very cold.)
Flying from Anchorage to Fairbanks usually costs under $300 round-trip
with advance purchase and is sometimes as low as $200. Flying saves a
full day each way over driving or taking the train. (The lowest round-trip
train fare is $420 in the high season.) You can also fly from Anchorage to
towns such as Homer, Kenai, or Valdez, saving many hours of driving;
using this strategy, you can make Anchorage a base for far-flung fishing
or sightseeing day trips that would take two or three days by car.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Alaska 71

Flying to the Bush
The only way to the great mass of Alaska is by air. Alaska Airlines flies
jets to larger Bush hubs, such as Nome, Barrow, and Kodiak. Expect to
pay $450 to $650 to Barrow or Nome with advance purchase and $350 or
more to Kodiak. You can usually save by buying a package from Alaska
Airlines Vacations (details are in the town sections). After you arrive in
the Bush communities, small flight services carry passengers and cargo
to the surrounding Alaska Native villages in prop-driven planes. Taking
one of these planes, for a fare of $75 to $200 round-trip, gets you into
very remote areas where you can see how Native people live; but don’t
go in bad weather.
Riding the Rails
Alaska has only one full-service rail line, running from Seward about 500
miles north, through Anchorage and Denali National Park and ending in
Fairbanks. The Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552 or 907-265-2494; www.
alaskarailroad.com) runs through unbelievably beautiful country.
The trains are well appointed, recalling the golden days of rail. Onboard
guides provide commentary, and you can ride in dome cars to soak in
the views.
The train is expensive and slow. For example, to get from Anchorage to
Denali National Park takes seven and a half hours each way and costs
$270 round-trip in the high season. For the much more desirable Gold
Star service, add another $170. (For less than $250, you can rent a car
for a week, and the drive is only four and a half hours.) And, after you
arrive by train, you still need to find a way to get around. For these rea-
sons, I advise most parties to drive; but if you’re traveling alone, or trav-
eling as a couple and you don’t like to drive, consider using the railroad.
Also, check out the Alaska Railroad’s money-saving packages, on its Web
site. (See Chapter 6 for information on package tours.)
The state’s other railroad, the gold rush–era White Pass & Yukon
Route, is primarily an excursion train, as opposed to a people-moving
service. It takes sightseeing runs from Skagway into the pass and back
(see Chapter 21).
Sailing the Alaskan Coast
The state-run Alaska Marine Highway System (% 800-642-0066; www.
ferryalaska.com) is a subsidized fleet of big, blue-hulled ferries the
mission of which is to connect the roadless coastal towns of Alaska for
roughly the same kind of cost you’d pay if the area had roads to drive
on. The schedule is on the Web site.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
72

The system’s strengths are its low cost, frequent summer sailings, inex-
pensive stopovers, exceptional safety, and the fact that kids love it. In
the summer, U.S. Forest Service guides offer interpretive talks onboard.
The system’s weaknesses are crowds during July peak season, occa-
sional lengthy delays, and a shortage of cabins, which means that most
people camp on deck or sleep in chairs during overnight passages.
You can ride the ferry to Alaska, starting off in Bellingham, Washington,
or Prince Rupert, British Columbia, but you’re going to need to add a
couple of days to your itinerary. For most travelers, it makes more sense
to fly to your starting point somewhere in the middle of Southeast
Alaska. Flying saves time and reduces the chance of having to spend the
night sleeping in a chair onboard. Long hauls on the ferry can be uncom-
fortable and don’t save much money compared to flying, but the ferry is
much less expensive and more appealing for connecting towns within
the Southeast region.
Fly into Juneau or Sitka and plan a ferry trip from there, stopping at vari-
ous places before returning to catch your plane home. The schedule has
been changeable in recent years, but during the summer, you can count
on the larger ships in the fleet stopping daily (although sometimes in the
middle of the night) in Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, Haines,
and Skagway. Sitka currently receives daily service, but in the past ships
stopped there slightly less frequently. One high-speed catamaran, the
Fairweather, saves about half the sailing time over the traditional ves-
sels, but I can’t predict which route it will be serving when you visit. The
ferry Kennicott crosses the Gulf of Alaska once or twice a month in the
summer, connecting Juneau to Whittier, near Anchorage, and points
west. Other ferries link towns in Prince William Sound and between the
Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak and even to the remote Aleutian Islands.
Check out the map on the inside back cover of this book to find out
where the Alaska ferries travel.
The ferry is quite economical. For example, the run from Juneau to Sitka
takes nine hours on the regular ferry, five on the fast ferry, for a fare of
$45, plus approximately $80 to bring your car along (though you have
more flexibility and freedom if you don’t — see the upcoming section,
“Making your ferry ride more enjoyable”). Fares for children 6 to 11 are
half-price, and children 5 and under ride free. A cabin with an outside
window and private bath is only $56 on that route (although there are no
cabins on the fast ferry).
Reserving ferry passage
The Alaska Marine Highway (www.ferryalaska.com) has an online
booking system that makes figuring out a trip far easier than using its
inscrutable timetables. Just be sure to make vehicle and cabin reserva-
tions as early as possible. If you need to talk to a real person for advice
or to change reservations, the system has a toll-free number (% 800-642-
0066), but it can be understaffed, with long waits for an operator. An
Chapter 7: Getting Around Alaska 73

alternative is Viking Travel, in Petersburg (% 800-327-2571 or 907-
772-3818; www.alaskaferry.com), which will accept your booking
before the official reservation system opens, and then reserve it the first
day the system becomes available. It can also take care of all your air
and tour connections, lodgings, activities, and so on.
Making your ferry ride more enjoyable
You won’t find anything difficult about riding the ferry — in fact, it’s the
most relaxing mode of transportation I know. But a few insider tips may
make it even better:
 Buying ahead or booking round-trip tickets saves you nothing on
the ferry, and stopovers of any length add little to the cost of your
passage. Use the ferry system to explore the towns along the route,
grabbing the next ferry through to continue your journey.
 If you travel without a vehicle, you generally don’t need reserva-
tions (with the possible exceptions of the Bellingham sailings and
passages across the Gulf of Alaska from Juneau to Whittier).
 Bring along a bike, or even a sea kayak, to have wonderful freedom
in exploring Southeast Alaska. You can carry either quite cheaply.
 Don’t count on port calls to be long enough to see the towns. If the
boat is running late, the staff may not let you off at all. Instead, get
off and catch the next ferry through.
 In the summer, you need to make a reservation well in advance,
often several months ahead, for any real chance of taking a vehicle
on the ferry. It’s expensive, too. Renting a car at your destination
will probably save money and enhance your trip by allowing you
more flexibility in your stopovers.
 Try to bring some of your own food on the ferry. Ferry food can get
boring after several meals in a row, and during peak season, lines
are sometimes unreasonably long. My family usually brings a cooler
or picnic basket. Even if you’re traveling light, you can pick up some
bagels and deli sandwiches on a stopover or long port call.
 You can avoid some crowds on the boats by scheduling around
them. Ferries are crowded northbound in June, southbound in
August, and both ways in July. If you’re planning to fly one way and
take the ferry the other, go against the flow (southbound in June
and northbound in Aug).
Covering Ground by Bus
If you don’t want to rent a car, fly, or pay the outrageous fares on the
Alaska Railroad, you can get around parts of Alaska by bus or van. When
traveling alone, the bus can be a good way to meet other adventurous
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
74

travelers. Most of the buses run only in the summer and mainly serve
visitors. No single large bus company serves the entire state. Instead,
mom-and-pop operations cover certain home routes. With some excep-
tions, the quality is below intercity coaches operated by the big bus
lines. Here are some of the larger operations with the places they serve:
 Alaska/Yukon Trails (% 800-770-7275; www.alaskashuttle.
com), a van and bus service, operates on the Parks Highway from
Fairbanks to Anchorage and also serves the Alaska and Top of the
World highways from Fairbanks to Dawson City. You can start or
stop anywhere in between. The Anchorage to Denali fare is $65, a
third of the train fare. The shuttle stops at hostels and is popular
with backpackers.
 The Park Connection Motorcoach Service (% 800-266-8625 or
907-245-0200; www.alaskatravel.com/bus-lines) connects
Seward with Anchorage and Denali National Park daily in the
summer in each direction with big, comfortable coaches. Fares are
competitive: $56 from Anchorage to Seward, $135 Seward to Denali.
 Homer Stage Line (% 907-235-2251, or 907-399-1847 on the van;
www.homerstageline.com) runs older-model vans from Homer to
Anchorage and points in between. The fare is $65 one-way, $120
round-trip, plus a fuel surcharge.
Driving Around Alaska
In the summer, driving is the most practical way to see the Interior and
Southcentral Alaska. The road network is simple, with just a few two-
lane highways connecting Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the towns in their
orbits. Although few roads exist, you’ll encounter little traffic on most of
them (though around Anchorage, weekend drivers can clog the roads).
The stunning, undeveloped scenery you’ll pass through on your drive
can be a highlight of your trip. Touring these highways with an RV is
another classic way to see Alaska; I cover that in the following section.
(Details on the best driving routes are in Chapter 18.)
Renting a car
Because I don’t recommend driving to Alaska (unless you have lots of
time on your hands), you should rent a car after you get here. You can
find the major car-rental companies based at the Anchorage and
Fairbanks airports, including Avis, Hertz, Dollar, Budget, Payless,
Alamo and National (national reservation numbers and Web addresses
are listed in the Quick Concierge). I don’t recommend renting a car in
Southeast Alaska towns, except perhaps for a day to see the edges of
town.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Alaska 75

Some of Alaska’s greatest drives are on gravel roads, but nearly every
rental agency prohibits taking their cars off pavement, where broken
windshields and flat tires are common. Driving a car on a gravel highway
in violation of your rental contract exposes you to costs for damages
that likely will not be covered by insurance. Some independent compa-
nies that permit their cars on the unpaved roads offer questionable
older vehicles, but I’ve never received a complaint about these two long-
established outfits in Fairbanks that cater to drivers who want to con-
quer the gravel rural roads:
 In Fairbanks, Alamo/National, with locations at the airport and at
4960 Dale Rd. (% 907-451-7368), rents four-door, four-wheel-drive
pickup trucks for travel on gravel roads such as the Dalton, Steese,
and Denali highways. Be sure to call the local franchise, not the
national reservation number.
 Another Fairbanks firm rents SUVs, trucks, and campers on four-
wheel-drive pickups, as well as RVs for the gravel highways:
GoNorth Alaska Travel Center, 3500 Davis Rd. (% 866-236-7272
or 907-479-7272; www.gonorthalaska.com). The business is also a
source for renting outdoor equipment.
Finding the best deal
Car-rental rates vary widely and you can save a lot of money if you keep
some of the following details in mind when you book:
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. Check if the rate
is the same for pickup Friday morning as it is Thursday night. Also,
weekly rates usually amount to the daily rate for five days, so it
may not cost more to keep the car for a sixth or seventh day.
 In Alaska, you generally pay prohibitively high drop-off charges 
if you don’t return the car to the rental location where you picked 
it up.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
76
Checking road conditions
The Alaska Department of Transportation’s Web site, which you can search using
detailed maps, posts current information on driving conditions, accidents, and road clo-
sures around Alaska. You can also get much of this data over the phone on a hot line. In
winter, checking highway conditions before heading out of town is an important safety
measure. In summer, checking the road conditions helps you avoid drastic construction
delays. Check out 511.Alaska.gov (http://511.alaska.gov) or call % 511. For
conditions on the Alaska Highway in Canada, check with the Yukon Department of
Highways at www.511yukon.ca or % 867-456-7623 (% 511 within Yukon).

 Picking up your car is usually cheaper in town than at the airport,
because airports charge concession fees, but the actual savings
depends on the cost of getting to the car. In Anchorage, for exam-
ple, the airport charges 10 percent plus a $4-per-day fee, which
together could easily add $50 to a weekly rental (that’s in addition
to 22 percent in state and local taxes). If your hotel courtesy van
takes you near a downtown rental site, you can save the airport
fees; if you have to take a cab both ways, you don’t save much.
 A car-rental quote that doesn’t include taxes and fees doesn’t mean
much. Alaska has a 10 percent state rental-car tax, Anchorage
charges a 12 percent tax, and the Anchorage Airport has both a 
10 percent airport concession fee and $4-per-day fee; all this could
add up to more than 40 percent of the base rental cost.
 Many car-rental companies add on a fee for drivers under 25; some
don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price, ask for that specific rate. Don’t
forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP, and trade unions,
which often entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30
percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your most-used
airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons, but also most car
rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. Major
booking sites, such as Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), have
search engines that dig up discounted car-rental rates. After finding
the companies with the best rates, go to their own sites and find
out whether they have additional discounts or incentives available
only to direct customers.
Knowing what to initial on the rental contract
In addition to the standard rental prices, taxes, and airport fees, optional
charges apply to most car rentals. If you’re not careful, you can lose all
the savings you gained by shopping around if you impulsively initial the
rental contract for one of these extras. Here are some key items:
 The car-rental contract generally makes you responsible for damage
to the car and the company’s associated costs in case of an acci-
dent, which may go well beyond the car’s replacement cost. The
car-rental companies let you out of that obligation, however, if you
buy the Collision Damage Waiver when you rent the car. The
waiver is essentially insurance, but it’s often unreasonably priced
for as much as $20 a day. To get an idea how bad a deal that is, imag-
ine paying $7,000 a year for collision insurance on your own car.
Your own car insurance or your credit card probably covers you for
most of this risk. Check before you leave home.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Alaska 77

 The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if
you harm others in an accident), personal-accident insurance (if
you harm yourself or your passengers), and personal-effects insur-
ance (if someone steals your luggage from your car). Your insur-
ance policy on your car at home probably covers most of these
unlikely occurrences. However, if your own insurance doesn’t cover
you for rentals or if you don’t have auto insurance, the rental com-
pany’s liability coverage is a wise choice.
 How should you bet on the refueling gamble? Some companies try
to sell you an initial full tank of gas with the agreement that you
don’t have to return it full. Then you spend the trip trying to run
the car on empty to avoid giving gas back to the rental company,
for which you get no credit. The better option is to buy the gas
yourself and fill up the car before you return it, so you pay for only
the gas you use. But if you’re running late and don’t fill up, the
rental company zings you with astronomical refueling charges. If
you often run late and a refueling stop may make you miss your
plane, go ahead and buy the agency’s gas; otherwise, buy your
own. Check out the location of a gas station when you leave the air-
port at the start of your trip so you can refuel quickly before you
drop off your car.
Renting an RV
A recreational vehicle (RV) has obvious advantages in Alaska. It’s warmer
and more predictable than tent camping, yet more spontaneous and out-
doorsy than staying in hotels. There are negatives, too; the vehicles are
difficult to drive, you’ll have to deal with the sewage, and it’s not cheap:
Expect to pay at least $1,500 a week with limited mileage, plus high fuel
costs, campground fees, food, and so on. When I tried this mode of travel,
I didn’t anticipate how the size of the vehicle would tie us down — after
we parked, we didn’t want to move it. Rent the smallest vehicle you can
fit into.
Many RV parks are not very attractive: They look like parking lots. You
can use more-rustic public campgrounds, then go to a commercial RV
park every third day to wash up and drain your tanks. A map that lists
all the public campgrounds is available from the Alaska Public Lands
Information Centers (see the Quick Concierge) for a nominal cost. Or get
Traveler’s Guide to Alaskan Camping, by Mike and Terri Church (Rolling
Homes Press), which contains detailed reviews of virtually every public
and commercial campground in the state.
Several RV rental agencies operate in Alaska. One reputable company
that offers many one-way choices (with significant drop-off fees) is
Alaska Motorhome Rentals (% 800-323-5757; www.bestofalaska
travel.com). It also has packages, under the name Alaska Highway
Cruises (see Chapter 6). You can find a company offering RVs you can
drive on Alaska’s unpaved rural highways in the “Renting a car” section,
earlier in this chapter.

Driving safely in Alaska
Driving in Alaska is definitely different from driving in other states. You
don’t have to worry about carjacking or purse snatching, but you do
need to be prepared for immense distances between services and even,
in winter, survival in extreme conditions.
Here are a few tips for summer driving on paved highways:
 Keep your headlights on all the time for safety on these two-lane
highways.
 The law requires that you pull over at the next pullout whenever
five or more cars are trailing you on a two-lane highway, regardless
of how fast you’re going. You’ll usually find these roadside parking
areas, most of which are simply widened road shoulders, spaced
every few miles. Pulling over saves the lives of people who other-
wise will try to pass.
 Driving fast on an empty highway is tempting, but remember that
these roads sometimes have violent dips and humps called frost
heaves. Hitting a frost heave at high speed isn’t fun and can be dan-
gerous. Also, wildlife, such as moose, caribou, or bears, sometimes
wanders onto the road.
 Bring along sweaters and jackets, a picnic or some snacks, water 
or other beverages, CDs and tapes for the stereo, and mosquito
repellent.
 Check your jack and spare tire before you leave.
 Bring a cellphone if you have one; you’ll find coverage available in
most of the state’s populated regions.
 You can usually use a credit card wherever you go, but bring along
at least $100 in cash just in case.
 Don’t let your gas tank get low, because it may be a couple of hours
between gas stations — even on the paved highways. Likewise,
take advantage of your opportunities to use a toilet.
Not all Alaska roads are paved. Here are few tips for summer driving on
gravel highways:
 If the vehicle is rented, verify you can drive it off pavement without
violating the rental contract. A couple of companies that do allow
this are mentioned in the “Renting a car” section, earlier in this
chapter.
 When passing a vehicle going the other way, slow down and pull as
far as possible to the side of the road to avoid losing your wind-
shield to a flying rock. Always think about the path of rocks that
you’re kicking up toward other vehicles.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Alaska 79

 Make sure that you have a good, full-size spare tire and jack.
 Bring along a first-aid kit, emergency food, a towrope, and jumper
cables, and keep your gas tank full. On some rural roads, it’s a tank
of gas between gas stations.
In winter, Alaska’s roads are dark most of the time and always icy. Moose
stand on or run into the road in the dark, causing potentially fatal acci-
dents for the people in the car as well as the moose. Long periods can
pass between each car, long enough for frostbite in extreme cold if you
have a breakdown and don’t plan ahead. For many people, flying makes
more sense than driving for long trips, but if you choose to drive rural
Alaska highways in winter, take precautions:
 Be prepared for cold-weather emergencies far from help. Take all
the items previously listed for summer driving on gravel roads,
plus a flashlight, matches and materials to light a fire, chains, a
shovel, and an ice scraper. A camp stove to make hot beverages is
also a good idea.
 If you’re driving a remote highway (such as the Alaska Highway)
between December and March, take along gear adequate to keep
you safe from the cold in case you have to wait overnight with a
dead car at –40°F. (See the list of heavy winter gear in Chapter 12,
and add warm sleeping bags.)
 Never drive a road marked CLOSED or UNMAINTAINED IN WINTER.
 Studded tires are a necessity; non-studded snow tires or so-called
“all-weather” tires aren’t adequate.
 Never leave your car’s engine stopped for more than four hours in
temperatures of –10°F (–23°C) or colder. Alaskans generally have
electrical head-bolt heaters installed to keep the engine warm
overnight. You can find electrical outlets everywhere you might
park in cold, Interior Alaska areas.

 Finding the best cruise bargains

A
s you may expect from a state that offers a number of varied
options for getting into and out of its communities, cruising in
Alaska is big business. This chapter offers the details you need to help
you decide whether cruising is the option for you to take to arrive in
Alaska. You’ll also find information to help you choose which type of
cruise is best for you and to let you know what you can expect to pay for
traveling to Alaska via cruise ship.
Waterway transportation is so critical to Alaskans that the state has its
own ferry system, the Alaska Marine Highway System, which you can
use to travel to and around Alaska. However, to make this option work,
you must be willing to invest a considerable amount of time — for actual
travel and for planning — and be willing to give up the comforts and
diversions that a cruise ship offers. The Alaska State ferry system is cov-
ered in more detail in Chapter 7. This chapter is devoted to the cruise
ship, focusing primarily on those cruise options that give a real in-depth
experience. (If you want more information about cruising in Alaska, pick
up a copy of Frommer’s Alaska Cruises & Ports of Call, Wiley Publishing.)
Contemplating Your Cruise Options
More than three quarters of a million people cruise Alaska’s Southeast
coast every year, attracted by the prospects of seeing towering glaciers,
charming small towns, and all manner of wildlife. The sheer ease of
cruise travel is one reason for its popularity. You take in the scenery
from your boat, disembarking to visit ports of call or to engage in sports
activities. The dearth of roads between towns in the Southeast makes
the waters of the Inside Passage the region’s de facto highway.

The three main questions to ask yourself when choosing a cruise to
Alaska are “When should I go?”, “Where do I want to go?”, and “How big
a ship should I travel on?” This section helps answer those questions
and provides some tips and tricks for matching a cruise line to your par-
ticular (or peculiar) interests.
Deciding when to go
Alaska is a seasonal, as opposed to year-round, cruise destination; the
season generally runs from May through September, although some
smaller ships start up in April. May and September are considered the
shoulder seasons, and lower brochure rates and more aggressive dis-
counts are offered during these months.
Cruising in May is extremely pleasant; crowds have yet to arrive, and
locals are friendlier than they are later in the season. May also is one of
the driest months in the season. Late September, on the other hand,
offers the advantage of fewer fellow cruise passengers clogging the ports.
The warmest months are June, July, and August, with temperatures gen-
erally around 50°F to 80°F (10°C–27°C) during the day and cooler at
night. In the past couple of years, the temperature soared even higher.
You may not need a parka, but you will need to bring along some outer-
wear and rain gear. June 21 is the longest day of the year, with the sky lit
almost all night. June tends to be drier than July and August. April and
May are drier than September, although in early April you may
encounter freezing rain and other vestiges of winter.
If you’re considering traveling in a shoulder month, keep in mind that
some shops don’t open until Memorial Day, and the visitor season is
generally considered over on Labor Day (although cruise lines operate
well into Sept).
Knowing where to go
Many Alaskan cruises, particularly of the small-ship variety, combine
transportation with activities after you arrive. Here’s the lowdown on
your primary options:
 Inside Passage cruises: One of two basic weeklong itineraries
offered by the major cruise lines, Inside Passage cruises generally
sail round-trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, visiting three or
four port towns (typically Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, and either
Sitka, Haines, or Victoria, British Columbia) along the Inside
Passage, spending a day in Glacier Bay or one of the other glacier
areas, and spending two days at sea (meaning they just cruise
along, enabling you to relax and enjoy the scenery).
 Gulf of Alaska cruises: The second-most-popular cruise choice is a
Gulf of Alaska cruise, which generally sails northbound and south-
bound between Vancouver and Seward (the port for Anchorage) in
alternating weeks. These cruises visit many of the same towns and
attractions that the Inside Passage cruises hit, but because they
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
82

don’t have to turn around and sail back to Vancouver, they tack on
visits to Hubbard Glacier, College Fjord, or other gulf towns and
natural attractions.
 Small-ship cruises: Although most of the major cruise operators
stick pretty closely to these two basic routes, the small-ship cruise
lines tend to offer more small-port and wilderness-oriented itiner-
aries, some sailing round-trip between Juneau and Ketchikan, and
one even sailing between Juneau and Glacier Bay. Although many of
these ships visit major ports of call, they also may include visits to
small ports that aren’t accessible to the bigger ships — towns such
as Petersberg, Wrangell, Gustavus, Elfin Cove, and possibly the
Native village of Metlakatla. Some ships offer itineraries that enable
passengers to explore waterways by kayak or hike inland trails.
 Cruise tours: Combining a cruise with a land tour, either before or
after the cruise, typical cruise-tour packages link a cruise with a
three- to five-day Anchorage to Denali to Fairbanks tour, a seven-
day Yukon tour (which visits Anchorage, Denali, and Fairbanks on
the way), or a five- to seven-day tour of the Canadian Rockies.
Holland America, Princess, and Cruise West are the three leaders in
the cruise-tour market (Cruise West is a distant third). Even when
you book with another cruise line, chances are your land tour will
be through one of these operators.
Choosing between a big and small ship
Imagine an elephant. Now imagine your pet beagle, Sparky. That’s the
kind of size difference you can expect between your options in the
Alaska cruise market: behemoth modern ships and small, more
exploratory coastal vessels.
But your choice is more than just deciding between a bunch of or a little
extra room for stowing your bags, although, truth be told, cabin size is
pretty minimal in most cases, even on the largest ships. Your interest in
the variety of activities and amenities also needs to play a role in your
choice of which cruise ship to sail.
Cruising on bigger ships
The big ships in the Alaska market generally fall into two categories:
midsize ships and megaships.
Carrying as many as 2,670 passengers, the megaships look and feel like
floating resorts. Big on glitz, they offer loads of activities, attract many
families and (especially in Alaska) seniors, offer many public rooms
(including fancy casinos and fully equipped gyms), and provide a wide
variety of meal and entertainment options. And although they may fea-
ture one or two formal nights per trip, the ambience is generally casual.
The Alaska vessels of the Carnival, Celebrity, Princess, and Royal
Caribbean fleets all fit this category, and so do Norwegian Cruise Line’s
Norwegian Pearl and Norwegian Sun.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 83

Midsize ships in Alaska fall into two categories: the ultra-luxurious ships
of the Crystal and Regent Seven Seas fleets; and ships featuring a more
modern décor and atmosphere, such as the Veendam, Ryndam, Volendam,
Amsterdam, Maasdam, Zaandam, and Statendam of Holland America Line.
In general, the sizes of these bigger ships are less significant than the
general onboard atmosphere created by the companies that run them;
therein lay the advantages of big-ship cruising:
 You have lots of opportunities to meet and greet (and meet and
greet). With the many and varied meal and entertainment options,
combined with the diversity of activities, you’re bound to meet a
passenger or ten who share your interests.

Cruise ships in Alaska: Angel or devil?
The 49th state is one of the top cruise destinations in the world, with about 750,000
people cruising there annually. That may not sound like much in the abstract — after all,
Alaska’s a huge state, right? — but two facts make it actually a pretty big figure:
 Even though Alaska has more coastline than the rest of the United States combined,
cruise ships sail in only about 20 percent of that area (and really concentrate on
about half that).
 The cruise season is incredibly short, only lasting from late May to mid-September.
This leads to crowding in the biggest ports of call, and also to some backlash, with local
critics decrying excessive pedestrian traffic on their city streets, heavy bus traffic on
outlying roads, and environmental damage to the air and seas.
Some towns, particularly Juneau, Ketchikan, and Skagway, really can get overwhelmed
by cruise passengers at the height of high season, with a potential for more than 6,000
people floating in daily. The delicate balancing act between the resulting congestion
and the plain fact that tourism provides the state’s second-largest pool of jobs has led
to debate in recent years over imposing head taxes on cruise passengers, with the pro-
ceeds going to infrastructure support, conservation efforts, and other initiatives. The
latest effort, which would have slapped a $46 tax on every passenger sailing state
waters, was defeated in the Alaska legislature in May 2005, but don’t expect debate to
end.
On the environmental front, several well-publicized cases of illegal dumping over the
past decade have led the cruise industry to institute in-house and industry-wide com-
pliance and monitoring — after all, they can’t sell cruises to pristine Alaska if they’re
perceived as making it less pristine. State and local governments also have a hand in
minimizing cruise ships’ impact in some of Alaska’s most famous wild places. Glacier
Bay, for example, has a strict permit system that allows in only two large cruise ships
and several smaller vessels on any given day.

 The cruise ship is your oyster. Midsize ships and megaships offer a
great range of facilities for passengers. You won’t lack things to do
and places to go on these ships.
 Big ships have room for every need, with or without a view.
Cabins on these ships range from cubbyholes to large suites,
depending on the ship and the type of cabin you book.
 You will eat well. Big dining rooms and a tremendous variety of
cuisines will be the norm.
The sizes of these big ships also come with four major drawbacks for
passengers:
 You have lots of opportunities to meet and greet (and meet and
greet). These bigger ships carry many people and, as such, can at
times feel crowded.
 Size limits access. The big ships just can’t sail into narrow pas-
sages or shallow-water ports, limiting your in-port and sailing
options.
 Size limits opportunity. The size and inflexible schedules of bigger
ships limit their ability to stop or even slow down when wildlife is
spotted.
 Alaska becomes lost in the crowd. When passengers on a big ship
disembark in a town, they tend to overwhelm that town, thus limit-
ing your ability to see the real Alaska. (For more info on the rela-
tionship between Alaska and the cruise industry, see the “Where
there are ships, there are crowds” sidebar.)
Cruising on smaller ships
In the same way that big cruise ships are mostly for people who want
every resort amenity, small or alternative ships are best suited for
people who prefer a casual, crowd-free cruise experience that offers pas-
sengers a chance to get up close and personal with Alaska’s natural sur-
roundings and wildlife.
Smaller ships have a number of advantages of what can be considered
very important benefits on the plus side of the ledger:
 The sea becomes larger. Small ships can sail almost anywhere
(including far into Misty Fjords, an area that no large ship can 
penetrate).
 You can take more time to smell the roses — or whatever may be
swimming your way. Small ships tend to have more flexibility in
their schedules than the large ships, and usually take time to linger
whenever whales or other wildlife are sighted nearby.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 85

 Everything looks bigger. Smaller watercraft don’t scare off wildlife
as easily as the big ships, and the fact that you’re at or near the
waterline (as opposed to ten stories up on the large ships) means
you get a more close-up view.
 Land-based activities truly are land-based. Many smaller cruise
companies compensate for a lack of onboard activities by offering
more active off-ship opportunities, such as hiking or kayaking.
 You can discover Alaska’s depth. The alternative ships are also
more likely to feature expert lectures on Alaska-specific topics,
such as marine biology, history, and Native culture.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
86
Where there are ships, there are crowds
Now for the bad news: All those cruise ships aren’t necessarily good for Alaska and its
residents. Alaskans, who are known for their hospitality, all have their limits. Imagine
living in a coastal settlement and having the equivalent of an entire town full of new
people arriving all at once — doubling the population, and then some. These one-day
visitors crowd your streets and hiking trails, and their ships spew pollution into the air
and water. Imagine this deluge happening every day, all summer. Suppose also that
tacky souvenir stands and seasonal gift shops have driven out the old community busi-
nesses on the waterfront.
For years, the cruise-ship industry exploited the hospitality of Southeast Alaska as if it
were an inexhaustible resource. Local residents took a stand, however, when two lines,
Royal Caribbean and Holland America, were convicted of felonies for dumping pollu-
tion such as dry-cleaning fluid, photo chemicals, and used oil in the pristine waters of
the Inside Passage, and then lying about it. A series of environmental scandals followed,
leading to new state laws and a commitment by the cruise industry to clean up its act.
Alaska now has the toughest cruise-ship legislation of any state.
Protecting the environment is easier, however, than restoring the experience of living in
or visiting a small town. The presence of too many cruise-ship passengers has spoiled
some of these quaint places. Once-charming streets are transformed into carnival mid-
ways jammed wall-to-wall with people from ships landing simultaneously. Some com-
munities think the income generated by these “floating cities” isn’t worth what they
must sacrifice in their quality of life and, thus, they place limits on the number of ships
that can dock or they levy new taxes based on the number of people each ship carries.
After years of fast growth, the industry also began talking of a carrying capacity (that
is, determining just how much tourism is too much). And yet still more ships come, bring-
ing ever more visitors. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, aggravated the sit-
uation further, because cruise lines withdrew ships from certain foreign routes and
brought them to Alaska. Although the increase in capacity produced some extraordi-
nary bargains for cruise passengers, whether that continues is anyone’s guess.

But, as with everything in life, small ships also have their drawbacks:
 Small ships are, well, small. Small ships usually have small cabins,
only one lounge-bar and dining room, and no exercise facilities.
They just don’t have room for all the amenities.
 Don’t expect a smooth ride. Most of these smaller ships have no
stabilizers, so the ride can be bumpy in open water — which isn’t
much of a problem on Inside Passage itineraries, because most of
the areas in which small ships cruise are protected from sea waves.
 Accessibility is not always a given. Smaller ships are also difficult
for travelers with disabilities. The three exceptions are Spirit of ’98,
Spirit of Oceanus, and Clipper Odyssey — all of which are equipped
with elevators.
 Face it — you’ll pay more. Despite all the disadvantages — at least
from an amenity and activity standpoint — smaller ships are uni-
versally more expensive than their bigger counterparts, and the
small-ship cruise lines offer fewer discounts.
Visitors aboard large ships may physically be in Alaska, but unless
they’re reminded of it, they may never know it — such is the disjunction
between the glitzy modern ships and the real world outside. The experi-
ences of visitors aboard small ships, however, are many times more inti-
mate, which enables them to get in touch with the places they’ve come
to see. For these reasons, our advice to anyone who wants to experience
Alaska (rather than receive just a mere postcard impression of it) is to
spend the extra money for a small-ship cruise. As is true of any product,
you get what you pay for, and by paying extra in the short term for a
more intimate cruise, you’re almost always guaranteed of having an
Alaskan experience that you can fondly recall for the rest of your life.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 87
Weighing the dining options 
on various cruises
Smaller ships usually serve dinner at a certain time, with open seating, allowing you to
sit at any table you want. Large ships may offer only two fairly rigid set-seating times,
especially for dinner. This means that your table will be pre-assigned and remain the
same for the duration of the cruise. However, increasingly, there are some exceptions
to the rule in the large-ship category. The ships of Norwegian Cruise Line and Regent
Seven Seas now serve all meals with open seating — dine when you want and sit with
whom you want (within the restaurants’ open hours). Princess has its own innovative
version of this system, allowing guests to choose between traditional early or late seat-
ing, or open restaurant-style seating, before the cruise. Most large ships today also offer
multiple alternative-dining options, featuring casual buffets and specialty restaurants,
some with an additional charge (as a gratuity) of up to $30.

Finding the best cruise-ship experience for you
Cruise lines are in the business of providing a good time for their guests,
so they all have something going for them. This section provides a brief
rundown of some of Alaska’s best cruise ships, in a few different cate-
gories (with more details near the end of this chapter under the individ-
ual cruise listings).
Defining luxury
So, you think any type of cruise ship offers a certain measure of luxury?
Well, although you’re probably correct, these lines really know how to
serve up the extravagance:
 Luxury in Alaska is now defined by Regent Seven Seas, which
offers a casual kind of luxury (a really nice ship with a no-tie-
required policy). Regent’s Seven Seas Mariner offers just that, with
plush all-suite cabins (most with private balconies) and excellent
cuisine.
 For the ultimate Alaska experience in a small-ship setting, check
out the yachts of American Safari Cruises, where soft adventure
comes with luxury accouterments.
Being pampered in style
The following ships offer the crème de la crème of indulgences:
 Celebrity’s Infinity and Summit offer wonderful AquaSpas com-
plete with thalassotherapy pools and a wealth of soothing and
beautifying treatments.
 The solariums on Royal Caribbean’s Vision of the Seas, Serenade
of the Seas, and Radiance of the Seas offer relaxing indoor-pool
retreats.
 Regent Seven Seas pampers you all-around.
Finding the best meal
Regent Seven Seas is tops among the luxury lines. Of the mainstream
lines, Celebrity is the best, with its cuisine overseen by renowned
French chef Michel Roux. Dinner in the reservations-only specialty
restaurants on both the Infinity and the Summit ($30 service charge
per person) is a world-class dining experience. And there are signs of a
new and rather surprising challenger for the cuisine award: Carnival,
which has upgraded both its main dining room and buffet offerings. The
line’s Carnival Spirit boasts the Nouveau Supper Club ($30 service
charge per person), where you can enjoy just about as fine a meal as
you’re likely to find anywhere.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
88

Bringing the family along
All the major lines have well-established kids’ programs. However,
Holland America and Norwegian Cruise Line win points in Alaska for
their special shore excursions for youngsters and teens, and Carnival
gets a nod for offering shore excursions for teens as well.
Participating in the best onboard activities
The ships operated by Carnival and Royal Caribbean offer full rosters
of onboard activities, ranging from the sublime (such as lectures) to the
ridiculous (such as contests designed to get passengers to do or say
crazy things). Princess’s ScholarShip@Sea program is a real winner, with
exciting packaged classes in such diverse subjects as photography, per-
sonal computers, cooking, and even pottery.
The best of the mainstream lines
If you’re looking for beauty in a boat, Celebrity’s Infinity is a true stun-
ner, as is its sister ship Summit. These modern vessels, with their exten-
sive art collections, cushy public rooms, and expanded spa areas, give
Celebrity a formidable presence in Alaska.
Setting the bar for the small-ship market
Clipper Cruise Line’s newest vessel, the Clipper Odyssey, is a really
stunning little ship, offering a higher level of comfort than most of the
other small ships in this category. Plus, it sails some of Alaska’s most
exotic itineraries.
Experiencing whale-watching at its best
When they come close enough, you can see whales from all the ships in
Alaska. Smaller ships, however — such as those operated by Clipper
and Cruise West — might actually change course and follow a whale.
Get your cameras ready!
Booking the best cruise tours
Princess and Holland America are the entrenched market leaders in get-
ting you into the Interior either before or after your cruise. Some of the
other lines actually buy their cruise-tour products from them.
The strength of Holland America’s cruise tour is its three- and four-night
cruises combined with an Alaska/Yukon land package. Princess arguably
is stronger in seven-day Gulf of Alaska cruises in conjunction with
Denali/Fairbanks or Kenai Peninsula land arrangements.
Stopping at the best ports
Juneau and Skagway are perennial favorites, but Haines also is a winner:
 Juneau is one of the most visually pleasing small cities anywhere
and certainly the prettiest capital city in America.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 89

 As for Skagway, no town in Alaska is more historically significant,
and the old buildings are so perfect you may think you stepped into
a Disney version of what a gold-rush town should look like.
 For a more low-key Alaska experience, take the ferry from Skagway
to Haines, which reminds us of the folksy, frontier Alaska depicted
on the TV show Northern Exposure. It’s also a great place to spot
eagles and other wildlife. Some ships also stop at Haines as a port
of call.
Discovering the best shore excursions
Most cruise lines offer some great shore-excursion options to include
with your trip. Here are a few of the most recommended activities to ask
about when booking your cruise:
 Flightseeing and helicopter trips in Alaska are unforgettable ways to
check out the scenery if you can afford them. (They’re pretty pricey.)
A helicopter trip to a dog-sled camp at the top of a glacier (usually
the priciest of the offerings) affords both incredibly pretty views and
a chance to try your hand at the truly Alaskan sport of dog-sledding
(earning you bragging rights with the folks back home).
 For a less extravagant excursion, nothing beats a ride (on a clear
day) on the White Pass & Yukon Route railway out of Skagway to
the Canadian border at Fraser — the route followed by the gold
stampeders of ’98.
 Active excursions, such as kayaking and mountain-biking, afford
not only an opportunity to work off those shipboard calories, but
also optimum opportunities for spotting eagles, bears, seals, and
other wildlife.
Booking Your Cruise
Almost every cruise line publishes brochure prices that are the travel
equivalent of a new car’s sticker price: wildly inflated, hoping that some-
one, somewhere, might take them at face value. In reality, you may be
able to get the cruise for 40 percent or 50 percent off at the last minute.
But here’s the problem with waiting: Alaska right now is hot, hot, hot.
Sure, you may be able to save by taking your chances, but if you don’t
reserve space early, you may also be left out in the cold. (Cold in Alaska,
get it?)
So how do you book your cruise? Traditionally (meaning over the past
30 years or so), people have booked their cruises through travel agents.
But you may be wondering, hasn’t the traditional travel agent gone the
way of typewriters and eight-track tapes and been replaced by the
Internet? Not exactly. Travel agents are alive and kicking, though the
Internet has indeed staked its claim alongside them and knocked some
of them out of business. In an effort to keep pace, most traditional travel
agencies have created their own Web sites.

So which is the better way to book a cruise these days? Good question.
The answer can be both. If you’re computer savvy, have a good handle
on all the elements that go into a cruise, and have narrowed down the
choices to a few cruise lines that appeal to you, Web sites are a great
way to trawl the seas at your own pace and check out last-minute deals,
which can be dramatic. On the other hand, you’ll barely get a stitch of
personalized service searching for and booking a cruise online. If you
need help getting a refund or arranging special meals or other matters,
or deciding which cabin to choose, you’re on your own.
In this section, you’ll find details for booking cruises on large and small
ships. So, regardless of whether you’re a veteran cruiser or a first-timer,
the details and money-saving tips here can help you book an enjoyable
and affordable cruise.
Reserving a small-ship cruise
The small-ship companies in Alaska — American Safari Cruises, Clipper,
Cruise West, and Lindblad Expeditions — all offer real niche-oriented
cruise experiences, attracting passengers who have a very good idea of
the kind of experience they want (usually educational or adventurous,
and always casual and small scale). In many cases, a large percentage of
passengers on any given cruise will have sailed with the line before.
Because of all this, and because the passenger capacity of these small
ships is so low (12–235), in general you don’t find the kind of deep dis-
counts that you do with the large ships.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 91
Shopping for shore tours
Most cruise-ship passengers sign up for onshore activities and excursions when they
arrive onboard. It’s easy and convenient, and you can be sure that the outing will be
timed to your port of call.
On the downside, these excursions tend to be the most superficial and highest-priced
choices in town and almost always involve large groups. For outdoor activities, troop-
ing down a trail or paddling a sea-kayak in a big mob can spoil the experience. You do
have an alternative, however.
A large part of the high shipboard price for shore tours is the cut that’s taken by the
cruise line. You can get a much better deal (as much as half off) by arranging your own
activities in advance. Most guides are happy to tailor an outing to your limited time, and
you’ll probably encounter a far more intimate experience in the bargain. It only takes a
little advance prep work: Study your ports of call, the activities and operators in those
locations (for which this book is an invaluable guide), and the amount of time you’ll be
ashore, and then make your reservations before you leave, putting down the appropri-
ate deposits and getting directions for making transfers.

Nevertheless, for the most part, these lines rely on agents to handle
their bookings, taking very few reservations directly. (Clipper is the
exception to this rule, taking most of its Alaska bookings directly rather
than through agents.) All the lines have lists of agents with whom they
do considerable business, and they can hook you up with one of them if
you call (or e-mail) the cruise line and ask for an agent near you.
Finding an agent who specializes 
in mainstream cruises
There are several full-service and cruise-only agencies that have solid
reputations in selling mainstream cruise bookings such as with Carnival,
Celebrity, Holland America, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess, and Royal
Caribbean, and they operate a combination of walk-in and toll-free 
telephone-based business.
If you don’t know a good travel agent already, try to find one through
your friends, preferably those who have cruised before. For the most
personal service, look for an agent in your local area, and for the most
knowledgeable service, look for an agent who has cruising experience.
Asking an agent questions about his personal knowledge of the product,
such as whether he has ever cruised in Alaska or with one of the lines
you’re considering, is perfectly okay. The easiest way to be sure that
the agent is experienced in booking cruises is to work with an agent at 
a cruise-only agency (that’s all they book) or to find an agent who is a
cruise specialist. If you’re calling a full-service travel agency, ask for
the cruise desk, which is where you’ll find these specialists.
A good and easy rule of thumb to maximize your chances of finding an
agent who has cruise experience and who won’t rip you off is to book
with agencies that are members of the Cruise Lines International
Association (CLIA; % 212-921-0066; www.cruising.org) or the
National Association of Cruise Oriented Agencies (NACOA; % 305-
663-5626; www.nacoaonline.com). Members of both groups are cruise
specialists. Membership in the American Society of Travel Agents
(ASTA; % 800-275-2782; www.astanet.com) ensures that the agency is
monitored for ethical practices, although it does not designate cruise
experience.
You can tap into the Web sites of these organizations to find reliable
agents in your area.
Figuring out what’s included in the cost
No matter how you arrange to buy your cruise vacation, what you basi-
cally have in hand at the end is a contract for transportation, lodging,
dining, entertainment, housekeeping, and assorted other miscellaneous
services that are provided for you during the course of your vacation.
Remembering what extras are not included in your cruise fare, however,
is just as important.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
92

Aside from airfare, which usually isn’t included in your cruise fare (see
“Booking air travel through the cruise line,” later in this chapter), the
most pricey additions to your cruise fare are likely to be shore excur-
sions. Ranging from about $30 for a bus tour to $299 and up for a heli-
copter or seaplane flightseeing excursion, these sightseeing tours are
designed to help cruise passengers make the most of their time at the
ports the ship visits, but they do add a hefty sum to your vacation costs.
Another item you’ll want to add to your calculations is the amount of tips
you need to add for the ship’s crew. One exception in Alaska recently is
Regent Seven Seas, the only line in the market to include tips in the
cruise fare. Tips are given at the end of the cruise. Count on tipping at
least $10 per passenger in your party, per day. That figure takes care of
the room steward, waiter, and busperson (in practice, most people tend
to give a little more). Additional tips to other personnel, such as the
headwaiter or maitre d’, are at your discretion. On the small ships, all tips
often go into one pot, which the crew divides up after the cruise.
All but a few ships charge extra for alcoholic beverages (including wine
at dinner) and for soda. Prices are comparable to what you’d pay at a
bar or restaurant ashore. Non-bubbly soft drinks, such as lemonade and
iced tea, are included in your cruise fare.
Port charges, taxes, and other fees are usually included in your cruise
fare but not always, and these charges can add as much as $250 per
person onto the price of a seven-day Alaska cruise. Make sure you know
whether these fees are included in the cruise fare when you’re compar-
ing rates. Read the fine print!
Of course, the same as at a hotel, you also pay extra for such items as
ship-to-shore phone calls or faxes, e-mails, spa treatments, and so on.
Keeping in mind some money-saving strategies
Cruise pricing, like airfares, is a fluid medium, and you can employ a
number of strategies to save money off the booking price.
Booking early
The best way to save on an Alaska cruise is to book in advance. In a typ-
ical year, lines offer early-bird rates, usually 25 percent or more off the
brochure rate, to those who book their Alaska cruise by mid-February of
the year of the cruise. If the cabins don’t fill up by the cutoff date, the
early-bird rate may be extended, but it may be lowered slightly — say, a
15 percent or 20 percent savings.
In the past couple of years, the lines have been getting even more
aggressive with early-booking discounts, hoping to encourage passen-
gers to make their Alaska cruise plans months in advance. (Cruise-line
executives like their ships filled up as early as possible.) If the cabins 
are still not full as the cruise season begins, cruise lines typically start
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 93

marketing special deals, usually through their top-producing travel
agents. These last-minute discounts can run as high as 50 percent. And
keep in mind that last-minute deals are usually for a very limited selec-
tion of cabins. Planning your Alaska cruise vacation well in advance and
taking advantage of early-booking discounts is still the best way to go.
Traveling the shoulder season
Think of the Alaska cruise season as three distinct periods: peak season
(late June, July, and early to mid-Aug), value/standard season (early
June and late Aug), and budget or economy Season (May and Sept). 
You can save by booking a cruise during this last period, during the
shoulder months of May or September. That’s when cruise pricing is
lower. Although the weather may be a little chillier — and September is
known for rain — fewer people visit during these months, thus enabling
your experience of Alaska to be a bit more pristine, especially when
you’re sailing on a small ship. A friend who recently took an early-May
sail reported that he felt like he had the state all to himself.
Sharing a cabin or booking as a group
Most ships offer highly discounted rates for third and fourth passengers
sharing a cabin with two “full-fare” passengers (even if those two have
booked at a discounted rate). Although doing so may mean a tight
squeeze, it nevertheless saves you a bundle. Some lines also offer spe-
cial rates for kids, usually on a seasonal or select-sailing basis, that may
include free or discounted airfare. Those younger than age 2 generally
cruise free.
One of the best ways to get a cruise deal is booking as a group of at least
16 people in at least eight cabins. The savings include a discounted rate,
and at least the cruise portion of the 16th ticket will be free. A “group” in
this case can be a real group of friends, relatives, and so on, or simply a
block of passengers booked by a travel agency on the same cruise. You
don’t even have to pretend to know the other people — the savings are
the same. Ask about any group deals your travel agent may offer.
Using age to your advantage
Seniors may be able to get extra savings on their cruise. Some lines take
5 percent off the top for those 55 and over, and the senior rate applies
even if the second person in the cabin is younger. Membership in groups
such as AARP is not required, but such membership may bring addi-
tional savings.
Booking air travel through the cruise line
Except during special promotions, airfare to the port of embarkation
rarely is included in cruise rates, so you have to purchase airfare on
your own or buy it as a package with your cruise through your travel
agent or online cruise site. You can usually find information about these
air-sea programs in the back of cruise-line brochures, along with prices.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
94

The benefits of booking through the cruise line are that round-trip trans-
fers are included, and the cruise line knows your airline schedule, so
that in the event of delayed flights and other unavoidable snafus, it can
do more to make sure that you and other people on your flight board 
the ship. When you book your air transportation separately, you’re on
your own.
On the downside, air add-ons may not be the best deals and booking
your own airfare may be cheaper. Furthermore, you probably won’t be
able to use any frequent-flier miles that you’ve accumulated.
Choosing your cabin
Cruise-ship cabins range in size from tiny boxes with accordion doors
and bunk beds to palatial multi-room suites with hot tubs on the bal-
cony. Cabins are either inside (without a window or porthole) or outside
(which do have a view), the latter being more expensive. On big ships,
the more deluxe outside cabins may also come with private verandas.
Cabins are usually described by price (highest to lowest), category
(suite, deluxe, superior, standard, economy, and other types), and furni-
ture configuration (“sitting area with two lower beds,” for example).
Which is right for you?
Price will likely be a big factor here, but so should the vacation style 
you prefer. If, for instance, you plan to spend a lot of quiet time in your
cabin, you should probably consider booking the biggest room you can
afford. If, conversely, you plan to be out on deck all the time checking
out the glaciers and wildlife, you may be just as happy with a smaller
(and cheaper) cabin to crash in at the end of the day.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 95
New cruisers
There is a saying in the industry that nobody should cruise just once. On any voyage, a
ship could encounter bad weather. On any given day at sea, the only seat left in the
show lounge might be behind an unforgiving pillar. Or a technical problem might affect
the enjoyment of the onboard experience. Jerry remembers vividly one occasion on
which the air-conditioning on a ship on which he was traveling — which shall remain
nameless — went out for half a day. It was an uncomfortable time and could have turned
a neophyte off cruising forever. That would have been a mistake.
In travel, there is liable to be an occasional snafu. Your hotel room is not available, even
though you have a valid confirmation number. Your flight is canceled. The luxury car you
thought you rented is not on the lot, and all that’s available is a mini-subcompact. But you
don’t stop flying, you don’t refuse to stay in a hotel ever again, and you don’t stop rent-
ing cars. Nor should one unforeseen problem on a cruise ship cause you to swear off
the product forever. Give it another go. On a different cruise line, if you prefer. If you still
haven’t had the enjoyable experience that millions of others have discovered, then, and
only then, maybe it’s time to abandon hope of becoming a cruise aficionado.

Speaking up about special health and 
dietary concerns
The cruise line should be informed at the time you make your reserva-
tions about any special dietary requirements you have. Some lines offer
kosher menus, and all will have vegetarian, low-fat, low-salt, and sugar-
free options available.
The Small-Ship Cruise Lines
Small ships enable you to see Alaska from sea level, without the kind of
distractions that you encounter aboard the big ships — no glitzy interi-
ors, no big shows or loud music, no casinos, no spas, and no crowds,
because the largest of these ships carries only 382 passengers. You’re
immersed in the 49th state from the minute you wake up to the minute
you fall asleep, and for the most part, you’re left alone to form your own
opinions. These types of cruises usually cost more, but by far, they pro-
vide the better cruise experience for anyone who really wants to get the
feel of Alaska.
Small-ship itineraries can be placed into one of the following categories:
 Port-to-port: These itineraries mimic larger ships by simply sailing
between port towns.
 Soft-adventure: These itineraries provide some outdoor experi-
ences such as hiking and kayaking, but they don’t require partici-
pants to be trained athletes.
 Active-adventure: For the true adventurer, hiking and kayaking are
the focus of the trip, and the experience may be strenuous.
On each of these types of cruises, the small-ship experience tends
toward the educational rather than the glitzy. You’ll likely listen to infor-
mal and informative lectures and sometimes watch video presentations
about Alaska wildlife, history, and Native culture. Meals are served in
open seatings, so you can sit where and with whom you like, and time
spent huddled on the outside decks scanning for whales fosters great
camaraderie among passengers.
Cabins on these ships don’t generally offer TVs or telephones and 
tend to be small and sometimes spartan (see the individual reviews for
exceptions).
American Safari Cruises
Directed toward the slightly jaded high-end traveler, American Safari
Cruises sails luxury soft-adventure cruises aboard three full-fledged luxury
yachts. American Safari Cruises promises an intimate, all-inclusive yacht
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
96

cruise to some of the more out-of-the-way stretches of the Inside Passage —
and it succeeds admirably. The price is considerable — but so is the 
pampering.
The vessels carry between 12 and 36 guests, guaranteeing unparalleled
flexibility, intimacy, and privacy. Once passenger interests become appar-
ent, the expedition leader shapes the cruise around them. Black-bear afi-
cionados can chug off in a Zodiac boat for a better look, active adventurers
can explore the shoreline in one of the yacht’s four kayaks, and slacker
travelers can relax aboard ship.
The line’s newest yacht, the 36-passenger Safari Explorer, entered serv-
ice just in time for the cruise season in 2008 after a ten-month refurbish-
ment costing $3.5 million. The 22-passenger Safari Quest (1992) and the
12-passenger Safari Escape (1993) and Safari Spirit (1991) are the clos-
est things you’ll find to private yachts in the Alaska cruise business.
They’re sleek, they’re stylish, and they’re as far as you can get from the
megaship experience without owning your own boat. Cabins are comfort-
able, and sitting rooms are intimate and luxurious, almost as if they were
transported from a spacious suburban home.
Passengers — almost always couples — tend to be more than comfortably
wealthy and range from about 45 to 65 years of age. Most hope to get close
to nature without sacrificing luxury. Dress is always casual, with comfort
being the prime goal.
A shipboard chef barters with nearby fishing boats for the catch of 
the day, and raids local markets for the freshest fruits and vegetables —
say, strawberries the size of a cub’s paw and potent strains of basil and
cilantro.

Lowest-price outside cabins $4,991 for a 7-night cruise. No inside cabins or suites.
Cruise West
Like all small ships, Cruise West’s eight Alaska vessels can navigate in tight
areas such as Misty Fjords and Desolation Sound, visit tiny ports such as
Petersburg and Haines, and scoot up close to shore for wildlife-watching.
But these are not adventure cruises. These vacations are for people who
want to visit Alaska’s coastal communities and see its wilderness areas up
close and in a relaxed, comfortable, small-scale environment without big-
ship distractions. They’re not for people who want to spend their days
hiking and kayaking — unless they really want to on their own, that is.
Passengers with Cruise West tend to be older (typically 60–75), financially
stable, and well educated, and consider themselves adventuresome. The
operative words here are casual, relaxed, and friendly. At sea, the lack of
organized activities on the line’s port-to-port itineraries leaves you free to
scan for wildlife, peruse the natural sights, or read a book. In port —
whether one of the large popular ports or a less visited one — the line
arranges some novel, intimate shore excursions. All excursions are
included in the price.

98
Watching whales
Whales are a huge draw on Alaska cruises, ranking right up there with calving glaciers
and Alaskan Amber beer. On most large cruise ships, the captain or officer on watch
makes an announcement when he spots a whale, at which point half the people onboard
crane their necks in the same direction.
We’ll be honest with you: Whale-watching takes patience, because frankly, whales
spend a lot of time underwater. What the spotter is seeing is typically the curve of the
whale’s back as he slides through the water, or the flash of his tail as he makes a deep
sounding dive. It can be minutes before the whale comes up again, and you never know
exactly where that may happen.
Humpbacks are definitely the stars of the Alaska whale-watching show, easily recog-
nized by their huge, mottled tails; by the hump on their backs, just forward of their dorsal
fins; and by their arm-like flippers, which can grow to be 14 feet long. These migratory
whales spend all their summers in Alaska, feeding on small fish and other tiny creatures
that they filter through strips of stiff, fibrous baleen — the material that humpbacks have
instead of teeth. Most humpback sightings are of the whales’ humped backs as 
they cruise along the surface, resting, and of the flukes of the tail as they dive. Feeding
dives can last a long time and often mean you won’t see that particular whale again,
but if you’re lucky, the whale may be just dipping down for a few minutes before 
breaching — leaping straight out of the water, twisting around in midair before falling
back with a gigantic kersploosh! No one knows for sure why they do this, though to look
at them it seems obvious: They’re enjoying themselves.
Orcas, or “killer whales,” are probably the next most frequently sighted. Easily identi-
fied by their stark black-and-white patches, they’re the ocean’s top predator, moving
like wolves in highly structured family groups called pods and swimming at up to 25
knots (about 29 mph) in pursuit of salmon, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and almost any-
thing else that moves — except man, oddly enough. Like dolphins, orcas often pop above
the surface in a flashing, graceful arc when they travel, giving viewers a glance at their
sleek shape, markings, and tall dorsal fins. On a recent trip, we spotted a pod of orcas
coming straight toward our ship. As passengers watched, the group — at least ten
strong, the younger whales flanked by their parents — turned and sliced through the
water no more than 20 feet off the ship’s port side, the sun shining off their sleek, angu-
lar dorsal fins and panda-colored backs. It was “a moment.”
You may also spot beluga whales and minke whales. Belugas are the small, white
whales with the cute rounded beaks. More likely to be mistaken for a dolphin than any
other whale, belugas are larger and fatter than dolphins and lack the dolphin’s dorsal fin.
Adults are all white, while juveniles are gray, and they swim in large packs that can
number in the dozens, feeding on salmon. Minkes are the smallest of the baleen whales,
generally under 26 feet long, with a blackish-gray body, a white stomach, a narrow, tri-
angular head, and white bands on their flippers. When breaching, minkes leap some-
thing like dolphins, gracefully reentering the water headfirst — unlike humpbacks, which
smash down on their sides. Also unlike the humpbacks, they don’t raise their flukes clear
of the water when they dive.

The 96-passenger Spirit of ’98 is one of the most distinctive small ships in
Alaska. A replica 19th-century coastal steamer, the charming ’98 was even
featured in the Kevin Costner film Wyatt Earp. The Cruise West fleet also
includes three former Clipper Cruise ships: the 102-passenger Spirit of
Endeavour, the 138-passenger Spirit of Yorktown, and the Spirit of
Glacier Bay (previously the Nantucket Clipper). Cabins are comfortable
and of decent size, and continue the ships’ Victorian motif. In recent years,
the line has made a concentrated effort to upgrade the quality of its menus
and presentation — with considerable success, adding variety and con-
sistency to the table.

Lindblad Expeditions
Lindblad Expeditions specializes in providing environmentally sensitive soft-
adventure/educational cruises to remote places in the world, with visits to
a few large ports. Lindblad Expedition cruises are explorative and informal,
designed to appeal to the intellectually curious traveler seeking a vacation
that’s educational as well as relaxing. Your time is spent learning about the
outdoors (from National Geographic experts and high-caliber expedition
leaders trained in botany, anthropology, biology, and geology) and observ-
ing the world around you, either from the ship or on shore excursions,
which are included in the cruise package. Depending on weather and sea
conditions, there are usually two or three excursions offered every day.
Lindblad Expeditions tends to attract well-traveled and well-educated, pro-
fessional, 55+ couples who have “been there, done that” and are looking for
something completely different in a cruise experience. The 62-passenger
Sea Lion and Sea Bird are nearly identical in every respect. All are basic
vessels built to get you to beautiful spots and feature a minimum of public
rooms and conveniences: one dining room, one bar/lounge, and lots of
deck space for wildlife and glacier-viewing. Cabins are tight and functional
rather than fancy. Although far from haute cuisine, dinners are well pre-
pared and presented, and are served at single open seatings that allow
passengers to get to know each other by moving around to different tables.

Silversea
There’s no argument: Silversea is a very worthy member of the small
number of operators of truly luxurious small to midsize ships. The only
rival to its Silver Shadow in that category in Alaska in 2008 was Regent’s
Seven Seas Mariner. Silversea isn’t in Alaska every year, though this
marked its second year in a row in the market. It likes to offer past pas-
sengers as much variety as possible so some years it chooses to move
from the 49th state to deploy its ships in more exotic trades — Southeast
Asia, South America, and the like.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 99

Silversea represents the last word in elegance and service. Spacious
accommodations, all oceanview suites, no tipping expected, free bever-
ages (alcoholic and otherwise), swift and caring baggage handling — these
are the hallmarks of the Silversea product.
Guests tend to be in their 60s and up. They’re generally well-educated with
definite ideas on just what luxury means in accommodations, cuisine, and
service. And they have the means to pay for it!
Food is one of Silversea’s strengths — both in preparation and in presenta-
tion — not only in the main dining room (known simply as The Restaurant)
but also in the breakfast/lunch buffets in the La Terrazza Café as well. That
room doubles as a low-capacity, bistro-type eatery in the evening.
Silversea recently significantly enhanced its onboard enrichment program.
Naturalists, historians, well-known authors, award-winning chefs, and wine
experts host excellent sessions, often targeted for the specific cruising
location. The line has also introduced a Viking Cooking School, which fea-
tures state-of-the-art cooking theaters that allow chefs to present a vari-
ety of specialized cooking classes and demonstrations on every cruise.

The Big-Ship Cruise Lines
The ships featured in this section vary in size, age, and offerings but share
the common thread of having more activities and entertainment options
than any one person can possibly take in during the course of a cruise.
You’ll find swimming pools, health clubs, spas, nightclubs, movie theaters,
shops, casinos, multiple restaurants, bars, and special kids’ playrooms,
and in some cases sports decks, virtual golf, computer rooms, martini
bars, cigar clubs, and even quiet spaces where you can get away from it
all. In most cases, you’ll find an abundance of onboard activities, including
games, contests, classes, and lectures, plus a variety of entertainment
options and show productions, some very sophisticated.
Carnival Cruise Lines
Carnival is the Big Kahuna of the cruise industry, boasting a modern fleet
of big ships that are the boldest, most innovative, and most successful on
the seas. And nonstop fun (if you have the energy after a hearty day of
Alaska cruising) is the name of the game onboard.
The decor on Carnival’s ships is eclectic and definitely glitzy, offering
something of a theme-park ambience. Translating the line’s warm-weather
fun-in-the-sun experience to Alaska has meant combining the “24-hour orgy
of good times” philosophy with opportunities to experience the natural
wonders of the state, so you may find yourself bellying up to the rail with
a multicolored party drink to gawk at a glacier. Drinking and R-rated come-
dians are part of the scene, and the casino is nearly always hopping. The
motto is “fun,” and with a big focus on entertainment, friendly service, and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
100

creative cruise directors (they can be corny sometimes, but at least
they’re lively), that’s what Carnival delivers. Cocktails inevitably begin to
flow before lunch. You can learn to country line-dance or ballroom-dance,
take cooking lessons, learn to play bridge, watch first-run movies, and
practice your golf swing by smashing balls into a net. Once in port,
Carnival lives up to its “more is more” ethos by offering more than 100
shore excursions in Alaska. These are divided into categories of easy, mod-
erate, and adventure.
Overall, Carnival has some of the youngest demographics in the industry.
This is the same crowd that can be found in Las Vegas and Atlantic City and
at Florida’s mega-resorts. It’s a lively crowd that tends to feel equally com-
fortable checking out whales and icebergs as dancing the Macarena on cue.
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 101
Weddings at sea
Lovers have long known that there is nothing as romantic as cruising. Luxury cruise
ships have been vastly popular honeymoon vehicles for decades. And recently, with the
growing popularity of cruises, they’ve assumed new significance in the marriage busi-
ness. Ship operators now make it easier to tie the knot either in a port of call during the
voyage or onboard the vessel. Most lines will help you set it all up — if you give them
enough advance notice. They’ll provide the music, photographer, bouquets, champagne,
hors d’oeuvres, the cake, and other frills and fripperies. All you have to do is bring some-
body to share your “I do” moment. The wedding package might cost you $1,000 or so
over the price of your cabin.
In Alaska in 2008, Carnival, Celebrity, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, and
Holland America Line allow you to hold your marriage ceremony in a specially deco-
rated lounge onboard while in port, officiated by a local clergyman or justice of the
peace. Princess goes one better: Whereas before you could be married only on the
Diamond, Sapphire, Island, and Coral Princesses, all of them equipped with wedding
chapels in which the captain himself can conduct the ceremony, now you can be wed
on any ship in the Princess fleet, including those in Alaska in 2009. It’s all perfectly legal.
The ships have been reflagged to Bermuda registry, the authority under which your nup-
tials will be certified. The captain of the Carnival Spirit can also marry couples at sea
(including same-sex couples) in the waters off British Columbia (international waters).
If you want guests to attend your special onboard moment while in port, the ship line
must be notified well in advance, and your guests will be required to produce valid ID
and to go through the same kind of screening process that passengers go through.
Princess makes it easy for friends and family onshore to share the event by filming the
entire process and then posting it on a special Webcam found on its Web site
(www.princess.com/bridgecams). And, no, it’s not really live. The images are
there for all to see long after the rites are concluded.
No matter where you wed, you have to have a valid U.S. marriage license (or a Canadian
license, if you want to bid farewell to the single life in one of the British Columbia ports).
The cruise line’s wedding planner will help you set that up. Just remember to plan in
advance — these things take time.

The 2,124-passenger megaship Carnival Spirit is big and impressive, even
if some may find the interior a bit over the top. It offers plenty of activi-
ties, great pool and hot-tub spaces (some covered for use in chillier
weather), a big oceanview gym and spa, and more dining options than your
doctor would say is advisable.

Celebrity Cruises
With a premium fleet that’s among the best designed in the cruise indus-
try, Celebrity Cruises offers a comfortably sophisticated, upscale cruise
experience: classy, tasteful, and luxurious. You’ll be pampered (as their
commercials say) — at a relatively reasonable price.
Each of the Celebrity ships is spacious, glamorous, and comfortable,
mixing sleekly modern and vaguely Art Deco styles and throwing in an
astoundingly cutting-edge art collection. The line’s genteel service is
exceptional: Staff members are exceedingly polite and professional, and
they contribute greatly to the elegant atmosphere.
The typical Celebrity guest is one who prefers to pursue his or her R&R 
at a relatively relaxed pace, with a minimum of aggressively promoted
group activities. Like all the big-ship lines, Celebrity offers lots for its pas-
sengers to do, but its focus on mellower pursuits and innovative pro-
gramming sets it apart. A new program, Celebrity Xpeditions, is promising
more adventure-oriented shore excursions by the line.
Celebrity’s current Alaska fleet comprises two of the line’s newest ships,
the Infinity (91,000 tons, 1,950 passengers) and the similarly dimensioned
Millennium, and the stunning and only slightly older Mercury. All three
ships were designed with sharp attention to detail and a high degree of
decorative panache, and they offer just the right combination of elegance,
artfulness, excitement, and fun.
Celebrity’s cuisine, plentiful and served with style, is extra special, and
leans toward American/European. This means that dishes are generally
not low fat, although the line has eliminated trans fats, and healthier alter-
natives are always available. The company has realigned its dining pro-
gram under the leadership of Jacques Van Staden who was once
nominated for a “rising star” by the prestigious James Beard Foundation.

Holland America Line
Holland America Line (HAL) can be summed up in one word: tradition. The
company was formed way back in 1973 as the Netherlands-America
Steamship Company, and its ships today strive to present an aura of 
history and dignity, like a European hotel where they never let rock stars
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska

register. And thanks to its acquisition, over the years, of numerous land-
based tour operators, Holland America has positioned itself as Alaska’s
most experienced and comprehensive cruise company.
Cruising with HAL is less hectic than cruising on most other ships. The
line strives for a quieter, sometimes almost sedate, presentation, although
it has brightened up its entertainment package and its menus in recent
years. Overall, the ships tend to be more evocative of the days of grand
liners, with lots of dark wood and displays of nautical artifacts.
The company’s 1,266-passenger Statendam-class ships — the Statendam
(1993), Maasdam (1993), Ryndam (1994), and Veendam (1996) — are vir-
tual carbon copies of the same attractive, well-crafted design, with a dash
of glitz here and there. The 1,440-passenger Volendam officially debuted
in 1999, and the 1,440-passenger Zaandam debuted in 2000. Brighter and
bolder than the earlier ships, the Volendam and Zaandam share many fea-
tures of the Statendam-class ships, though they’re slightly larger in size
(63,000 tons, as opposed to 59,652) and carry more passengers (1,440,
against the Statendam class’s 1,266). The 1,380-passenger Amsterdam is
61,000 tons and is one of two flagships in the fleet. (The other is the
Amsterdam’s sister ship, the Rotterdam.) The Oosterdam (85,000 tons
and carrying 1,848 passengers) is one of four of HAL’s Vista-class ships,
the others being the Zuiderdam (which entered service in the winter of
2002), the Noordam (which checked in early in 2006), and the Westerdam
(which joined the fleet in 2004). Both the Zuiderdam and Noordam will 
sail Alaska as of 2008. The company’s smallest ship is the luxurious
Prinsendam, just 38,000 tons and with a passenger capacity of under 800.
Holland America’s passenger profile used to reflect a somewhat older
crowd than on other ships. Now the average age is dropping, partly thanks
to an increased emphasis on the line’s Club HAL program for children and
partly due to some updating of the onboard entertainment offerings. In the
last few years, HAL’s meals have become a lot more adventurous. The vari-
ety of dishes on the menu is as good as on any other premium line, and
the quality of the food is generally high throughout the fleet.
Holland America’s ships are heavy on more mature, less frenetic activities
and light on boogie-till-the-cows-come-home party-hearty pursuits. You’ll
find good bridge programs and music to dance to or listen to in the bars and
lounges, plus health spas and all the other standard activities found on most
large ships — bingo, golf-putting contests (on the carpet in the lobby), dance
lessons, art auctions, and the like. New in 2007 and continuing through at
least 2009, Alaska Native Travel Guides are on all Glacier Bay–bound ships.
Through a partnership with the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage,
the guides bring their knowledge and personal experience of local culture,
history, art, and flora and fauna, giving lectures and interacting one-on-one
with guests. They also sell artwork by Alaska Natives such as ivory- and
soapstone-carving, basket-weaving, and mask-making. In addition, a Tlingit
cultural interpreter from Hoonah boards ships at Glacier Bay and Hubbard
Glacier to give talks explaining the origins of the Huna people. At the gla-
ciers, there is also commentary by National Park Service employees. The
Huna tribe has called Glacier Bay home for centuries.

Norwegian Cruise Line
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) offers an informal and upbeat atmosphere
on medium- to mega-size ships. In 2008 both the Norwegian Pearl and the
Norwegian Star were in Seattle for the summer’s Inside Passage schedule,
while the Norwegian Sun returns to Vancouver for its Inside Passage
round-trips. All three ships are in seven-night rotation.
The company has gradually changed its program to what it calls “freestyle”
cruising, which makes life a whole lot easier for passengers. One of the
main components of freestyle cruising is freedom in when and where pas-
sengers dine. Guests can eat in their choice of a variety of restaurants
pretty much any time between 5:30 p.m. and midnight (you must be seated
by 10 p.m.), with no prearranged table assignment or dining time. Other
perks of freestyle cruising are that tips are automatically charged to room
accounts, dress codes are more relaxed (resort casual) at all times, and, at
the end of the voyage, passengers can remain in their cabins until their
time comes to disembark.
The line excels at activities, and its recreational and fitness programs are
among the best in the industry. The line’s children’s program and enter-
tainment offerings are also top-notch. The demographic tends more
toward fairly affluent retirees, but you’ll find an increasing number of fam-
ilies as well, including grandparents bringing along the grandkids.
None of the NCL vessels would win a prize for cuisine (though some of the
ships’ many alternative restaurants serve excellent meals for an extra
charge), but the cruise line handles the business of dining in an innova-
tive way thanks to its freestyle concept.

Princess Cruises
Princess Cruises strives, successfully, to please a wide variety of passen-
gers. The Princess fleet appeals to a wider cross-section of cruisers by
offering loads of choices and activities, plus touches of big-ship glamour,
along with plenty of the private balconies, quiet nooks, and calm spaces
that characterize smaller, more intimate-size vessels. Aboard Princess, you
get a lot of bang for your buck, attractively packaged and well executed.
In 2004, Princess became the first line to use the rather nondescript
Whittier as the northern terminus for its Gulf cruises instead of the more
commonly used Seward, and it’s done so ever since. Whittier’s primary
advantage over Seward is that it’s about 60 miles closer to Anchorage.
What’s more, passengers bound for rail tours of Denali National Park are
now able to board their trains right on the pier instead of taking a bus to
Anchorage and then embarking on their rail carriages.

If you were to put Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, and Holland
America in a big bowl and mix them all together, you’d come up with
Princess Cruises’ megas. The Coral Princess, Island Princess, Diamond
Princess, and Sapphire Princess — its latest creations — are less glitzy
and frenzied than the ships of, say, Carnival and Royal Caribbean; not quite
as cutting-edge as Celebrity’s Infinity and Summit; and more exciting,
youthful, and entertaining than Holland America’s near-megas. The
Princess fleet appeals to a wider cross-section of cruisers by offering loads
of choices and activities, plus touches of big-ship glamour, along with
plenty of the private balconies, quiet nooks, and calm spaces that char-
acterize smaller, more intimate-size vessels. Aboard Princess, you get a lot
of bang for your buck, attractively packaged and well executed.
Typical Princess passengers are likely to be between about 50 and 65 and
are often experienced cruisers who know what they want and are prepared
to pay for it. Princess passengers can expect enough onboard activity to
keep them going from morning to night if they’ve a mind to, and enough
hideaways to let them do absolutely nothing, if that’s their thing. The line’s
ScholarShip@Sea program, which allows passengers to take classes in sub-
jects as diverse as photography, computers, cooking, and even pottery,
has been hugely popular since it was pioneered by Princess in 2004. The
line also has naturalists and park rangers on board to offer commentary.
An indication of how seriously Princess takes its obligation to provide pas-
sengers with an ever greater variety of shore excursions is its programs
in Icy Strait Point — a cruise stop unheard of not many years ago. As of
2008, Princess will have no fewer than 16 outings in Icy Strait Point, rang-
ing from a simple Hoonah Indian Tribal Dance presentation to a kayak
adventure to a bike trek and bike trek/zip-ride combo plus much more.
Princess knows very well that what happens on the ship is important —
but so is what happens in port.

Regent Seven Seas Cruises
Regent’s guests travel in style and extreme comfort. Its brand of luxury is
casually elegant and subtle, and the line offers outstanding food, service,
and accommodations. The Seven Seas Mariner is one of the most com-
fortable ships at sea, offering its guests large suites and very spacious
public areas. Regent tends to attract travelers from their 40s to their 60s
with a household income of more than $200,000, who don’t like to flaunt
their wealth. Passengers wear country-club-casual attire.
Regent’s cuisine would gain high marks even if it were on land. Service by
professional waiters adds to the experience, as do little touches such as
fine china and fresh flowers on the tables. The complimentary wines
served with meals are generally quite good; there’s very little reason to
want to trade up. (However, the wines available by paying extra are actu-
ally fairly priced.)
Chapter 8: Cruising Alaska’s Coast 105

The line assumes that, for the most part, guests want to entertain them-
selves onboard, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a full roster of scheduled
activities. These include lectures by local experts and well-known authors,
and instruction in the fine arts of needlepoint and golf. There are card and
board games, blackjack and Ping-Pong tournaments, bingo, and big-screen
movies with popcorn. Bridge instructors are onboard on select sailings.
The ships are wireless throughout and offer great deals on Internet pack-
ages. Le Cordon Bleu–trained chefs offer cooking classes and gentlemen
hosts are on hand each evening to dance with single ladies.

Royal Caribbean International
A bold, brash industry-innovating company, Royal Caribbean sells a mass-
market style of cruising aboard its megaships that’s reasonably priced and
offers nearly every diversion imaginable. The ships are more informal than
formal and are well run, with a veritable army of friendly service employ-
ees paying close attention to day-to-day details.
The contemporary decor on Royal Caribbean vessels doesn’t bang you
over the head with glitz. It’s more subdued, classy, and witty, with lots of
glass, greenery, and art. Royal Caribbean owns the largest ship in the
world, the Independence of the Seas, at 160,000 tons (and similarly sized
sister ships Freedom of the Seas and Liberty of the Seas). The soon to
be introduced Oasis of the Seas will take on the “world’s largest” role at
220,000 tons. Although these 3,600-plus (Oasis is 5,000-plus) passenger
ships — which introduced such cruise-ship design features as ice-skating
rinks, rock-climbing walls, and cabins overlooking interior atrium areas —
are not in Alaska in 2008. Royal Caribbean does offer the very up-to-date
2,112-passenger Radiance of the Seas, which in 2001 introduced a new
category of ship for the line, offering many innovations, including a bil-
liards room with self-leveling pool tables. The ship is joined in Alaska by
its sister ship, the similarly dimensioned Serenade of the Seas. The
Radiance is in Gulf of Alaska service between Vancouver, British Columbia,
and Seward; the Serenade is in Inside Passage service out of Vancouver.
Also sailing in Alaska in 2009 is the 1,998-guest Vision of the Seas.
The crowd on Royal Caribbean ships, like the decor, tends to be a notch
down on the party scale from what you’ll find on Carnival and perhaps a
notch up from those on the somewhat more formal ships. Guests repre-
sent an age mix from 30 to 60, and a good number of families are attracted
by the line’s well-established and fine-tuned kids’ programs. Dress is gen-
erally casual during the day and informal most evenings.
Food on Royal Caribbean has been upgraded and improved in recent
years, and occasionally a dish will knock your socks off. On the activity
front, Royal Caribbean offers plenty of the standard cruise-line fare (craft
classes, horse racing, bingo, shuffleboard, deck games, line-dancing les-
sons, wine-and-cheese tastings, cooking demonstrations, and art auc-
tions), but if you want to take it easy and watch the world go by or scan

for wildlife, nobody will bother you. Port lectures are offered on topics
such as Alaska wildlife, history, and culture. The ships also offer an exten-
sive fitness program called ShipShape. Children’s activities are some of
the most extensive afloat and include a teen disco, children’s play areas,
and the Adventure Ocean program, which offers a full schedule of scav-
enger hunts, arts-and-crafts sessions, and science presentations — so
many activities, in fact, that kids get their own daily activities program
delivered to their cabin.

 Assessing outdoor health and safety
 Joining outdoor activities — summer and winter
 Viewing Alaska’s wildlife
 Choosing an outdoor escorted tour
You wouldn’t go to Paris and view the Louvre only through the
window of a bus, but many visitors to Alaska do see the wilderness
only through glass. They miss the detail in the flowers, the scent of the
forest, the feeling of the air on their skin, and the tundra under their feet.
They miss the irreplaceable feeling of being a small part of the over-
whelming power of nature.
For some very elderly or frail travelers, surveying the scenery from a
vehicle is better than missing out entirely. But most visitors, even those
with disabilities, can get outdoors in Alaska in some way. Experienced
hikers, anglers, sea-kayakers, canoeists, and other nature lovers will be
in heaven. But you don’t have to know anything or have any experience
in the outdoors; someone is always available to help and to introduce
you to Alaska’s wild lands at your own level.
Nine Ways to Get Killed in Alaska’s Outdoors
Violent death is the first thing that some urbanites think of when they
contemplate going out into nature. As it happens, some rural Alaskans
share the same thoughts when they contemplate going to a big city. (I
remember as a child being told by friends, and believing, that New York
City had “blocks of death” — normal-looking blocks where, if you set
foot there, immediate assassination was virtually guaranteed.)
In Alaska, we have no blocks of death, or trails of death (or whatever the
wilderness version would be). Some activities are inherently hazardous,
such as white-water rafting or snowmobiling. (Any time you have to 
sign a release, it probably means you’re taking a risk.) Other than those

obvious exceptions, however, you encounter danger mainly if you
behave foolishly or get in over your head. Consider this safety rule
number one: If you don’t know what you’re doing, you need to be with
someone who does, such as the experienced guides that I recommend
later in this chapter.
I feel safer in the Alaska wilderness than anywhere else, but in the spirit
of the paranoia I remember from those “blocks of death,” here is a list of
safety tips, arranged to begin with everyone’s worst fantasies of disaster
and work down from there.
Getting eaten by a bear (and such)
Bear-mauling is probably the least likely way for your vacation to end.
Deaths from dog bites are much more common, for example. (Don’t
worry: It’s an example. I’m almost certain you won’t die from a dog bite
either.) But you still need to be prepared for bears and know how to
avoid being trampled by moose.
The first rule of defense is simple: Don’t attract bears. It’s not that hard:
 Keep your food and trash in airtight containers when you’re camp-
ing. (When car camping, the vehicle’s trunk works.)
 Keep a clean camp, avoiding fish odors or other food residue near
where you’re staying.
 Never keep food, pungent items, or clothing that smells like fish in
your tent.
 Clean fish away from your campsite.
When walking through brush or thick trees or hiking at night, make lots
of noise to avoid surprising a bear or moose. You can sing, carry on a
loud conversation, or periodically holler, “Hey bear!” At all costs, avoid
coming between a bear and its cubs or a bear and food. Here’s one
safety tip that’s the same in New York as in Alaska: If a mugger wants
your wallet, give it to him; if a bear wants the fish you just caught, con-
sider it his. Moose also are strongly defensive of their young and can
attack if they feel you’re getting too close.
Most people hurt by moose are in urban settings — they’re quite
common in Anchorage — so don’t assume that because you meet a
moose on a paved path he’s going to step politely aside. Wait at a safe
distance for the moose to move, or go around or return the way you
came. Don’t approach the moose for a picture. Human contact stresses
moose and they can snap and attack someone.
If you see a bear, stop, wave your arms, and make noise. If you’re with
others, group together so that you look larger to the bear. Don’t run,
tempting the bear to chase; depart by slowly backing away, at an angle if
possible, so that you’re not going directly away from the bear. If the bear
follows, stop and begin making noise again.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 109

We sometimes carry a shotgun loaded with slugs for protection in bear
country, but that’s not practical for most visitors. A good alternative is a
bear-deterrent spray, available in a canister for about $45. Buy the hol-
ster, too, because the spray is useless unless you can quickly get at it.
You shoot the spray to produce a burning fog of capsaicin pepper
between you and a threatening bear. Although ineffective in wind or rain,
the sprays are legal in national parks, unlike firearms. Transportation
Security Administration regulations essentially prohibit the product on
the airlines, even in checked baggage. (Ironically, you can check guns
and ammunition.) Unless you can borrow one, you’ll have to buy it here
and give it away before you leave. They’re available in all sporting goods
stores. You can research and order pepper spray direct from Counter
Assault (% 800-695-3394; www.counterassault.com).
Drowning in freezing water
Because of the cool temperatures, unpredictable weather, and cold
water, going out on the ocean or floating down a fast river is more haz-
ardous in Alaska than in most other places. You should go only with an
experienced, licensed operator unless you really know what you’re
doing.
There’s little margin for error if you fall into the water or capsize. The
cold water can cause sudden shock, which leads to drowning. If you
make it past the first couple of minutes without panic or shock, you
have limited time to get out and get warm before the onset of hypother-
mia, a cooling of the body that can lead to death. A life jacket can keep
you afloat during the period of shock, but it won’t keep you alive in 40°F
(4°C) water. If you’re sea-kayaking or canoeing, stay close to shore and
take dry bags (also called float bags) with everything you need to
quickly warm a person who gets wet (see the following section).
Succumbing to exposure
Hypothermia, also called exposure, is a potentially fatal lowering of core
body temperature. It’s most dangerous when it sneaks up on you, per-
haps in 50°F (10°C) weather on a damp mountain hike or rainy boating
trip. Dress in material (whether wool or synthetic) that keeps its warmth
when wet, choosing layers to avoid chilling perspiration. Make sure you
eat well and avoid exhaustion. Keep chocolates or other energy foods in
reserve.
Hypothermia’s symptoms include
 Having cold extremities
 Being uncommunicative
 Displaying poor judgment or coordination
 Fighting sleepiness
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
110

A shivering victim still has the ability to warm up if better dressed. A
lack of shivering means the body has gone beyond that point and you
need to add warmth from the outside and from warm drinks. Get
indoors, force down hot liquids (except in cases of shock, when the
victim could choke), and, if shelter is unavailable, apply body heat from
another person, skin on skin, in a sleeping bag.
Getting eaten alive by bugs
Actually, you can’t die this way. Alaska has no snakes or poisonous spi-
ders nor, at this writing, West Nile virus. But you may wish you were dead
when the mosquitoes or black flies swarm during warmer weather. The
bugs can be too intense for anyone to stand. As a reporter, I once cov-
ered the story of a man who threw a rock through a bank’s plate-glass
window so that he could get arrested and get away from the mosquitoes.
Effective insect repellent is a necessity, as is having a refuge from the
bugs, such as a tent or cabin. Mosquitoes can bite through light fabric.
In the Interior and the Arctic, where mosquitoes are worst, we use jack-
ets of tightly woven fabric with net hoods, which you can buy in Alaska.
Benadryl tablets or other antihistamines often relieve swelling caused
by mosquito bites.
Getting lost
Even experienced people get lost. Hiking off-trail or voyaging in a canoe,
raft, or kayak, you quickly find that one mountain looks a lot like another.
If you’re unsure of your navigational skills, maps, or equipment, don’t go.
Beyond those basics, the most important safety precautions are to go
with another person and to make sure someone knows where to look for
you if you don’t come back. For extended trips (more than a day hike on
a trail), leave a written trip plan with a person who will call rescuers if
you’re late. At the very least, leave a note in your car indicating where
you’re bound. Cellphones sometimes work near towns and some high-
ways, but not reliably, and there is no coverage beyond populated areas.
Nowadays, you can rent an Iridium satellite phone that will work out-
doors anywhere on Earth from RoadPost (% 888-290-1616 or 905-
272-5665; www.roadpost.com), starting at $9 a day, plus $1.79 a minute,
and a $35 delivery fee; cheap if it saves your life, but not as good as
knowing where you are and what you’re doing. They send you the phone
by overnight express and customer service is excellent. However, the
phones are finicky and only work outdoors.
Drowning while crossing a river
Hiking off trails in Alaska’s backcountry, such as at Denali, can require
crossing rivers without bridges. Wading a small stream may be safe, but
use great caution in substantial flows: You can easily get in trouble.
Often, the water is glacial melt, barely above freezing and heavy with silt
that makes it opaque. The silt can fill your pockets and drag you down. If
in doubt, don’t do it.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 111

If you do decide to cross, unbuckle your pack, keep your shoes on, face
upstream, use a heavy walking stick if possible, and rig a safety line.
Carry children or have them follow next to an adult who breaks the full
force of the current.
Keeling over from bad clams
Don’t eat mussels, clams, or scallops you pick or dig from the seashore
unless you know they’re safe to eat. Generally, that means you need
some specific and reliable local knowledge. There is a government pro-
gram to assure shellfish safety, but the only easily accessible beaches it
affects are on the eastern shore of Kachemak Bay. The risk is paralytic
shellfish poisoning, a potentially fatal malady caused by a naturally
occurring toxin. It causes total paralysis that includes your breathing. A
victim may be kept alive with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until med-
ical help is obtained. For more information, check the Web site of the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, www.alaska.gov/
dec/eh/fss/seafood/psphome.htm, or go to www.alaska.gov and
search for “psp”.
Getting seasick
Seasickness sometimes feels like it will be fatal, and it always kills the
fun of a boat trip. Here are tips that will work in Alaska or anywhere else
your stomach can’t keep up with you:
 Abstain from alcohol the night before, eat a light breakfast, and
limit coffee.
 Sit low and near the middle of the boat, away from odors and with
your eyes on the horizon — and no reading.
 Alternative medicine cures, such as ginger or acupressure, have no
proven benefits but nonetheless work for many of those who
believe in them. A placebo, such as a sugar pill, is 40 percent effec-
tive with seasickness if the patient has faith.
 The very best cure is the scopolamine skin patch, available only by
prescription, which lasts up to three days.
 The main choices for over-the-counter drugs are meclizine (brand
names Bonine, Antivert, or Dramamine II) and dimenhydrinate
(original Dramamine). Both are drowsiness-inducing antihista-
mines, but there’s less of that side-effect with the newer meclizine.
To be effective, the drugs need at least two hours to get through
your digestive system, so you must take the pill well before you get
on the boat. For best effectiveness, take a tablet before bed and
another on the morning of the outing.
If you’ve taken nothing and feel yourself getting seasick, there is a
last-minute cure that sometimes works: Chew up the tablets but
don’t swallow them, holding the mush under your tongue or
against your cheek. The drug is partly absorbed through the lining
of the mouth.

112

Drinking tainted water
Unpurified river or lake water may not be safe to drink (although it won’t
kill you). Hand-pumped filters available from sporting goods stores for
about $75 are the most practical way of dealing with the problem on
long backcountry trips. Iodine kits and boiling also work. The danger is a
protozoan cyst called giardia lamblia, which causes diarrhea and has
been spread to thousands of water bodies all over the United States by
animal droppings. You may not notice the side effects for a couple of
weeks after exposure, and then it could become chronic. If symptoms
show up after you get home, tell your doctor you may have been
exposed so that he can test and treat you.
Getting Active in the Alaska Summer
Summer in Alaska is a time to get outside; on a sunny weekend, you’re
hard pressed to find an Alaskan in town. Here’s a mini-directory to help
you figure out which activities are best for you, where you can do them,
and whom you can get to take you. I also provide information to help
you decide whether to participate in these activities on your own or
with a guide. I suggest a few guides here to get you started; the destina-
tion chapters in this book include alternative guides, as well as informa-
tion on renting equipment in each town.
Backpacking
I can’t imagine a more beautiful or exciting place for a backpacking expe-
dition than Alaska. You can have immense swaths of tundra or mountain
to yourself, places with more wildlife than people.
 Difficulty level: Take an overnight hike near home before you
invest in a backpacking trek in Alaska to hone your skills and make
sure you enjoy carrying a pack. Even Alaska’s trail hikes tend to be
remote, with potentially tough weather; the most dramatic hiking
routes are challenging, far beyond the trails.
 Best places: For self-guided trail hikes, pick the pathways of
Chugach National Forest and Chugach State Park near Anchorage
(see Chapter 14). For self-guided, off-trail hiking, try Denali National
Park (see Chapter 19). For guided, off-trail hikes, consider St. Elias
Alpine Guides at Wrangell–St. Elias National Park (see the last item
in this list).
 Guided or on your own: To set up your own trip, you need to buy
trail guidebooks and maps, bring or rent equipment, and arrange
for transportation at your starting and ending points. You can start
with the outfitters that I recommend throughout this book. This
takes a lot of planning, but it’s doable if you’re motivated. A guided
trek takes out the guesswork but costs many times more.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 113

 Who to go with: St. Elias Alpine Guides (% 888-933-5427; www.
steliasguides.com) specializes in trekking and climbing the
rugged and spectacular Wrangell–St. Elias National Park, some of
the most remote wilderness on the planet. A four-day trek starts at
around $800 per person.
Biking off-road
Mountain-biking is allowed off-road almost everywhere in Alaska except
in the national parks. Literally thousands of miles of dirt roads and
tracks reach through the coastal forests. In the cities, excellent cross-
country ski trails become excellent mountain-biking trails in the
summer.
 Difficulty level: Mountain-biking rough terrain is a real skill, but
novices can enjoy fat-tire bikes on dirt roads and ski trails around
many communities without difficulty.
 Best places: Many places in Alaska have superb mountain-biking.
The remote roads across Kachemak Bay from Homer are among 
the best: They’re not connected to the highway network, they’re
easy to reach by boat, and the town has good bike shops (see
Chapter 16).
 Guided or on your own: Some areas do have guided mountain-
biking day trips, but mostly it’s a self-guided activity: You rent the
bike and go. Plan ahead by contacting a bike shop in the area
where you plan to ride (see the appropriate chapter in this book
for suggestions), getting advice on the area, and reserving your
equipment.
 Who to go with: Bike-rental agencies are listed with each destina-
tion in the book.
Biking on pavement
In Alaska’s smaller communities, especially in the Southeast, a bicycle is
a visitor’s most efficient way of getting around. Vigorous cyclists can
also use a bike to see natural places on the edge of town on day trips.
Some vigorous cyclists tour the state’s scenic highways on bikes.
 Difficulty level: Almost anyone with physical mobility can get on a
bike and coast along the coastal trail in Anchorage. Highway trips
are for physically fit riders who can handle traffic.
 Best places: The bike paths of Anchorage (see Chapter 14) allow
casual rides into the woods, where you can frequently spot moose
and eagles. There are good trails in Juneau, too, and in Seward,
Skagway, and Sitka the quiet streets are fine for riding (see
Chapters 16, 20, 21, and 22).
 Guided or on your own: You don’t need a guide to rent a bike and
explore a quaint town or wooded bike trail. You may want to join a
group for a bike expedition.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
114

 Who to go with: I list bike-rental agencies with each town in the
book. Alaska Bicycle Adventures (% 907-245-2175; www.alaska
bike.com) offers vacations for avid cyclists. An eight-day tour over
the spectacular Richardson Highway costs around $3,000, inclu-
sive. The schedule includes bike and kayak tours, too.
Canoeing
Gliding down a gently flowing stream or across the mirrored surface of a
pristine lake may be the most serene way to get into the true Alaska.
Wild land unfolds around you as if you were the first person to float on
the waterway.
 Difficulty level: Anyone can get out for a paddle on Fairbanks’s
gentle Chena River. Expert canoeists find a paradise of thousands
of miles of little-used routes in many locations.
 Best places: Fairbanks is a canoeing center, with accessible river
routes for every level of ability or length of journey (see Chap-
ter 17). The Swan Lake Canoe Route, near Kenai, is a good self-
guided backcountry trip for novices (see Chapter 16).
 Guided or on your own: If you’re confident paddling a canoe, you
can manage the easier routes that I mention in the book. Always
check water levels and stream conditions with local authorities. To
get deeper into the wilderness, where emergency help is unavail-
able, go with a guide.
 Who to go with: River guide and author Karen Jettmar leads long
floats by canoe or raft on exotic wilderness rivers for small groups
all summer through her firm, Equinox Wilderness Expeditions 
(% 604-222-1219; www.equinoxexpeditions.com). A ten-day float
costs $4,000.
Day-hiking
Part of Alaska’s magic is that no place is so urban that it’s more than an
hour from big, unspoiled natural areas. Anyone who has the use of his
legs should make a point of getting off on the trails that lead out from
every town.
 Difficulty level: You set the level of difficulty. Hike a half-mile up a
level seaside trail or conquer a mountain on an all-day hike.
 Best places: You find great day hikes everywhere you go in Alaska.
The best trails are near towns in coastal Alaska, including
Anchorage (see Chapter 14), the Kenai Peninsula (see Chapter 16),
and every town in Southeast Alaska (three of which are covered in
Part V). You can hike on tundra, off trails, at Denali National Park
(see Chapter 19), and many other places.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 115

 Guided or on your own: All you need are walking shoes and direc-
tions to the trailhead. I mention some of the best hikes throughout
this book. If you’re uncomfortable on your own, the national parks
lead guided hikes.
 Who to go with: The best guided day hikes are at Denali National
Park, where rangers lead daily Discovery Hikes off trails deep
inside the park (see Chapter 19).
Fishing
Alaska’s legendary salmon and halibut fishing drive the rhythm of life in
coastal communities. Just try not to get excited when you haul in a fish
bigger than you up from the sea floor, or hook a mass of fighting muscle
in a remote stream. The best all-around source of information about fish-
ing in Alaska is the Web site of the Alaska Department of Fish & Game
Sport Fish Division (www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/statewide/index.
cfm). The site includes guides on where, how, and when to fish; fishing
reports updated weekly; and the option to purchase licenses online.
Nonresident sport-fishing licenses start at $20 for a one-day license and
go up to $80 for a two-week license. You can also get a license on the
spot from sporting goods stores, grocery stores, and guides.
 Difficulty level: Just about anyone can enjoy guided fishing on a
boat in the Kenai River or on the ocean in Southeast or Southcentral
Alaska. Avid anglers can schedule time at a remote fishing lodge or
on a guided or unguided floatplane fly-in, or just fish streamside on
one of Alaska’s highways.
 Best places: For halibut (from a boat), go to Homer, Juneau, or 
Sitka (see Chapters 16, 20, and 22). For salmon in the ocean (from a
boat), head to Seward, Juneau, or Sitka (see Chapters 16, 20, and
22). And for salmon in a stream (on a boat or on the bank), try the
Anchorage environs and Kenai (see Chapters 14 and 16).
 Guided or do-it-yourself: Fishing is easy; catching a fish is what
takes some skill. Unless you have plenty of time for research and
trial and error, take at least your first fishing trip with a guide to
learn the unique skills required for salmon-fishing. (You must have
a guide for halibut, because you need a boat.)
 Who to go with: If fishing is the primary reason you’re going to
Alaska, contact Sport Fishing Alaska (% 888-552-8674; www.
alaskatripplanners.com), a fee-based booking agency that gets
anglers to Alaska’s hottest fishing spots. If fishing is just one of
your goals, check with the fishing resources I list in the chapters
specific to the towns you plan to visit.
Rafting
River-rafting comes in different flavors: half-day white-water thrill rides
or multi-day journeys across great swaths of Alaska wilderness that you
can’t reach any other way — or a combination of the two.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
116

 Difficulty level: Sitting in a raft is easy. But floating through violent
rapids in cold water is inherently hazardous and definitely not for
everyone. A guided raft expedition is the most comfortable way to
see remote wilderness, but you must be ready to sleep in a tent and
endure the bugs, and you have no way to quit before the end.
 Best places: For day trips, the Nenana Canyon outside Denali
National Park (see Chapter 19) and the fast rivers around Anchorage
(see Chapter 14) are among the best options. For expeditions, the
rivers of the Arctic may be best for their broad scenery and wildlife-
viewing.
 Guided or on your own: Unless you’re an expert, putting together
your own raft trip is probably impractical. Guided expeditions
should be planned and booked three months in advance, to reserve
a spot and to make sure you know what you’re getting into. You can
take day trips on a next-day basis.
 Who to go with: For day trips near Anchorage, try NOVA (% 800-
746-5753; www.novalaska.com). At Denali National Park, contact
Denali Outdoor Center (% 888-303-1925; www.denalioutdoor
center.com). For expeditions, check out Equinox Wilderness
Expeditions (% 604-222-1219; www.equinoxexpeditions.com) or
Alaska Discovery (% 800-586-1911; www.akdiscovery.com).
Sea-kayaking
A sea kayak is a uniquely intimate way to see the abundance of the
marine world. Rich seafloor life glides by inches below you in clear
water, sea otters and birds let you approach, and whales take no notice.
You enter into their universe.
 Difficulty level: Almost any adult or teen can safely handle a
guided sea-kayaking outing, but you can get into serious danger
quickly without a guide or the proper skills. People with joint or
back problems may not be comfortable, and young children must
be able to sit perfectly still.
 Best places: Virtually every coastal community has a sea-kayaking
guide and someplace beautiful to take guests for day trips, so there
is no need to tailor your itinerary to taking a day paddle.
Expeditions are available in many places, too; some of the best
waters for extended paddling are in Southeast Alaska, accessed
from Juneau (see Chapter 20).
 Guided or on your own: Experienced kayakers can easily rent
what they need for a wonderful trip. You can also find operators
who rent sea kayaks to raw beginners — a life-and-death gamble I
don’t recommend. You’re better off going with one of the guides
always found in Alaska’s coastal towns. Reserve expeditions well in
advance and book day trips a day or two ahead.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 117

 Who to go with: I’ve recommended kayak guides for day trips in
every coastal town in the book. For a sea-kayaking expedition, try
Alaska Discovery (% 800-586-1911; www.akdiscovery.com), with
trips into Glacier Bay National Park, a whale-watching paddle from
a base camp, and even cushy inn-to-inn journeys. The three-day,
two-night base camp trip costs $1,150.
Keeping Active in the Alaskan Winter
For people who live in Alaska, getting outdoors in winter is a matter of
maintaining sanity: Winter lasts from October through April, and you
just can’t stay inside that long. For visitors, the winter holds a magnifi-
cent opportunity for winter sports. In many ways, this is when Alaska is
at its best.
The following sections discuss the variety of winter activities you can
try, including their difficulty level, some suggestions for the best places
to go, and whether to try them on your own or with a guide. As with the
preceding summer-activities section, I also suggest a few outfitters for
you to consider; you can find more options, as well as rental providers,
in the destination chapters in this book.
Dog-mushing
No one should come to Alaska in the winter and not take at least a quick
spin in a dog sled. You simply can’t believe the speed, joy, and intelli-
gence of the dogs running ahead of you as you ride quietly through the
trees.
 Difficulty level: Anyone can ride in a sled driven by an experienced
musher, although few folks will want to do it for more than an hour
or so. You can certainly learn to drive a well-trained team, but you
need to be confident around dogs and agile enough to handle situa-
tions that arise.
 Best places: Fairbanks area is the state’s center for mushing, with
plenty of dogs, snow, and land for running — all the necessary
ingredients (see Chapter 17).
 Guided or on your own: If you don’t own a dozen trained dogs and
a sled, doing it yourself isn’t an option. The choice is in the basket
or on the runners (riding or driving); learning to drive a sled is
great, but it takes time and money. You can usually arrange day-trip
rides a day or two in advance, or a few weeks for peak race periods.
 Who to go with: In Fairbanks, the mushing center, Sun Dog Express
Dog Sled Tours (% 907-479-6983; www.mosquitonet.com/~
sleddog) charges $30 for a quick spin, up to $250 to learn to drive
a team in a half-day.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
118

Skiing
Alaska has outstanding downhill skiing and snow that you can count on.
Even better, because of the distance from population centers, lift lines
are a rarity even at the busiest ski resorts. Cross-country skiers will find
great trails without fees and unlimited backcountry to explore.
 Difficulty level: Going all the way to Alaska to ski makes sense
mostly for those who already know how, but you can still find easy
slopes to learn on. Expert skiers find no limit to challenges.
 Best places: Alaska’s best ski resort is Alyeska Resort in Girdwood,
just south of Anchorage (see Chapter 15). The best cross-country
trails, more than 30 miles of them, are at Kincaid Park in Anchorage
(see Chapter 14). Turnagain Pass, near Girdwood, is prime country
for backcountry skiing.
 Guided or on your own: Planning a skiing vacation is relatively
easy, because you only need to deal with one place. For Christmas
or spring-break reservations, call well ahead.
 Who to go with: Alyeska Resort (% 800-880-3880; www.alyeska
resort.com) offers inexpensive learn-to-ski and advanced lesson
packages; you can set many other activities through them, too.
Snowmobiling
In most of Alaska, snowmobiles are like cars in other places: They’re
simply the most practical way to get from place to place in a frozen land-
scape. Recreationists also use them for thrill riding, but for visitors,
their primary value lies in the ability to get to beautiful places without
using more muscle than you may have.
 Difficulty level: Riding is simple to pick up, but you can quickly get
stuck or tip over in powder snow. The sport is hazardous: The
machines are fast, your body is unprotected, and you can find your-
self far away in cold, dangerous places in minutes. Take it easy.
 Best places: The snowy mountains and glaciers south of Anchorage
offer plenty of room to ride and scenery to enjoy, and the area has
a professional guide service (see the last item in this list).
 Guided or on your own: Even experienced riders should go with a
guide first to get the lay of the land and learn about the special haz-
ards of extreme terrain before setting out on their own.
 Who to go with: Based in Girdwood, near Anchorage, Glacier City
Snowmobile Tours (% 877-783-5566; www.snowtours.net) guides
groups on outings of up to six hours, with 31⁄2 hours riding, for $225.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 119

Viewing Alaska’s Wildlife
Ask visitors to Alaska, “How was your trip?” and they usually respond by
telling you what kind of animals they saw, such as “We saw two bears
and a whale.” I’ve found this rule holds true even for lifelong residents
who’ve been traveling in the state.
The corollary to the rule is the reaction of travelers who’ve seen no
wildlife: They complain about the weather.
If seeing wildlife is important to you, why not plan your trip to maximize
the number of animals you see? Don’t count on just tripping over a
moose here or there. Pick the very best places to see bears or whales
and go. Even then, you still may not see anything. Part of the electricity
of encountering wild animals is the sheer unpredictability of the experi-
ence. But you stand a much better chance of giving one of those positive
trip reports than if you don’t plan for it.
Like so many of the better things in life, getting to good wildlife-viewing
areas in Alaska is expensive. Wild animals stay away from highways,
which are noisy and dangerous for them. During a one-week trip, you
may see moose or caribou or some other creature from a road (or on a
hike or while snowmobiling), or you may not. It’s a matter of probabili-
ties. With one very significant exception, you’ll need a boat, a small
plane, or some other means of traveling into large-mammal habitat. The
significant exception is Denali National Park (see Chapter 19), where a
bus ride on a road that’s closed to private vehicles leads to superb
wildlife-viewing at a reasonable price.
I’ve seen every animal on the list in this section more than once, but
that’s after a lifetime of traveling in Alaska. On a short trip, you need to
make an investment of time and money, you need luck, and you may
need to be satisfied with seeing animals at a distance with binoculars.
But if you try, you’re very likely to see some exciting wildlife in Alaska.
The following sections cover the varieties of wildlife you may see,
including some distinguishing features, where they’re found, how easy
or difficult they are to find, and whether you need help getting there. For
general safety tips in bear and moose country, see “Getting eaten by a
bear (and such),” earlier in this chapter.
Bald eagle
The bald eagle, the symbol of America, is a huge bird of prey that has
always been quite common and easy to find in Alaska.
 Size: 6- to 71⁄2-foot wing span; 8 to 14 pounds.
 Where to find them: Bald eagles show up over most of the state,
even wheeling around the high-rise hotels in Anchorage. They’re
most common in coastal towns in Southeast and Southcentral
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
120

Alaska, where they feed on fish. In Homer, a woman has long fed
eagles in the wintertime, making that a top viewing site, but eagles
also are common in Seward, Juneau, and Sitka (see Chapters 16, 20,
and 22).
 Easy or hard to spot: Easy. Go to the waterfront and you see them.
 Guided or on your own: You can just take your binoculars to the
beach. If you take a tour-boat ride to see other birds and animals,
you’re likely to see eagles, too.
 ID notes: Bald eagles take five years to mature into their distinctive
white head; younger birds have mottled brown plumage but can be
recognized by their size, shape, and long flight feathers.
Black bear
The smallest, most common, and least dangerous of North American
bears, black bears show up in most of Alaska’s coastal forests; in
Southeast Alaska towns, they’re often pests getting into the garbage.
 Size: 5 feet nose to tail; 200 pounds.
 Where to find them: Locals in coastal communities often know
salmon-spawning streams where bears congregate, or you can
simply stumble over them, even in urban areas.
 Easy or hard to spot: Hard. Without chartering a floatplane to cer-
tain hot spots at certain times, you can’t count on finding black
bears (although you have a decent chance of encountering one
unexpectedly).
 Guided or on your own: Most people don’t focus on black bears. If
you do, you need a knowledgeable floatplane guide to find them
reliably (see the list in the following section).
 ID notes: Black bears are usually pure black, but they can come in
many other colors (even blue or white); you can be sure of distin-
guishing a black bear from a brown bear by noting its smoother
back, bigger ears, and long, straight nose.
Brown bear (grizzly)
Also known as the grizzly bear when found inland, brown bears are
among the largest and most ferocious of all land mammals, and among
the most exciting to see. More than 98 percent of the U.S. brown bear
population is in Alaska.
 Size: Up to 9 feet tall when standing; normally 250 to 900 pounds,
with a maximum of 1,400 pounds.
 Where to find them: Denali National Park (see Chapter 19), Katmai
National Park (see Chapter 24), Kodiak Island (see Chapter 24),
near Homer (see Chapter 16), and Admiralty Island near Juneau
(see Chapter 20).

 Easy or hard to spot: Can be easy. Certain surefire spots on salmon
streams predictably gather many huge bears, but all are expensive
to get to ($400 per person and up). Grizzly sightings are common
but not assured on Denali National Park bus rides for much less
money; these are the smaller inland animals, under 500 pounds.
 Guided or on your own: Denali and Katmai national parks are the
on-your-own options (see Chapters 19 and 24). Other choices are
with fly-in guides — from Homer, Emerald Air Service (% 907-235-
6993; www.emeraldairservice.com); in Kodiak, Sea Hawk Air
(% 800-770-4295; www.seahawkair.com); in Juneau, Alaska Fly
’N’ Fish Charters (% 907-790-2120; www.alaskabyair.com).
 ID notes: Brown bears are generally larger than black bears and
have a humped back and smaller ears.
Caribou
Alaska’s barren-ground caribou are genetically identical to reindeer but
were never domesticated as reindeer were in Europe. For many Alaska
Natives, their huge herds remain an essential source of food and hides.
 Size: 4 feet tall; 200 to 600 pounds.
 Where to find them: On broad tundra areas where you can see a
long way, for example, along northern Interior highways, such as
the Richardson, Dalton, or Denali (see Chapter 18); in Denali
National Park (see Chapter 19); and in the Arctic (see Chapter 23).
 Easy or hard to spot: Hard. Migrations of tens of thousands of ani-
mals take place in remote country that few visitors reach. Near the
road system, caribou are more scattered and they’re shy of
humans. You need some luck.
 Guided or on your own: Backcountry treks sometimes observe
caribou migrations in remote regions of Alaska, but that’s for the
highly committed; for most of us, the best chance is the Denali
National Park shuttle-bus ride.
 ID notes: Unlike other Alaska deer (including moose), caribou
prefer open country and travel in groups, sometimes in herds of
many thousands.
Dall sheep
These sheep, which look like smaller versions of bighorn, stay in high,
rocky places, where their incredible agility keeps them safe from 
predators.
 Size: 3 feet tall (to shoulder); 150 to 300 pounds.
 Where to find them: Dall sheep live in high, craggy mountains over
much of Alaska, but they’re usually difficult to spot. The notable
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
124

exception is on the cliffs along the Seward Highway near Anchorage
(see Chapter 15), where they often venture near the road.
 Easy or hard to spot: Generally hard, but often easy on the Seward
Highway near Anchorage.
 Guided or on your own: Just keep your eyes on the high cliffs and
keep checking white spots you see with your binoculars; no guided
option is available.
 ID notes: Mountain goats use the same habitat as Dall sheep; the
goats have straighter horns and shaggier bodies.
Humpback whales
Behaviors such as feeding by lunging through the surface and leaping
completely out of the water make the huge humpback among the most
spectacular of whales to watch. I’ve seen leaping humpbacks many
times from a sea kayak, from a small boat, and from shore. In Alaska, you
can find them reliably, in beautiful settings, and without many other
boats around.
 Size: 45 feet long; 45 tons.
 Where to find them: Whales usually show up in Sitka Sound near
Sitka and in Glacier Bay (see Chapter 22), and less reliably in
Resurrection Bay and Kenai Fjords National Park near Seward 
(see Chapter 16) and in Prince William Sound near Whittier (see
Chapter 15). Boats from Homer sometimes view whales, too 
(see Chapter 16).
 Easy or hard to spot: Easy, if you’re willing to invest some time and
money. For your best chance of success on any particular day, you
have to spend some money on a tour-boat ride; budget $90 to $175
per person. Seeing humpbacks from a sea kayak requires a bigger
commitment of time and money, plus a little of your own effort.
Spotting them from shore is hit or miss.
 Guided or on your own: Booking a whale-watching boat ride a few
days ahead is easy, and it’s even possible the day of the outing. 
For tours from Whittier, Seward, Homer, Juneau, or Sitka, see
Chapters 15, 16, 20, and 22, respectively.
 ID notes: The shape of the humpback’s back and small dorsal fin
are a giveaway once you’re familiar with the sight. The whales also
have white fins up to 14 feet long that they use to slap the water.
Moose
In winter, when they move to the lowlands, Alaska’s abundant moose
can be pests, blocking roadways and eating expensive shrubbery. In the
summer, they’re a little more elusive, often standing in forest ponds
eating the weeds from the bottom or pruning willows from stream banks
or disturbed roadsides.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 125

 Size: Length 7 to 10 feet; 800 to 1,600 pounds.
 Where to find them: Moose live over much of Alaska but show up
most reliably in the Interior and Southcentral regions. Your best
chance of seeing one is along a road in wet, brushy country.
 Easy or hard to spot: Seeing a moose by design is hard, but it’s a
rare week that goes by at our home in Anchorage when we don’t
run across at least one.
 Guided or on your own: Guided viewing is not available, but you
never know when you may see a moose.
 ID notes: Alaska moose can grow larger than horses, with brown,
shaggy hides, bulbous noses, and heavy antlers.
Musk ox
The musk ox may be the strangest animal you’ll ever see: a big, shaggy
mop of a thing that seems to glide slowly over the tundra. The wool, said
to be one of Earth’s warmest fibers, is gathered from the tundra and knit-
ted by Alaska Native women into exquisite garments.
 Size: 4 to 5 feet tall at the shoulder; 400 to 800 pounds.
 Where to find them: Along the roads that radiate across the tundra
from Nome (see Chapter 23).
 Easy or hard to spot: Getting to Nome is expensive; after you’re
there, finding a musk ox by car isn’t too difficult.
 Guided or on your own: You can rent a car in Nome to explore the
surrounding roads. Private guided tours often can be arranged; ask
at the visitor center.
 ID notes: If you see an animal that looks like it wandered out of a
science-fiction movie, you’re probably observing a musk ox.
Orca (killer whale)
The starkly defined black-and-white patches of the orca seem painted by
their creator to reflect the speed, agility, and fierceness of the ocean’s
top predator. You can easily feel envy when a well-organized family pod
of orcas passes by your boat in calm procession.
 Size: 23 to 27 feet long; 10 tons.
 Where to find them: Resurrection Bay from Seward (see Chap-
ter 16), Prince William Sound from Whittier (see Chapter 15), and
waters near Juneau and Sitka (see Chapter 20).
 Easy or hard to spot: Moderate. Orcas aren’t as predictable in their
feeding locations as humpbacks, but good tour-boat captains often
know where to find the resident pod.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
126

 Guided or on your own: You’ll need to join a tour-boat cruise from
Whittier, Seward, Juneau, or Sitka. If seeing killer whales is your pri-
ority, choose a smaller charter to focus on that goal.
 ID notes: Look for the tall, black dorsal fin.
Polar bear
The polar bear is among the scariest and most dramatic of all animals.
Seeing one is a rare and unforgettable experience shared by few
Alaskans and even fewer visitors. Polar bears, classified as marine mam-
mals, live on the pack ice, north of Alaska, venturing ashore only at cer-
tain times.
 Size: 8 to 10 feet tall when standing on back legs; 400 to 1,200
pounds, with a maximum of 1,500 pounds.
 Where to find them: The only places for visitors to see polar bears
are the villages on the Arctic Ocean coast, the largest of which is
Barrow (see Chapter 23). With luck, you may find them feeding on
bones left by Eskimos after whale hunts.
 Easy or hard to spot: Hard. Going to Barrow is expensive, and you
must arrive at the right time (mid-Oct through June) and even then
you need good luck to see a bear. The tour operators are casual
businesses (see Chapter 23).
 Guided or on your own: You’d better hope you don’t see a polar
bear on your own! Arctic Tours (% 907-852-4512) takes visitors to
Point Barrow in a Humvee for $70 per person, with a two-person
minimum. Arrangements are changeable, however, so call and firm
things up carefully before you go.
 ID notes: The polar bear is unmistakable.
Puffin (and other alcids)
The horned and tufted puffin are the most delightful of seabirds to
encounter, with their large, brightly colored beaks and comedic move-
ments. When you enter their habitat of seaside cliffs, you also find many
other alcids, fascinating birds that live only at sea.
 Size: 14 inches long; 11⁄4 pounds.
 Where to find them: Kenai Fjords National Park, Homer (see
Chapter 16), and Sitka (see Chapter 22).
 Easy or hard to spot: Easy during the summer season on a boat
tour to the bird rookeries.
 Guided or on your own: For a good chance of seeing puffins, you
need to get to the rocky, offshore bird colonies on Alaska’s south-
ern coast. A tour boat is the best opportunity, with Kenai Fjords
National Park leading the list (see Chapter 16). You can also see
puffins on a sea-kayaking tour (see “Sea-kayaking” earlier in this
chapter), with less certainty of success.
Chapter 9: Planning an Outdoor Adventure 127

 ID notes: If you see a bird that looks like a small penguin with a
toucan’s beak, you’ve probably found a puffin. Horned puffins are
the more familiar kind; tufted puffins have tufts of feathers curling
back from their heads.
Sea otter
The charming sea otter is quite common in coastal Alaska, rarely war-
ranting a second glance from locals. Otters usually put up with close
inspection as they float on their backs, using their tummies as tables for
shellfish or to carry their young.
 Size: Up to 4 feet long; 40 to 90 pounds.
 Where to find them: All coastal waters off rocky shores; most
common in Prince William Sound (see Chapter 15) and near 
Sitka (see Chapter 22), Juneau (see Chapter 20), Seward (see
Chapter 16), Homer (see Chapter 16), Kodiak (see Chapter 24), 
and other shoreside communities.
 Easy or hard to spot: Easy. Often you don’t even need to leave the
dock, and you can expect a good look on a tour boat or sea-kayak
ride.
 Guided or on your own: Otters live in the ocean, where you need
help to get to them. Any of the tour boats or sea-kayaking guides in
this book can help you spot them.
 ID notes: You can tell otters from the seals and sea lions that are
common in the same waters by their legs (the others have flip-
pers); even when the legs aren’t showing, more of the otter shows
above the surface.
Wolf
Unlike other parts of the United States, wild wolf populations in Alaska
are plentiful, yet the animals are shy around humans, and sightings are a
rare treat.
 Size: 31⁄2 to 61⁄2 feet long; 75 to 145 pounds.
 Where to find them: Denali National Park (see Chapter 19) and
other mountain tundra areas with long views, such as along the
Richardson or Denali highways (see Chapter 18). Wolves live all
over Alaska, but they’re hard to see in brush or trees.
 Easy or hard to spot: Very hard. Wolves don’t like to show them-
selves. You need to be able to see a long way to have any chance of
sighting a pack.
 Guided or on your own: Any wolf sightings are likely to be fleeting,
lucky glimpses. Although wolf numbers are low in Denali National
Park, conditions on the shuttle-bus rides are good for making 
sightings.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
128

 ID notes: I’ve seen wolves, yes, but I’ve heard them more often;
listen for the howl during quiet outings in the evening, such as
while hiking or cross-country skiing.
Choosing an Activity-Based Escorted Tour
If scheduling an outdoor vacation in Alaska on your own seems intimi-
dating, an easier way is available: Book an outdoor escorted tour, a
group exploration of some of the state’s best activities and wildlife-
viewing with a guide to take care of all the details. These trips are
escorted samplers of places and activities, with everything included
except your travel to the starting point. The companies that offer them
know that the itineraries work and have polished the outings along the
way to appeal to the majority of their guests. On the downside, you
don’t get to choose each stop or linger longer than the group. (For more
on escorted tours, see Chapter 6.)
 Alaska Wildland Adventures (% 800-334-8730; www.alaska
wildland.com) pioneered the “Alaska safari,” a highway tour from
lodge to lodge, with fishing, rafting, wildlife-viewing, and the like
scheduled along the way. Alaska Wildland owns an outstanding
fishing lodge on the Kenai River and another on a remote lake, in
addition to other high-quality facilities. Trips concentrate on
Southcentral Alaska and Denali. Guides tend to be young and
enthusiastic. Packages include choices for varying interests, as 
well as tours aimed at families with teens and even for children as
young as 6. It’s not a cheap way to travel, however; a ten-day safari
costs about $6,000 per person, although shorter trips cost less.
 Alaska Discovery (% 800-586-1911; www.akdiscovery.com) offers
trips in Southeast Alaska similar to those in the preceding item for
comparable per-day prices. These are called “Inn-to-Inn Tours.” The
company is best known for more rigorous outdoor adventures and
has superb guides for activities.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Finding your lodging options
 Reserving in plenty of time
 Getting a good rate
 Using the Internet
T
he room you sleep in isn’t the most important factor in determining
how much you enjoy your trip, but it certainly is close to the top of
the list. Relaxing can be difficult unless you are comfortable, feel safe
and clean, and have at least the amenities you’re used to at home.
Beyond those minimums, a room can add something to your vacation,
giving you some insight into why living in Alaska is so worthwhile.
Alaska offers plenty of places that meet the first set of needs: It has all
the chain hotels you already know, with the comfort and predictability
that make them reassuring. But those places are guaranteed to miss on
the second criteria, so I recommend very few of them. Instead, I’ve
looked hard for lodging that can add to your experience of Alaska, and
perhaps become one of its most memorable parts.
Getting to Know Your Options
Authentically Alaskan accommodations come in different flavors.
Wilderness lodges are the best, but they cost a lot ($300 or more per
person, per night, all-inclusive), they’re often expensive to get to, and
they usually have minimum stays of three days or more (which you
probably won’t mind, given the investment you put into getting to the
lodge). Unfortunately, most of us can’t afford $2,000 or more for three
nights. However, many inns and bed-and-breakfasts and some specialty

hotels can also add to your feel for Alaska, and save money over strictly
anonymous accommodations. I’ve also included lodgings with suites and
cooking facilities, even when they don’t have loads of character: These
can be a godsend for families or large parties. In all cases, except as
noted for the wilderness lodges, the rates I quote are for a standard
room with two people in it during the high season.
Like other destinations in the United States, Alaska is going smoke-free.
Hotels usually still offer some smoking rooms, especially in small towns,
where smoking is still common, but many B&Bs and lodges have no-
smoking policies. Finding lodgings that take pets is difficult and often
those that do aren’t places I would recommend.
Table 10-1 explains the price ranges I’ve assigned to the lodgings
reviewed in this book, and what you can expect in each category.
Table 10-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
What to Expect
$
$100 or less
Stay here if saving money is your overriding con-
cern. Expect a small hotel room in an old building,
or a simple bed-and-breakfast room with a shared
bathroom.
$$
$101–$130
In smaller Alaska towns, this rate will buy you a
basic but attractive room or a good B&B room
with its own bathroom. In the large cities, rooms
at this price are still in the budget category.
$$$
$131–$165
You sacrifice nothing to stay here. Hotel rooms
will have all the usual conveniences, perhaps in a
smaller, independent establishment. B&B rooms
should be well-appointed.
$$$$
$166–$210
Falling in this price range are the larger, full-
service hotels, often with extra amenities and
central locations. Also expect to pay this much for
a luxury B&B with some special attraction or lots
of extras.
$$$$$
$211 or more
The best luxury hotels charge more than this
amount, as do all wilderness lodges that include
meals or guiding in a single price. At elite wilder-
ness lodges, prices can top $500 per person per
night (so far beyond most travelers’ reach that I
haven’t included any in this book).
Chapter 10: Booking Your Accommodations 131

Bed-and-breakfasts
I can offer some sensible reasons for staying at B&Bs but few reasons for
avoiding them.
You don’t have to worry about being stuck in Junior’s room in an other-
wise ordinary family home. Although you can still find some places like
that, I don’t list them in this book, and they’re easy to steer clear of.
Most B&Bs do have hosts who live there, but the rooms usually have 
the amenities (and twice the charm) of an ordinary hotel room, with a
smaller bathroom and perhaps a small TV. These hosts are great assets
when visiting a place like Alaska. They have stories to tell about bear
and moose encounters (everyone has plenty of these), and they can pro-
vide lots of advice for your trip. At best, they’ll make you feel like you
have friends in Alaska.
The other important benefit of staying at a B&B is the significant money
you’ll save. Rates are often $30 to $50 less than for a comparable room 
in a hotel, and the inclusion of breakfast saves you another $20 (for a
couple). Expect to pay about $130 per night.
If you’re vacationing with children or you have a disability, don’t choose
a B&B unless you first question the proprietor about whether you’ll be
comfortable in the rooms. B&Bs often have narrow stairs or small rooms
that may not be suitable for you.
Hotels
Good, inexpensive hotel rooms can be found in Alaska’s cities, but not
easily and not with many choices. Instead, you’ll find a variety of stan-
dard hotel rooms (with an interior hallway and the expected amenities)
with a wide range of prices. At the top of the list are the luxury hotels in
the larger cities, which are often found in the town’s tallest buildings.
These rooms usually cost more than $200 a night. The next tier down
consists of good, comfortable places that are often found in smaller
buildings. Some of these establishments are operated by particular
owners who keep the quality top-notch. These rooms rent for $165 to
$185 a night. Next are the budget lodgings, which are usually found in
older buildings, with small rooms and perhaps less-desirable addresses.
I’ve found the good ones, where dedicated people offer decent rooms for
a reasonable price. They charge $120 to $140 per night.
Wilderness lodge look-alikes
Another category of hotels, which may be unique to Alaska, are hotels
impersonating wilderness lodges. A real Alaskan wilderness lodge, even
a very expensive one, generally has plenty of rough edges that add to
the authentic frontier atmosphere. Operating way out in the boonies,
with difficult transportation, a short season, and a staff that has to 
live on-site, wilderness lodges have to charge enough to make it. But 
in recent years, some beautifully built midsize hotels and inns that are
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
132

situated on the road system have taken on a wilderness-lodge persona,
with good results. They cost much less than a remote lodge, although
they still aren’t cheap ($200–$250 double).
Knowing When to Reserve
Recent, extensive hotel construction has made rooms easier to find in
Alaska cities, but not the special ones that I aim to put you into. The new
rooms are all in chain hotels; if that’s what you’re after, your favorite
brand is probably here, and you can probably book it fairly easily on the
Internet or through the hotel’s toll-free number a week or two ahead (see
the Quick Concierge for contact information).
If you want something interesting or unique, coming to Alaska during the
summer high season without your rooms booked a month or two in
advance is unwise. You’ll get a place to sleep somewhere, but you may
go through plenty of trouble to find it — and it won’t be anyone’s first
choice.
Lodgings that I recommend often book earliest because they’re the best,
so it makes sense to start reserving the minute you set the dates for
your trip (six months should be adequate). Before June or after August,
rooms are much easier to reserve; you usually can have your choice
with little advance notice. The exceptions are around the Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race, in early March, and through the winter at a pair 
of resorts — Alyeska Resort and Chena Hot Springs Resort (see Chap-
ters 15 and 17, respectively) — which have wintertime peak seasons.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Some hotels publish rack rates — the public rates that are really their
maximums — without intending to charge anyone that price. I’ve run
into hotel managers who try to keep the rack rate a secret, because they
know it’s outrageous and nobody pays it anyway: Everyone who comes
in the door qualifies for a discount. But other lodgings, especially
smaller establishments and budget places, really mean the rates they
publish. Here are some tips on requesting a better rate and knowing
when not to try.
Shop early for peak times
As your date nears and rooms book up, you have fewer choices, and that
means you have to pay more. If you’re coming to Alaska between mid-June
and mid-August, January is not too early to be on the phone shopping
among lodgings for the best prices and accommodations. Proprietors love
early bookings and may be willing to compete for your business, espe-
cially when you let them know you’re shopping around for the best price.
Chapter 10: Booking Your Accommodations 133

Travel off-peak
Rates crash like a bear stock market when the season starts winding
down; big, luxury hotels often charge less than half their peak rates
during the off season, putting them in competition with the cheapest
budget lodgings. Rooms stand empty, so you can show up at the desk
and ask for their best deal, ready to walk next door if they don’t go low
enough. You can sometimes use these same tactics to get killer deals at
the big, package-tour hotels at Denali and elsewhere on the day of your
stay, even during high season, because gaps between groups sometimes
leave them with blocks of empty rooms. But you’ll be gambling if you
count on this happening.
Ask for discounts
Hotels (but not usually B&Bs and small inns) usually offer various dis-
counts for people with travel-club or other memberships, and some
offer automatic discounts to anyone who asks. I’ve tried telling reserva-
tionists that I want the corporate or AAA discount, even though I don’t
qualify; sometimes they laugh and say, “Sure,” sometimes I just get a
“No.” It never hurts to ask. You’re more likely to be able to dicker this
way with a small hotel where the person you’re talking to actually has
some authority rather than when you’re talking to a call center for a
large chain. Some small places don’t have discount programs, but you
can still ask for a discount, especially if the rate isn’t already low. For
example, B&Bs sometimes will knock something off the price when you
stay more than one night or when you offer to pay cash. But don’t count
on it, and don’t push it when they say no, because you can sour your
relationship from the start.
Don’t stop with the Internet
Using Web sites to shop for prices is great, but you may be able to do
better if you follow up on the establishment’s own Web site or call
directly. Sometimes you can get a Web special, extra airline mileage, or
other deals by contacting a hotel yourself (this works for rental cars and
airline tickets, too). Check out the “Booking Rooms Online” section, later
in this chapter, for more helpful info.
Book a package tour
Package tours, whether escorted or unescorted, often offer significant
savings over the a la carte approach to booking hotels. The big hotels at
Denali National Park have set their rates very high to accentuate the
value they give customers on their escorted packages, who make up 
virtually the entire clientele. (See Chapter 6 for more about booking
packages.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
134

Don’t worry about it
If the thought of all this checking and calling and dickering makes you
tired, don’t fret over it. Some people ruin their vacations worrying about
how much they’ve paid for things (I know — I get letters from some of
them.) The point is: Did you have a good time? Did you stay within your
budget? If so, you got a good deal.
Booking Rooms Online
The Internet is a great way to find out about a hotel or B&B and to check
availability and going rates. Virtually every hotel and B&B has its own
Web site, and you can discover a lot about an establishment from what
you see there (and from what you don’t). But making a choice without
knowing more than what the proprietor wants to tell you can lead to dis-
appointment. I’ve checked out all the accommodations listed in this
book, but if you want find other choices with guidance from people who
have actually been there, use a travel Web site that offers user ratings.
The sites are agents for many hotels at once, listing many more options
than any travel book can, and sometimes you can even get a better rate
from a third-party Web site than from the establishment itself.
Because travel Web sites are not discriminating in the accommodations
they list, you can easily book yourself into a dive if you don’t read the user
comments. The sites also have had problems in Alaska with listing places
together that are geographically unreasonable alternatives, although they
seem to be improving on that point. To spot-check them, I reviewed
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Hotels.com, Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), searching for hotel rooms in
Anchorage for the same span of nights. As always with these sites, the
choices and rates that came up were similar but not identical, with one or
two great deals that you could find only on one or two sites. Travelocity
had the most choices. All four sites have user ratings, which flagged the
bad choices and seemed accurate for the good ones, too, but Orbitz didn’t
have enough ratings for that system to work well. Don’t book a room with-
out recent, authentic user ratings to back up your choice, unless the hotel
is part of a chain that you already trust. Few of the best B&Bs and interest-
ing small inns were listed on any of the sites.
For those places with local color, try an Alaska-based Web site. Before
discussing lodging choices in cities and regions covered elsewhere in the
book, I provide Web sites that link with associations or bookers of local
B&Bs or small inns. The best site for these places on a statewide basis 
is Alaska.org. I’m also impressed by Inn Site: The Internet Directory of
Bed & Breakfasts (www.innsite.com), which lists many of the best
places all across the state (and around the world) and provides links to
each establishment’s own site.

the place is pretty much ready with services that cater to just

those services.
Vacationing in Alaska with Children
Even though my name appears on the title page, I think of my travel
books as a family project. When I researched my first Alaska travel book,
my son, Robin, was 3, and my daughter, Julia, was 6 months. Today,
Robin is 17, Julia is 13, Joseph is 9, and Becky is 7. You may run into us
at a campground or on a boat dock anywhere in Alaska as we travel to
research our next guidebook. (If we see you carrying the book, we’ll
introduce ourselves.) Yes, it’s a great job, and bringing the family along
is the best part.
Alaska’s magnificent scenery is something that even young children can
understand and appreciate. Also, an Alaska vacation is largely spent out-
doors, which is where kids like to be. Children never get enough ferry-
riding, boating, or camping, and the older ones especially enjoy hiking,
canoeing, sea-kayaking, skiing, and dog-mushing. Alaska makes good
sense for families if you do your homework.

Tackling the challenges
Alaska does have drawbacks as a family destination. It’s expensive.
Some activities, such as flightseeing and tour-boat cruises, tend to have
less-than-generous children’s discounts and cost too much for most fam-
ilies. Hotel rooms and restaurant meals in Alaska cost a lot for a sizable
family (though I include some family-friendly listings throughout this
book and mark them with a Kid Friendly icon). Often, bed-and-breakfast
rooms are too small for a family. Although camping solves many of these
problems, getting your camping gear to Alaska is a logistical challenge.
For tips on doing so, see Chapter 12. (I don’t review campgrounds in this
book. A book that covers all of Alaska’s campgrounds in detail is
Traveler’s Guide to Alaskan Camping, by Mike and Terri Church, pub-
lished by Rolling Homes Press.)
Most parents know to plan the necessities, such as food and lodging,
when traveling with children, but for an Alaska trip you should also
think carefully about your itinerary and activities. Alaska’s highways are
long, and children require a gradual approach to covering a lot of
ground. They also need time to play, explore, and rest. Children often
don’t enjoy wildlife-watching. Searching for the animals takes a long
time, and when you do find them, they’re usually off in the distance.
Kids 7 and under often don’t have the visual skills or patience to pick
out the animals from the landscape and can get bored quickly, even
when they can see the animals. The “Keeping kids happy on the road”
section, later in this chapter, includes some ideas that I’ve picked up
over years of traveling the state with my kids that may help keep your
kids engaged during your trip.
Though your kids will likely love the outdoors as much as you will, don’t
overtax them with excessively long walks and hiking trips. Keep track of
the longest hike you’ve managed without excessive whining, and then
try to extend that record just a little bit each time out. If your kids aren’t
accustomed to hiking, try taking them on a few hikes at home to help
them (and you) build stamina for the trip. Short sea-kayaking excur-
sions, on the other hand, are great for children who are old enough,
riding in the front of a double-seat boat with a parent in back. In prac-
tice, the age limit depends on the outfitter and your child’s level of
responsibility.
If you’re like most families, you’ll be getting on each other’s nerves after
a few weeks on the road. Our family makes it through those tough
moments by leaving time for low-key kid activities monitored by one
adult, such as beachcombing and playing in the park, while the other
grown-up splits off for a museum visit, shopping, or a special, more
expensive activity. Of course, if you want to preserve your marriage,
you’ll have to be scrupulously fair about who gets to go flightseeing and
who has to stay behind and change diapers, because you won’t have my
all-purpose excuse: research.
Chapter 11: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 137

Finding a family-friendly package
I wouldn’t recommend a typical escorted package trip for a family with
young children. A scripted tour on a motorcoach will bore any child 
who needs activity and spontaneity to be happy. Better to get the kids
outdoors — which is possible with a specially designed package.
Alaska Wildland Adventures (% 800-334-8730; www.alaskawildland.
com) has various trips for kids as young as 12, and can take children as
young as 6 for a package of day activities based at their Kenai Riverside
Lodge. The package, called the “Kenai Explorer,” is flexible in length and
geared to families, offering games and kid-oriented guides. The shortest,
2-night, 3-day version is $975 adults, $900 children 7 and over. Alaska
Discovery (% 800-586-1911; www.akdiscovery.com) takes children as
young as 12 on some of its extended Southeast Alaska sea-kayaking
trips, which start at $895 for three days and two nights, and welcomes
younger children on its non-camping trips.
In addition, the cruise-ship industry is courting families, and many ships
offer fun activities for children. Some cruise lines even have programs
that take the kids off your hands for a while — something that both chil-
dren and parents enjoy. (See Chapter 8 for cruise lines that offer child-
oriented programs.)
Keeping kids happy on the road
My wife and I have taken trips with our children that no sane person
would attempt — all over Alaska and all over the United States, for as
long as seven weeks at a time; we’ve even spent two weeks all alone in
the remote wilderness with three kids and a baby. We’ve enjoyed all our
trips. One reason, besides having great kids, is that we’ve learned the
importance of adjusting our plans and our behavior to our children’s
needs. Here are some of our discoveries:
 Keep consistent mealtimes. This is the most important factor to
keeping your crew happy. Carry food with you in case you can’t
make it to a restaurant when your regular lunch, dinner, or after-
noon snack time arrives. Make no exceptions. Hungry people get
grumpy and irrational, and then everything falls apart.
 Don’t compromise on nutrition when you’re traveling. If you nor-
mally eat junk all the time, okay. But if you have a healthy diet at
home, don’t stop now. With the stress of traveling, your kids need
good food more than ever. Pass on the burger in a box in favor of a
healthy, real restaurant meal or a picnic.
 Choose rooms with cooking facilities. You’ll go crazy if you eat
three meals a day in restaurants with children for your whole trip.
You can save money and time — and reduce stress — by staying in
for breakfast and an occasional lunch or dinner.

 Remember Alaska’s long summer days. We don’t sweat bedtime in
the summer, and neither do most of the Alaskan parents we know.
The Alaskan sky stays light late at night and everyone is energized.
Getting to bed early is hard for kids and adults.
 Leave time for fun and spontaneity. Often, when driving a highway
in Alaska, you may see a place where you’re tempted to just jump
out of the car and romp in the heather. What a shame if you’re in a
rush to get somewhere and can’t stop.
 Don’t overdo it. One big activity a day is enough.
 Bring toys and activities — but just a few — and then buy more as
you go. Hold back some fresh toys for tough times. New toys are a
lot more fun than old ones. Your toy bag can also include crayons,
pencils, pads of paper, stickers, pipe cleaners, cards, magnetic
checkers, picture books, coloring books, activity books, and maps.
Bring little prizes to make car games more exciting. If you’re care-
ful, you can fit all this in one small backpack a child can carry.
 Consider entertainment. Bring an inexpensive personal music
player with headphones for each child with a collection of music or
recorded stories. Kids enjoy listening to something that no one else
can hear. Buy some new audiobooks to break out on the way when
the going gets rough. What about video entertainment? Our kids do
watch iPods and occasionally DVDs on long, routine drives, but I
don’t think I’d do that on a scenic drive where looking out the
window is a big reason you’re traveling.
 Craft a family journal. Make a journal of your trip by buying post-
cards everywhere you go (even gas stations) for your children to
put in a cheap photo album or otherwise make into a book. They
can write on the back of the postcards, or draw pictures, and put
them in the album. Rearranging, editing, and showing off the book
uses up a lot of time. And when you get home, it’s a good souvenir.
 Create a personal journal. Our children have always kept journals
every night when traveling or at our summer cabin, even when they
were too young to write. (They drew pictures and dictated words.)
At the beginning of the summer, each child picks out a good bound
journal that they really value. Journal time is a wonderfully quiet
evening ritual and a good prelude to bedtime. Barbara and I are
always surprised at which experiences the children think are impor-
tant enough to mention, and their teachers are pleased at how their
writing skills improve over the summer. In the fall, the kids proudly
show off their work to their grandparents and classes at school. For
us, the old journals have become treasured keepsakes.
 Take this time to get to know your kids again. Talk to them, read
to them, and take advantage of learning about a new place together.

Traveling as Senior Citizens
People 65 and over make up a fourth of all visitors to Alaska. Most 
of the people coming over the road or by ferry are retired, presumably
because they have the time to make the trip. So there’s nothing “special”
about an older visitor to Alaska; indeed, whatever way you come, you’ll
often find yourself with people your own age. Consequently, facilities are
used to dealing with senior citizens, and won’t be surprised to hear your
request for reduced-admission prices for seniors, which many Alaska
attractions offer.
The National Park Service offers a senior free admission and discount
program to those 62 or over under the ungainly name America the
Beautiful–National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass–Senior
Pass (formerly called the Golden Age Passport). The pass is good for
lifetime free entrance to national parks, monuments, historic sites, recre-
ation areas, and national wildlife refuges for a one-time processing fee of
$10. If you have a pass, make sure to mention it when making shuttle or
camping reservations at Denali National Park, because otherwise park
attendants will automatically add the entrance fee to your bill. The pass
does not give a discount on concession-offered services such as the
Denali shuttle. Buy the pass in person at any park that charges an
entrance fee. For more information, go to www.nps.gov/fees_passes.
htm or call the U.S. Geological Survey (% 888-275-8747), which issues
the passes.
Most towns have a senior center where you’ll find activities and help
with any special needs. The Anchorage Senior Center (% 907-258-7823;
www.anchorageseniorcenter.org) offers guidance for visitors, as well
as use of the restaurant and fitness room, a gift shop, and a chance to
meet locals. Dances are held most Friday nights.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) operates many
weeklong Alaska learning vacations for groups of people 55 and older. 
A catalog of tour and program options is available on the Web site.
ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group
yacht cruises in Alaska to off-the-beaten-path ports, with sea-kayaking
and hiking in remote spots, as well as adventure travel to many destina-
tions around the world for travelers 50 and older.
Accessing Alaska: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Today, finding a hotel without rooms accessible for people with disabili-
ties is rare, and even some B&Bs have made the necessary adjustments.
The results often are the best rooms in the house. Make sure to ask for
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
140

the special rooms when making reservations, and question smaller
establishments closely about exactly what accessible means to them.
People with permanent disabilities can get a free lifetime pass to
National Parks and many other federal public lands and a 50 percent dis-
count on some camping fees and the like. Apply in person at any facility
such as a park that charges an entrance fee. You’ll need to show proof of
a medically determined disability. Other details (including the program’s
absurdly long name) are the same as those listed for the elders’ pass in
the previous section (except this one ends with “Access Pass,” instead
of “Senior Pass”).
Resources for Gays and Lesbians
Anchorage, Juneau, and Fairbanks have active gay and lesbian communi-
ties. In Anchorage, Identity (www.identityinc.org) offers referrals,
publishes a newsletter called Northview, sponsors activities throughout
the year, and operates a gay and lesbian helpline (% 888-901-9876). The
June Pridefest includes a parade and picnic, among other events. The
Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Anchorage is at 336 E. 5th Ave.
(% 907-929-4528).
Gays and lesbians can find some Alaska B&Bs and tours specifically 
marketing to them. For example, Olivia Travel (% 800-631-6277; www.
olivia.com) typically brings a lesbian cruise to Alaska each summer,
with well-known entertainers onboard. In Fairbanks, a small company
specializes in outdoor tours and backcountry trips for gays and lesbians;
it’s called Out in Alaska (% 877-347-9958; www.outinalaska.com).

eady to go? Have you asked someone to feed the cat?
The little details can be the ones that trip you up. For example, I’ve cre-
ated a conundrum by suggesting throughout this book that you do a lot
outdoors in Alaska but also recommending that most visitors fly. So how
do you get your gear to Alaska on a plane when it won’t fit in the over-
head bin or under the seat? I have some handy solutions to this prob-
lem, along with some other practical information to help you out.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Several kinds of travel insurance are available, ranging in value from
essential to rip-off; I cover the differences in the following sections.
Buying any sort of travel insurance is easy: Go to www.insuremy
trip.com. The site allows travelers to get quotes from many insurance
companies at once by providing the dates of the trip, the amount and
type of coverage, and the age of the travelers. To contact a reputable
firm directly, try one of the following: Access America (% 866-807-3982;
www.accessamerica.com), Travel Guard International (% 800-826-
4919; www.travelguard.com), Travel Insured International (% 800-
243-3174; www.travelinsured.com), and Travelex Insurance Services
(% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).

Trip-cancellation insurance
If you’ve already made many of your reservations, you’ve probably put
down a lot of money in deposits. Alaska tour operators, guides, lodges,
and bed-and-breakfasts all make this demand, and often with more rigor-
ous refund requirements than you may be used to. These deposits are
nonrefundable after a certain date. The reasons are understandable:
Alaskans in the tourism industry have only two or three months to make
a year’s income, so they can’t afford any significant number of no-shows
that leave them with empty rooms or seats. But what if you get sick or
bad weather intervenes and you can’t get there? Or what if your airline
goes bankrupt or a catastrophe prevents travel? You lose your deposits
and your vacation. Trip-cancellation insurance protects you against that
dreadful possibility for around 5 percent to 7 percent of the cost of the
trip. Given the uncertainty of Alaska travel, I think this insurance is
worth the price.
The Alaska travel-planning industry has been hit by several large fraud
cases and many smaller incidents in recent years. Being cautious about
whom you do business with is always wise, but in one case a large, main-
stream operator turned out to be a fraudulent house of cards. Besides
insurance, you can protect yourself by paying for everything — includ-
ing the insurance — with a credit card. You can get your money back on
goods and services not received if you report the loss within 60 days
after the charge is listed on your credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to remote or
high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip or can arrange
insurance policies through a partnering provider, a convenient and often
cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain insurance. But this option
entails higher risk than buying the insurance yourself from a third party.
If the company you’ve bought your trip from fails, you’ll have a harder
time recovering your money if it is also your insurer. In addition, I’ve
encountered policies that exclude coverage of trips by a referring com-
pany. As always, it pays to read the fine print, and for the greatest secu-
rity buy your insurance independently of buying your trip.
Medical insurance
Medical insurance for travelers from outside the United States is a
worthwhile investment, but it probably doesn’t make sense for most
travelers from the United States, who likely are already covered under
their regular health insurance. However, if you’re heading into remote
areas on your own, check to make sure you’re covered for medical evac-
uation should you get sick or be injured. A medevac flight can easily
exceed $10,000.
Also, if you belong to an HMO, check to see whether you’re fully covered
while away from home.
Chapter 12: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 143

International visitors should make health-insurance arrangements before
traveling to the U.S. Good policies will cover the costs of an accident,
repatriation, or death. Packages such as Europ Assistance’s Worldwide
Healthcare Plan are sold by European automobile clubs and travel agen-
cies at attractive rates. Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc. (% 800-777-
8710; www.worldwideassistance.com) is the agent for Europ Assistance
in the United States.
Lost-luggage insurance
Insurance on your baggage is included in most travel-insurance plans. If
not, consider the pros and cons of a separate policy. Your baggage is
often covered under your homeowners’ policy or credit card benefits,
but that coverage may expose you to high deductibles or sneaky exclu-
sions, so read the fine print carefully and, if relying on a card, make sure
to use that card for everything relevant to the coverage. If an airline
loses or damages your bags, it’s usually responsible for up to $2,500 per
passenger on domestic flights or, on international flights, up to approxi-
mately $635 per checked bag, excluding expensive items such as jewelry
and cameras. Good luck getting the airline to actually pay in a reason-
able period of time, however — it’s notoriously difficult. The simplest
course is to leave valuables at home or carry them with you, insuring
your baggage only if justified by the worth that you can prove. You need
to establish the value of your lost clothing and such with bills of sale or
similar documentation for each item.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the air-
port, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The air-
lines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house
or destination free of charge.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. Some
readers, however, refuse to follow this advice. (In fact, I’ve been known
to pick up a bug on a trip now and then.)
The obvious things you do at home to avoid getting sick are even more
important on a trip, because you’ll be exposed to many more pathways
to pick up germs. Passing through airports, eating in restaurants, and
visiting attractions all put you in contact with more people than a
normal day at home. Washing your hands frequently is the most impor-
tant defense, especially before eating anything at all. The Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) recommends carrying a waterless hand sanitizer
such as Purell and using it as you travel. It’s also important to avoid get-
ting exhausted by jet lag and over-filled days under the midnight sun.
Tired people get sick more easily.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
144

Visitors who come to Alaska on cruise ships or spend time on escorted
bus tours should be especially careful. These closely contained groups
are ripe breeding grounds for the spread of infectious disease, especially
the miserable Norovirus, which causes vomiting for a day or two but
remains contagious long after the symptoms have passed. You can pick
up the bug from a doorknob or railing, and hand washing is the only
defense. The CDC offers a health Web site for travelers, which includes
sanitation ratings for the ships, and much other useful information, at
wwwn.cdc.gov/travel.
You’ll find modern, full-service hospitals in each of Alaska’s larger cities,
and even in some small towns that act as regional centers. There’s some
kind of clinic even in the smallest towns, although they often are staffed
by physicians’ assistants rather than medical doctors. I’ve listed the
addresses and phone numbers for medical facilities in each destination
under “Fast Facts.” Call those numbers, too, for referrals to a dentist or
other health professional. In an emergency, call % 911.
For domestic trips, most healthcare plans provide coverage if you get
sick away from home. For information on purchasing additional medical
insurance for your trip, see the “Medical insurance” section, earlier in
this chapter.
If health is a particular concern, consider joining MedicAlert (% 888-
ID-ALERT [888-432-5378]; www.medicalert.org) and wearing their
engraved bracelet, which will inform emergency medical personnel of a
primary preexisting medical condition and provide them with access to
the organization’s response center for your information on file, such as
medications and physician and family contacts. The cost is $40 for the
first year, and then $25 a year after that.
For information on safety during Alaskan outdoor activities, see 
Chapter 9.
Reserving Activities, Restaurants, and Shows
After you’ve reserved your flight, car, and room, you’re finished planning
your vacation — if you plan to spend the trip sitting in a room and a car,
that is. The highlights of an Alaska trip are the activities: fishing, wildlife-
watching, flightseeing, and the like. Make reservations for most of these
activities at least a few days in advance; for others (such as the Denali
National Park bus tour), you should make reservations as soon as you
know your vacation schedule. I let you know which activities need more
advanced reservations in the destination chapters in this book. A few of
the best restaurants also require advance reservations, and if you want
to catch a popular performing-arts event, you should check schedules
before you leave home.
Chapter 12: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 145

Booking your activities
As a general rule, the larger your party is relative to the size of the entire
group on the outing, the more important reservations become. If you
want to fish, sea-kayak, or take a bear-viewing flight on a certain day —
all activities that involve four to ten people per outing — reserve at least
a few days ahead, and preferably a few weeks ahead, to make sure you
get to do what you want on the day you’re ready to do it. If your party is
larger than three, make reservations even further in advance.
Likewise, if your vacation is short, reserve everything ahead. On a quick
trip, you don’t have flexibility in your schedule to adjust for booked-up
activities. Besides, spending valuable vacation time on the phone trying
to line things up at the last minute is a real drag.
When you call to reserve, always check for cancellation policies in case
of bad weather so that you’re not faced with the choice between losing a
deposit and going on a seasickness-inducing or scary ride.
If possible, set up your itinerary so that it includes an extra day after
each weather-dependent activity. Even in summertime, weather often
stops or disrupts outdoor activities, especially on the water. Guides,
boat captains, and pilots won’t endanger you by going out in bad
weather, but they may make you miserable on a tossing boat or bumpy
aircraft, with reduced visibility due to driving rain. Suppose you don’t
want to go out in such marginal weather but the tour is going anyway.
Despite your (reasonable) decision, the operator may decline to give
you your money back, because the tour hasn’t been cancelled. However,
most operators will rebook you for the next day, because they still get
paid that way. Having that extra day available means you get to go, and
it saves your deposit.
Certain activities are so difficult to book and so important to a great trip
that you should, if possible, plan your trip around them. Make the hard-
to-get reservation first so that you have flexibility to accept any avail-
able dates. Then fill in your itinerary with that one date locked in. If you
can adjust the dates of your entire vacation, you’ll have an even better
chance of doing the most popular activities.
Here are the main activities ranked by how quickly you need to act. I
don’t list activities included in package tours or multi-day adventures,
which are also integral to setting up your trip. (For activities without
chapter references, see area-specific chapters for more information.)
 Reserve as early as possible:
• Permit-limited bear-viewing hot spots, including Brooks
Camp at Katmai National Park (see Chapter 24) and Pack
Creek on Admiralty Island in Tongass National Forest (see
Chapter 20)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
146

• Early morning Denali National Park shuttle-bus rides (see
Chapter 19)
• White Pass & Yukon Route rail tickets (see Chapter 21)
• Guided river fishing during run peaks (the only time you
should fish for salmon)
 Reserve a week or two ahead:
• Sea-kayaking and ocean charter fishing
• Fly-in fishing
• Mount McKinley flightseeing from Talkeetna (see Chapter 19)
• Helicopter flightseeing in Juneau (see Chapter 20)
• Dog-mushing and snowmobiling during peak periods (Feb
and Mar)
 Reserve a few days ahead:
• Whale-watching and tour-boat outings (on large boats)
• Most flightseeing outings
• River-rafting
• Rental equipment such as bikes and canoes
• Town tours and other bus tours
 No need to reserve:
• Museums and other public facilities
• Hiking and self-guided outdoor activities
• Skiing
Reserving a table at restaurants
Just a few of the best restaurants in Anchorage fill up all reasonable
dining hours on weekends several days in advance. If you plan on some
special meals, read the listings in this book and call ahead to make sure
that you can get a table at any that say, “Reservations recommended.”
Getting performing-arts reservations
Some events are aimed specifically at tourists, including gold-rush melo-
dramas, dramatic Robert Service poetry recitations, and films about
wildlife or the aurora. You generally don’t need to reserve these activi-
ties ahead, unless I note otherwise in my descriptions in each chapter.
If you’re interested in something a bit more sophisticated, consider
attending a performance with the locals. Although winter is the busy
season for concerts and theater, you can catch shows in the summer,
too. Make your evenings more interesting by checking out what will be
Chapter 12: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 147

showing and arranging your schedule to attend a live performance.
Check Chapter 3 for major happenings such as the Sitka Summer Music
Festival. The Web site or phone number of the festival itself is the best
place to find event times and tickets.
For complete listings of performing-arts, spectator sports, community
activities, and the like, local Web sites are the best source. Here are the
best of these for Alaska’s three largest towns:
 Anchorage: The Anchorage Daily News produces an extensive
entertainment section in the Friday edition; the calender is exhaus-
tive (www.adn.com/play).
 Fairbanks: The Fairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau offers 
a very informative calendar at www.explorefairbanks.com/
calendar.
 Juneau: Check www.traveljuneau.com (click “Event Calendar”),
operated by the Juneau Convention & Visitors Bureau.
Packing for the North
“What should I pack?” is among the most frequent questions of visitors
to Alaska. Although most travelers know they aren’t headed into a scene
from Nanook of the North, they also don’t know exactly what they are
headed into. You won’t need mukluks and you won’t need a necktie, but
you will need to prepare for swings in temperatures broader than you
may be used to. And you’ll need binoculars and mosquito repellent.
Summer clothing
You’re not going to the North Pole; for a summer visit, don’t weigh down
your luggage with a down parka or winter boots. But you should be
ready for swings from sunny 80°F (27°C) days to windy, rainy 45°F (7°C)
outings on the water. The way Alaskans prepare for such a range is with
layers. The content of the layers depends on what you’re doing, but
everyone should bring at least the following:
 Warm-weather clothes
 Heavy long-sleeved shirts and pants
 A wool sweater
 A warm jacket
 A waterproof raincoat and rain pants
Gloves and wool hats are a good idea, too, especially for boating trips. If
you’re camping, add synthetic thermal long underwear and wool socks
to the list and make your jacket thick synthetic fleece. Combine these
items, and you’re ready for any summer conditions. For hiking, bring
sturdy shoes or cross trainers.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
148

Winter clothing
You can be comfortable no matter how cold it is. When you know how to
dress warmly, the world of snow opens up to you. But first, what not to
wear: People don’t wear heavy Arctic gear in town, even in the Arctic. To
make the dash from car to heated building, you can get by with a heavy
overcoat, sweater, hat, gloves, wool socks, and long underwear.
For vigorous winter activities
For outdoor pursuits, what you wear depends on how active you are.
The key to warmth and safety during vigorous outdoor activities is to
wear layers of breathable clothing that stay warm when wet, such as
wool or synthetics. With the following layers, you’re ready for tempera-
tures well below 0°F (18°C), at which point you won’t want to ski or
skate anyway:
 Synthetic thermal long underwear
 Synthetic fleece pants and coat
 Wool sweater
 Wind-resistant pants and jacket
 Wool socks and hat
 Warm boots with liners or covers
 Lined mittens
Strip off these layers for warmer temperatures.
For sedate winter activities
For more sedentary outdoor activities, such as watching the aurora or
riding a snowmobile or dog sled, you need warmer clothing. Likewise,
drives on rural highways in winter require warm clothing in case of
breakdowns. On guided trips or at cold-weather resorts, they either tell
you what to bring or provide or rent the gear. If you need to get your
own, a full outfit includes the following:
 Synthetic thermal long underwear
 The stoutest Sorel-style or Air Force bunny boots
 Insulated snow pants
 A heavy down parka with a hood
 Thick, insulated mittens (not gloves)
 A wool hat
 A face-insulating mask
 Ski goggles or quality sunglasses
Chapter 12: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 149

You don’t want any skin showing while riding a snowmobile or standing
in a strong wind in below-0°F temperatures. Such a getup costs more
than $500. You can buy what you need in Anchorage at Army Navy
Store, 320 W. 4th Ave. (% 888-836-3535; www.army-navy-store.com),
or in Fairbanks at Big Ray’s Store, 507 2nd Ave. (% 800-478-3458;
www.bigrays.com).
Dressing like a local
One of the most dramatic examples of a culture clash I ever witnessed
was during the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which I covered as a newspaper
reporter. Suddenly, Texan oil executives in sharp suits flooded into little
Alaskan fishing towns where, previously, a man in any kind of a business
suit was enough to cause a double take. The Exxon executives took only
a few days to figure out just how out of place they looked and how
poorly that served their PR aims, and soon they all started wearing flan-
nel shirts and blue jeans — crisply pressed flannel shirts and blue jeans.
They stood out just as much as ever!
The uniform of coastal Alaska is simple: rubber boots, T-shirts or flannel
shirts, and blue jeans or Carhart canvas pants. (Carhart-brand clothes
are those stiff, loose-fitting, rough-woven work clothes that you may
have seen on your auto mechanic. They’re for sale all over Alaska, espe-
cially at the shops listed at the end of the preceding section.) In
inclement weather, add a fleece or lined Carhart canvas jacket and
rubber rain gear. Fish blood on the clothing is a mark of pride. Away
from the coast, the rubber boots may be replaced by leather work boots,
and the Carharts become a permanent fixture: Mosquitoes can’t bite
through them.
If you don’t want to dress like a local, you won’t go wrong with sturdy
casual clothing. The great thing about Alaska is that no one really cares
what you wear.
Communicating on the Road
Alaska’s telecommunications network is world-renowned. Even tiny vil-
lages without indoor plumbing have TV, telephone, and Internet connec-
tions. Adventurers crossing trackless Arctic terrain can check their
e-mail by satellite. The question is, how connected do you want to be
when you’re seeking nature?
Logging onto the Internet
Taking a laptop on vacation isn’t just for losers anymore. You can watch
DVDs on the plane, listen to music, and write letters. These days even
many B&Bs offer Internet access through wireless networks. On the
other hand, you’ll be lugging a computer around, worrying about it
being stolen, and you’ll face the constant temptation to keep up with the
office — and that is for losers!
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
150

The very reasonable alternative is to rely on public Web access. Even tiny
Alaska towns offer access to travelers; most have an Internet cafe, while in
others you can log on at the public library. Internet access for each Alaska
community is listed in the appropriate sections of the book under “Fast
Facts.” Typically, you can find the information you want for less than $5.
To retrieve your e-mail from a public computer, ask your Internet serv-
ice provider (ISP) if it has a Web-based interface tied to your existing
e-mail account. If your ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use
the free mail2web service (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to
your home e-mail (click Secure Login to protect your privacy).
Making a cellphone call
Bringing your cellphone to Alaska makes good sense. It doesn’t take up
much space, and you may need it. However, using it extensively could
get expensive if you don’t have a plan that covers the state. It’s wise to
check about roaming charges before you start making a lot of calls.
Alaska’s main providers are AT&T and local companies called ACS and
GCI. The most densely populated portion of the state and most of the
paved highways have cellular coverage. Don’t bet your life on being able
to make a call anywhere beyond the end of pavement, though.
To be sure you’re always in touch, you can rent a satellite phone; that’s
more expensive, and the phones are not at all handy to use. I cover that
option under “Getting lost,” in Chapter 9.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
Security measures at airports get tighter all the time, often with little
warning. One threat meant everyone had to begin taking shoes off before
getting on an airplane; another meant no liquids could go onboard with
passengers. There’s not much you can do except be patient, allow extra
time, and check the Web sites that keep up-to-date information on the
latest rules at www.tsa.gov. Here are a few obvious tips to save you
time and trouble:
 Arrive early. Usually, being at the airport two hours before your
flight is not necessary, but every once in a while you run into hor-
rendous security or check-in delays at major airports. At Alaska’s
small airports, an hour is generally adequate. You should be in the
boarding area for Alaska Airlines flights 30 minutes before depature.
 Be sure to carry plenty of documentation. A government-issued
photo ID (federal, state, or local) is required. Bring paper backup
for your electronic ticket, just in case. And be sure that your ID is
up-to-date: An expired driver’s license, for example, may keep you
from boarding the plane. (Minors 17 and under don’t need govern-
ment-issued photo IDs for domestic flights.) Each traveler should
have possession of his own ID and boarding pass before entering
the security area.
Chapter 12: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 151

 Use E-tickets to help beat the lines. Avoid using paper tickets.
Passengers with E-tickets can beat ticket-counter lines by using air-
port electronic kiosks or even online check-in from a home com-
puter. Online check-in involves logging onto your airline’s Web site,
accessing your reservation, and printing your boarding pass — and
the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using
a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card you used to book the
ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass from
the kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your
pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an
exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so using most airline kiosks.
Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines where it is
available.
 Prepare for special needs. If you have trouble standing for a long
time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair.
Only ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks
escorting children or disabled passengers; those helpers will need
documentation from the airline before approaching security.
 Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor
can prevent a long chat with the security screeners.
 Know what you can carry on and what you can’t. The Trans-
portation Security Administration (TSA) publishes a list of items
prohibited in carry-on or checked baggage; the list changes fre-
quently, and TSA agents are empowered to ignore it and confiscate
anything they find suspicious. The general rule is that sharp things
and liquids are out. For the latest detailed list, check the TSA Web
site at www.tsa.gov. See the “Camping and airline security” side-
bar in this chapter for advice on bringing outdoor supplies on a
plane.
 Prepare to be searched. Take out your laptop and put it in a sepa-
rate tray. Try to send it through last so it’ll be exposed to theft for
less time on the other end. (The same goes for cellphones and
PDAs.) Be ready to remove your shoes and jacket for X-ray. Remove
anything metal from your pockets and take off your belt if it has
anything but a small buckle. Don’t complain about being searched;
the security people have the power to ruin your day on a whim if
you irritate them.
 Prepare to have your checked bags searched. Checked baggage is
subjected to powerful X-rays and often inspected by hand as well.
Do not leave film in your bag, because the X-rays will ruin it. If you
lock your bag, use an approved lock that allows screeners to open
and relock it; otherwise, a TSA agent will likely cut your lock or
force your bag open. Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks. Many
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
152

brands are certified and available virtually anywhere you buy lug-
gage. Also, don’t overstuff your luggage, as screeners may not be
able to get it back together after a search.
 Don’t joke. A physician who made a stupid joke at one Alaska air-
port after September 11 was barred permanently from flying on
Alaska Airlines. Because no other airline flies to the town he was in
and it can’t be reached by road, he was stuck there for some time —
and humiliated in the media to boot.
Chapter 12: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 153
Camping and airline security
Security baggage screening makes life tough for all outdoors people. Critical survival
gear can be confiscated without the passenger’s knowledge: One party found them-
selves in the Alaska wilderness without matches to build a fire or glue to fix their rafts
because a screener had intercepted those items on the flight out. I list some advice
here, but the rules change (and sometimes even allowed items are confiscated —
screeners have complete discretion). For the latest regulations, check www.tsa.gov
and search using the keyword camping. That should bring up a list of camping equip-
ment and how to handle each item. The best solution for many of these issues is to
buy what you need on arrival; but allow time to responsibly dispose of anything you buy
in Alaska and cannot take on the plane ride home.
 Camp stoves: Camp stoves are not allowed onboard with even the slightest odor
of fuel. Effectively, that means you can’t bring a stove with an attached fuel tank
on your trip. Indeed, even stoves without attached fuel tanks often are barred.
Don’t try — you’ll either lose your stove or miss the plane. Rent a stove in Alaska,
buy an inexpensive stove you can get rid of when you’re done, or mail your
detached-tank stove ahead and buy a tank on arrival.
 Bear-deterrent spray: Not allowed even as checked baggage, so you’ll have to
buy this item in Alaska or do without (see Chapter 9).
 Matches and lighters: Lighters are generally not allowed in checked baggage,
but you can bring common pocket lighters and one book of safety matches on
your person or as carry-on luggage.
 Insect repellent: You can take repellent in checked baggage, but the rules were
unclear to me about bringing it in aerosol cans. Just in case, stick with the pump
or lotion variety in your checked luggage.
 Flares: Not allowed at all. You can take an unloaded flare gun in checked bag-
gage in a hard-sided case, declaring it at the counter, but you’ll have to buy flares
on arrival.
Remember: When you arrive, inventory your survival equipment to make sure it’s all 
still there. If anything is missing, replace it before you set out for your adventure.

Flying with Bulky Outdoor Equipment
Two issues make flying and camping tough. One is the bulkiness of the
gear, and the other is getting it past security screeners. The latter is
addressed in the “Camping and airline security” sidebar in this chapter.
Backpackers don’t have to worry about bulky equipment, because their
stuff is already compact: They can simply check the pack with the air-
line. Family camping entails a lot more gear than backpacking, and that
adds challenges. Just the bedding for our family of six could fill the belly
of a 747.
Baggage fees can make it expensive to send your gear. They’re changing
rapidly at this writing; check airline Web sites before you begin packing.
Currently, Alaska Airlines charges $25 for a passenger’s second bag and
$100 for a third. Size and weight restrictions also affect campers: No
longer can you just stuff a huge duffle. Anything over 62 inches in length
plus width plus height carries a $50 fee.
Services such as Sports Express Luggage Delivery (www.sports
express.com) can take care of all this for you, including sending ahead
items like bikes and kayaks. Parcel services like FedEx and UPS can
deliver you luggage, too. But that generally will cost even more than
excess baggage charges.
Here are some tips for family camping without the family car:
 Start with a list. A list keeps you from forgetting things and makes
it easier to decide what not to take.
 Find out how much baggage is allowed. Airlines charge stiff fees
for extra baggage. Most campers won’t be able to stay within the
limits. Before you start, check airline Web sites so you can balance
baggage costs against renting what you need on arrival.
 Figure out how much you can handle. Will you need to tote every-
thing yourself to get on a train or boat, for example? If so, figure out
who carries what, and make sure each person can really carry his
or her assigned items. If you rent a car at the airport, you don’t
have to carry everything at once, but it does have to fit in the car’s
trunk. Consider the bulk of whatever you plan to rent, too.
 Start packing early. You won’t believe how much space all your
stuff takes until you see it all together. If you start early enough,
you’ll have more time for alternatives, such as buying smaller gear
or arranging to rent gear at your destination.
 Bring an extra collapsible bag. A spare duffel can be great for
items you pick up on the way, for dirty clothes, or for segregating
stuff you don’t need so that you can stash it somewhere.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Alaska 
154

 Mail back the extras. You don’t have to haul around souvenirs you
buy or items you aren’t using. Have shops mail them home for you.
If you brought along something that’s hanging around your neck
like a millstone (a friend told me a hilarious story of a trip weighed
down by an old manual typewriter), stop in at a post office, buy a
box, and mail it home. I list the location of the local post office in
the “Fast Facts” section for each town in this book.
 Stow gear at your hotel. Many lodgings are willing to hold onto
extra luggage for a few days, especially if you’re coming back to
stay there again. Keep camping gear with you only for the outdoor
excursion, and then store it until you’re ready to head home.
 Don’t bring what you can buy cheaply. For example, water bottles
are sold in every convenience store.
 Arrange to rent as much as you can. I list outdoor rental agencies
in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau, Alaska’s key gateways, in
Chapters 13, 17, and 20, respectively. Make sure to call ahead and
reserve what you need. You can rent camping equipment as well as
large items such as bikes, canoes, and sea kayaks.

I
’ve given Anchorage and the easy day trips around the city
an entire three-chapter part in this book, and not just
because it’s my hometown. Anchorage is a fun city to visit
and a perfect base of operations for a survey of the largest
part of Alaska. You can do and see most of what you’ve come
for within a half-day’s drive of Anchorage, and you can be in
spectacular wild country less than an hour from the largest
downtown hotel. With all its transportation options, in addi-
tion to its big stores and ofﬁces, the city serves as Alaska’s
heart.
These chapters provide information on what to do, where to
stay and eat, and how to get around Anchorage, the nearby
Seward Highway, the ski resort at Girdwood, Prince William
Sound from Whittier, and the Mat-Su area.

A
nchorage isn’t a beautiful city, but it’s in a beautiful place, and
that’s good enough. The main part of the city lies in the Anchorage
Bowl, which is rimmed by the Chugach Mountains and the broad mud
flats and swirling gray water of Cook Inlet. Wilderness is only minutes
away in either direction — by air over the water to the west or on foot or
bicycle into the mountains to the east. Yet the town itself is quite civi-
lized and firmly linked to the rest of the United States in its culture and
in the way it looks. On a city street, if you keep your eyes off the moun-
tains, you could be almost anywhere. But a few steps off the street, and
you’re into a greenbelt or a big natural park, ready to encounter moose,
eagles, or beluga whales.
I wouldn’t recommend that anyone spend an entire vacation in
Anchorage (well, maybe a skiing vacation), but you can and should use
the city as a base. As I discuss in earlier chapters, Anchorage is the
cheapest gateway into the largest part of the state, with the state’s most
complete services and transportation network. The city is a world trans-
portation hub; the airport here sees as much air cargo pass through as
any in the United States and has the world’s busiest floatplane base at
Lake Hood. The Alaska Railroad is based here, and the three busiest
highways meet close by. You need Anchorage, just as Alaskans do.
But the city is more than a jumping-off point; it has its own attractions,
including several options for rainy-day activities. The state’s biggest
museum, an extraordinary Native cultural center, and Alaska’s only zoo
are here. And some of the state’s best outdoor activities are found within
the (quite large) city limits or on easy day trips to Prince William Sound
or to the mountains and rivers north and south of town. Anchorage also
has a thriving performing-arts scene, a choice of superb restaurants, and
plenty of places to shop for art or schlock.

In this chapter, I cover the practical advice about how to get to
Anchorage and where to stay and eat. In Chapters 14 and 15, I go into
the attractions and activities that make this a great city to visit.
Getting to Anchorage
Most visitors to Alaska pass through Anchorage at some point. It’s a
simple gateway, much like other midsize American cities, but knowing a
few details can ease your way.
Flying in
You’ll probably fly into Anchorage at the start of your trip, because it has
the most flights linking Alaska to the rest of the world. The Anchorage
International Airport is a major hub. Seattle has the most frequent
flights to Alaska, with numerous domestic carriers flying nonstop all day
(see Chapter 6). Within Alaska, many flights route through Anchorage,
even for communities much closer to each other than either is to
Anchorage. Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com) is
the dominant carrier for Alaska destinations and the only jet operator to
most Alaska cities (see Chapter 7).
Various commuter carriers link Anchorage to rural destinations not
served by jet. Era Aviation (% 800-866-8394; www.flyera.com) is one
of the largest for Southcentral Alaska destinations and can be booked
directly or through Alaska Airlines.
The Anchorage airport is perpetually under construction, so some
details I could give would go out of date as renovations are completed
(not to mention airlines going out of business!). Here are some tips you
can generally count to get oriented in the airport; for more, check
www.anchorageairport.com:
 The Main Terminal hosts Alaska Airlines, some other domestic air-
lines and all commuter airlines. After renovation, the rest of the
domestic flights will probably come in here as well.
 The North Terminal receives all international flights and, during
construction, several domestic carriers as well. It’s reached from
the domestic terminal by a free shuttle bus that comes every 15
minutes all day.
 Baggage claim in the main terminal is downstairs next to the lower
ramp, where you’ll also find taxis, airport courtesy vans, a tunnel to
the railroad station (used only for cruise-line charters) and airport
shuttles.
 Rental-car counters are connected to the main terminal, which
accesses the parking garage. The closest gas stations are at the
intersection of Spenard Road and Minnesota Drive.
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
160

 ATMs are within a few steps everywhere in the airport, on either
side of the security barriers.
 The airport offers free Wi-Fi, which seems to work all over the
buildings.
 Visitor information desks at the airport are in the baggage-claim
area in the C concourse and in the international terminal.
Getting into town from the airport
The airport is right in the city, an easy trip from downtown. However,
Anchorage is big and spread out, so getting around beyond downtown
can be expensive without a car.
Renting a car
The most practical way to tour this part of Alaska is to rent a car. Even 
if you’re just staying in Anchorage, taxis are expensive to use because 
of the spread-out urban design. On an ideal visit, you’ll travel to sites
beyond downtown at least once a day for hiking, skiing, sightseeing,
dining, or accommodations. Chapter 7 covers tips on renting a car or RV
in Anchorage. Pick up your baggage and head under the lower ramp to
where the car-rental desks are located.
As you leave the airport, a divided highway leads east (toward the
mountains); this is International Airport Road. At the first major inter-
section, Spenard Road leads to the left, toward the main area of airport
hotels. The next intersection on International is a large interchange.
Follow the signs to head north on Minnesota Drive, which leads 
downtown.
Catching a cab or shuttle
Some hotels have free courtesy vans. That’s the cheapest way to get to
your hotel, and it allows you to postpone renting a car until you really
need it. Find out the arrangement for getting the van when you reserve
your room. If your hotel doesn’t have a courtesy van, a taxi is the easiest
way to get to your accommodations and costs only a little more than
taking a shuttle, even for a person traveling alone. The ride downtown
from the airport costs $18 to $20 (plus a tip of around $3) and takes 15
to 30 minutes, depending on traffic. Try Alaska Yellow Cab (% 907-
222-2222).
Various airport shuttles have operated from time to time. Ask at the 
visitor information desk for the current options. If you don’t have much
luggage, you can consider taking the People Mover city bus, which con-
nects the airport and the downtown transit center hourly. Take Spenard
Route 7A (every other Route 7 bus on weekdays). For finding schedules
and other details on using the People Mover see “Getting Around
Anchorage,” later in this chapter.
Chapter 13: Settling into Anchorage 161

Arriving by car
Only one road connects Anchorage to the rest of the world: the Glenn
Highway. The Glenn starts 330 miles from Anchorage in Tok, at the inter-
section with the Alaska Highway, and runs through Glennallen and the
Mat-Su area before entering downtown Anchorage and becoming 5th and
6th avenues. From Fairbanks or Denali National Park, the Parks Highway
leads south through Mat-Su, where it merges with the Glenn Highway 30
miles out of Anchorage. (Alaska’s highways are covered in Chapter 18.
The Mat-Su area is in Chapter 15.)
The only other road entering town, the Seward Highway, connects the
city to the Kenai Peninsula, to the south (see Chapters 15 and 16). If 
you arrive in the region by cruise ship or ferry, you’ll probably land in
Seward or Whittier, 124 miles or 50 miles south of Anchorage, respec-
tively. Cruise lines take care of the bus or rail transfer to Anchorage. The
highway becomes Ingra and Gambell streets in downtown Anchorage,
where it meets the origin of the Glenn Highway.
Arriving by train
Some cruise-ship passengers arrive in Anchorage by rail from Seward 
or Whittier. Some trains go straight to the airport, others to the main
depot downtown on 2nd Avenue, a short bus ride from downtown
hotels.
Orienting Yourself in Anchorage
Navigating Anchorage is easy if you just remember that the mountains
are to the east. Use them as your compass. The “Anchorage” map, later
in this chapter, familiarizes you with the major streets, but to find a par-
ticular address, you need to pick up a more detailed map at one of the
visitor centers I mention in “Finding Information after You Arrive,” later
in this chapter.
Downtown
Many visitors here for only a day never make it beyond the downtown
area, the old-fashioned grid of streets at the northwest corner of the 
city where the large hotels and the gift shops are located. Street 
numbers and letters work on a simple pattern. Numbered avenues 
run east and west. Lettered streets run north and south. East of A 
Street, north–south streets have the alphabetized names of Alaska
places (Barrow, Cordova, Denali, Eagle, and so on). Check out the
“Downtown Anchorage” map in this chapter for a detailed look at this
easy-to-navigate area.
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
162

Midtown and the rest of the Anchorage Bowl
Most of Anchorage beyond the compact downtown area is a newer cre-
ation, built in the western U.S. model of commercial strips along big
roads. Midtown, just south of downtown, is the main added-on commer-
cial center. South Anchorage is roughly everything south of Dimond
Boulevard and includes Hillside, the district east of the Seward Highway
in the foothills and mountainsides of the Chugach Range. Learning the
names of most other neighborhoods isn’t important.
Three major north–south thoroughfares run from downtown, through
Midtown, to the shopping malls and residential districts of South
Anchorage. These are Minnesota Drive, which becomes I and L streets
downtown; C Street and A Street; and the New Seward Highway, which
is Ingra and Gambell streets downtown and heads out of town to the
south. Major east–west roads in the grid are 5th and 6th avenues,
becoming the Glenn Highway and leading out of town to the north;
Northern Lights Boulevard and Benson Boulevard, running across the
city in Midtown; and Dimond Boulevard, in South Anchorage.
Beyond the Bowl
Some parts of Anchorage are outside the Bowl defined by the Chugach
Mountains. The communities of Eagle River and Eklutna are northeast
of Anchorage on the Glenn Highway; go a little farther that way and you
reach the Mat-Su area. Girdwood and the Portage Glacier are on the
Seward Highway, to the south. A tunnel near the glacier leads to
Whittier and Prince William Sound.
Finding Information after You Arrive
Besides the information desks at the airport, you can get questions
answered at the Log Cabin Visitor Information Center, downtown at 4th
Avenue and F Street (% 907-274-3531). It’s open June through August
daily 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., May and September daily 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
October through April daily 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Anchorage Convention
& Visitors Bureau (% 907-276-4118; www.anchorage.net) operates the
information center.
Diagonally across the street is an indispensable stop for anyone plan-
ning an outdoors trip: the Alaska Public Lands Information Center,
605 W. 4th Ave. (% 866-869-6887; www.nps.gov/anch). It’s open in the
summer daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., in winter Monday through Friday 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. It’s not just a place to get advice and information, it’s also an
outdoors museum. Located in a 1930s post office and federal court-
house, the center houses exhibits in a grand room with high ceilings. All
the land agencies are represented and the bookstore has an excellent
Chapter 13: Settling into Anchorage 163

selection of trail and field guides available. Rangers are on hand with
advice based on personal experience. Employees also offer talks, films,
and children’s programs. A visit is well worth the brief inconvenience of
going through federal security screening.
Getting Around Anchorage
The population of Anchorage roughly doubled during the oil-boom years
of the 1970s and early 1980s. Large sections of forest and swamp sud-
denly became city. It achieved its current form and size by 1985. Maybe
there wasn’t enough time to do it right. In any event, Anchorage ended
up as one big sprawl.
If you plan to break out of the older, pedestrian-friendly downtown area,
you’re almost forced to rent a car. Taxis often cost as much or more, and
they’re much less convenient. The People Mover city bus will work if
your aim is to save money, but you pay the price in time, as buses come
only every 30 minutes at best, a poor use of valuable vacation time. Bus
tours are available; they’re good for orientation or to get to the Alaska
Native Heritage Center, but otherwise they aren’t recommended for get-
ting around. (Find out more about guided tours in Chapter 14.)
Driving around town
Driving in the city is simple, at least in the warm months. The roads are
wide and straight, turning right at a red light is permitted, finding your
way with a map is easy (just remember the mountains are east), and
parking is not a problem (half the town is parking lots). If you have trou-
ble finding a space downtown, just duck into one of the many pay-to-
park public lots or garages. The fees won’t break you at any of these
places, but you pay cheaper fees farther east.
The allowable blood alcohol level in Alaska is low: 0.08 percent.
Penalties for driving while intoxicated are extremely stiff: Besides
mandatory jail time, big fines, and fees, Anchorage police can take away
your car on the spot and sell it.
Winter driving can be a challenge. The roads are slick and the lines
between lanes become invisible under snow and ice. Driving under these
conditions is a skill, but the principles are simple: Go slowly, accelerate
gradually, and plan ahead so that you’re prepared to stop safely. When
starting from a stop, apply as little gas as possible; avoid spinning your
wheels. Renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle is probably worth the money.
Avoid a car with rear-wheel-drive; front-wheel-drive handles much better
on ice.
For winter drives to outlying areas, such as the ski resort in Girdwood,
check on road conditions with the Alaska Department of Transporta-
tion’s hotline or Web site (% 511; http://511.alaska.gov).
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
164

Occasionally, the road to Girdwood, the Seward Highway, is closed by
avalanche conditions or is undrivable because of wet ice. See “Arriving
by car,” earlier in this chapter and Chapter 7 for more information on
driving in Alaska.
Calling a cab
If you can’t drive, taking a taxi may be your second-best choice. Because
of the size of the city, taxis are an expensive way to get around, but 
if you plan your trips carefully and don’t go too far — like the zoo,
Chugach State Park, or Eklutna — you can make it work. I’ve had the
best luck with Alaska Yellow Cab (% 907-222-2222).
Hailing a cab usually isn’t possible, so you need to call. Normally, a cab
comes within ten minutes of being called, but if you need one around the
time the bars close (2 a.m.) or near the start of the workday, and you
want to be on time, allow at least half an hour. If you leave something 
in a cab, call the cab company. To file a complaint, call the city’s
Transportation Inspection Division (% 907-786-8525).
Waiting for the bus
It takes patience to go a long way on the People Mover buses (% 907-
343-6543; www.peoplemover.org), but the system is convenient and
inexpensive for destinations such as the Alaska Native Heritage Center
that are served by direct routes from downtown. Moreover, Anchorage
buses are safe and well maintained and cover most of the city. Bus fares
all over town are $1.75 for adults; $1 for children 5 to 18; 50¢ for seniors
61 and over, people with disabilities, or those with a valid Medicare
card; free for children 4 and under. The transit center bus depot is at 6th
Avenue and G Street. Buses generally come every half-hour (hourly on
weekends), but to use the system conveniently, go online and figure out
your route and timing in advance.
Riding a bike
The network of bike trails is a great way to see the best side of Anchorage
but not a practical means of transportation for most people. The city is
just too large. The Tony Knowles Coastal Trail comes right downtown,
linking to trails that weave along greenbelts all over town. The trails and
bike rental are covered in Chapter 14.
Using shoe leather
In the downtown area, the simplest way to get around is on foot. If
you’re spending only a day in Anchorage before heading off to activities
elsewhere in the state, you don’t need to go any farther than downtown
for an interesting visit, so you don’t need transportation.
Chapter 13: Settling into Anchorage 165

Where to Stay in Anchorage
Find a place in Anchorage you can use as a handy base for your trip. If
you’re using the airport frequently for getting around the state, staying
in that part of the city makes sense. If you don’t plan to rent a car, rent-
ing a room downtown gives you foot and bike access to the greatest
number of attractions. If you’re renting a car, you can stay anywhere in
the city. If you reserve at the same establishment for each time you pass
through the city, you can stow extra baggage there and, when you come
back for your subsequent stay, receive an extra level of hospitality.
Anchorage is a good place to consider staying in a bed-and-breakfast or
small inn for two reasons:
 Compared to a similar room in a hotel, you can save $50 a day with
the lower rate and the breakfast that’s included.
 It offers a chance to make a personal link with a local, your host,
who can give you insider advice and regale you with stories of
Alaskan adventure. (The visitor bureau gives all residents an
annual exam to make sure we have enough bear stories.)
I’ve searched for some of the best small places, choosing those with
character and reasonable prices. Anchorage has hundreds more, many
of them just as good. Dozens link through a Web site maintained by the
cooperative Anchorage Alaska Bed & Breakfast Association (www.
anchorage-bnb.com). Browse through or search by amenities or loca-
tion. Links go the B&Bs’ own sites, which often have online availability
calendars. Without a computer, call their hotline (% 888-584-5147 or
907-272-5909), which is answered by hosts at member properties to offer
referrals to places that meet callers’ requirements.

Downtown
This all-suite hotel has a rare combination of advantages: a superb, central
location; solid, quiet rooms; fully equipped kitchens in every unit full of
housewares and with dishwashers and automatic ice makers; generous
amenities; and rates competitive for this area of town. The hotel lacks
much of a lobby, as the main entrance and handicap entrance lead directly
into a stairway or hallway; that’s because it is a reincarnation of an old,
concrete apartment building. But the immaculate rooms and tiled bath-
rooms are quite large, decorated in a trim, subdued style with fine cabi-
netry. Despite the full kitchens, I’ve never noticed odors in the many rooms
I’ve checked on several occasions, which is remarkable. Also, despite the
kitchen, they serve a free continental breakfast in the morning (and deliver
the newspaper). Every unit has a bedroom and a queen-size sofa sleeper
in the living room.

granite countertops in the bathrooms and common areas. The small
upstairs rooms in the main building have wonderful views and funny
angles; two of those share a bathroom. Lower-level rooms open on a patio.
The rooms in the newer building, nearer the water, have high ceilings on

more than hospitable, creating the homey feeling of a country inn right in
the urban core. They serve a large continental breakfast in the common

Dimond Center Hotel
$$$$$
South Anchorage
This hotel is unique in several ways. Owned by the Seldovia Native
Association, its primary clientele is rural Alaska residents coming to the
big city for shopping and entertainment. That explains the location, on the
south side of town, far from downtown sites, in the parking between a Wal-
Mart store and a large shopping mall. Strange as it sounds, however, the
location makes sense for many visitors: Chugach State Park, the zoo, and
the Seward Highway and its many attractions are closer than anywhere
else you could stay. Since the owners built the hotel for themselves, the
attention to comfort and detail are impressive. The common areas are styl-
ish and decorated with Native art, and the rooms are grand: high ceilings,
granite counters, attractive modern furniture, 42-inch flat-screen TVs, and
pillow-top beds with comforters. The bathrooms are elaborate, with large
shower areas and separate soaking tubs that can connect to the bedroom
by opening wooden shutters. Amenities are exhaustive. Note: A car is
essential at this location, and you’ll have to drive if you want to eat any-
thing but fast food.

The Hotel Captain Cook
$$$$$
Downtown
This is Alaska’s great, grand hotel, where royalty and rock stars stay. (For
a mere $1,500 a night, you can stay in the same suites they do.) Former
governor Wally Hickel built the first of the three towers after the 1964
earthquake, and now the hotel fills a city block and anchors the downtown
skyline. Inside, the earth tones and dark-wood decor contribute to a fully
realized (maybe a little excessive) nautical theme, with art memorializing
Cook’s voyages and enough teak to build a square-rigger. The regularly
renewed rooms are decorated in a rich, sumptuous style using exquisite
fabrics, unique pieces of custom-built furniture, and lots of varnished trim.
Rooms are comfortable in size, but not as large as those in modern upscale
chains, and all have a choice only of a king or two twin beds. Lots of
custom tile, mirrors and granite make up for the relatively small size of the
bathrooms. There are great views from all sides and you don’t pay more
to be on a higher floor. The pool, spa, and fitness facilities in the below-
ground lower lobby are among the best in town.
Sophisticated food and superb service justify the high prices at the Crow’s
Nest, the city’s most traditional fine-dining restaurant, on the hotel’s top
floor. Most tables have stupendous views, and high-backed booths lend
intimacy for a romantic dinner. The cuisine draws on many influences with-
out being trendy and looks wonderful on the plate. Main courses range
from $26 to $50. The wine list is voluminous, with few bottles under $40.
Fletcher’s, off the lobby, is an English pub serving good Italian-style pizza,
pasta, and sandwiches. The Pantry is an above-average hotel cafe, with
interesting entrees in moderate serving sizes. The Whale’s Tail serves
light meals, coffee, and cocktails amid overstuffed chairs and big TVs; it’s
a good place for a drink without feeling like you’re in a bar.

Lake Hood Inn
$$$$
Airport
Pilot Bill Floyd built this place right next to his floatplane slip (he flies a
Cessna 180) and filled it with fascinating aviation stuff: photographs, pro-
pellers, and even rows of seats from a Russian airliner. The guestbook is
an aircraft logbook. On the comfortable balconies, headphones are at the
ready to listen to radio traffic between the tower and the aircraft you can
see taxiing on the lake in front of you. Floyd invested in commercial-
quality construction and the rooms have the feel of a solid, upscale hotel
room, not a family B&B; they’re decorated in cool, muted shades with
Berber carpet, light flooding in through big windows. The bathrooms have
large shower stalls. Beds can be configured as two twins or as one king.

Two front rooms have their own balconies and cost $20 more; the two

The Oscar Gill House
$$
Downtown
On the Delaney Park strip, just a few blocks from downtown, this is truly the
oldest house in Anchorage — it was built in 1913, in Knik, before Anchorage
was founded, and moved here on a barge a few years later. Oscar Gill was
an early civic leader. The house was to be torn down in 1982 but was moved
to storage by a historic preservation group; Mark and Susan Lutz saved it
in 1993, transferring it to its present location and, with their own labor,
restoring it authentically as a cozy bed-and-breakfast. Now it’s on the
National Historic Register. Appropriate antiques sit on plank floors in rooms
sized in those more modest times. With the period decoration it’s like vis-
iting your grandmother’s house when it was brand-new. The outgoing
Lutzes create a warm, social setting. Book early, because they fill up; you
can check availability and even select a room on their Web site.
See map p. 173. 1344 W. 10th Ave., Anchorage. % and Fax: 907-279-1344. www.

with private bathroom; extra person $25. Rates include full breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Susitna Place
$$
Downtown
Just a few blocks from the downtown core, where a narrow residential
street reaches a quiet end, a nondescript door under a carport leads into
a rambling house of rooms ranging from comfortable and inexpensive to
grand. It turns out that the street side is really the back of the house, which
sits at the top of a high bluff facing an unobstructed view of Cook Inlet and
Mount Susitna beyond, a view so unlike most urban vistas that it’s easy 
to forget you’re right in town. A large, gracious common room and break-
fast area and an adjoining balcony command this extraordinary view.
Remodeling completed in 2007 filled the house with new furniture. The
suite is quite luxurious, but the four rooms that share two bathrooms are
the rarer find: cozy and very clean, sharing this prime location, they allow
travelers to save money without compromise. A good, simple room with
two double beds and its own bathroom rents for $130 double. The hosts,
successful journalists, are hospitable Alaskans.

The Voyager Hotel
$$$$
Downtown
Thanks to its exacting proprietor, Stan Williams, The Voyager is just right,
down to the high quality of the linen and memory-foam mattresses. The
size is small; the location is central; the rooms are large and light, all with
well-designed kitchenettes; and the housekeeping is exceptional. Business
travelers will appreciate the well-equipped desks, with speaker phones,
free wired broadband, and extra electrical outlets. The whole place has a
feel of crisp professionalism. The pick of the rooms are three on the north-
west corner, each of which has an added meeting or sitting room but costs
the same as the units that have only the bedroom; however, they’re in high
demand and often unavailable. There’s nothing ostentatious or outwardly
remarkable about the hotel, yet experienced travelers return again and
again.

Where to Dine in Anchorage
Anchorage offers some great dining experiences. The regional cuisine of
fresh salmon, halibut, shellfish, and game dominates all fine-dining estab-
lishments, and as long as they don’t overcook the fish or keep it frozen
for too long, you can’t go wrong. The very best restaurants, however, use
these ingredients creatively, combining various international styles in
exciting and unexpected ways. (And you can always get a steak, too.)
But dining in style is expensive and takes a long time. Most people can’t
afford to do it every night. Moreover, some of our family and friends who
have come to Alaska get tired of salmon. So I include plenty of other, less
expensive places, too. If I list them here, they’re good — but read on to
discover which restaurants offer a unique Alaskan experience and which
just serve satisfying meals.
The top restaurants
Bear Tooth Grill
$
Midtown
SOUTHWESTERN
You can’t find food of this quality for prices this low anywhere else in
Anchorage. Dishes such as the soy grilled halibut are sophisticated and
nicely done, but they make up only a small part of a menu that goes on
and on with Mexican choices, sandwiches, and other selections inexpen-
sive enough to make the restaurant fit for an after-work impulse — most
main courses are under $11. The partners who own the restaurant started
in business by making beer and then opened a pizzeria to sell the beer (see
the Moose’s Tooth, later in this section); next they opened a theater-pub
(see Chapter 14); the grill, in the same building, was the final addition. Eat
tacos, wraps, or pizza while watching a movie or at tables in the movie-
theater lobby, a loud, free-flowing setting perfect for kids and open for
lunch daily at 11 a.m. The grill is in a separate, calmer, and more confined
dining room, best for couples and parties of four or fewer, and opens at 
4 p.m. The food comes more slowly, as befits the atmosphere. Tables are
more comfortable than booths, but at peak times you have to take what
you can get, often with a wait, so try to dine here early or late. Besides the
beer, they have a full bar serving many margaritas and 20 wines by the
glass.

Campobello Bistro
$$$
Midtown
NORTHERN ITALIAN/BISTRO
Arriving at this quiet little midtown restaurant is like stepping into north-
ern Italy, except for the Alaska seafood. Even the service has the quality of
jocular professionalism I remember from Italy. The same priceless pair of
waiters have developed a following over a decade in the restaurant. Unlike
most of Anchorage’s best restaurants, the bistro doesn’t try to reinvent the
cookbook. Most of the menu consists of recognizable dishes, such as veal
Marsala or Italian sausage and polenta. Meals are bold, highly flavored, and
entirely satisfying. The seafood crepe is fantastic. Those seeking the bland
tomatoes and cheese of a typical Italian family restaurant should go else-
where. (Sorrento’s and Romano’s, both on Fireweed Lane, each do that
tried-and-true formula well.) The wine and food are reasonably priced.
See map p. 168. 601 W. 36th, Suite 10, Anchorage. % 907-563-2040. Main courses:

Club Paris
$$$$
Downtown
STEAK/SEAFOOD
Coming from a bright spring afternoon into midnight darkness, under a
neon Eiffel Tower and past the bar, I sat down at a secretive booth for two,
and felt as if I should lean across the table and plot a shady 1950s oil deal
with my companion. And I would probably not have been the first. In con-
trast to Sullivan’s Steakhouse, across the street, which contrives a mas-
culine, retro feel, Club Paris is the real thing, decorated with mounted
swordfish and other cocktail-era decor. The club is the essence of old
Anchorage boomtown years, when the streets were dusty and an oilman
needed a classy joint in which to do business. Steak, of course, is what to
order, and rare really means rare. It’s consistently voted the best in town.
Ask for the blue-cheese stuffing; the stuffed filet is worth the years it prob-
ably takes off your coronary arteries. They have a full bar.

Glacier Brewhouse
$$–$$$$
Downtown
GRILL/SEAFOOD/PIZZA
An eclectic and changing menu is served in a large dining room with lodge
decor, where the pleasant scent of the wood-fired grill hangs in the air. It’s
a lively place to see others and be seen. A glass wall shows off the brew-
ing equipment, which produces eight or more hearty beers, and also turns
out spent grain for bread that’s then set out on the tables with olive oil.
An advantage for travelers is the wide price range — a pizza with feta
cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, and garlic is $10; crab legs are $37. The
Part III: Anchorage and Environs

food is usually quite good. Choose this place for a boisterous meal with
quick, casual service that will get you out in time to do something else with
the evening. Do reserve ahead, however, as waits can be long.

Jens’ Restaurant
$$$$
Midtown
INTERNATIONAL
Chef Jens Hansen is truly gifted. His restaurant is for the kind of diner who
loves exciting food, surprises, and beautiful plates of new tastes and tex-
tures. The meals are about the food, sharing bites, and saying “Wow,” and
“How did he do that?” The cuisine is highly eclectic, but I won’t call it
experimental, despite the raw kangaroo I tried on one visit, because these
dishes work far more often than any experimentalist has a right to expect.
There’s often only one item on the changing menu that isn’t unusual or
challenging: the superb pepper steak. Like everything, even that dish has
a sauce, and it is complex and memorable. The wine list is exceptional but
manageable and reasonably priced, and you can sip your selection while
dining inexpensively on appetizers in a pleasant bar area; try the incredi-
ble spinach ravioli with Gorgonzola, for example. Desserts are sublime.
The dining room is uncluttered and decorated with modern art. Service is
highly professional, with each formally attired waiter assigned to just a
few tables, and they earn their keep as well by helping diners learn about
food and wine they’ve probably never tried.

DINER
This Anchorage institution of half a century (in high school we called it
“The Bone”) is where the real pioneer Alaska meets families out for a deli-
cious, not-too-greasy, fried-chicken dinner and famous milkshakes (try the
hot fudge) and other delights from the fountain. It’s our children’s favorite.
One section of the counter is reserved for discussion of aviation and golf.
When the beloved owners outlawed smoking years ago, it made the front
page of the newspaper. You’ll see few other tourists, as the location, among
the car dealerships at the extreme east end of downtown, is too far to walk
to from the hotels. They have a drive-in.

The Marx Brothers Cafe
$$$$$
Downtown
ECLECTIC/REGIONAL
A restaurant started by three friends back when gourmet food was an
exotic hobby in Anchorage long ago became the standard of excellence in
the state. Treatments of Alaska seafood that began here as cutting-edge
creative cuisine now turn up in many of the best restaurants, yet Chef Jack
Amon’s signature macadamia nut–encrusted halibut is nowhere done
better. He still presides in the kitchen of the cottage downtown, one of the
city’s first houses, while maître d’ Van Hale manages the front, preparing
his famous Caesar salad at tableside, a ritual that allows him to schmooze
with anyone he chooses in the tiny dining rooms. His attitude mirrors the
casual elegance of the entire evening, where those wearing ties are in the
minority. The cuisine is eclectic, ranging from Asian to Italian, and always
turned out flawlessly. The changing menu is not long, but the wine list is
the size of a dictionary, winner of many awards, but potentially intimidat-
ing. A meal is an experience that takes much of the evening and most
entrees are over $30. Save room for the exceptional desserts.

PIZZA
The best pizza and beer in Anchorage undoubtedly come from this fun and
friendly place. The microbrewery came first, but the pizza really is the
greater accomplishment. It has a soft, light crust like Italian pizza but the
oomph of American pie. They offer many ingenious toppings, but not just
to dump on: The combinations really work. The ambience is youthful,
casual, and loud; the high energy means kids aren’t out of place. The dining
room, although handsomely rebuilt, still looks from top to bottom like a
college-town pizzeria. Service is quick and friendly. The only drawback is
the restaurant’s popularity, which can make for long waits at peak times.

This restaurant is unique in Anchorage for serving interesting food even
though it’s large and oriented to the downtown tourist trade. The warm

Bold flavors amp up a long menu full of surprises. The mushroom ravioli,
with a generous dose of smoked salmon, was rich and strongly flavored.
Service is professional but not stuffy, and the food comes fast enough not to

CREATIVE/ECLECTIC
This is the most fashionable restaurant in town, and also one of the best.
The storefront dining room, in warm Southwest colors and sharp angles,
resembles a showcase for the food and diners, who can sit at tables or at
a tapas bar. The cuisine defies categorization but is consistently interest-
ing and creative, frequently with Thai influences. The menu changes, but
one consistent offering is chicken with scallops, shiitake mushrooms,
snow peas, udon noodles, ginger cream sauce, and black-bean salsa.
Vegetarians do as well as meat eaters. For lunch, the sandwiches are unfor-
gettable, with choices such as shrimp and avocado with herb cream
cheese on sourdough. Do not fail to try the tomato soup with Gorgonzola.
The beer and wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. They serve
brunch Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.

STEAK/SEAFOOD
Simon’s, as it’s known, is a jolly beef and seafood grill where voices boom
off the high ceilings. On sunny summer evenings, the rooms, fitted with
brass turn-of-the-20th-century saloon decor, fill with light off Cook Inlet,
down below the bluff; the views are magnificent. The food is consistently
good. Besides a nightly list of specials, the restaurant boasts of its
macadamia nut–stuffed halibut, but most of the cuisine is simpler — prime
rib, for example. Service is warm and professional and quick enough to
allow time for other evening activities. Children are treated well. To enjoy
the place on a budget, order a sandwich and soup for lunch in the well-
stocked bar; it’s open until 11 p.m. every night. Getting a table in the
restaurant at a reasonable hour requires advance planning in peak season
or on off-season weekends; call a couple of days ahead.

This is the happening spot downtown for breakfast or lunch. What started
as a smaller, granola-crowd place grew on the basis of hearty, tasty food
and a friendly young wait staff into a large, busy restaurant with lots of life

when you’ll rarely do better than the salmon cakes and eggs or omelets.
Breakfast is served all day. Lunch, starting at 11 a.m., includes comfort
food such as mac and cheese or meatloaf, but also unusual sandwiches,
such as roast beef and blue cheese or the delicious portobello burger. The
dinning room is light and colorful, with a clean feel, and with tables out in
the open amid lots of movement. The restaurant offers free Wi-Fi. My only
demerit: waits at busy hours. Small monthly art shows begin with artist
receptions every first Friday, a pattern shared with all the downtown gal-

Chapter 14
Exploring Anchorage
In This Chapter
 Discovering the top sights
 Getting outside and finding more to do
 Planning an Anchorage itinerary
 Shopping for Alaskan gifts and souvenirs
 Going out at night
You can find plenty to do for a few days in Anchorage, but not all 
of it is indoors. As good as the museum is, it can’t compare to
flying over Mount McKinley or climbing to the top of a rocky peak
above the city. No museum can beat a sunny day in the world’s most
spectacular places. An easy rule helps set priorities: If the sun is out,
stay outside; if it rains, check out the indoor attractions until it stops.
That’s how Alaskans do it, with one exception. They stay outside in the
rain, too.
Now, a quick note on definitions. I define anything that involves the
world out of doors as outdoors, not just bear-wrasslin’ or rock-climbing
with your fingernails. Driving to a fabulous mountain overlook or
riding in a small aircraft over a wildly rugged terrain counts as
outdoors in this book, too. So you don’t have to be active to see the
good stuff. You do, however, need an interest in nature, for participation
or observation.
Two essential indoor attractions in Anchorage are worth anyone’s time:
the Alaska Native Heritage Center and the Anchorage Museum. These
are places where you can put your Alaskan experiences in context,
adding layers of meaning beyond the sheer beauty. The zoo is fun, too,
but it’s mostly outdoors.
This chapter helps you plan your Anchorage explorations, and it
includes two maps to help you chart your course.

Hitting the Top Sights
Alaska Native Heritage Center
Glenn Highway (east of downtown)
Alaska Natives built this extraordinary center to bring their cultures to vis-
itors. It’s Alaska’s best Native cultural attraction. What makes it so is not the
graceful building or the professional and informative displays, but the
Native people themselves — real village people, who often make a personal
connection with visitors and rarely come across as practiced or distant.
The three main parts of the center take much of a day to absorb; allow
three hours, not for the exhibits, but to have time to interact with the
people. First, storytellers, dancers, and Native athletes perform in a hall
with three 30-minute programs rotating through the day. The second part
features a gallery of educational displays, and a series of workshops,
where artisans practice and show off traditional crafts, often teaching vis-
itors. Finally, don’t miss the pond surrounded by traditional Native
dwellings, each representing a cultural group, and each with a Native host.
The center has a snack bar and grill serving soup, sandwiches, and other
meals. The gift shop has inexpensive items mixed in with real Native arts
and crafts for sale by the center or on consignment from Native artisans.
The center is about the same distance from downtown as the airport, but
to the east. It’s a 10- to 20-minute drive, depending on traffic. The center
offers a free shuttle from various places in town; call for details on taking
it. Depending on the size of your party, you may prefer to rent a car on the
day you visit the center, using it later for further explorations or to go out
in the evening. Also, ask for discounts, including family admission or a
joint admission with the Anchorage Museum.
See map p. 168. 800 Heritage Center Dr. From the Glenn Highway (6th Avenue down-
town), take the North Muldoon exit. % 800-315-6608. www.alaskanative.net.
Open: Summer daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; winter call for hours and discounts. Admission: $24
adults ($10 Alaska residents), $21 seniors and military, $16 children 7–16 ($7 Alaska
residents). AE, MC, V.
The Alaska Zoo
Hillside
Alaskan animals are the zoo’s best attraction. I enjoy watching polar bears
Ahpun and Lyutyik play and swim underwater. (You can check that out on
a Webcam, too.) Gravel paths meander through the woods past large
enclosures with natural flora for bears, seals, otters, musk oxen, Dall
sheep, moose, caribou, waterfowl — all the animals you were supposed
to see in Alaska but may have missed. You can see a few exotic species
from beyond Alaska, too. You can easily spend half a day at the zoo, but if
it’s raining, you may not want to, because there is little shelter. A snack
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 181

bar serves basic meals, and a large gift shop is on-site. Getting to the zoo
requires a 20-minute drive from downtown, without traffic. (Take the New
Seward Highway to O’Malley Road, then turn left and go 2 miles.) However,
a free shuttle runs daily in the summer from downtown, timed to meet up
with two-hour naturalist tours that take place at noon and include some
backstage stops. The tours are $25 adults, half-price for children 12 and
under. The zoo has a basic snack bar and a large gift shop.

educational programs most Tues at 7 p.m., live music most Fri at 7 p.m.; off season
open daily at 10 a.m., closing time varies depending on the time of sunset. Admission:
$10 adults, $8 seniors, $6 children 3–17, free for children 2 and under. MC, V.
Anchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center
Downtown
The state’s largest museum doesn’t have its largest collection, but it has
the room and staff to teach and to serve as a center of contemporary cul-
ture for this part of the world. Most visitors tour the large Alaska Gallery,
an informative and enjoyable walk through the history and some of the
anthropology of the state. In the art galleries, you can see what’s happen-
ing in art in Alaska today; Alaskan art isn’t all scenery and walrus ivory,
but the grandeur of the state does influence almost every work. The
Anchorage museum also gets the best touring and temporary exhibits.
Depending on your interest, you could spend most of a day there. The
restaurant, operated by the excellent Marx Brothers Cafe (see Chapter 13),
serves some of the best lunches to be had downtown. The shop is an excel-
lent place to buy authentic Alaska Native art. A $100-million expansion
project is underway, with completion anticipated in 2010.
See map p. 173. 121 W. 7th Ave., Anchorage. % 907-343-4326. www.anchorage
museum.org. Open: May 15–Sept 15 daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Sept 16–May 14 Tues–Sat
10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors 65 and over, free
for children 17 and under.
Getting Outdoors: Summer 
and Winter in the City
In most cities, you have to go somewhere else for a natural outdoor
experience. In Anchorage, you may be able to do it right from your hotel.
The city is a shallow scratch of civilization on a vast wilderness. You find
big parks with plenty of wildlife mixed in among the cars and strip malls.
Just beyond the last houses, but still within the city limits, is Chugach
State Park, one of the largest and most beautiful in the nation (indeed,
many national parks don’t come close). You can drive right to some of
its most impressive views.
If you miss the outdoors, you’re missing the whole point of Anchorage.
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
182

I cover some indispensable outdoor day trips in Chapter 15. Although
you can’t do them all, you should do at least one. Here, I cover the top
outdoor places and activities right in town, including activities that take
place far afield but begin and end at the airport here (such as flightsee-
ing and fly-in fishing).
In town, the city’s bike trails connect through greenbelts whose sooth-
ing, creekside woods span the noisy, asphalt urban core. Kincaid Park
and Far North Bicentennial Park are both on the trail system within the
city and encompass scores of miles of trails for Nordic skiing, mountain-
biking, and horseback-riding. The Chugach Mountains, which form the
backdrop to the town, offer tundra hiking, backpacking, mountain-
biking, and climbs that range from easy to technical. Or you can just
drive up and take a look at the view.
Summertime outdoor activities
Don’t be overwhelmed by the length of this section. I can only boil down
warm-weather activities so far while still offering something for every
ability level. Use the alphabetized listing here to jump to what you’re
interested in doing, and then choose a place to match your interests and
energy level.
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 183
Gearing up in Anchorage
You can rent almost anything you need for outdoor activities in Anchorage. The city also
may be the best place to stock up and gear up before heading out on the next leg of your
trip, renting a canoe, bike, skis or camping equipment here to carry with your rental car.
 Backcountry gear and Nordic skis: You can get advice and rent cross-country skis,
snowshoes, bear-proof containers, and mountaineering equipment at Alaska
Mountaineering and Hiking, 2633 Spenard Rd. (% 907-272-1811; www.alaska
mountaineering.com). It’s a small shop where the staff takes the time to help
you plan a trip. A block away, at 1200 W. Northern Lights Blvd., REI has a much larger
store (% 907-272-4565; www.rei.com) that rents a wide range of gear, including
lightweight canoes and touring kayaks with car-top carriers, camping gear, tents,
packs, sleeping bags, and cross-country skis (but not bikes or ice-climbing gear); it
also carries the town’s best stock of outdoor athletic clothing.
 Bikes: Try Downtown Bicycle Rental (% 907-279-5293; www.alaska-bike-
rentals.com), at 4th Avenue and C Street. Rates start at $16 for three hours, $4
additional hour, max $30 per day. The shop also carries tandems, kids’ bikes, and
trailers.
 Downhill skis: Each of the downhill ski areas listed in the “Wintertime outdoor activ-
ities” section, later in this chapter, has a full rental operation.
 Ice skates: Skates rent for $10 a day at Champions Choice, in the University Center
Mall at Old Seward Highway and 36th Avenue (% 907-563-3503).

Biking and walking on pavement
Anchorage has an award-winning network of paved bike trails spanning
the city along wooded greenbelts. You rarely see a building and almost
always cross roads and rail lines through tunnels and over bridges, so
you’re never in traffic. Here are two of the best:
 Tony Knowles Coastal Trail: Leading 10 miles from the western
end of 2nd Avenue along the shore to Kincaid Park, the coastal
trail is a unique pathway to the natural environment from the heart
of downtown and is among my favorite things about Anchorage.
I’ve been stopped by moose so many times on the trail between
Earthquake Park and Kincaid that it’s become a darned nuisance;
closer to downtown, I’ve ridden parallel to beluga whales swim-
ming along the trail at high tide (just once). The most popular
entry is at Elderberry Park, at the western end of 5th Avenue.
Westchester Lagoon, a large dammed pond, is ten blocks south
of Elderberry Park, making for a lovely stroll. It’s an equally enjoy-
able destination for a picnic or to feed the ducks and geese. A
couple of miles farther, the trail arrives at Earthquake Park and
Point Woronzof, mentioned in the upcoming section, “Driving to
beautiful places.”
 Lanie Fleischer Chester Creek Trail: Starting at an intersection
with the Coastal Trail at Westchester Lagoon, the trail runs about 4
miles east along the greenbelt to Goose Lake, where you can swim
in a cool woodland pond at the end of a hot bike ride — still,
improbably enough, in the middle of the city. In the summer, you’ll
often find snacks for sale and boats for rent there, too. South from
the lake, a wooded trail leads partway through the University of
Alaska Anchorage campus.
Driving to beautiful places
If you’re not up to muscle-powered sports, and you don’t want to 
spend the money it takes to go flightseeing, you can still get a taste of
Anchorage’s beauty behind the wheel of a rental car. Here are directions
to some lovely places in town (don’t miss the day trips mentioned in
Chapter 15, either):
 Glen Alps Overlook: High in the mountains above Anchorage, the
popular trailhead also has a short, easy trail to a spectacular over-
look with interpretive signs. For directions, see “Hiking and moun-
tain-biking,” later in this chapter.
 Point Woronzof: A parking lot here sits atop a bluff over the edge
of Cook Inlet with the best sunset views in town and a clear view of
Mount McKinley in good weather. A short walk on a pathway down
the bluff leads to a broad sand and pebble beach. Drive west on
Northern Lights Boulevard, past Earthquake Park (see the
“Discovering More Cool Things to See and Do” section, later in this
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
184

chapter). You’ll have to pass by an airport security booth, which is
normally unoccupied. After the road makes a sharp left above the
water, look for the sign on the right.
 Potters Marsh: A boardwalk leads into an enormous wetland rich in
waterfowl and other bird life. Take the New Seward Highway south,
turning left just past the Rabbit Creek exit.
Fishing
Hatchery salmon run in many of Anchorage’s streams, and stocked
trout, salmon, or char in more than 28 lakes, so you need not leave town
to catch a fish. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game, 333 Raspberry
Rd., Anchorage (% 907-267-2218; www.alaska.gov/adfg, click on
Sport Fisheries and then navigate using the maps), publishes informa-
tive booklets on the Web and on paper, as well as an online fishing
report updated weekly in season. There’s also a recorded information
line (% 907-267-2503) with what’s hot and lots of other advice.
 Fly-in fishing: Use Anchorage as a base from which to fly to a
remote lake or river with a lot of fish and not many other people.
Even folks who are unenthusiastic about fishing may find such a
flight an unforgettable experience. The plane lifts off from
Anchorage’s Lake Hood floatplane base and within half an hour
smoothly lands on a remote lake or river. You climb out and watch
as the plane lifts off and disappears, leaving behind the kind of
silence unique to true wilderness. Taking a guided outing is a good
opportunity to learn how to hook a salmon. I’ve heard people com-
plain of how sore their arms got from pulling in too many. It’s on
such trips that avid anglers are made — or spoiled.
Several companies offer fly-in trips; among the largest is Rust’s
Flying Service (% 800-544-2299 or 907-243-1595; www.flyrusts.
com). They can take you out guided or on your own, for the day or
for a longer stay in a cabin or lodge. If you fly to a lake, they’ll pro-
vide a boat. They can’t make fish appear if none are running, but
they will try to take you to the hot spots. You can bring your own
gear, or they can provide it. Prices for an unguided day trip start at
around $240 per person, with a two-person minimum; guided, $435.
Pickup from your hotel is included, but fishing licenses are extra.
 Roadside fishing (unguided): Although the setting (under a high-
way bridge in an industrial area) may not be the wilderness experi-
ence you’ve dreamed about, the 25- to 40-pound king salmon you
pull from Ship Creek may make up for it. From downtown, just walk
down the hill to the railroad yard. A couple of shacks sell and rent
gear in the summer. Fishing for kings is best in June and for silvers
in August and September. Fish only on the rising tide, when the fish
come into the creek. Fishing near the end of the rising tide will
mean crossing less mud, but one successful angler I know insists
it’s the start of the tide that’s best. Either way, you’ll need rubber
boots, preferably neoprene chest waders, for the muddy banks, but
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 185

don’t go too far out, as the mud flats are dangerous and several
times every summer the fire department has to rescue stuck fisher-
men. Bird Creek, 25 miles south of Anchorage on the Seward
Highway (see Chapter 15), carries a strong hatchery run of silver
salmon, peaking in August. When silver fishing is hot, it gets
crowded. Pink salmon run from late June through early August in
even-numbered years. Other creeks along this stretch of highway
have similar but smaller runs.
Flightseeing and bear-viewing
If Anchorage is the heart of Alaska’s transportation system, small planes
are the blood cells. Anchorage hosts several busy airports and, of these,
Lake Hood is the world’s busiest floatplane base. Many providers offer
flightseeing tours. If you’re planning to travel to Talkeetna or Denali
National Park (see Chapter 19) or Juneau or Glacier Bay National Park
(see Chapter 20), it may be wise to save your flightseeing splurge for
those extraordinary places. Likewise, for bear-viewing flights, Homer
(see Chapter 16), Juneau (see Chapter 20), and Katmai National Park or
Kodiak (see Chapter 24) are closer to the action. On the other hand,
plenty of spectacular territory is near Anchorage, and, if time is short,
you can see bears or Denali in an afternoon. I recommend Rust’s Flying
Service (see the preceding section), a reliable operator that has
designed a menu of choices around visitors’ most common interests.
They can take you on a floatplane ride for as little as $95. A flight to see
Mount McKinley (without landing) is $295 and takes three hours. An all-
day bear-viewing tour from Anchorage is $560 to $750 per person. The
exact destination — Lake Clark, Katmai National Park, or somewhere
else — depends on where bears are active when you’re traveling. Of
course, all air-service prices vary according to fuel costs, so use these
only as a general guide.
Hiking and mountain-biking
Choices of where to hike or mountain-bike are arranged in order of con-
venience to downtown, but all are best reached by rental car.
 Kincaid Park: Covered in more detail later in this chapter, under
“Skiing,” Kincaid Park is an idyllic summer setting for mountain-
biking and day hikes. Moose are sighted daily on the wide dirt and
grass trails that snake for about 40 miles through the birch and
white spruce of the park’s hilly 1,500 acres of boreal forest. You get
many views of the sea and mountains beyond. Within the park,
wooded Little Campbell Lake is a picturesque swimming hole, and a
fun spot for family canoeing and fishing for stocked trout, salmon,
and char; however, it has no lifeguard. The park also has an 18-hole
Frisbee golf course. To get here from downtown, take Minnesota
Drive (I Street) south beyond the airport interchange to Raspberry
Road, which leads to the park. Be certain to park outside the park if
staying late, as the gates are locked at 10 p.m.
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
186

 Far North Bicentennial Park: The 4,000-acre park, on the east side
of town (also known as the Campbell Tract), is a unique patch of
urban wilderness, a habitat for bear, moose, and spawning salmon.
People use it for dog-mushing and skiing in winter, and for day-
hiking and exceptional mountain-biking in summer. The Alaska
Botanical Garden and Hilltop Ski Area are both within the park’s
boundaries. A good place to start a hike or ride through the woods
is the Campbell Creek Science Center (% 907-267-1257; www.
blm.gov/ak/sciencecenter), an educational facility where staff
are often on hand to answer questions and you can consult books
and maps and admire a big aquarium of native fish. To get there
from downtown, take Gambell Street (which becomes New Seward
Highway) south to Dowling Road, go east (toward the mountains),
and turn right on Lake Otis Road and left on 68th Avenue, following
it to the end, and then left at the BLM Campbell Tract entrance
sign. Note that the park is home to potentially dangerous brown
bears that fish from the creek; observe signs closing trails, and
stick to daylight hours for hiking or biking.
 Glen Alps Trailhead and Flattop Mountain: You can find many
ways to reach the alpine tundra, intoxicating fresh air, and cine-
matic views of the Chugach Mountains behind Anchorage, but the
easiest and best developed are at Chugach State Park’s Glen Alps
Trailhead. Even if you’re not up to hiking, a drive and a walk on a
short, paved overlook loop with incredible views and good inter-
pretive signs is well worth the effort. (Payment of the $5 day-use
fee is not required for those visiting only the overlook.) If you’re
ready for a hike, you can start at the trailhead for trips of up to sev-
eral days, following the network of trails or taking off across dry,
alpine tundra by yourself, but largely within cellphone range.
Camping is permitted anywhere off the trails.
Flattop Mountain is the most popular hike from the Glen Alps
Trailhead, so it can be a bit crowded on weekends. It’s a steep after-
noon hike, easy for fit adults and doable for school-age children.
Watch out for a bit of a scramble near the summit and be sure to
stick to the painted markers on the rocks. Also, don’t forget to
dress warmly and don’t go in the rain, when slick rocks can be haz-
ardous. For a longer or less steep hike or a mountain-biking trip,
follow the broad gravel trail that leads up the valley from the Glen
Alps Trailhead to several other great routes. Trails lead all the way
over the mountains to Indian or Bird Creek, on Turnagain Arm, up
some of the mountains along the way, or to round alpine lakes in
high, rocky valleys. You’re always above the tree line, so you don’t
need to follow a trail if you have a good map. The area is wonderful
backpacking country.
To get to the Glen Alps trailhead, take New Seward Highway to
O’Malley Road, head east toward the mountains, then turn right on
Hillside Drive and left onto Upper Huffman Road. Finally, turn right
on the narrow, twisting Toilsome Hill Drive. Don’t forget to bring
cash for a self-service day-use fee of $5.
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 187

 Eagle River Valley and Crow Pass: The Eagle River Nature Center,
at the end of Eagle River Road, 12 miles up Eagle River Valley from
the Glenn Highway exit (% 907-694-2108; www.ernc.org), is like a
public wilderness lodge, with hands-on naturalist displays about
the area and guided nature walks or talks daily in the summer and
weekends year-round (2 p.m. weekends; call for other times).
Operated by a nonprofit concessionaire for Chugach State Park, it’s
open June through August Sunday through Thursday 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Friday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; May and September
Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; October through April
Friday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There’s a $5 parking fee.
Outside the center, the 3⁄4-mile Rodak Nature Trail, with interpre-
tive signs, leads to a viewing platform over a beaver pond. The
Albert Loop Trail is a 3-mile route; a geology guide from the center
matches with numbered posts on the way. Both trails have good
bird- and wildlife-watching. The 25-mile Crow Pass Trail, a portion
of the historic Iditarod Trail, continues as a backpacking route up
the valley and across the mountains to Girdwood (see Chapter 15).
To use it for a day hike of around 6 miles, loop back to the starting
point on the Dew Mound Trail.
 Thunderbird Falls and Eklutna Lake: The hike to Thunderbird
Falls is an easy, 1-mile forest walk with a good reward at the end: a
view of the falls (possible without making the steep final descent to
their base). The trail is easy to find: Take Glenn Highway north to
the Thunderbird Falls exit, 25 miles from Anchorage. You can visit
Eklutna Lake on the same outing. From the falls, continue 10 miles
up the Eklutna Lake Road until you come to the glacial lake, a place
for canoeing, hiking, and exceptional mountain-biking. The
Lakeside Trail leads 14 miles to Eklutna Glacier, with lake views
along the way. (Doing the whole thing and back is too much for a
day trip.) Rental bikes, kayaks, and other equipment, as well as
guided kayak tours, are available through Lifetime Adventures,
with a booth at the trailhead (% 907-746-4644; www.lifetime
adventures.net). For $75, you can kayak 8 miles to the other end
of the lake and pick up a bike there to ride back. This glacial melt is
also where Anchorage gets most of its city water. People bottle it
and sell it as “glacier water.”
Rafting
Several whitewater rivers are within a 90-minute drive of Anchorage.
NOVA (% 800-746-5753 or 907-745-5753; www.novalaska.com) has
more than 30 years of experience offering multi-day trips all over the
state, and five different half-day floats in the Anchorage area. Various
rafting trips are available, ranging from the relatively easygoing
Matanuska and Kings rivers to the class IV and V white water of Six-Mile
Creek, which begins with a required instructional swim and includes 
fun optional swims. That wild white water is about an hour south of
Anchorage on the Seward Highway. White-water rafting always entails
risk, but NOVA’s schedule allows you to calibrate how wild you want to
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
188

get, and the company offers add-ons for self-paddling, helicopter flight-
seeing, or glacier hiking. The half-day trips range in price from $75 to
$135. Children 5 to 11 can go on the calmer Matanuska River float for
$45. Other trips are suitable only for older children and adults. You’ll
need your own transportation to the river, and you may need to bring
your own lunch.
If you want to go rafting without traveling to Matanuska River or Six-Mile
Creek, you can save time and money by taking a shorter, less-dramatic
ride closer to town on Eagle River. A white-water ride is as little as $35
with Lifetime Adventures (% 907-746-4644; www.lifetimeadventures.
net), and they have longer floats that encompass more smooth-water
floating. In summer, the rides leave several times a day every day.
Sea-kayaking
Except at Eklutna Lake (see “Hiking and mountain-biking,” earlier),
kayaking day trips from Anchorage go through Whittier, on Prince
William Sound (see Chapter 15).
Wintertime outdoor activities
If you don’t enjoy winter sports, Anchorage during the snowy months
(usually Nov–Mar) probably isn’t for you. Less-active summer activities
such as fishing, walking, or driving are difficult, impossible, or chilly. But
cold weather doesn’t feel so cold when you’re active. Skiers and snow-
mobilers pray for snow. And around here, their prayers get answered
pretty consistently.
Ice skating
Westchester Lagoon, just ten blocks from downtown (see “Biking and
walking on pavement,” earlier in this chapter), is a skating paradise in
the winter. When the ice gets thick enough, usually by mid-December,
the city clears a large rink and over a mile of wide paths that wind
across the pond, mopping the ice regularly for a smooth surface. Skaters
gather around burn barrels, to socialize and warm their hands, and on
weekends, vendors often sell hot chocolate and coffee.
Skiing
Kincaid Park is one of the best cross-country skiing areas in the coun-
try, with the first World Cup–certified trails in the United States. More
than 40 miles of trails are geared to every ability level, with the majority
intermediate and expert. Superb trails aside, Kincaid is a beautiful place
to ski, with rolling hills of open birch and spruce and views of the moun-
tains and ocean. Trails are groomed for skating and classical techniques.
Ten miles are lighted (important on short winter days). The Kincaid
Park Outdoor Center (% 907-343-6397) is open daily from 10 a.m. to
9:45 p.m., with shorter hours on holidays. A gate closes at 10 p.m., so
park outside it if you plan on skiing later. Skiing usually lasts through
March. Big races occur in February and early March.
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 189

Far North Bicentennial Park also has some excellent trails — 20 miles
total, 41⁄3 miles lighted — and a slightly longer season because of its hill-
side location. Start at Hilltop Ski Area.
Many other parks and bike trails have lengthy skiing routes, too, many of
them lighted. You can ski right from downtown on the Tony Knowles
Coastal Trail. (See the “Gearing up in Anchorage” sidebar, earlier in this
chapter, for ski rentals.)
Anchorage has several downhill ski areas. The best, Alyeska Resort,
is described in the Girdwood section of Chapter 15. Hilltop Ski Area,
7015 Abbott Rd. (% 907-346-2167; www.hilltopskiarea.org), in
Bicentennial Park in town, is a great place to learn to ski, with one long
beginner slope. One-day lift tickets are $22 to $28, and ski package
rentals are around the same price.
Snowmobiling
Glacier City Snowmobile Tours (% 877-783-5566 or 907-783-5566;
www.snowtours.net) operates out of the Great Alaskan Tourist Trap gift
shop in the shopping center on the Seward Highway. Guides suit up
clients — most of whom have never been on a snowmobile — and drive
them to a promising site, determined according to snow conditions. At
best, the winter tours make it all the way to Spencer Glacier. Groups are
no larger than six and the attitude is casual: After a brief introduction,
you’re driving your own machine, using your own judgment. The entire
outing lasts as long as six hours, with three-and-a-half hours of riding.
The cost is $225 per person.
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
190
Answering outdoors questions
The Alaska Public Lands Information Center, at 5th Avenue and F Street downtown
(% 907-271-2737; www.nps.gov/anch), offers guidance for outdoor activities all
over the state, especially around Anchorage. For information on the bike trails, cross-
country skiing parks, and other city recreation, contact Anchorage Parks & Recreation
(% 907-343-4355; www.muni.org/parks). Cross-country skiers can get information
from the Nordic Ski Association of Anchorage (% 907-276-7609; www.anchorage
nordicski.com). Get advice about Chugach State Park from the public lands center
or directly from the park (% 907-345-5014; www.dnr.state.ak.us/parks/
units/chugach/index.htm). Their Ridgelines newspaper is packed with useful
information about the park, including a map adequate for most day-hikers, and is avail-
able for download at www.alaskageographic.org (click Trip Planning). The best
trail guide to the entire region is Helen Nienhueser and John Wolfe, Jr.’s 55 Ways to the
Wilderness (The Mountaineers), which is available in any bookstore in the area. An
excellent trail map is the Chugach State Park map published by Imus Geographics and
sold at either of the sporting goods stores mentioned in the “Gearing up in Anchorage”
sidebar, earlier in this chapter.

Discovering More Cool Things to See and Do
These ideas can be part of a fun visit to Anchorage. I’ve arranged them
starting with the choices that you can reach on foot downtown, followed
by attractions you need wheels to reach.
Downtown
 Tour an old house. The Oscar Anderson House Museum (% 907-
274-2336), on a beautiful site in downtown’s Elderberry Park over
the water, shows how an early Swedish butcher and entrepreneur
lived. The quaint house dates from the city’s founding in 1915. The
45-minute guided tour gives a good overview of Anchorage’s his-
tory. Admission is $3 adults, $1 children 5 through 12, and it’s open
summer only Monday through Friday from noon to 5 p.m. If you
come in early December, don’t miss the Swedish Christmas tours.
 Visit a quirky little museum. Downtown at 245 W. 5th Ave., the free
Alaska State Troopers Museum (% 800-770-5050 or 907-279-5050;
www.alaskatroopermuseum.com) is a prideful trove of law-
enforcement insignia, police equipment, a 1952 Hudson Hornet,
photographs, and other memorabilia.
 Entertain the kids with science. A fun little children’s science
museum called The Imaginarium (% 907-276-3179; www.
imaginarium.org) lies in the heart of the downtown visitor area
at 737 W. 5th Ave. A strong Alaska theme imbues many of the dis-
plays, including the highlight, a saltwater touch tank that is like an
indoor tide pool. Admission is $5.50 adults, $5 seniors 65 and over
and children 2 to 12. The museum is open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.
 Walk at the speed of light. A scale model of the solar system
begins with the sun in the plaza at 5th Avenue and G Street, with
the planets spread clear across town. Walking pace equals the
speed of light, so Earth, a few blocks west, is eight minutes away,
just as it takes the sun’s energy eight minutes to reach us. The
model is beautifully made and informative. The route between plan-
ets (and out the coastal trail up to Pluto in Kincaid Park, more than
five hours away) is the best walk in Anchorage.
Beyond downtown
 Walk a wooded garden trail. The Alaska Botanical Garden
(% 907-770-3692; www.alaskabg.org) is a pleasant place to learn
about native flora and some of the garden flowers and herbs that
grow in Alaska. The plantings are in a few small clearings con-
nected by gravel paths on thickly wooded grounds at the edge of a
large wildland park. The Lowenfels Family Nature Trail is a 1-mile
loop with a guide brochure that is pitched at an unusually thought-
ful level. Along the walk is a chance to see salmon in Campbell
Creek. Those without strong interest in gardening or native plants
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 191

may find other attractions more deserving of limited time, however,
especially considering the drive from downtown, which is 20 min-
utes without traffic, and possibly twice that at rush hour. Take New
Seward Highway (Gambell Street) to Tudor Road, exit to the east
(left), turn right off Tudor onto Campbell Airstrip Road, and park at
the Benny Benson School. A $5 donation is requested, $10 per
family; the garden is open in summer during daylight hours.
 See the remains of the continent’s biggest earthquake. On Good
Friday in 1964, the biggest earthquake ever recorded in North
America hit Southcentral Alaska, registering 9.2 on the Richter
scale, killing 131 people, and flattening much of the region.
Earthquake Park preserves some of the landscape that was
thrown into a chaos of slides, cracks, and wave-like humps, and a
sculpture and interpretive signs have been added to commemorate
and explain the event. Anyone can get to the interpretive area, but
the land devastated by the earthquake is overgrown and requires
climbing through the brush on an unmaintained trail. From near 
the memorial, walk downward on the paved Coastal Trail, and then
choose one of the informal trails that make off into the woods.
Earthquake Park is also a good access point to the Coastal Trail. 
To drive to the park from downtown, take L Street (which becomes
Minnesota Drive) to Northern Lights Boulevard and turn right. The
park is on your right after you pass the last houses.
 See a mysterious Native cemetery. The Athabascan village of
Eklutna has a fascinating old cemetery, still in use, in which a
highly decorated spirit house, the size of a large dollhouse,
encloses each grave. These little shelters excite the imagination in
a way no ordinary marker can. Two small Russian Orthodox
churches are also on the tribal Eklutna Historic Site (% 907-688-
6026), including one built of logs sometime before 1870, making it
among the oldest buildings in the Southcentral region. Guides give
an introductory talk and then you can walk through on your own.
Admission is $5 adults, $3 children 10 to 18, free for children 9 and
under. The site is open in summer Monday through Friday 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m., Saturday and Sunday noon to 4 p.m., Sunday 1 to 4 p.m.;
it’s closed in the off season. Wear mosquito repellent. To find it,
drive the Glenn Highway 26 miles to the Eklutna exit, and then go
left over the overpass. If you come out this far, don’t miss the
Thunderbird Falls, described earlier in this chapter under “Hiking
and mountain-biking.”
 Attend a summer-league baseball game. Perhaps the best way to
spend a fresh June or July evening in Anchorage is at Mulcahy
Stadium, watching the Anchorage Glacier Pilots (% 907-274-3627;
www.glacierpilots.com) or the Anchorage Bucs (% 907-561-
2827; www.anchoragebucs.com). You hear, smell, and feel the
rhythm of the game when you sit in the tiny park. The teams are
made up of college players spending their summer in the six-team
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
192

Alaska League. Among famed alumni are Mark McGwire, Rick
Aguilera, Tom Seaver, Dave Winfield, Barry Bonds, Wally Joyner,
and Randy Johnson. Check the Anchorage Daily News or the team
Web sites for game times. Mulcahy is at 16th Avenue and A Street, a
long walk or a short drive from downtown. Tickets are around $5.
Dress warmly for evening; a blanket is rarely out of order.
Seeing Anchorage by Guided Tour
Gray Line of Alaska’s Anchorage Highlights Tour (% 800-544-2206;
www.graylineofalaska.com) takes three hours to visit the Ship Creek
area below downtown and the Alaska Native Heritage Center. It spends
an hour at the center, not as long as I like to stay. The tour costs $49 for
adults, half-price for children 12 and younger, and includes admission to
the center. The company’s bus tours to Portage Glacier are covered in
the next chapter.
Spending One, Two, or Three 
Days in Anchorage
If I had a nickel for every time I’ve been asked, “What should I do in just
one day in Anchorage?” I’d have a big bag of nickels. I long ago gave up
asking people to read over all the options I’ve written about and make
choices based on their own interests. So here are ideas for how to
spend one, two, or three days in Anchorage, with my standard dis-
claimer: I think Alaska is about nature and the outdoors, even in the
state’s biggest city. So if you ask my advice, I’m going to send you out
under the sky. Also, consider the day trips from the city that I cover in
Chapter 15.
For simplicity’s sake, I’ve set up these itineraries with the assumption that
you’re staying downtown, but they work from anywhere in Anchorage.
Also, I don’t list these days in order of priority: Choose any of the three for
a great one-day itinerary, or pair them up in any combination. You can find
more information throughout this chapter about the attractions men-
tioned in the itineraries. For details on lodging and dining recommenda-
tions, check out Chapter 13.
Day 1 in Anchorage
In the morning, head out to the Alaska Native Heritage Center to meet
Alaska’s indigenous people and discover their culture. Arrive there close
to the 9 a.m. opening time so that you can get back downtown for lunch.
Eat casually but well at the Glacier Brewhouse, and then check out the
shops in the area, including the string of galleries and offbeat businesses
along G Street. When you’re done shopping, walk five blocks west on 5th
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 193

Avenue to Elderberry Park, where you’ll find the Tony Knowles Coastal
Trail and the sea. Walk the coastal trail to see the ocean, mud flats, and
wildlife, or rent bikes at a nearby booth at 5th Avenue and L Street and
ride the trail. The ducks of West Chester Lagoon make a good, close des-
tination; in less than an hour, you can bike to Earthquake Park and
Point Woronzof. If you’re a hard-core bicyclist, you can ride 10 miles
(one-way) all the way through the woods to Kincaid Park. At the end of
your coastal-trail sojourn, back at Elderberry Park, you’ll be a block
from one of the best restaurants in town, Simon & Seafort’s (but you
must reserve a table a day or two ahead).
Day 2 in Anchorage
This morning, gather sweaters, jackets, and a picnic, and drive to the
Glen Alps Trailhead for a hike (or mountain bike) above the tree line
with wonderful views and clear, crisp air. You can stay the whole day,
or spend the afternoon at the Alaska Zoo, on the drive back. Afterward,
go for a special dinner at Jens’, which takes up the evening.
Day 3 in Anchorage
Start the day at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art. See the
Alaska Gallery for a survey of Alaska’s history and culture and then
check out art galleries for the best attempts at capturing Alaska on
canvas. Lunch at the Marx Brother’s Cafe at the Museum. Now drive
out the Glenn Highway to the Eagle River Valley and the nature
center and trails there, perhaps joining a naturalist program. If time
remains, drive a bit farther to see Thunderbird Falls and the Eklutna
Historical Park. Back in town, catch a summer-league baseball
game at Mulcahy Stadium and enjoy hot dogs and beer under the 
midnight sun.
Saving Time for Alaska Shopping
You can buy any of Alaska’s unique creations in Anchorage — Alaska
Native arts and crafts, furs, and fine art. The city has some of the state’s
best galleries and all its largest fur shops, and it’s big enough to have a
few quirky, offbeat shops, too.
Finding the best shopping areas
Most of the shopping choices that interest visitors are downtown, and
all are within walking distance of one another. I’ve identified two clusters
of the best shops.
4th Avenue Market Place (and nearby)
Fourth Avenue is Anchorage’s old-time main street. Although mostly flat-
tened by the 1964 earthquake, it remains an active center of street life in
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
194

the summertime. The centerpiece is a small shopping mall on the north
side between C and D streets, which houses a Native arts-and-crafts mall
and entertainment center, collecting together Alaska Native businesses
(www.4thavenuemarket.com). The Two Spirits Gallery, owned by the
Cook Inlet Tribal Council, presents carvers and artists working on-site
every day. Alaska Natives cultural groups are scheduled to perform in the
common area June through August Monday through Saturday at 11:15
a.m. On the eastern end of the building, take in large, interesting graphics
about the 1964 earthquake and other historic topics. A theater shows a
dizzying large-format film on Alaska and an interactive earthquake exhibit,
which has been popular for a quarter century at another location.
Here are a few other highlights of the area:
 The Rusty Harpoon, just north at 411 W. 4th Ave., just west of the
Market Place (www.rustyharpoongifts.com), carries authentic
Native crafts, handmade jewelry, and distinctive gifts, and is staffed
by reliable long-time proprietors.
 The International Gallery of Contemporary Art, half a block
south of 4th at 427 D St. (www.igcaalaska.org), is a nonprofit
space dedicated to in-depth exploration of just a few artists’ work
at a time. Because it’s run by volunteers, hours are short and
changeable: Wednesday through Sunday noon to 4 p.m., Tuesday
5:30 to 8:30 p.m.
 If you’re in the market for gear to keep you warm at –40°F (–40°C),
or if you’re just curious, check out the Army Navy Store, 320 W. 4th
Ave. (www.army-navy-store.com).
 The 5th Avenue Mall, between 5th and 6th avenues and C and E
streets, is Alaska’s largest upscale shopping center, anchored by
Nordstrom and JCPenney, with a large food court on the top level
and scores of shops arrayed around a tall atrium. Most of the
stores are national chains.
A walk down G Street
G Street from 5th to 3rd avenues has the city’s greatest concentration of
interesting and unusual shops. Here are some highlights, starting on 6th
Avenue and working north:
 Aurora Fine Arts, at 5th and G (737 W. 5th Ave.), contains fine art
and more affordable items: prints, crafts, gifts, and other creations
in a pleasingly cluttered environment.
 Right across G street, at 423 G St., the Alaska Glass Gallery
(www.alaskaglassgallery.com) shows fanciful and dramatic
glass sculptures by Alaskan Cynthia England and other artists in a
light-filled storefront.
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 195

 Three good spots to meet people, eat, and drink are on this block:
Uncle Joe’s Pizzeria (428 G St.) for pie, Darwin’s Theory (426 G
St.) for booze, and Side Street Espresso (412 G St.) for java.
 Suzis’ Woollies, 420 G. St. (www.suziswoollies.com), is a Celtic
shop carrying imported sweaters, jewelry, and CDs, with live Irish
music on Saturday afternoons.
 Tracy Anna Bader Design Studio, 416 G St. (www.tracyanna.com),
is a shop of bright, graphic wearable art.
 Across the street, at 4th and G, is Cabin Fever, one of the classier
gift shops in town.
 And finally, the next block north contains Artique, 314 G St.
(www.artiqueltd.com), a high-end gallery of popular work that
also has a large print collection.
Anchorage Market
If you can be in town on a weekend during the summer, be sure to visit
the Anchorage Market (www.anchoragemarkets.com), held all day
Saturday and Sunday from mid-May through mid-September in the park-
ing lot at 3rd Avenue and E Street. It’s a huge street fair with food, music,
and hundreds of miscellaneous booths.
What to look for and where to find it
Shoppers are hunters or gatherers. If you’re looking for something in
particular, you’re a hunter, and this section is for you.
Alaska Native arts and crafts
Many stores in Anchorage carry Native Alaskan arts and crafts. Before
making major purchases, know what you’re buying. You can read up 
on this subject in Chapter 5. In the Bush, you’ll find lower prices but a
smaller selection.
Nowhere else can you find a business like the Oomingmak Musk Ox
Producers’ Co-operative (% 888-360-9665 outside Alaska or 907-272-
9225; www.qiviut.com), located in the house with the musk ox on the
side at 6th Avenue and H Street. Owned by 250 Alaska Native women in
villages across the state, the co-op sells only scarves and other items
they knit of qiviut (ki-vee-oot), the light, warm, silky underhair of the
musk ox, which is collected from shedding animals. Each village has its
own knitting pattern. They’re expensive — adult caps are $130 to $180 —
but the quality is extraordinary.
The Alaska Native Arts Foundation Gallery, at 6th Avenue and E Street
(www.alaskanativearts.org), is a nonprofit promoting the best work
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
196

of indigenous artists, both in traditional and contemporary forms. The
gallery hosts shows dedicated to individual artists in a light, open space;
another area shows a mix of pieces. The Web site is well worth a visit
and has an online shopping function.
The shop at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art has superb
Native art. The Alaska Native Heritage Center shows original work, too,
mostly crafts. The Rusty Harpoon, 411 W. 4th Ave. (www.rustyharpoon
gifts.com), has authentic Native items, less-expensive crafts, and 
reliable proprietors. Likewise, the tiny Yankee Whaler, in the lobby of
the Hotel Captain Cook, at 5th Avenue and I Street, is a well-regarded
shop carrying Native arts.
Probably the best place for Native crafts in Anchorage is the Hospital
Auxiliary Craft Shop in the Alaska Native Medical Center, off Tudor east
of Bragaw (call % 907-729-1122 for directions), where everything is
made by Alaska Natives who alone are eligible to use the hospital. The
work you find here is all authentic and entirely traditional. The shop is
open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the first and
third Saturday of the month from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The shop does not
accept credit cards. You can see exceptional Native art on the walls of
the hospital, too.
Furs
If you’re in the market for a fur, Anchorage has a wide selection and no
sales tax. David Green Master Furrier, 130 W. 4th Ave. (% 907-277-9595;
www.davidgreenfurs.com), is an Anchorage institution. Others are
nearby.
Gifts
You’ll find lots of places to buy both mass-produced and inexpensive
handmade crafts that aren’t from the Bush. The Anchorage Market
street fair, every summer weekend in the parking lot at 3rd Avenue and 
E Street, has hundreds of booths (see the previous section). You won’t
have any trouble finding gift shops on 4th, including the ones I mention
earlier in this chapter. The Kobuk Coffee Company (www.kobukcoffee.
com), at 5th Avenue and E Street next to the town square, occupies one
of Anchorage’s earliest commercial buildings; it’s a cozy little candy,
coffee, and collectibles shop with a tiny space to sit down for a hot cup
in back. In midtown, on International Airport Road between the Old and
New Seward highways, Alaska Wild Berry Products (www.alaskawild
berryproducts.com) is a fun but touristy store to visit, where visitors
come by the busload. Inside are a chocolate waterfall and a big window
where you can watch the candy factory at work. Outside, they’ve built
an area like a little theme park in the woods where you can stroll. The
chocolate-covered-berry jellies sold here are addictive.
Chapter 14: Exploring Anchorage 197

Fine art
Downtown has several galleries, the best of which I mention earlier
under “4th Avenue Market Place (and nearby)” and “A walk down G
Street.” Openings at all the galleries happen on the first Friday of each
month, allowing for an evening of party-hopping to meet artists and non-
tourists of like interests.
Getting Out in the Evening
Anchorage isn’t exactly a nightlife capital, but you can always find some-
thing to do in the evening.
Attending the performing arts
To find out what’s happening, pick up the Friday edition of the Anchorage
Daily News or check their exhaustive event and music scene calendar
online, at www.adn.com/play. For the larger venues in town, the agency is
Ticketmaster (% 907-562-4800; www.ticketmaster.com), which also sell
through Fred Meyer grocery stores. The Alaska Center for Performing Arts,
631 W. 6th Ave. (www.alaskapac.org), operates its own ticket agency,
CenterTix (% 907-263-ARTS [907-263-2787]; www.centertix.net). The
call center and box office in the center are open Monday through Friday 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday noon to 5 p.m., and evenings prior to events.
The Anchorage Concert Association (% 907-272-1471; www.anchorage
concerts.org) offers a fall-through-spring schedule of classical music,
theater, dance, and other performing arts. Whistling Swan Productions
(www.whistlingswan.net) promotes folk and acoustic alternative per-
formers in intimate venues. The Anchorage Symphony (% 907-274-
8668; www.anchoragesymphony.org) performs during the winter season.
Anchorage also has lots of community theater, opera, and limited profes-
sional theater, including the experimental Out North Contemporary Art
House (% 907-279-3800; www.outnorth.org), which produces local
shows and imports avant-garde performers. Downtown, Cyrano’s Off
Center Playhouse, at 4th Avenue and D Street (% 907-274-2599; www.
cyranos.org), is a tiny theater with its own highly regarded semiprofes-
sional repertory company.
Hitting the nightclubs and bars
The hippest downtown club is Bernie’s Bungalow Lounge, 626 D St.
(% 907-276-8808), which grew from a little bungalow into a large, artsy
playground with a backyard patio enclosed by a hedge. You can some-
times find foreign films, poetry readings, and similar cultural fare here,
and, more often, you can socialize with people interested in such things.
Also downtown: Humpy’s, 610 W. 6th Ave. (% 907-276-2337), a popular
tavern with a young crowd, decent food, and live music; Darwin’s
Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
198

Theory, 426 G St. (% 907-277-5322), a friendly, elbows-on-the-table
hangout; and the bar at Simon & Seafort’s, 420 L St. (% 907-274-3502),
an upscale after-work place for the professional set.
Note that downtown has some rough bars and nightclubs that are best
avoided, mostly along 4th Avenue.
If you can get beyond the downtown area, you’ll find more choices for
music or dancing. Blues Central/Chef’s Inn, 825 W. Northern Lights
Blvd. (% 907-272-1341), is a showcase of the best blues performers and
presents imported rock acts, with live music virtually every night. Major
blues names and up-and-coming national performers come through on a
regular basis. Shows start at 9:30 p.m. They’re also known for their beef.
The most famous bar in Anchorage, with the slogan, “We cheat the other
guy and pass the savings on to you,” is the huge Chilkoot Charlie’s, at
Spenard Road and Fireweed Lane (% 907-272-1010; www.koots.com). It
has two stages, three dance floors, and ten bars on different themes,
including a historic old dive from the Seward Highway called the Bird
House that was picked up and moved into the building. The place is
huge and full of entertainment, like an adult Disneyland, but I find it
claustrophobic when crowded, with its low ceilings and confusing
layout. It’s open every day of the year from 10:30 a.m. until after 2 a.m. If
you do go there late, avoid conflict and use caution when leaving, as it
can be a wild crowd and a rough neighborhood.
Spending the evening at the movies
A movie at the Bear Tooth Theatre Pub, 1230 W. 27th Ave. (% 907-276-
4200; www.beartooththeatre.net), is a chance to sit back with a big
glass of craft-brewed beer and a plate of nachos or a full dinner — it
feels a lot like watching at home except for the big screen and the other
people around you in the dark. (Well, our home is usually a bit cleaner,
but our cooking isn’t as good.) The films tend to be independent or
second run, either campy or deep. The dining choices include gourmet
tacos, pizzas, and other hand-held selections. Everything is quite good.
They also put on concerts monthly; check the Web site. And now the
fine print: Even bad movies sell out and there’s often a crush. You must
arrive quite early to find parking, get your ticket and seat, order your
food and beer, and finish waiting in various lines before the movie starts.
The staff brings the meal to you in the theater.
There are several multiplexes in Anchorage playing all the current
Hollywood output; check the sources at the beginning of this section for
listings and reviews. Century 16, 301 E. 36th Ave. (% 907-770-2602;
www.cinemark.com), is an attractive, modern multiplex a reasonable
cab ride from downtown.

Side Trips from Anchorage
In This Chapter
 Enjoying the vertical landscape of the Seward Highway
 Taking in some winter (and summer) activities in Girdwood
 Cruising Prince William Sound
 Breaking away in the Mat-Su Valley
A
base in Anchorage puts you close enough to some of Alaska’s most
appealing destinations for you to experience them as day trips.
Few days that you spend in town can compare with what you’ll see on
some of the outings discussed in this chapter.
Driving between Mountain and 
Sea on the Seward Highway
One of the world’s great drives starts in Anchorage and leads roughly 
50 miles south on the Seward Highway to Portage Glacier. The journey,
not the destination, is what makes the drive worthwhile. The two-lane
highway is chipped from the foot of the rocky Chugach Mountains along
the waters of Turnagain Arm, providing a platform to see a magnificent,
ever-changing, mostly untouched landscape full of wildlife.
I list the sights in the style of a highway log because you’ll find interest-
ing stops all along the road. This route also leads to several other great
places: Girdwood’s ski slopes, Whittier and Prince William Sound (cov-
ered later in this chapter), and the Kenai Peninsula (see Chapter 16).
Getting there
Getting lost on the Seward Highway is hard to do. It leaves downtown
Anchorage under the name Gambell Street, becomes a limited-access
freeway through the rest of the city, and then narrows to two lanes at
Potter Marsh as it leaves the developed part of Anchorage (even though
you remain within the enormous city limits almost all the way on this
drive). From the marsh, the highway traces the edge of Turnagain Arm.

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 203
A sightseeing drive takes at least half a day round-trip, and you can find
plenty to do if you want to make it an all-day excursion. Use your head-
lights for safety even during daylight and be patient whenever you get
stuck behind a summertime line of cars. If you pass, you’ll soon come up
behind another line ahead once again. You simply can’t make good time
when the roads are full of summer travelers — and, with the scenery,
there’s little reason to try.
If you’re taking the train to Seward or driving elsewhere on the Kenai
Peninsula later in your trip, don’t take this day trip, because you’ll be
covering the same ground.
Seeing the sights
The sights described in the following list are in order of the highway
mileage markers that you’ll encounter on the way from Anchorage:
 Potter Marsh (mile 117): Heading south from Anchorage, the
Seward Highway descends a bluff to cross a broad marsh formed
by water impounded behind the tracks of the Alaska Railroad.
Beside the marsh is a boardwalk from which you can watch a huge
variety of birds. Salad-green grasses grow from sparkling, pond-
green water.
 Potter Section House (mile 115): At the south end of Potter Marsh,
the section house was an early maintenance station for the Alaska
Railroad. Today it contains offices of Chugach State Park, open
during normal business hours, and outside features a few old train
cars and interpretive displays. Across the road is the trailhead for
the Turnagain Arm Trail, a mostly level path running down the
arm well above the highway with great views breaking now and
then through the trees. Hike as far as you like and then backtrack
to your car; or, if you can arrange a one-way walk with a ride back
from the other end, continue 4 miles to the McHugh Creek picnic
area and trailhead, or 9 miles to Windy Corner.
Taking a tour
If you don’t want to drive, bus tours follow this route and visit Portage Glacier. Gray Line
of Alaska (% 800-544-2206; www.graylineofalaska.com) offers a seven-hour
trip that includes a stop in Girdwood and a boat ride on Portage Lake for $72 adults,
$36 children 12 and under. Even better, go on the Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552;
www.alaskarailroad.com), which sends excursion trains along the same route
as the highway, and then climbing up into the mountains through glaciated terrain that
can’t be reached any other way. Remote stops in Chugach National Forest offer the
opportunity for guided or on-your-own hiking or for river-rafting before an evening
return to Anchorage. The basic tour is $102 adults, $51 children.

Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
204
 McHugh Creek (mile 111): Four miles south of Potter is an excel-
lent state park picnic area and a challenging day hike with a 3,000-
foot elevation gain to Rabbit Lake, which sits in a tundra mountain
bowl, or a 4,301-foot ascent to the top of McHugh Peak. You don’t
have to climb all the way; spectacular views are to be had within an
hour of the road.
From this point onward, most of the sights are on the right or ocean
side of the road: Plan your stops for the outbound trip, not on the
return when you would have to make left turns across traffic.
 Beluga Point (mile 110): The state highway department didn’t
really need to put up scenic overlook signs at this spectacular pull-
out, 11⁄2 miles south of McHugh Creek, because you’d probably have
figured it out on your own. The terrain is simply awesome, as the
highway traces the edge of Turnagain Arm below the towering cliffs
of the Chugach Mountains. If the tide and salmon runs are right,
you may see beluga whales, which chase the fish toward fresh
water. Sometimes they overextend their pursuit, stranding them-
selves by the dozens in the receding tide, but they usually aren’t
harmed. The pullout has spotting scopes to improve the viewing.
The right-hand pullouts for the next few miles ahead have interpre-
tive signs about the 1895 gold rush in this area and other topics.
 Windy Point (mile 106): Be on the lookout on the mountain side 
of the road for Dall sheep picking their way along the cliffs. It’s a
unique spot, for the sheep get much closer to people here than is
usual in the wild; apparently, they believe they’re safe. Windy Point
is the prime spot, but you also have a good chance of seeing sheep
virtually anywhere along this stretch of road. If cars are stopped,
that’s probably why; get well off the road and pay attention to traf-
fic, which will still be passing at high speeds.
 Bird Ridge Trail (mile 102): This trail is a lung-busting climb of
3,000 feet in a little more than a mile. It starts as an easy, accessible
trail but then rises steeply to views that start at impressive and
become ever more amazing as you climb.
 Bird Creek (mile 100): A parking lot carved from a cliff side and
pathways provide safe access to the creek, a popular silver and
pink salmon stream (for details, see Chapter 14). Non-anglers can
enjoy a short trail, interpretive signs, and an overlook.
 Bird Point (mile 96): The remarkable wayside here is not to be
missed. A paved pathway rises up to a bedrock outcropping with a
simply wonderful view — all the severity of the Turnagain Arm, but
framed by the soft green of a freshwater wetland with a beaver
lodge. Take a look at the fascinating interpretive signs on many sub-
jects. Bike trails that run parallel to the highway are accessed here,
too. Bring out a bike from Anchorage for a scenic ride.
 The flats (miles 96–90): At Bird Point, the highway descends from
the mountainside to the mud flats. Several pullouts on the right
side of the highway have interpretive signs. At high tide, water

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 205
comes right up to the road. At low tide, the whole arm narrows to 
a thin, winding channel through the mud. The arm is not practical
to navigate, and navigational charts are not even available. Few
have ever tried to navigate it other than gold prospectors in row-
boats a century ago or today’s occasional death-defying canoeist or
kayaker. The first to try was Captain James Cook, in 1778, as he was
searching for the Northwest Passage on his final, fatal voyage of
discovery. (He was killed by Hawaiians later that year.) He named
this branch of Cook Inlet Turnagain Arm because the shoals and
the strength of the currents defeated his efforts to explore.
 Turnoff to Girdwood (mile 90): The attractions of Girdwood,
which I cover later in this chapter (see “Enjoying the Slopes of
Girdwood”), are worth a visit, but the shopping center here at the
intersection is not chief among them. Stop for a simple meal or a
restroom break (the convenience store has large public restrooms),
or to fill your gas tank for the last time for many a mile.
 Twentymile River (mile 80): Three species of salmon and a small
smelt, the eulachon, known locally as the hooligan, spawn in 
this river. In the spring you can see Native people dip-netting the
hooligan.
There is good bird-watching here and from turnouts farther on, but
venturing out on Turnagain Arm’s tidal mud carries the real risk 
of getting stuck in quicksand-like mud and drowning in the tide.
Don’t do it.
 Old Portage (mile 80): All along the flats at the head of Turnagain
Arm are large marshes full of what looks like standing driftwood.
These are trees killed by salt water that flowed in when the 1964
quake lowered the land as much as 10 feet. On the right, 3⁄4 mile past
the Twentymile River and across from the rail depot, a few ruins of
the abandoned town of Portage are still visible, more than 40 years
after the great earthquake.
 Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center (mile 79): The nonprofit
center, developed with visitors in mind, gives homes to injured and
orphaned deer, moose, owls, elk, bison, musk ox, bear, fox, and
caribou (% 907-783-2025; www.awcc.org). Visitors drive through
the 200-acre compound to see the animals in fenced enclosures as
large as 110 acres — you can often get a close look at the animals,
but the larger enclosures give them natural vegetation and the abil-
ity to get away from view if they want to. There’s no need to visit
both here and the Alaska Zoo (see p. 168). The zoo has more kinds
of animals and it’s a fun place to stroll, but the cages there are
much smaller and often seem constricting. Here the animals’ set-
tings are more natural and perhaps more humane, but viewing is
car based. A big, log gift shop and outdoor snack bar are at the end
of the tour. Admission is $7.50 for adults; $5 for military, seniors,
and children 4 to 12 (with a maximum of $25 per vehicle). In
summer, it’s open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (last vehicle in at 7:30 p.m.);
in winter, daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
206
 Portage Glacier (take the 51⁄2-mile spur road at mile 78): The
named attraction has largely melted, receding out of sight of the
visitor center. (The glacier that you can see is Burns Glacier.) When
the center was built in 1985, Portage Glacier was predicted to keep
floating on its 800-foot-deep lake until the year 2020. Instead, it
withdrew to the far edge of the lake in 1995. Today, the exhibits in
the lakeside Begich, Boggs Visitor Center focus on the Chugach
National Forest as a whole, rather than just the glacier; these
informative displays are well worth an hour or two to become ori-
ented with the area’s nature, history, and lifestyles. Children and
adults alike will be interested.
Several short trails start near the center. Rangers lead nature walks
on the 1⁄4-mile, paved Moraine Trail. Another trail leads less than a
mile to Byron Glacier, in case you’re interested in getting up close
to some ice. Always dress warmly, because cold winds are the rule
in this funnel-like valley.
A day boat operated by Gray Line of Alaska (% 800-478-6388 for
reservations, or 907-783-2983 at the lake; www.graylineofalaska.
com) traverses the lake to get right up to Portage Glacier on hour-
long tours, ice conditions permitting. It costs $29 adults, half-price
for children 12 and under; it operates five times daily in summer,
every 90 minutes starting at 10:30 a.m. If this is your only chance to
see a glacier in Alaska, the tour is probably worth your time, but if
your itinerary includes any of the great glaciers in Prince William
Sound, Kenai Fjords National Park, or the like, you won’t be as
impressed by Portage.
Enjoying the Slopes of Girdwood
Girdwood, 37 miles south of Anchorage, is proof that a charming little
town can coexist with a major ski resort, as long as the resort goes
undiscovered by the world’s skiers. Girdwood still has a sleepy, offbeat
character. Retired hippies, ski bums, and a few old-timers live in the
houses and cabins among the big spruce trees in the valley below the
Mount Alyeska lifts. (These homes include that of Senator Ted Stevens,
the renovation of which became the subject of his 2008 federal corrup-
tion trial.) Everyone expected a development explosion to follow the
construction of an international resort here a number of years ago, but it
hasn’t happened. Although that may not be good news for the investors
in the resort, it’s great for skiers and other visitors who discover this
paradise. They find varied, uncrowded skiing through long winters,
superb accommodations, and an authentically funky community.
The primary summer attractions are the hiking trails, the tram to the top
of Mount Alyeska, and the Crow Creek Mine, described later in this
chapter. In winter, it’s skiing. Mount Alyeska isn’t as big as some of the
famous resorts in the Rockies, but it’s large and steep enough. Better
still, there’s room for everyone, half the mountain is above the tree line,

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 207
and the snow lasts a long time. Olympian Tommy Moe trained here, and
the Alpine national championships raced down these slopes twice in
recent years. The national extreme skiing and snowboarding competi-
tion used Alyeska’s lifts in 2008. Skiers used to tamer, busier slopes rave
about the skiing here, with long, challenging downhills, few lift lines, and
stunning views of the Chugach Mountains above and glistening
Turnagain Arm below.
Getting there
A rental car is the most practical way to reach Girdwood. The preceding
section gives directions for driving from Anchorage to Girdwood. In
summer, you can come down for the sights and hikes; in winter, you can
make it a day trip for winter sports. If you plan to stay at the resort for
skiing, however, you may not need a car. Call the Alyeska Resort (see
the Alyeska Prince Hotel in “Where to stay,” later in this chapter) to find
out about current shuttle arrangements.
Seeing the sights
Here I cover sights and activities specific to Girdwood, but you can also
use Girdwood as a base for a large area south of Anchorage, including
the wildlife cruises and sea-kayaking from Whittier (covered in the next
section), and the river rafting and snowmobiling farther down the high-
way (see Chapter 14).
Crow Creek Mine
Girdwood
This mine, opened in 1898, is still operated in a small way by the Toohey
family, but mostly they use the paths and eight small original buildings as
a charming tourist attraction. You can see the frontier lifestyle and watch
rabbits and ducks wandering around. A bag of dirt, guaranteed to have
some gold in it, is provided for gold panning, and you can dig and pan to
get more if you have the patience for it.
Crow Creek Road (off the Alyeska Highway), Girdwood. % 907-278-8060. www.
crowcreekmine.com. Open: May 15–Sept 15 daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m. Admission: With
gold panning $10 adults, $4 children 11 and under; without gold panning $3 adults,
free for children 11 and under
Mount Alyeska Tram
Girdwood
The tram isn’t cheap, but it’s worth the price if you otherwise may not
make it to high alpine tundra during an Alaska trip. (In winter, ride on your
lift ticket; in summer, ride free while taking in a meal at the Seven Glaciers
Restaurant at the top — covered later in this chapter.) The tram takes
seven minutes in summer to rise to the 2,300-foot level, where it stops at
a station with the Seven Glaciers and an attractive cafeteria with a limited

Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
208
selection, the Glacier Express. The tram presents an opportunity for every-
one, no matter how young, old, or infirm, to experience the pure light, lim-
itless views, and crystalline quiet of an Alaska mountaintop. Take the
opportunity to walk around and enjoy it. Dress very warmly.
At the Alyeska Prince Hotel (see “Where to stay,” later in this chapter), Girdwood.
Open: Summer daily 10 a.m.–9:30 p.m., winter when lifts operate (call as hours vary).
Admission: $16 adults, $15 ages 55 and older, $12 ages 8–17, $7 ages 7 and under.
Getting outdoors in Girdwood
For additional information about activities in this area, contact the
Alyeska Resort. For snowmobiling, see Chapter 14.
Skiing
Mount Alyeska, at 3,939 feet, has 1,000 acres of skiing, operated by
Alyeska Resort (% 907-754-2545; www.alyeskaresort.com), beginning
from a base elevation of only 250 feet and rising 2,500 feet. The normal
season is from early November through April, and it’s a rare year when
there isn’t plenty of snow all winter (although the warming climate has
brought some poor ski seasons). Skiing on the upper mountain usually
lasts through Memorial Day weekend (not for beginners). The average
yearly snowfall is 721 inches, or 61 feet. Because it’s near the water, the
weather is rarely very cold. Light is more of an issue, with the short days
in midwinter. There are 27 lighted trails covering 2,000 vertical feet on
Friday and Saturday evenings from mid-December through mid-March,
but the best Alaska skiing is when the days get longer and warmer in the
spring. Besides, the lighted trails are only for more-accomplished skiers.
Alyeska has ten lifts, including the tram. Two chairs serve beginners,
with a vertical drop of around 300 feet. The other 89 percent of the
mountain is geared toward intermediate to expert skiers. The biggest
drawback for less experienced skiers is a lack of runs in the low to inter-
mediate ability range. After graduating from the primary beginners’ lift,
Chair 3, skiers must jump to significantly more challenging slopes. That
explains the long lines in busy periods on Chair 3. (It’s the only lift on
the mountain with real waits.) More confident skiers like the mountain
best. Most of it is steep and the expert slopes are extreme. Helicopter
skiing goes right from the resort’s hotel as well.
An all-day lift ticket costs $55 for adults, $40 for seniors 60 to 69 and chil-
dren 14 to 17, $35 for children 8 to 13, and $10 for seniors 70 and older
and children 7 and under. Discounts apply for families. Private and
group instruction is available. You can save a lot by buying your lessons,
lift ticket, and equipment rental at the same time. The day lodge rents
basic gear and the hotel rents high-performance gear. A basic rental
package costs $35 a day for adults, $27 for seniors 60 and over and chil-
dren 13 and under; high-performance and demo packages costs $45 to
$75. The resort also has groomed cross-country trails and gear for rent,
but the best Nordic skiing is in Anchorage (see Chapter 14).

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 209
The utilitarian day lodge with snack and rental counters is located at
the front of the mountain. A new owner plans to replace it. The Sitzmark
Bar is a more comfortable place for a meal (burgers are about $10). The
hotel is on the other side of the mountain, connected to the front by the
tram to the top and beginner-level Chair 7 — you can ski right from the
door. The hotel is a quieter and more genteel starting point for day-trip-
pers and guests, because it has its own rental counter with better equip-
ment (and higher rates) and day lockers. The hotel has several dining
choices, two at the top of the tram (see “Where to dine,” later in this
chapter).
A center operated by Challenge Alaska (% 907-783-2925 or 907-344-
7399) enables skiers with disabilities to use the mountain, skiing down
to the lift to start and back to the center at day’s end.
Hiking
A couple of great hiking trails begin in Girdwood. Among the best trails
in the region for a family hike is the Winner Creek Trail, which begins
behind the Alyeska Prince Hotel and leads to a roaring gorge where
Winner Creek and Glacier Creek meet; a hand-operated tram crosses the
water. The trail is essentially level and a good length for an afternoon:
the round-trip to the gorge is about 41⁄2 miles. The Crow Pass Trail is
more ambitious. The route rises into the mountains and continues all
the way over to Eagle River, after a 26-mile hike that can take a couple of
days. But with less expenditure of time, you can make a strenuous day
hike of it going just up to the pass, where you can see the glaciers, wild-
flower meadows, and old mining equipment. The trail head is up Crow
Creek Road, off the Alyeska Highway.
Where to stay
Besides the resort hotel, plenty of condos and B&Bs are in town. Alyeska
Accommodations, on Olympic Circle (% 888-783-2001; www.alyeska
accommodations.com), offers condos, cabins, and luxurious houses.
Alyeska Prince Hotel
$$$$$
Girdwood
The Alyeska Resort’s hotel is among Alaska’s best. The beauty of the build-
ing alone separates it from the competition, as does its location in an
unspoiled mountain valley among huge spruce trees. Studded with dorm-
ers and turrets, it’s an impressive sight. Inside, sumptuous cherrywood
and rich colors unite the welcoming common rooms and elegant guest
rooms. Although not large, rooms have every convenience. The saltwater
swimming pool is magnificent, with a cathedral ceiling and windows by
the spa overlooking the mountain. A few days spent here skiing and swim-
ming can make daily reality seem drab.

Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
210
Now for the bad news: On weekends and school holidays in the winter, the
hotel is overrun by partying families from Anchorage who overtax the facil-
ities and destroy the peaceful ambience. Children run wild, the pool
becomes impossibly crowded, and service deteriorates to an unaccept-
able level. If you’re coming for a skiing vacation, avoid these times.
Six dining options vie for attention. The Seven Glaciers, 2,300 feet above
the lobby by tram on Mount Alyeska, serves trendy and beautifully pre-
sented dinners in a sumptuous dining room floating above the clouds.
Service is warm and highly professional. Meals are expensive, especially
since the small servings make it desirable to order several courses. The
restaurant opens only on the weekends in the winter. A mountaintop cafe-
teria is right next door (great views, limited choices). At the base level,
choices include a teppanyaki and sushi place, a hotel cafe, a bar and grill,
and a casual cafe.

This is where Girdwood locals meet their friends and take their families

Bob Dylan music accompanied a friendly game of pool, while men with
ponytails and beards sipped microbrews. Another evening, a guy in the
entryway entertained the children with magic tricks and the waitress
asked them to draw pictures to enter into a contest. The menu offers

CAJUN
The ski bum–casual atmosphere and rambling, cluttered dining room
among the trees match the wonderful Cajun and New Orleans food in a
way that couldn’t have been contrived — it’s at once too improbable and
too authentic. Service is relaxed to a fault, and food takes a long time to
arrive, but when it does, every dish is flawless. I love the jambalaya and the
steaks, which are famous (by which I mean, really famous — Food Network

chose this as one of the ten best restaurants in America). On my most
recent visit, with two couples, each item on our plates — from appetizers
through dessert — was remarkable; since I love talking about the food over
dinner, I love this place. The Double Musky isn’t to everyone’s taste, how-
ever; your senses can feel raw after the extreme noise, highly spiced food,
and crowds. Parking can also be difficult. Loud groups will enjoy it more
than couples, and families don’t really fit. Since the restaurant doesn’t take
reservations, here’s an important tip: Grab seats in the bar and dive into
your meal there with appetizers and drinks instead of simply waiting.

Embarking on Prince William 
Sound from Whittier
Almost all of Prince William Sound is in Chugach National Forest, the
nation’s second largest. The sound is a world to itself, one largely free 
of people, with 3,500 miles of shoreline enfolded within its islands and
deeply penetrating fjords and passages. Glaciers loom on the mountains
at the northwestern part of the sound, and on the way to see them it’s
commonplace to encounter humpback and orca whales, dolphins, seals,
otters, and a variety of birds.
Whittier is Anchorage’s portal to this vast wildness. Although Anchorage
itself is on Upper Cook Inlet, that muddy, fast-moving waterway is little
used for recreational boating. Whittier, on the other hand, stands on the
edge of a long fjord in the northwest corner of the sound, where clear
waters are full of salmon, orcas, and otters, and bounded by rocky
shores, rain forests, and glaciers. The water also is calmer here than on
excursions to Kenai Fjords National Park (see Chapter 16), so seasick-
ness is rare and the glaciers are more numerous.
Whittier, in itself, is not a destination. Passengers on many Princess
cruises arrive here to board trains to Anchorage, but they see no more
of the town than the road they walk across from the dock to the rails.
There’s no reason for them to stay, nor for land-based visitors to spend
the night. Other than activities on the water, which are easy as a day trip
from Anchorage or Girdwood, there’s nothing to do. Whittier is an odd
town where most of the tiny population lives in a single, 14-story con-
crete building. I don’t recommend a visit other than to go out on Prince
William Sound.
Getting there
If you plan to take a day trip on the sound from a base in Anchorage —
the way most people use Whittier — you can leave the car behind and
take a train or bus all the way. Tour-boat operators (listed in “Getting out

Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
212
on the sound,” later in this chapter) will book the transportation from
Anchorage for you, simplifying the process and assuring that you’ll be
on time for the boat. On the other hand, if you have more than two in
your group, a car may save you money and give you flexibility to make
other stops on the way. Likewise, drive if you plan to continue through
the sound by ferry or to make Whittier a stop on the way down the
Kenai Peninsula to Seward or Homer.
If you plan to drive, carefully read “By car,” a few sections later in this
chapter, to find out about the unusual process of getting through the
tunnel to Whittier.
By bus
Tour-boat operators put visitors on buses and vans from Anchorage that
are less expensive than riding the train. The bus ride is included in the
cost of the tour-boat ticket, adding around $50 per adult to the fare.
Children’s fares tend to be half-price.
By train
The Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552; www.alaskarailroad.com)
runs a daily train timed to match the schedules of Prince William Sound
tour boats. The large tour operators will book it for you when you buy
your boat ticket, potentially with a substantial savings over booking 
with the railroad directly. The round-trip train fare from Anchorage to
Whittier is $80 adults, $40 children 2 to 11. The train ride is scenic and
fun, but extends an 8-hour trip from Anchorage to more than 11 hours
and costs more than a rental car even for a single traveler.
By car
Take the Seward Highway, as described in “Driving between Mountain
and Sea on the Seward Highway,” earlier in this chapter, to the Portage
Glacier Road, at mile 78 (48 miles from Anchorage). Allow at least an
hour from Anchorage without stops. The road through the 23⁄4-mile-long
World War II–era rail tunnel to Whittier is only one lane that is also used
to accommodate trains, so you’ll probably have to wait your turn. Get
the schedule through the tunnel’s Web site (www.tunnel.alaska.gov),
through its phone recording (% 877-611-2586 or 907-566-2244), or by
tuning your radio to 1610 AM in Portage or 530 AM in Whittier. Checking
the schedule can help you avoid a wait of an hour or more caused by
missing the opening for your particular direction of travel.
In summer, the first opening from Whittier is at 5:30 a.m. and the last to
Whittier is at 11:15 p.m. Winter hours are shorter and changeable, so
check ahead. The toll — $12 for cars; $20 for RVs, cars with trailers, or
large vans — is charged only for travel toward Whittier. Special permits
are required for really huge vehicles (over 14 ft. high or 10 ft. wide).
Parking in Whittier is $10 a day.

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 213
By ferry
The fast ferry Chenega of the Alaska Marine Highway System (% 800-
642-0066; www.ferryalaska.com) connects Whittier to the other two
towns in Prince William Sound, Cordova, and Valdez. From Valdez, you
can drive north on the beautiful Richardson Highway, making a complete
circle back to Anchorage in two days or more (see Chapter 18). The
Kennicott runs a two-week-long loop several times a summer from
Prince Rupert, British Columbia, to Juneau, Whittier, and then westward
to Homer and Kodiak. It’s the only practical public transportation con-
necting this part of Alaska to the outside world without flying.
Getting out on the sound
Whittier is the entrance to western Prince William Sound, at the end of
one of many long, deep fjords where marine mammals and eagles are
common. You can ride one of the tour boats that cruise these waters
from Whittier, viewing glaciers at the heads of many of the fjords.
Large tour boats
Several companies with offices in Anchorage compete for your business
for day-trip tours to the Sound’s western glaciers. Besides having incred-
ible scenery, the water is calm, making seasickness unlikely — for the
queasy, this is a much better choice than Kenai Fjords National Park.
Each operator times departures to coordinate with the daily Alaska
Railroad train from Anchorage (see the “By train” section, earlier), which
means they have up to six hours for the trip. Some try to see as much as
possible, while others take it slower to savor the scenery and wildlife
sightings. Between the train and boat fare, expect to spend around $220
per person for this day’s outing, leaving Anchorage at 10 a.m. and return-
ing at 9:30 p.m.
You can save around $25 a person and up to three hours by taking a bus
that the tour-boat company arranges instead of the train. With two or
more people, you can save over the bus by renting a car and driving.
You’ll be able to buy meals onboard or meals will be provided.
Note that, while all the prices in the book are subject to change, those
listed here are especially shaky because of changing fuel costs.
Phillips Cruises & Tours
The 26-glacier cruise travels the sound on a fast three-deck catamaran,
counting the glaciers as it goes. The boat ride is four and a half hours, so
if you use their bus, your total time from Anchorage is less than 81⁄2 hours.
As a pioneer of these tours, Phillips has many years of experience and
does a professional job. The boat has a snack bar, and a hot lunch is
included in the fare.
519 W. 4th Ave., Anchorage. % 800-544-0529. www.26glaciers.com. Price: $139
adults, $79 children 11 and under; fuel surcharge $17 per passenger.

214
Major Marine Tours
This company operates a smaller, 149-passenger vessel at a slower pace
than Phillips — they visit a mere ten glaciers, but spend more time wait-
ing for ice to fall from glaciers. Another important feature: The tour is nar-
rated by a Chugach National Forest ranger, not the company. The route
goes up Blackstone Bay. The boat is comfortable, with reserved table seat-
ing. They emphasize their food, which costs extra; the salmon and prime-
rib buffet is $19. It’s quite good. Time on the water is five hours.
411 W. 4th Ave., Anchorage. % 800-764-7300. www.majormarine.com. Price: $107
adults, $53 children ages 11 and under.
Small tour boats
Instead of getting on a giant tour boat with a mob of people, you can go on
a small boat with a local whom you’ll get to know as he or she shows off
favorite places and lands on beaches for picnics and walks. If you see a
whale or other point of interest, you can stay as long as you like, and in 
a small boat you can get closer. What you give up are the comforts of a
larger, tour bus–like vessel, and most small boats have a four-person 
minimum.
Honey Charters
Family-run Honey Charters has three sturdy aluminum boats built for
these waters, specializing in personal tours, water transportation, and
kayaker drop-offs. They operate with a minimum of four passengers; by
paying the four-person minimum, you can have a boat to yourself. Bring
your own food.

Sound Eco Adventures
Gerry Sanger is a retired wildlife biologist who spent years researching the
waterfowl and ecology of Prince William Sound. Now he carries up to six
passengers at a time on whale, wildlife, and glacier tours from his 30-foot
aluminum boat, which has a landing craft–like ramp perfect for pulling up
on gravel beaches, and suitable for wheelchairs. Finding whales in the
sound takes skill and requires covering a lot of water; Gerry’s success rate
is better than 90 percent since 1999, and he’s gone years without missing
once. His shorter, five-hour tours usually do not encounter whales. Fares
include snacks but you need to pack your own lunch.
Whittier. % 888-471-2312. www.soundecoadventure.com. Price: 10-hour whale
and wildlife cruise $225–$250 per person, 5-hour sightseeing cruise $170 per person.
Fishing
About 30 charter fishing boats operate out of Whittier, the closest salt-
water fishing to Anchorage. Most target halibut but some also go after
salmon during hot runs. The Greater Whittier Chamber of Commerce

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 215
(% 907-677-9448; www.whittieralaskachamber.org) can help find an
operator, and has links to several on its Web site. Bread-n-Butter Charters
(% 888-472-2396; www.breadnbuttercharters.com) has been around
for many years. They charge $259 per person for a day of halibut fishing
and have an office on the waterfront. Honey Charters (listed in the “Small
tour boats” section, earlier in this chapter) has a similar service.
Sea-kayaking
Whittier is a popular starting point for kayak trips to beautiful and pro-
tected western Prince William Sound. Day trips for beginners paddle
along the shore near Whittier, often visiting a cliff-side bird colony, or
you can take a boat 5 miles from the harbor to Shotgun Cove and paddle
back. Longer multi-day trips go by boat to even more interesting waters,
where you can visit glaciated fjords and paddle narrow passages. Here
are a couple of kayaking businesses competing in Whittier:
 Alaska Sea-Kayakers (% 877-472-2534; www.alaskaseakayakers.
com) offers three- and five-hour day trips for $79 and $175, respec-
tively. Paddles at Blackstone Glacier, which begin with a charter-
boat ride, cost $300. Guides are well trained and occasionally offer
weekend instructional clinics (check the Web site for times).
Offices are at each end of Whittier Harbor. They rent to experi-
enced paddlers, too.
 The Prince William Sound Kayak Center (% 877-472-2452; www.
pwskayakcenter.com) offers guided half-day trips starting at $75,
as well as full days and other options; it also rents kayaks. It’s been
in business since 1981.
Where to dine
Most meals served in Whittier are for people grabbing a sandwich while
waiting for a boat or otherwise passing through. Several such restau-
rants are in the triangle at the east end of the harbor where you can con-
veniently check them all out before making a choice.
Taking a Side Trip to the Mat-Su Area
Here are some highlights of the Matanuska and Susitna valleys, the 
suburbs to the north of Anchorage commonly referred to as Mat-Su.
Reached by the Glenn Highway about 40 miles from Anchorage, the Mat-
Su area is both a bedroom community for the city and a former frontier-
farming region with a quirky identity (but marred by road frontage
commercial development). Among the towns is the once obscure
Wasilla, now famous as the hometown of Sarah Palin. Just because
you’ve heard of the place, however, doesn’t make it worth visiting
(unless you want to see just how little there is to see). Most travelers
pass through on a drive north, perhaps taking advantage of some of the
area’s attractions for a break along the way.

Part III: Anchorage and Environs 
216
In this summary, I discuss a few attractions in the central area of the
valley. Other places of interest in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which
covers an area the size of West Virginia, are elsewhere in the book where
they fit better with the itineraries I recommend: Talkeetna, in the north-
ern Susitna Valley along the Parks Highway, is grouped with Denali
National Park in Chapter 19; rafting the Matanuska River, a good
Anchorage day activity, is included in Chapter 14; and the skiing and
mountain lodges near the Matanuska Glacier on the Glenn Highway are
covered in Chapter 18. The region’s biggest annual event, the Alaska
State Fair, is covered in the calendar of events in Chapter 3.
Seeing the valley’s highlights
The only way to travel the Mat-Su area is by car. Here are some stops to
make if you’re passing through or exploring the area.
Hatcher Pass
Heading north to Denali National Park or Fairbanks, the rough, winding
gravel road through Hatcher Pass to Willow makes a glorious alpine
detour around what otherwise would be the least attractive part of your
drive (it bypasses the traffic and blight of Wasilla). Past the mine and
skiing area, the road is open only in summer and is not suitable for large
RVs. Just after the Parks Highway branches from the Glenn Highway, exit
to the right on the Trunk Road and keep going north on Fishhook Road.
From the Glenn Highway near Palmer, take Fishhook just north of town.
Even if you’re not headed north, a trip to Hatcher Pass combines one of
the area’s most beautiful drives, access to great hiking and Nordic skiing,
and interesting old buildings to look at. The Independence Mine State
Historical Park (% 907-745-2827; www.alaskastateparks.org, click
on “Individual Parks,” then “Matanuska and Susitna Valleys”) takes in the
remains of a hard-rock gold mine that operated from 1938 to 1951. Some
buildings have been restored, including an assay office that’s a museum
and the manager’s house that’s a welcoming visitor center, while a big
old mill, towering on the hillside, sags and leans as a picturesque ruin. 
A visit is interesting even if you don’t go inside, using the interpretive
panels and map on a self-guided tour. The paved trails are easily naviga-
ble by anyone, and the rugged, half-mile Mill Trail leads up to that build-
ing’s ruins. The setting, in a bowl of rock and alpine tundra, is
spectacular. The day use fee is $5 per vehicle. A guided tour is an addi-
tional $5 per person and leaves at 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. weekdays, plus
4:30 p.m. weekends. Tours depend on staffing and may be increased or
decreased from these hours. The visitor center is open from 10 a.m. to 
7 p.m. daily in the summer; it’s closed in the off season.
The valley high in the Talkeetna Mountains that the site occupies is ideal
for a summer ramble in the heather or for Nordic or Telemark skiing in
winter, with several miles of groomed trails for cross-country skis and
limitless alpine terrain for exploration on your backcountry skis. There
are four hiking trails and two mountain-biking routes in the area — ask at

Chapter 15: Side Trips from Anchorage 217
the visitor center. The Gold Cord Lake Trail is less than a mile. The Reed
Lakes Trail is spectacular for its mountain scenery and waterfalls; start-
ing from the Archangel Road, it gains 3,000 feet over 41⁄2 miles to Upper
Reed Lake. Another challenging hike is the Gold Mint Trail, which starts
across the road from the Motherlode Lodge on Hatcher Pass Road and
leads 8 miles to the Mint Valley.
Along the Parks Highway
Driving north on the Parks Highway from Anchorage to Denali National
Park or Fairbanks takes you through the populated central part of the
valley. Although this stretch of the road is unattractive, like unplanned
highway development anywhere, you may want to stop at the Museum
of Alaska Transportation & Industry, off the Parks Highway at mile 47,
on Museum Drive, west of Wasilla (% 907-376-1211; www.museumof
alaska.org). Volunteers have gathered every conceivable machine and
conveyance — thirteen fire trucks, seven locomotives, and two steam
cranes, for example — and fixed up as many as they could to running
condition. An indoor museum displays the finished masterpieces, while
the 20 acres outside are crammed with deteriorated treasures — trains,
aircraft, tractors, fishing boats, and mining equipment — all grist for
memories and imagination. The museum is open May 1 through
September 30 daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., off season by appointment.
Admission is $8 for adults, $5 for seniors and students, $18 for families.
Along the Glenn Highway
The Glenn Highway, north of the Parks Highway intersection and onward
north of Palmer, is one of Alaska’s prettiest drives. The road traces the
edge of a rugged canyon over the Matanuska River and Matanuska
Glacier (see Chapter 18). Nearer Anchorage, the main attraction is the
Alaska State Fair in Palmer, which takes place the week before Labor
Day (see Chapter 3 for details).
Where to stay and dine
There are unlimited fast-food spots and roadhouse burger places in the
Mat-Su area. Here are some choices with a little local flavor: Vagabond
Blues, 642 S. Alaska St., Palmer (% 907-745-2233), a coffeehouse and
cafe offering sandwiches, wraps, baked goods, homemade bread, and
soup, and which is also the region’s outstanding music venue; and
Sunrise Family Restaurant, 777 Parks Hwy., Wasilla (% 907-376-1677),
where locals pack in for good elbows-on-the-table cuisine, including the
house specialties, wings and Philly steak sandwiches.

but no TV. The cabins are clean and nicely set up, with no rustic edge
except chemical toilets and the lack of running water. Guests go to the

ingly professional meals there. Stay in summer for a taste of the real Alaska

Part IV
Road Trips from
Anchorage

In this part . . .
T
he easiest way to many of Alaska’s best destinations is
along the two-lane highways that wind through the moun-
tains from the Southcentral coast into the Interior and
beyond, all the way to the Arctic Ocean. With a car that you
rent in Anchorage, you can get to the forests and ocean
shores of the Kenai Peninsula, including Seward, Kenai Fjords
National Park, Kenai, and Homer. You can drive to Fairbanks
and explore the long Interior highways. And you can see the
wildlife and scenery of Denali National Park.

 Experiencing Homer
T
he Kenai (keen-eye) Peninsula is a microcosm of what’s most appeal-
ing about Alaska, and you can get to it without the expense and dis-
tances that can make traveling much of the state difficult. South of
Anchorage, between Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, the peninsula
is a large enough landmass to show up on any globe, but unlike much of
Alaska, it’s not unimaginably vast and intimidating. And it’s accessible,
with roads, rails, and frequent air service. Traveling here is a bit more like
traveling anywhere else in America (if you leave aside the amazing beauty
and huge undeveloped areas). You have no need for guides or tour buses;
on the Kenai Peninsula, you can discover Alaska on your own.
Most of what you’re looking for — glaciers, whales, legendary sport-
fishing, spectacular hiking trails, interesting little fishing towns and art
colonies, bears, moose, and high mountains — lies along a few hundred
miles of blacktop, within reach with a rental car and perhaps a tour boat.
People from Anchorage go to the peninsula for the weekend to fish, hike,
dig clams, and paddle kayaks. Certain places can become crowded, but
it’s easy to get past the humanity into places where you’ll see few, if any,
other people. You can easily and inexpensively get beyond the road net-
work altogether.

Discovering the Kenai Peninsula 
and Its Major Attractions
Set aside enough time to visit Kenai Fjords National Park from Seward, at
least one overnight from Anchorage. For Homer or Kenai, allow two or
more nights. Driving around that area takes time when you consider how
tempting it is to stop along the way to view all the open and beautiful
public land. The following sections contain a few of the highlights to be
aware of while planning.
Seward
The attractive small town of Seward, situated at the head of a large fjord
opening on the Pacific Ocean called Resurrection Bay, is a threshold to
the ocean and marine-oriented Kenai Fjords National Park. The town lies
124 miles by road or rail from Anchorage on the southeastern side of the
peninsula. While in Seward, you may want to:
 Visit the Alaska SeaLife Center, a research aquarium where you
can see marine mammals and birds up close.
 Fish salmon or halibut in the ocean from charter boats.
 Sea-kayak among sea otters and along rocky shores and streams
where salmon spawn.
Kenai Fjords National Park
At this marine park, mile-high mountains jut straight from the sea.
Glaciers burst over the mountains’ shoulders, dumping big chunks of
blue ice in the water. Craggy islands poke out of the ocean, hosting thou-
sands of nesting sea birds; whales and other marine mammals cruise
through regularly. Visitors arrive at the park on day-tour boats from
Seward. The park also has a back door, Exit Glacier, accessible by land
from Seward. A short drive from town, that area’s nature trails allow visi-
tors to walk up for a closer look at ancient ice.
Kenai and Soldotna
The towns of Kenai and Soldotna sit on the banks of a supremely pro-
ductive salmon stream, the Kenai River, which produces the world’s
biggest king salmon and many other species of fish. Visitors come to
fish, but non-fishing members of the family can easily find some sight-
seeing to interest them, too. Alaska’s most easily accessible canoe route
is close at hand in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (which is not part
of Kenai Fjords National Park). Kenai is about a three-hour drive from
Anchorage on the peninsula’s west side. While you’re there, consider
these activities:

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 223

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
224
 Salmon-fishing in the Kenai River — one of Alaska’s top 
attractions — for a chance to catch enormous, hard-fighting fish.
 Walking through Russian heritage and contemporary art for an
afternoon in the town of Kenai.
 Paddling a canoe in wilderness on an overnight in Kenai National
Wildlife Refuge.
Homer
This hip, artsy, and vigorous little town is on the shore of Kachemak
Bay, which stretches out across the community’s front yard like an out-
door smorgasbord. After seeing the galleries in town, take the opportu-
nity to experience Alaska directly by getting across the water and
beyond the road network. Spend at least a couple of days to get a feel for
the land and to justify the four-and-a-half-hour drive down from
Anchorage to the end of the road. While in Homer, you can
 Visit the galleries and the Pratt Museum. View the output of
Alaska’s most active art colony and learn about the area’s natural
history.
 Go tide-pooling and take a nature walk. A nature center teaches
about the area, with several options for guided nature walks in
forest or tide pool.
 Hook into a monstrous halibut. The state’s biggest fleet of charter
boats goes after fish that can top 300 pounds.
 Sea-kayak among tiny islands. The waters of Kachemak Bay are
also home to some fascinating wildlife, including sea otters and
puffins.
 Mountain-bike and hike beyond the reach of cars. A water taxi
can take you for a day to wonderful paths and byways off the road
network.
 Dine at a watery art colony. Boats are the only vehicles in the 
village of Halibut Cove, near Homer.
Landing in Seward
This agreeable little town started life as a place to get off the boat to
Alaska. Later, it became a place for Alaskans and visitors to get on boats
to see the bay, to fish, and to visit Kenai Fjords National Park (described
in the “Enjoying Kenai Fjords National Park” section, later in this chap-
ter). With the growth of the cruise industry, Seward is once again a place
to get off the boat. Many cruises that cross the Gulf of Alaska begin or
end here, with their passengers taking a bus or train to or from the air-
port in Anchorage.

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 225
Located by the broad fjord of Resurrection Bay, Seward is a mountain-
side grid of streets lined with old wood-frame houses (see the “Seward”
map, later in this chapter). It’s long been the sort of place where pedes-
trians casually wander across the road, hardly glancing for cars, for
there likely won’t be any. Or, if there are, they’re ready to stop. The
growing tourism industry brought more traffic, but most of what’s new
has been good for the town. The Alaska SeaLife Center, is a research
aquarium that’s open to the public. Combined with the excellent ocean
fishing, the national park, the wonderful hiking trails, and the unique and
attractive town itself, Seward is well worth a two-day visit (although if
you don’t want to go out on the water, one day is plenty).
Getting there
The least expensive and most convenient way to Seward is by car from
Anchorage, but the train is an appealing option.
By car
The 124-mile drive down from Anchorage on the Seward Highway is easy
and particularly scenic. It takes under two and a half hours without stops,
but allow an additional hour to get out and look at the scenery, a highlight
of any trip to Seward. The first 48 miles of this drive are described in
detail in Chapter 15. For tips on renting a car, see Chapters 7 and 13.
By train
The Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552; www.alaskarailroad.com)
offers passenger service from Anchorage to Seward and back daily
during summer. The route is even prettier than the highway, passing
close to glaciers and following a ledge halfway up the narrow, vertical
Placer River gorge, where it ducks into tunnels and pops out at bends in
the river. The landscape still looks as it did when the first person beheld
it. The railroad’s young guides are well trained. The fare is $75 one-way,
$119 round-trip; children ages 2 to 11 ride for half-price. The railroad
also offers money-saving lodging and sightseeing packages through its
Web site. Don’t do Seward as a day trip by rail — it’s too tiring.
A rental car is much cheaper than the train, and it’s more convenient
when you get to Seward, but the train ride is unforgettable, and getting
around Seward is manageable without a car. Seward is the end of the
line, however, so you’ll have to ride the same rails back to Anchorage.
Getting around
You can easily cover downtown Seward on foot, although a little help is
handy to get back and forth from the boat harbor. If it’s not raining, a
bike may be the best way. Seward Bike Shop (% 907-224-2448), in a
railcar near the depot at the harbor, rents high-performance mountain
bikes and models good for just getting around town, plus accessory
equipment. A cruiser is $12 half-day, $19 full-day. PJS Taxi (% 907-
224-5555) is one of the cab companies in Seward.

Where to stay
Alaska’s Point of View Reservation Service (% 907-224-2323; www.
alaskasview.com) is a Seward lodging and tour-booking agency. The
Web site has a search function for lodgings, including B&Bs and lodgings
that are otherwise hard to find on the Internet.
Ballaine House Bed & Breakfast
$
Downtown Seward
This 1905 house near downtown is a classic B&B, with wooden floors; a
large living room; and tall, double-hung windows. The building is on the
National Register of Historic Places and the town walking tour, and it’s 
decorated with antiques and handmade quilts. Ballaine House is a social
place with service that’s accommodating and fun, and the hostess offers

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 227
raincoats, binoculars, and other gear for outings; cooks breakfast to order;
and even does laundry. The B&B can also book your activities and boats
in Seward and some other towns, giving you the booking commission,
which can save as much as 20 percent. The rooms are not large — they’re
suitable for only one or two people — and all bathrooms are shared. This
B&B does not take children 7 and under.

ballaine. Rack rate: $99 double. Rates include full breakfast cooked to order. No
credit cards.
Harborview Inn
$$$
Near the small-boat harbor
The rooms here have long been among the most attractive in town, with
lots of light, Mission-style furniture, and Tlingit art, with rates that are rea-
sonable by Seward’s high standards. The location, midway between the
small-boat harbor and downtown, puts both within long walking distance.
Families and large groups especially should consider a stay, as the inn has
a four-bedroom family suite with the features and size of a house — it’s
2,500 square feet — renting for $199 double, plus $10 for each additional
person. Two two-bedroom apartments on the beach along Ballaine Avenue
are perfect for families as well; they rent for $189 per night for four. There
are other suites, too.

Seward Windsong Lodge
$$$$$
North of Seward
This hotel is the only one at Kenai Fjords National Park with a national
park atmosphere. The big lobby, with its high ceiling, huge wood beams,
fireplace, and cedar shingles could be at Yellowstone. Moreover, the posh,
solidly finished quality of the place puts it in first place among Seward’s
hotels. The location is out of town, among spruce trees on the broad valley
of the Resurrection River, and the collection of buildings goes on and on.
Rooms are in separate lodges with entry from exterior porches. They have
a crisp feel, all with two queen-size beds and rustic-style furniture and
good amenities. Family suites are available with TVs and video games in
the kids’ room. The hotel restaurant, the Resurrection Roadhouse, is
reviewed later, under “Where to Dine.”

Where to dine
You can find various places at the harbor to grab a sandwich or a quick
meal on the way out to sea; they change too frequently for me to include
here. Downtown, the Ranting Raven, 228 4th Ave. (% 907-224-2228), is
a great little gift and coffee shop serving pastries, sandwiches, and soup.
It’s open April through Christmas.
Apollo Restaurant
$$
Downtown Seward
MEDITERRANEAN/SEAFOOD
This is a surprisingly good small-town restaurant. Seward families come
back for a menu that includes anything they might want: Greek and south-
ern Italian cuisine, steaks, seafood, pizza, and much more. They’ll even
cook your own day’s catch. But the food is far more sophisticated and
expertly turned out than you expect in such a place, especially the seafood
dishes, and the service is fast, skilled, and flexible — great for families with
children. The dining room, with many booths, takes the Greek theme as
far as it’ll go — I especially enjoy the miniature Doric columns. They serve
beer and wine.

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 229
Though not perfect, it’s more nuanced than the typical harborside place;
the seafood chowder is great. Most important, they don’t overcook the
fresh local fish — and that’s really all you can ask. On a busy summer week-
end, however, the place can be overrun, with long waits and harried
servers. They have a full bar.

gourmet pizzas. The view of the mountains is great and the feeling is
relaxed, a low-key alternative to a noisy waterfront restaurant. Do call
ahead, as they fill at dinner time.

Seward’s top attractions
Seward has only one top attraction. I cover other in-town pastimes later
in this chapter under “Other cool things to do in Seward.”
Alaska SeaLife Center
Downtown Seward
The center’s role as an important research institution makes it an espe-
cially vibrant and fascinating aquarium to see creatures from nearby
Alaska waters. There’s always something happening. You may have seen
puffins diving into the water from a tour boat; here you can see what they
look like flying under the water. Seabirds, harbor seals, octopus, and sea
lions reside in three spectacular exhibits viewed from above or below —
you can get within a few feet of the birds without glass. There are smaller
tanks with fish, crab, and other creatures; a touch tank where you can
handle starfish and other tide-pool animals; and exhibits on current ocean
changes and hot research issues. An exhibit traces the life cycle of salmon;
the staff hatches salmon eggs on a schedule so fish at each stage of devel-
opment will always be present in their realistic habitats. I don’t want to
oversell the place, however: The center is not as large as a big-city aquar-
ium, and you’ll likely spend no more than a couple of hours unless you
sign up for one of the lectures or special behind-the-scenes programs for
adults and children that happen all day.

Getting outdoors in Seward
In this section, I describe things to do outdoors in Seward other than the
main event, the national park, with its fjords and road-accessible Exit
Glacier. For that information, see “Enjoying Kenai Fjords National Park,”
later in this chapter.
Sea-kayaking
Sunny Cove Sea Kayaking (% 800-770-9119 or 907-224-4426; www.sunny
cove.com) has earned a good reputation for guided kayaking in
Resurrection Bay and beyond. Its day trips suitable for beginners are
offered as part of the Kenai Fjords Tours trips to its Fox Island lodge.
More ambitious day trips and multi-day trips venture into the fjords
themselves (see the “Kenai Fjords National Park,” section later in this
chapter). On a budget, you can take one of Sunny Cove’s tours right from
Seward. They launch from Lowell Point, following the shore toward
Caines Head State Recreation Area, where you can see sea otters,
seabirds, intertidal creatures, and the salmon in Tonsina Creek. Three-
hour paddles are $65; eight-hour trips, $125. A trip to Fox Island is more
expensive but comes with a fjords boat tour and salmon bake, so the
cost of the kayaking comes out roughly the same.
Fishing
Seward is renowned for its saltwater silver-salmon fishing. The silvers
start showing up in the bay in mid-July and last through September. You
can catch the fish from shore, from Lowell Point south of town, or even
near the boat harbor, but your chances for success are far greater from a
boat. I prefer small, six-passenger boats, because you can get to know
the skipper better and learn more about fishing. (If seasickness is a con-
cern, choose a large boat — it’ll bob less in the waves.) When your party
has the entire boat, you can control where it goes, perhaps adding
whale-watching or sightseeing to the day. The going rate for a guided
charter, with everything provided, is about $175 per person, or $245 to
fish for salmon and halibut on the same day. You can choose from
among many charter services, either using a central booking agency or
engaging a charter directly. Here are two choices:
 Andrew Mezirow, a marine biologist and maritime instructor, oper-
ates two boats. Besides day-fishing, he takes guests on multi-day
fishing expeditions to extremely remote and beautiful places. His
business is Crackerjack Sportfishing Charters (% 800-566-3192;
www.crackerjackcharters.com).

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 231
 To choose among a variety of boats, contact The Fish House,
located at the small boat harbor (% 800-257-7760; www.thefish
house.net). They operate their own boats, book charters with
other skippers, sell and rent ocean-fishing and spin-casting gear,
and carry some fly-fishing supplies. If you want to be on a small
vessel, make sure to ask for a “six-pack,” as the six-passenger boats
are known. For charters, reserve ahead.
Hiking
You’ll find some excellent hiking trails near Seward. You can obtain a
complete list and directions at the Kenai Fjords National Park Visitor
Center (see the upcoming section about the park).
 The Mount Marathon Trail is a challenging hike to the top of a
3,022-foot mountain, with a couple of trails of varying difficulty
levels. The route of the famous Mount Marathon footrace is the
more strenuous choice, basically going straight up from the end of
Jefferson Street; the hikers’ route starts at the corner of 1st Avenue
and Monroe Street. Either trail rises steeply to the top of the rocky
pinnacle, which has incredible views. Allow an entire day, unless
you’re a racer; in that case, expect to make it up and back in less
than 45 minutes.
 The Caines Head State Recreation Area (www.dnr.state.ak.us/
parks/units/caineshd.htm) has a 7-mile coastal trail south of
town. Parts of the trail are accessible only at low tide, so it’s best
done either as an overnight or with someone picking you up or
dropping you off in a boat at the far end; the Miller’s Landing
water taxi (% 866-541-5739; www.millerslandingak.com) offers
this service for $45 round-trip. The trail has some gorgeous views,
rocky shores, and a fascinating destination at the end: a towering
cliff with the concrete remains of Fort McGilvray, a World War II
defensive emplacement. Take flashlights and you can poke around
in the spooky, pitch-dark underground corridors and rooms and
imagine what each was used for. (Going in without lights would be
foolhardy.) The trailhead from town is just south of Seward on
Lowell Point Road; pull off in the lot right after the sewage plant,
and then cross the road through the gate and follow the dirt road a
bit until it becomes the actual trail. Stop at the Kenai Fjords
National Park Visitor Center at the boat harbor for tide conditions
and advice.
If you take a boat both ways to North Beach, 41⁄2 miles in, you cut
the hike to the fort down to a size any family can manage. We have
a wonderful day with grandparents and little ones that way.
Sled-dog mushing
When Mitch Seavey won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 2004, many
agreed it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. He’s made a lot of
friends over the years offering rides with his dogs. It’s a family business,

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
232
including his four boys (one is a Junior Iditarod champ), making use of
their kennel on Old Exit Glacier Road off Herman Leirer Road. They offer
summer rides in Seward and in winter in Sterling (near Soldotna). The
summer ride uses a wheeled sled and a full, 12-dog team — not the real
thing (no snow), but you’ll get a feeling for the dogs’ power and intelli-
gence. Husky puppies are available for cuddling, too. The 90-minute tour
costs $59 for adults, $29 for children 11 and under. They call their com-
pany IdidaRide (% 800-478-3139; www.ididaride.com).
Those willing to spend much more should consider mushing on snow 
at the height of summer by joining a helicopter tour to Godwin Glacier
from the Seward Airport with Godwin Glacier Dog Sled Tours (% 888-
989-8239 or 907-224-8239; www.alaskadogsled.com). A chopper lands
at a camp of 100 dogs, where guests take a ride in the dog sled, or even
drive it themselves. The company also offers glacier hikes and overnight
camping on the ice. They charge $430 for adults, $390 for children 12
and under.
Other cool things to do in Seward
Most of Seward’s attractions are of the modest, small-town variety and
involve exploring downtown and the waterfront on foot:
 Walk along the beach on Ballaine Avenue. The broken concrete
and twisted metal you see are the last ruins of the Seward water-
front that was destroyed by a tsunami wave that resulted from the
1964 earthquake. Sometimes you can see sea otters swimming just
offshore.
 Visit the Seward Museum at 3rd and Jefferson (% 907-224-3902).
It’s a charming grandma’s attic of a place, with clippings, memora-
bilia, and curiosities recalling the history of the town and of the
Iditarod Trail, painter Rockwell Kent, and the ways of the past.
Admission is $3 for adults, 50¢ for children 17 and under. The
museum is open during the summer daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., in
the winter it’s usually open weekends noon to 4 p.m., but call ahead
to be sure. Evening slide programs take place during the summer
months.

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 233
Kenai Fjords National Park is all about remote rocks, mountains, and
ice that meet the ocean, and the animals that live there. The park com-
prises 670,000 acres of the south coast and impassible highlands of the
Kenai Peninsula. The shore here is exposed to the Gulf of Alaska, where
wild, recurrent storms beat against the mountainous shore unbuffered
by any landmasses from the vast expanses of the Pacific to the south.
Wildlife thrives, but humans have never made a mark.
The majority of the area, in the impossibly rugged interior of the Kenai
Peninsula, was likely first seen by human eyes only in 1968, when moun-
tain climbers initially crossed the Harding Ice Field, which covers most
of the national park (Alaska Natives had no use for that area). Exit
Glacier and all the glaciers of Kenai Fjords flow from this Ice Age left-
over, which may be a mile thick. The ice field lies in a high bowl of moun-
tains that jut straight out of the ocean to heights of 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
Visitors travel the park’s marine periphery, seeing the glaciers that dip
into the sea, the shore’s razor-sharp mountains, and the abundant
wildlife that lives in the water, on the rocks, and in the air. A large vessel,
such as a tour boat operating out of Seward, is the only practical way for
most people to do this, and that takes time and money. Better destina-
tions are available for people who get seasick (for example, Prince
William Sound; see Chapter 15). But if you go, you’ll experience a ride
into primeval wilderness that’s pretty much unequaled.
Getting there
Seward is the threshold to the park. Exit Glacier is 13 miles from the
town by road. The Kenai Fjords National Park Visitor Center is at the
Seward small-boat harbor; tour boats that visit the park also leave from
the harbor.
Don’t try to see the park in a day (coming from Anchorage by train or
road, touring the park by boat, and then returning that evening). To see
the best of the park, you need to take an all-day boat trip — most half-
day trips barely leave Resurrection Bay and see hardly any of the park
proper. Besides, the trip down from Anchorage and back in one day,

especially by train, is too tiring, amounting to 16 hours of near-constant
boat and train rides. A better plan is to spend a night or two in Seward,
taking in the full Kenai Fjords boat trip and visiting Exit Glacier.
Getting park information
At the Kenai Fjords National Park Visitor Center, at the small-boat
harbor, Seward (% 907-224-7500; www.nps.gov/kefj), rangers answer
questions about the park, provide information on the all-important tour
boats, and operate a small bookstore. The center is open late May
through early September daily from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., the balance of
May and September daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; it’s closed October through
April.
Note that the park is pure wilderness, with no commercial facilities of
any kind. Seward is the place to stay, eat, and do any non-wilderness
activities.
Enjoying the park
Kenai Fjords is essentially a marine park. On a boat tour, you’ll see its
mountains, glaciers, and wildlife. On any of the tours, you’re sure to see
sea otters and sea lions, and you have a good chance of seeing hump-
back whales, orcas, mountain goats, and black bears. I saw all that
wildlife on one trip to Aialik Bay. Gray whales come in the early spring
and huge fin whales show up sometimes, too, but they’re hard to see.
Bird-watchers may see bald eagles, puffins (both tufted and horned),
murrelets (marbled, ancient, and Kittlitz’s), cormorants (red-faced,
pelagic, and double-crested), murres (common and thick-billed), auklets
(rhinoceros and parakeet), and various other sea ducks, alcids, and
gulls.
The farther you go into the park, the more you’ll see. If you really want
to see Kenai Fjords National Park and glaciers that drop ice into the
water, the boat has to go at least into Aialik Bay to Holgate Glacier or
Aialik Glacier. Northwestern Glacier is even deeper in the park. Half-
day Resurrection Bay cruises offer plenty of impressive scenery but
pass only one glacier, and that at a distance. Passengers also have fewer
opportunities for seeing whales and puffins and other birds. The longest
trips into the heart of the park encounter the greatest variety and
number of birds and animals. If you’re lucky with the weather, you can
make it to the exposed Chiswell Islands, which are home to some of the
greatest bird colonies in Alaska, supporting more than 50,000 seabirds of
18 species. I’ve seen clouds of puffins swarm here. The daylong trips
also provide more time to linger and really witness the behavior of the
wildlife. Whatever your choice, binoculars are a necessity; you may be
able to rent them onboard.

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 235
Deciding on a tour
Prices are about $160 to go to Northwestern Glacier in Northwestern
Fjord off Harris Bay, a ten-hour trip; $130 to $140 to go to Holgate
Glacier or Aialik Glacier in Aialik Bay, which takes six to eight hours;
and $65 to $85 for a three- to five-hour Resurrection Bay tour, which
doesn’t go to the national park at all. Children’s prices are usually about
half off. I’ve seen misleading publicity material from the tour operators,
so ask exactly where the boat goes or get a map of the route.
Bear Glacier, on the edge of the park, is unimpressive, because boats
can’t get anywhere near it. Go at least to Holgate Glacier for a notewor-
thy glacier sighting.
The season begins in April with tours to see the gray whale migration,
mostly within Resurrection Bay. That’s done by mid-May, when the regu-
lar schedule of tours begins, which lasts into September. Although you
can sometimes obtain early-season or Web specials, fares with each oper-
ator differ little. Instead, shop for the destination, length of trip, food
service, interpretation, and size or intimacy of the boat. Ask how much
deck space is outside so that you can really see. What is the seating
arrangement? How many passengers will be onboard and how many
crewmembers can answer questions? Is lunch provided, and what does it
consist of? Another important point of comparison is whether you have a
ranger providing the commentary, or only the captain — some captains
don’t know when to shut up and can give inaccurate information.
Beware of seasickness
A critical factor in choosing your boat tour is your susceptibility to seasickness. To
reach the heart of the park, vessels must venture into the unprotected waters of the
North Pacific. Large, rolling waves are inevitable on the passage from Resurrection
Bay to the fjords themselves, although once you’re in the fjords the water is calm. On
a rough day, most boats will turn back for the comfort of the passengers and change
the full-day trip into a Resurrection Bay cruise, refunding the difference in fare. Of
course, they’d rather not do that, and the decision often isn’t made until the vessel is
out there and some people are sick. This has happened to us more than once. On one
trip, about 80 percent of the passengers were already vomiting when the boat turned
around. (Even for those who don’t lose it, being around that much puke isn’t fun.) If
you get seasick easily, my advice is to stick to the Resurrection Bay cruise or take a
boat tour in protected Prince William Sound out of Whittier (see Chapter 15), where the
water is smooth. Details on avoiding and treating seasickness are in Chapter 9. In any
event, when you book, ask about the tour company’s policy on turning back and
refunds.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
236
Try to schedule loosely so that if the weather is bad on the day you
choose for your boat trip, you can wait and go the next day. In bad
weather, you’ll be uncomfortable and the animals and birds won’t be as
evident, or the boat may not go out at all. If you pay upfront to hold a
reservation on a boat — probably a good idea in the busiest months —
find out the company’s policies regarding refunds and rescheduling.
Most operators offer packages with the Alaska Railroad and the Alaska
SeaLife Center, which may save you money, but make sure you have
enough time to do everything you want to do in Seward. All have offices
at the small-boat harbor in Seward.
Kenai Fjords Tours
This is the dominant tour operator, with the most daily sailings and choices
of destination. The main part of the operation uses 90- to 150-passenger
vessels, many of which have forward-facing seats, like an airplane’s. They’re
professionally staffed. The whole operation runs remarkably smoothly, and
we found the crew extremely attentive. When the ships are crowded, how-
ever, the experience becomes more impersonal. Onboard, the captain pri-
marily narrates with other employees sometimes helping.
The same company also owns Mariah Tours, which operates more-
intimate 16-passenger vessels. Their trips are more spontaneous and go
all the way to Northwestern Fjord every day, weather permitting; the
downside is that the smaller boats move more in the waves.
Most of the large Kenai Fjords vessels visit a day lodge that the company
owns on Fox Island, in Resurrection Bay, for lunch and National Park
Service ranger talks. The lodge sits on a long cobble beach near Sunny
Cove, where painter Rockwell Kent lived in seclusion with his son in 1918
and 1919 and produced the art that made him famous; it’s an inspiring
spot. The lodge itself stands on a narrow strip of land between the beach
and a pond, which visitors overlook from large wooden decks. Lunch is
grilled Alaska salmon. Some passengers spend the night at the company’s
Kenai Fjords Wilderness Lodge on all-inclusive packages. Half-day sea-
kayaking paddles from the island are offered for day-trippers or overnight
guests: $89 to $99 per person as an add-on for overnighters; or $149 to
$169, including a Resurrection Bay tour-boat ride, for day-trippers.

Major Marine Tours
This company pioneered first-class onboard dining and commentary by
park rangers, who go on every trip. Their boats are slower than some of
the competitors’, so they don’t make the long trip to Northwest Glacier;
they either go to Aialik Glacier or tour Resurrection Bay around Seward.
Instead of bringing sandwiches or stopping for a meal, they serve a buffet

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 237
of salmon and prime rib onboard ($15 for adults, $7 for children). The food
is surprisingly good. I also like their table seating arrangement with for-
ward-facing seats. Your seat is assigned, so there’s no need to rush aboard
or try to stake out your spot.

Sunny Cove Sea Kayaking
Seeing the fjords from a sea kayak is quieter and more intimate than a big
boat with too many people. Even beginners can do it on a guided day trip.
Sunny Cove Kayaking takes guests for a wildlife tour to Aialik Bay on a small
charter boat, and then launches kayaks for a paddle in front of the glacier.
At $375 per person, it’s more than double the cost of a regular tour-boat
ride, but this is the best of the best. If you’re sure you like kayaking and
camping, spend a couple of days; a two-night kayak camping trip costs $949.

Checking out Exit Glacier
The only land-accessible part of the park is the engaging Exit Glacier,
one of the few glaciers in Alaska that you can stroll up to. Approaching
the glacier, you can see the pattern of vegetation reclaiming the land
that the melting ice has uncovered, a process well explained by interpre-
tive signs and a nature trail. At its face, cold, dense spires of ice loom
over you, breathing chilled air like an open freezer door. A National Park
Service nature center adds to the comfort and educational content of a
visit. (The building is also interesting technically — it’s powered by a
hydrogen fuel cell.) You can easily spend a couple hours on a casual,
pleasant visit to the glacier (longer if you do a hike).
A safety note: Big chunks fall off the glacier ever more frequently as
Alaska’s climate warms. Stay behind the signs or you stand a good
chance of being crushed.
Spending the night on an island
Fox Island stands with high, rocky pinnacles like a castle over Resurrection Bay, a
seductive destination for anyone exploring those waters. For a price, you can spend
a night or two there. Sea-kayaking outings among the sea otters, puffins, and sheer
rocks are an essential add-on, priced at $89 to $99 per person for lodge guests. An
overnight package on the island costs $399 per person, including meals and a full-day
cruise in the national park. Contact Kenai Fjords Tours (% 800-478-8068 or
907-224-8068; www.kenaifjords.com) to make a reservation.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
238
The easiest way to get to the glacier is to drive. Take the Seward
Highway 33⁄4 miles north of town to the clearly marked 9-mile route to the
glacier. In winter, the road is closed to vehicles. If you don’t have a car, a
shuttle may be available; check with the Kenai Fjords National Park
Visitor Center (see the “Getting park information” section, earlier in this
chapter) to see who currently offers this service.
Following the road along the broad bed of the wandering Resurrection
River, you can observe, in reverse order, the succession of vegetation,
from mature Sitka spruce and cottonwood trees down to smaller alders
and shrubs. It takes time for nature to replace the soil on sterile ground
left behind by a receding glacier. As you get closer, watch for signs with
dates starting a couple of centuries in the past; they mark the retreat of
the glacier through time. At the glacier itself, nothing grows at all.
The Exit Glacier Nature Center is open Memorial Day weekend through
Labor Day daily 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., sporadically in May and September 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Ranger-led nature walks start daily at 10 a.m., 2 p.m., and 
4 p.m. on the short trail to the glacier. However, no guide is needed —
the trails are simple. At the glacier, a steep route goes up along the side
of the glacier, and the easy route runs on the flat gravel at its face.
One of the glacier’s striking features is a high berm of gravel that fits
around its leading edge like a necklace. This is a moraine, the glacier’s
refuse pile. The glacier gouges out the mountains with its immense,
moving weight as new ice flows down from the ice field above and melts
here. It carries along the rock and gravel torn from the mountain like a
conveyor belt. This moraine is where the conveyor belt ends and the
melting ice leaves the debris behind in a big pile. Probably without
knowing it, you’ve seen hundreds of moraines all over North America,
where the glaciers of the last Ice Age piled debris into hills, but this is
the most obvious moraine I’ve ever seen, and it helps you understand
how they work.
An all-day hike, 8 miles round-trip, climbs along the right side of the gla-
cier to the Harding Ice Field — Exit Glacier gets its name for being an
exit from that massive sheet. The walk is a challenging 3,000-foot eleva-
tion gain, but it’s the easiest access I’m aware of to visit an ice field on
foot. Because of snow, the trail doesn’t open until late June or early July.
The ice field itself is cold and dangerous.
Kenai and Soldotna
The largest sport-caught king salmon in the world, almost 100 pounds,
came from the Kenai River. That’s why people come here. The Kenai’s
kings run so large that the river has a different trophy class. Everywhere
else in the state, the Alaska Department of Fish & Game certifies a 50-
pounder as a trophy, but, on the Kenai, your catch has to be at least 75

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 239
pounds. That’s because kings in the 60-pound class — with enough wild
muscle to fight ferociously for hours — are just too common here.
Anglers prepared to pay for a charter will be in their element on the river
when the fish are running hot. Catching a big king isn’t easy or quick,
however, and success rates vary greatly year to year and week to week.
Visitors who aren’t interested in fishing find less than a day’s sightseeing
in these towns. Instead, they can use the towns as bases for the out-
doors. Kenai has a strangely beautiful ocean beach and the Kenai River
mouth offers exceptional bird-watching during migrations. Best of all,
wonderful canoeing waters lie north of town in the lake-dotted Kenai
National Wildlife Refuge, which has headquarters in Soldotna.
Getting there and getting around
The drive on the Seward and Sterling highways to the Kenai/Soldotna
area from Anchorage is 147 miles and takes a good three hours without
stops. In summer, traffic slows you down, and in winter, speeds are lim-
ited by ice and the fear of hitting moose. (The first 48 miles of this trip
are covered in Chapter 15.) Bear right onto the Sterling Highway about 90
miles from Anchorage. Car rental in Anchorage is covered in Chapters 7
and 13.
Kenai receives frequent flights from Anchorage via Era Aviation (% 800-
866-8394; www.flyera.com). Four car-rental companies operate at the
Kenai airport: Avis, Budget, Hertz, and Payless.
The area is too spread out to walk and has no public transportation. You
can get by without a car if you do nothing but fish and you eat at your
lodgings; in that case, you can get the rides you need from your guide,
your host, or a taxicab. One of the cab companies in the area is Alaska
Cab (% 907-283-6000 in Kenai or % 907-262-1555 in Soldotna).
Where to stay
Rates at all the hotels in the area are on seasonal schedules with three,
four, or even more levels linked to the salmon runs. When I list high-
season and off-season rates in this section, I’m talking about the highest
and lowest rates of the year.

For anglers, it’s the location that counts, and for that, this lodge is hard to
top, with a third of a mile of river frontage where the Moose and Kenai
rivers converge, a hot fishing spot since time immemorial, as an ancient
Native site attests. In the evening, the lodge keeps a guide and campfire
on the beach so you can keep casting in the midnight sun. Lodge rooms
overlooking the river are spacious and have gas fireplaces and private
bathrooms. Unfortunately, the site suffers from vehicle noise from the adja-
cent Sterling Highway. The lodge offers a wide variety of guided fishing
activities, including fly fishing and halibut outings. For guests interested in
seeing wildlife, the lodge offers trips to its own backcountry tent camps,
including one across Cook Inlet with good brown bear–viewing. Check the
lodge’s Web site for information on the many tours and wilderness safaris
that they offer, as well as rates, which are too extensive to itemize here.

right. When they “borrowed” the pepper steak created by Jens Hansen at
his restaurant in Anchorage, they admitted it on the menu — classy. In
addition, the restaurant offers various ways of having local seafood in cre-

Fishing in Kenai and Soldotna
Fishing the Kenai River is the point of coming to the area for most visi-
tors. Check at the visitor centers (see “Fast Facts: Kenai and Soldotna,”

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
242
later in this chapter) for information and regulation booklets. Or contact
the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, 43961 Kalifornsky Beach Rd.,
Soldotna (% 907-262-9368, or 907-262-2737 for a recorded fishing
report; www.alaska.gov/adfg). Serious anglers shouldn’t miss that
Web site, which includes daily sonar counts of salmon in the river and
information on biology and fishing techniques; click the Sport Fish link,
and then click the Southcentral region on the map. Licenses are for sale
on the site, as well as in any sporting-goods store in Alaska and many
grocery stores.
The Kenai River has more than two dozen public-access points along its
80-mile length. A guide brochure with a map is available from the state
Division of Parks (% 907-262-5581; www.alaskastateparks.org); you
also can pick up a copy at one of the town visitor centers.
Fishing for king salmon
King salmon, the monsters of the river, come in two runs. The early run
comes from mid-May to the end of June, peaking in mid-June. On average
less plentiful and smaller, in the 20- to 40-pound range, the run did also
produce the sport caught world’s record (97 lb., 4 oz.). The second run
comes during the month of July and includes more of the massive fish.
Most people fish kings from a boat, fishing certain holes. Boats hold sta-
tionary or back slowly down the river; or fishermen drift downriver.
Your chances from the bank are low; on average, with or without a boat,
it takes 29 hours of fishing time to land a king. (You’ll likely get at least a
dozen strikes for every fish that makes it into the boat.) With a guide,
the average time to land a fish is cut in half, but that still means that if
you fish for only one day, chances are good that you’ll get skunked. A
boat of three anglers on a half-day guided charter has roughly a 50 per-
cent chance of landing a king between them.
A guided charter averages $150 to $170 for a six-hour trip, $250 to $265
full-day. There are dozens of guides. Contact the visitor center in Kenai
or Soldotna for a referral (see “Fast Facts: Kenai and Soldotna,” later in
this chapter), or book through your lodgings — many have their own
boats and guides. The Sports Den, 44176 Sterling Hwy., Soldotna (% 907-
262-7491; www.alaskasportsden.com), is one charter operator that
offers river and ocean trips, fly-in fishing, and hunting, and that also has
lodging packages. I’ve found them friendly and helpful.
Fishing for red salmon
The area really goes crazy when the red (or sockeye) salmon join the
kings in the river, from mid-July to early August. You can fish reds from
the bank or from a boat. Reds are plankton eaters; some say they won’t
strike a lure and others say they do. In some popular fishing areas regu-
lations allow only the use of flies; check the regulations or contact Fish
& Game for details. Most people around here cast the flies with spinning
gear, weighting the line 18 inches from the fly so it bounces along the

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 243
bottom. Cast upstream from shore and allow the fly to drift down, keep-
ing near the bank. While waiting for a strike, debate whether the fish
really attack the flies, or if they get caught when they instinctively move
their mouths in an eating motion, which they do in quick-moving water.
Fishing for silver salmon
Silvers first arrive in late July, peaking during August, but continuing to
be in the river through September and even in October. They’re easiest
to catch anchored in a boat, but you can also do well from shore. Lures
work well, as does bait of salmon eggs.
Fishing for other species
Trophy-size rainbow trout and Dolly Varden char also come out of the
river. Anglers using light tackle may also enjoy catching pink salmon,
which are plentiful in the Kenai during even-numbered years, arriving in
late July and lasting until mid-September. Use spinning gear and lures.
Most Alaskans turn up their noses at this easy-to-catch 4-pound fish; just
smile and keep hauling them in. Fresh, bright pinks taste great over a
campfire.
Canoeing near Kenai and Soldotna
Floating through the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in a canoe narrows
the world into a circle of green water, spruce, and birch. You can paddle
and hike for days without encountering more than a few other people.
Your only expenses are the costs of your canoe and the vehicle that car-
ried you to the trailhead. Most of the western half of the Kenai Peninsula
lies within the 2 million acres of the refuge — it’s almost as large as
Yellowstone National Park — and much of that is impossibly remote and
truly dedicated to wildlife. Canoeists use the lowlands on the west side,
west of the Sterling Highway and north of Kenai and Soldotna. The
region is a maze of lakes connected by trails. You can reach more than
70 lakes on canoe routes that stretch more than 150 miles. It’s the easi-
est way to real Alaska wilderness that I know.
Stop in at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center, Ski Hill
Road, Soldotna (% 907-262-7021; http://kenai.fws.gov), for guid-
ance before plunging into the wilderness. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife
Service, which manages the refuge, exhibits natural history displays
here, shows a film each hour in the afternoon in the summer and main-
tains a 3-mile nature trail. The staff offers advice and sells books and
maps that you’ll definitely need for a successful backcountry trip. To
find the center, turn left just south of the Kenai River Bridge, taking a
right turn in front of the building-supply store uphill on the unpaved

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
244
I haven’t provided detailed driving instructions because you’ll need
detailed maps to go at all. You can order a good one printed on plastic
from Trails Illustrated (% 800-962-1643; www.natgeomaps.com). A
serviceable free map is distributed by the refuge visitor center. I also
recommend the book The Kenai Canoe Trails, by Daniel L. Quick
(Northlite Publishing), an extraordinary guide with super-detailed maps
and directions.
You get a guide or prepare for an unguided trip with the help of Alaska
Canoe & Campground (% 907-262-2331; www.alaskacanoetrips.
com), where the Finch family rents canoes and everything else you need
for a wilderness trip, near the intersection of Swanson River Road and
the Sterling Highway in Sterling. Coleman canoes rent for $43 for 24
hours and lighter, fiberglass canoes for a little more. They offer a shuttle
service to carry canoeists from one entrance to another so you don’t
have to double back on your trip, and they can give valuable expert
advice. They also rent a lot of other outdoor stuff: kayaks, mountain
bikes, rafts, and so on. Call ahead to check on equipment and to reserve.
Their campground is fully equipped, too — a good base where you can
return for showers and laundry.
The refuge has two main canoe routes, both reached from Swanson
River and Swan Lake roads, north of the Sterling Highway from the town
of Sterling. Many dozens of remote campsites are along the shores —
just lakeside areas of cleared ground with fire rings — and most of the
paths between lakes are well marked and maintained with wooden
planking over wet areas.
 The Swan Lake Canoe Route is a 60-mile network of 30 lakes con-
nected sometimes by channels but more often by portages, paths
on which you carry your boat and gear from one point of water to
another. It meets Swan Lake Road twice, allowing a loop of several
days. Along the way, you can penetrate deep into the wilderness,
visiting remote lakes that you’ll have all to yourself. Canoeing
through to the Moose River and riding its current 17 miles over a
long day back to the Sterling Highway also is possible. However,
getting anywhere requires frequent portages of a quarter mile or
so, and more ambitious routes have mile-long portages.
 You can skip the portaging by floating two days down the Swanson
River to its mouth, at the Captain Cook State Recreation Area north
of Kenai. Join the river at a landing at Mile 171⁄2, Swanson River Rd.
The water is slow and easy all the way.
Other things to do in Kenai and Soldotna
Here are some of the things to do in Kenai and Soldotna that don’t
require a fishing rod or canoe paddle:

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 245
 See the museum at the Kenai Visitors & Cultural Center. Located
at 11471 Kenai Spur Hwy. (% 907-283-1991; www.visitkenai.com),
the permanent exhibits cover the area’s history and a little natural
history. A highlight is the “King of Snags” — an immense conglomer-
ation of lost fishing lures and sticks from the bottom of the river. In
the summer, good temporary art exhibitions are mounted, too.
Summer admission to the museum is $3, free for students through
high school; off season, admission is free. The center is open in the
summer Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; off-season, Monday through Friday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Saturday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Walk Kenai’s historic area. Start at the visitor and cultural center
mentioned in the preceding paragraph and get a copy of the Old
Town Kenai Walking Map; follow the numbered markers. Not many
of the simple, weathered buildings remain from Kenai’s life before it
became an oil boom town, but those that do are interesting and lie
only a few blocks down Main Street from the center, along the Cook
Inlet bluff. These include the 1895 Holy Assumption Russian
Orthodox Church, a quaint, onion-domed church, brightly kept but
with old icons. A donation is requested.
 Watch fishing boats and whales in the river mouth. The best van-
tage point is from Erik Hansen Scout Park, at Cook and Mission
avenues, near the church mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
When the salmon are running, you can occasionally see white
beluga whales chasing them from here, sometimes in great num-
bers, competing with the transiting fishing boats and personal-use
dip-net fishermen.
 Walk the sandy beach. From the Kenai Spur Highway, turn left on
South Spruce Street, where you’ll find a simple beach park and a
place to begin a walk. A $10 fee applies while the dip-net fishery is
in progress in July, when the parking is in demand. Alaska residents
(only residents are permitted) line up with long-handled nets to
grab salmon from the river. On quieter days, with calm water, the
beach sand, the mudflats, and the inlet’s gray, glacial water seem to
meld together into one vast shimmering plain. Walking south, the
beach wraps around and becomes the shore of the Kenai River. It’s
too cold for swimming.
 Swim in a great public pool. The magnificent North Peninsula
Recreation Area Nikiski Pool (% 907-776-8472), 10 miles north of
Kenai on the Kenai Spur Road, occupies a large gold dome and has
a 136-foot water slide, mushroom fountains of water, and a raised
hot tub from which parents can watch their children play in the
pool below. The water slide is open in the summer Tuesday
through Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. (swimming without the
slide opens those days at 7 a.m.); the winter hours are complicated,
so call for details. Pool admission is $3, or $6 to use the slide and
pool. Weekends can be crowded.

Driving to the Sea in Homer
Homer is at the end of the road. The nation’s paved highway system
comes to an abrupt conclusion at the tip of the Homer Spit, a narrow
strip of land almost 5 miles out in the middle of Kachemak Bay. That
geography has brought together a wonderfully odd collection of artists
and retirees, fundamentalist preachers and New Age healers, wealthy
North Slope oil workers and land-poor settlers with no visible means of
support. They all live here simply because they choose to. The choice is
understandable. Homer lies on the north side of Kachemak Bay, a
branch of lower Cook Inlet of extraordinary biological productivity. The
halibut fishing is especially good. The town has a breathtaking setting on
the spit and on a wildflower-covered bench high above the bay. Outdoor
opportunities here are among Alaska’s best, and the arts community has
developed into an attraction of its own.
You’ll be disappointed, however, if you expect a charming little fishing
town. Poor community planning has created a town that doesn’t live up
to its setting. Homer Spit in summer is a traffic-choked jumble of cheap
tourist development and RVs. Ignore that. It’s where the spit goes that

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 247
counts. At its tip, out in the middle of the bay, you can feel like you’re at
sea. The town depends on that unique finger stretching out into the
ocean — an exceptional launching point to one of the world’s great
marine recreation areas.
Getting there
Most visitors drive, but you can save time by flying from Anchorage.
By car
The scenic 235-mile drive from Anchorage to Homer takes roughly four
and a half hours by car, if you don’t stop at any of the many interesting
or beautiful places along the way. Follow the Seward Highway south
from Anchorage (the first hour of the drive is detailed in Chapter 15),
and then join the Sterling Highway at the Tern Lake junction (about 90
miles from Anchorage). You’ll pass Soldotna and Kenai on your way to
Homer. Save time for the view from Baycrest Hill as you enter town. Car
rental in Anchorage is covered in Chapters 7 and 13.
By air
Era Aviation (% 800-866-8394; www.flyera.com) serves Homer from
Anchorage several times a day. Small air-taxi operators use Homer as a
hub for outlying villages and the outdoors.
By ferry
The Alaska Marine Highway System (% 800-642-0066; www.ferry
alaska.com) connects Homer to Seldovia, Kodiak, and points west
along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Archipelago with the ferry
Tustumena, and eastward to Whittier and then across the Gulf of Alaska
to Juneau with the Kennicott.
Getting around Homer
Homer is spread out and has no public transportation, so the best way
to get around is by car. If you fly or arrive by ferry, you can rent a car at
the airport from Hertz (% 800-654-3131 or 907-235-0734;
www.hertz.com) or three local firms.
For a taxi, one company is CHUX Cab (% 907-235-2489).
Where to stay
Homer has many good B&Bs. The Web site of the Homer Chamber of
Commerce (www.homeralaska.org) has links to scores of them.

rock, the hot coffeepot and inexpensive self-serve breakfast in the lobby,
and a friendly attitude. The old building has a cozy feel that’s somehow
enhanced by sloping floors and old fixtures. Most of its rooms are like
Pullman compartments in size and configuration, but they’re cute and
clean and have some real style. And they’re inexpensive. Nine bedrooms
share two bathrooms. The walls are thin, so there’s a no-noise policy
during evening hours. A separate new building nearer the water has five
rooms with king-size beds and a large common area. There’s also an
appealing 22-site RV park. The inn offers a fish cleaning station and freez-
ing facility and year-round fishing charters.

Land’s End Resort
$$$–$$$$$
Homer Spit
Traditionally the place to stay in Homer, Land’s End would be popular no
matter what it was like inside because of its location at the tip of Homer
Spit, the best spot in Homer and possibly the best spot for a hotel in all of
Alaska. It’s composed of a line of weathered buildings that fittingly strag-
gle along the beach crest like driftwood logs. The hotel is near the boat
harbor, and some people fish right from the beach in front. Inside, the local
owners keep high standards and make constant improvements. Rooms
range from cute ship-like compartments with fold-down Murphy beds to
big, two-story suites. The front desk also rents a series of privately owned
townhouse condos next door; for groups or couples on extended visits,
these are the best accommodations in the region, with stylish furniture,
lots of space and light, and a beachfront location second to none. The
condos rent for $325 to $450 a night, with a two-night minimum stay.
The Chart Room restaurant makes good use of its wonderful location,
looking out over the beach and bay from big windows. There’s a casual,
relaxing atmosphere in the long, wood-trimmed dining room. The deck out-
side has glass wind shields, making it a warm, satisfying place to sit over
coffee on a sunny day. You can watch otters, eagles, and fishing boats while
you eat. The selection of main courses ($16–$38) is fairly typical of a sea-
side fine-dining restaurant, and the food is good if not memorable. The
appetizer menu, however, is much more extensive and interesting, and the
appetizer portions are easily large enough to make a full meal.

Buildings on a grassy compound have a commanding view of Kachemak

conies, refrigerators, and microwaves; four have full kitchens (1 rents for
only $109). The less expensive rooms lack the views and are older, but are
still modern and have cute touches. The place is decorated with photo-
graphs and art collected over a family’s five generations in Alaska.

These rooms combine the artiness of the excellent Bunnell Street Gallery

and settling, their imperfections picked out by light from tall, double-hung
windows that look out at Bishop’s Beach. The antiques, handmade quilts,
and wonderful original art fit in as if they have always been there, yet the
rooms are comfortable, fresh, and clean. The B&B has no TVs or in-room
Calling a water taxi
To enjoy the best of the Homer area, get on and across Kachemak Bay. Using a system
of water taxis that run from the small boat harbor on Homer Spit to beaches and docks
that are half an hour and a world away is easy. Go for hiking, mountain-biking, or self-
guided sea-kayaking. Many operators are available, and rates vary little, about $75 
to get to Kachemak Bay State Park, plus a $4 park fee, for example. Here are two of
the best:
 Mako’s Water Taxi (% 907-235-9055; www.makoswatertaxi.com) is owned
by Mako Haggerty, who is experienced and has a good reputation. Besides car-
rying passengers, Mako’s rents sea kayaks and drops them off for experienced
paddlers. Using Mako’s advice, kayakers can plan a one-way paddle, with the
water taxi providing a lift at each end.
 Karl Stolzfus’s Bay Excursions Water Taxi & Tours (% 907-235-7525; www.bay
excursions.com) offers simple transportation but also specializes in hosting
serious birders. He rents sea kayaks, too.

SEAFOOD/SANDWICHES
The facade of the yellow house on Pioneer Avenue is unmistakable with
its elaborate bas-relief sculpture. The small dining room is a work of art,
too, a masterpiece of wood, light, and space. Jennifer Olsen seats guests,
and her husband, David, is the chef. As the owners, they’ve combined a
love for good food with practicality in a small town. The menu comes in
two parts. The regular daily menu is mostly mainstream — aimed at local
diners looking for something familiar — but they also have an extensive
daily menu of orally described specials, usually including interesting
choices based on local seafood. Do not make a choice before considering
these, which are the heart of the experience. David has a terrific sense of
the texture of food — the lamb chops are a sensual delight, crisply seared
on the outside, tender and juicy inside, on rich mashed potatoes. Portions
are large. They serve beer and wine.

NORTHERN ITALIAN
Built with great style in a former school-bus garage on the Sterling Highway
near the visitor center, the restaurant is a wonder of warm Mediterranean
colors, shiny metal, and primitive art — not the sort of place you expect
to find in a small town in Alaska. The cuisine brings further surprises: bold
flavors and textures, a little Tuscany, and plenty of Homer, too, including
local seafood. The centerpiece is a wood-fired Italian brick oven that pro-
duces pizza, grilled sandwiches, steaks, lamb, and other delights. They
serve local beers on tap and 30 wines by the glass. Although the restaurant
is not oriented to children, my kids love it because of the big pieces of
pizza available by the slice (which means adults can eat inexpensively,
too). Note that at peak hours it can take a long time to get a table and they
don’t take reservations.

BAKERY/CAFE
Ebullient Donna and Kevin Maltz’s organic eatery is quintessential Homer,
starting with its motto: “Food for people and the planet.” But there’s no
New Age dogma here. The Sourdough Express is fun and tasty, even as it
grinds its own grain and recycles everything in sight. An inexpensive lunch
menu includes many vegetarian choices as well as hearty sandwiches. The
evening menu includes many specials, elaborate dishes (including huge
portions of local seafood with rich sauces), and, perhaps more remark-
ably, simple, solid choices, too, for those who don’t want to spend a lot.
All-you-can-eat crab is served from 3 to 8 p.m. Families will enjoy the
relaxed atmosphere, the big sandbox, and an old van out front where kids
can play while you wait for your meal. Stop by on the way to the harbor
for a brown-bag lunch that you’ll need for a charter fishing trip. Don’t miss
dessert from the made-from-scratch bakery.

The ambience is that of an old-fashioned Alaska roadhouse, in a large log

edges: white table linens and professional service. The food is exciting and
wonderfully satisfying. The many seafood choices are done many different
ways — in some cases simply grilled to a turn, and in others with complex
sauces and various international influences. The portions are generous. If
you want a big piece of rare prime rib, go no further. We love this restaurant

Halibut Cove
SEAFOOD
What makes this restaurant unforgettable is the location and the trip to
get there. It’s about 5 miles across the water from the boat harbor on
Homer Spit; going there is a wonderful day’s outing to a remote art colony.
A classic wooden boat, the Danny J, leaves Homer daily in the summer at
noon for lunch and at 5 p.m. for dinner. (Seating on the Danny J is mostly
outdoors; they provide rain gear, but you still may not want to go in bad
weather.) Each trip allows time to wander the charming boardwalks and
galleries of Halibut Cove, a tiny seaside village without roads where boats
take the place of cars. The restaurant itself sits on pilings above the edge
of the smooth, deep green of the cove’s main watery avenue. You can sit
back in the deck gazebo and sip microbrews and eat fresh-baked bread,
mussels, sushi, and locally grown salads, followed by fresh fish grilled over
charcoal. Those who don’t eat seafood don’t have wide choices, but there
are several vegetarian and non-seafood items. In addition to the price of
the meal, budget for the boat ride: The noon trip is $50 for adults, $45 for
seniors, and $30 for children; the dinner trip is $30 for everyone. Make
meal and boat reservations at the same telephone number; you typically
need to book a few days ahead.

Finding Homer’s top attractions
Homer’s outdoor attractions overwhelm anything you can do indoors,
but there are a couple don’t-miss spots that put nature in context and
are worth a stop even on a sunny day. The town also is one of the best
places in Alaska to shop for art. I provide guidance on spending a rainy
day in the galleries in the “Other things to do in Homer” section, later in
this chapter.
Islands & Ocean Visitor Center
Downtown Homer
The term visitor center doesn’t do justice to this magnificent building and
the fascinating exhibits inside. Everyone coming to Homer should stop in
to see the building, an architectural gem that perfectly reflects the rocky

shores that the refuge takes in, and to experience exhibits that use tech-
nology and a deft sense of theater to re-create remote places in thought
and feel. It is also the best place to stop for information if you plan to go
outdoors anywhere in the area, or to learn about the Alaska Maritime
National Wildlife Refuge and the Kachemak Bay Research Reserve, the co-
sponsoring organizations. A film about the brave scientists who work in
the fierce wilderness of the refuge’s outer reaches, in the Aleutian Islands,
shows frequently in the auditorium. An easy nature trail descends to the
salt marsh below the center.

9 a.m.–6 p.m.; winter hours vary but at a minimum are Tues–Sat noon to 5 p.m.
Pratt Museum
Downtown Homer
The Homer Society of Natural History’s award-winning museum is as good
as any you’ll find in a town of this size. The Pratt displays art and explains
local history, too, but it’s strongest in natural history. It helped pioneer
technology that allows viewing of wildlife through live remote-control cam-
eras without disturbing the animals. Visitors at the museum can watch
puffins and other birds on Gull Island, and operate the camera’s controls.
Another remote camera focuses on the brown bears of Katmai National
Park. There is a saltwater aquarium housing local marine life, and if you’re
curious about all the fishing boats down in the harbor, you can find out
about the different types of gear as well as the fish they catch. In the small
botanical garden outside, you can learn to identify all the local wildflow-
ers, and a forest trail teaches about the area’s ecology. There’s much more
to see, too, including a good gift shop.

Getting outdoors in Homer
Homer is all about summer outdoor activities; it’s almost a crime not to
get out on that spectacular bay or up into those lovely hills and moun-
tains. Here are some choices.
Driving or mountain biking
Several gravel roads around Homer make for exquisite drives or bike
rides. Mountain bikers can use any of the hiking trails, too (see “Hiking,”
later in this section). Drive out East End Road, through lovely seaside
pastures, a forest, and the village of Fritz Creek, and then follow the bluff
line through meadows toward the head of the bay. The road eventually
gets rough and steep, a good time to deploy a mountain bike. Skyline
Drive has extraordinary views of high canyons and Kachemak Bay; drive
up East Hill Road just east of the downtown area.

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 255
After a boat ride across Kachemak Bay, an incredible wealth of mountain-
biking routes presents itself. This is a world accessible only by water. It
has few cars but many long, remote dirt roads. Rent a bike in town and
take it on a water taxi to the Jakolof Bay Dock. Supreme mountain-biking
routes lead along the shore and right across the peninsula through
forests and meadows for berry picking. A well-maintained 10-mile road
west leads along the shore to the charming village of Seldovia. For a good
boat operator, see “Calling a water taxi,” earlier in this chapter.
Homer Saw and Cycle, 1532 Ocean Dr. (% 907-235-8406; www.homersaw.
com), rents mountain bikes, street bikes, kids’ bikes, and trailers. Bike
rentals start at $25 a day. The shop keeps track of trail conditions and can
offer good advice for your ride. It’s open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m., Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. It rents as well from Land’s End
Resort at the end of the spit, open every day. Reserving bikes a day or two
ahead of time is wise, especially when an outing depends on getting one.
Fishing
Homer is known for halibut, those huge, flat-bottom fish, and the harbor
is full of charter boats that can take you out fishing for the day for about
$275 per person in the high season. Every day, a few people catch fish
that are larger than they are, and halibut weighing more than 50 pounds
are common. You can even bet you’ll catch an enormous fish. The
summer-long Jackpot Halibut Derby has a prize that has topped $50,000
for the biggest fish of the summer, and smaller monthly prizes and
tagged fish prizes. The grand-prize winner is generally more than 300
pounds. A ticket is $10 per day, and, of course, you have to buy it before
you fish. Stop at a booth on the spit to get yours (% 907-235-7740; www.
homerhalibutderby.com).
Getting out to where big halibut are plentiful requires an early start and
a long ride to unprotected waters. People prone to seasickness should-
n’t go, because the boat wallows on the waves while you’re fishing. (See
the tips in Chapter 9 on avoiding or curing seasickness.) One large, reli-
able operator is Silver Fox Charters (% 800-478-8792; www.silverfox
charters.com). Half-day charters are less likely to get way out to the
biggest fish, but they cost a lot less. Rainbow Tours (% 907-235-7272;
www.rainbowtours.net) operates a big boat for the shorter outings,
charging $95 for adults, $85 for seniors, and $75 for children. This choice
makes good sense if you are not a fishing fanatic or are taking kids along,
as a full day of halibut fishing is exhausting and can be tedious. Other
charter boats can be booked through Central Charters, listed later in the
“Booking your outing” sidebar.
Flightseeing and bear-viewing
You can get used to thinking of the mountains across Kachemak Bay
from Homer as the far side of a magnificent stage set, so it’s somewhat
mind-blowing to fly beyond that first line of mountains and see that
they’re just the beginning of a much more complex topography of peaks,
glaciers, chasms, and ice fields. The best person to show you that wild

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
256
country is Bill de Creeft. His Kachemak Bay Flying Service (% 907-235-
8924; www.alaskaseaplanes.com) offers spectacular scenic flights
starting at $175 per person. Having flown out of Homer since 1967, de
Creeft is experienced enough to qualify as a pioneer aviator, but the real
old-timer is his favorite plane, a restored 1929 Travel Air S-6000-B, one of
only six remaining examples of the executive aircraft, with mahogany
trim and wicker seats, which he has been flying and caring for since
1969. Jim Reardon wrote a book about this relationship of man and plane
(see the Web site). The tours begin with the thrill of a water take-off from
Beluga Lake in this unique aircraft.
Homer has several good air taxis providing access to the very remote
areas of the southern Kenai Peninsula and lower Cook Inlet that you
can’t easily reach by boat. You can also use their scheduled service to
explore, flying to Seldovia or even one of the two Alaska Native villages
across the bay. If your main objective is to see bears, however, the best
guides are at Emerald Air Service (% 907-235-6993; www.emeraldair
service.com). Ken and Chris Day specialize in all-day bear-viewing
flight expeditions. Unlike some air services I’ve flown with, whose pilots
may not know much about bears and land only briefly, the Days make a
point of teaching about bears and their habitat in extended visits. They
helped the National Wildlife Federation film an IMAX movie called Bears
and starred in it along with the title characters. Trips include a flight by
float planes on fresh or salt water and then a naturalist-guided hike to
see the wildlife. The couple pride themselves on their care for the envi-
ronment. The trips cost $595 per person.
Hiking
The 7-mile Homestead Trail is an old wagon road used by Homer’s early
settlers. The largely informal trail is lovely and peaceful, tunneling
through alders, crossing fields of wildflowers, and passing historic
cabins with great views. From a hilltop meadow, you can see all the way
to the inlet and the volcanoes beyond. The eastern trail head is at the
reservoir on Skyline Drive — drive up West Hill Road from the Sterling
Highway, turn right, and follow Skyline to the fourth left. The western
trailhead is on Rogers Loop, which branches from the Sterling Highway
just before it crests the last big hill before entering Homer. (That’s also
the place to join Homer’s outstanding cross-country ski trails.) A map
and guide produced by the Kachemak Heritage Land Trust is available at
the visitor center.
If you’re a bit more adventurous, one of Alaska’s great outdoor opportu-
nities awaits you in Homer: a hike in Kachemak Bay State Park. The
park encompasses much of the land across the water that makes all
those views from Homer so spectacular. For around $75, you can get a
water taxi to take you (and the skipper can give you all the advice you
need). Have the boat drop you off in the park after breakfast, walk the
beach, hike in the woods, climb the mountains, and then meet your boat
in time to be back in Homer for dinner. (See “Calling a water taxi,” earlier
in this chapter, for names of operators.)

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 257
The park has about 80 miles of trails, mostly linking near Halibut Cove.
The most popular route, with water taxis landing through the day, is the
easy Saddle Trail, which leads less than 2 miles from a seaside staircase
to the lake in front of Grewink Glacier. Many other choices allow hikers
of varying ability levels to get as far from other people as they choose,
climbing high peaks, finding secluded beaches, or even taking multi-day
treks. A free trail guide is available at the town visitor center, the Islands
& Ocean Visitor Center, and the ranger station in Halibut Cove Lagoon,
and detailed maps are for sale in Homer. Bring mosquito repellent and
review bear-avoidance skills (see Chapter 9). For park information
before you go, contact the Kachemak Bay State Park District Office, 
4 miles from town (Mile 168.5, Sterling Hwy.; % 907-235-7024; www.dnr.
state.ak.us/parks/units/kbay/kbay.htm). The office is usually
open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Natural history tours
The nonprofit Center for Alaska Coastal Studies (% 907-235-6667; www.
akcoastalstudies.org) is dedicated to educating the public about
Homer’s natural environment. Near town, its Wynn Nature Center offers
a chance to discover the ecology of the area on easy guided or unguided
walks across 140 acres of spruce forest and wildflower meadow off
Skyline Drive, with an 800-foot boardwalk accessible to people with dis-
abilities. This is a lovely area, and the center has done a fine job of
adding an educational component without diminishing it. It’s open from
mid-June through Labor Day daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with guided walks
twice a day. Fees are $7 for adults, $6 for seniors, and $5 for children 17
and under. Call and ask about the interesting weekly programs.
For a more ambitious and truly memorable outing, take the center’s
daily trip across Kachemak Bay to its facility in the Peterson Bay area.
At low tide, they lead guests on a fascinating guided tide-pool walk. The
center also has access to lovely woodlands where nature walks cover
forest ecology and geology and visit an archaeological site. Saltwater
tanks at the lodge contain creatures from the intertidal zone and micro-
scopes to inspect your finds. It’s a relaxed and truly Alaskan outing. You
can add on guided sea-kayaking or a reasonably priced overnight stay in
a yurt so you’re there, ready for an early-morning low tide. Reserve by
Booking your outing
Setting up a day on or across the water in Homer is easy because one central book-
ing agency represents many businesses. Call Central Charters (% 800-478-7847 or
907-235-7847; www.centralcharter.com) for advice and arrangements for halibut
fishing, boat tours, sea-kayaking, water taxis, the Saltry Restaurant in Halibut Cove,
and even tickets for an evening dramatic performance.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
258
calling the center at % 907-235-6667. The all-day tour is $100 for adults,
$63 for children 11 and under; it operates from Memorial Day to Labor
Day daily. Pack your own lunch and bring footwear suitable for hiking
and potentially wet beach walks and warm clothing for the boat ride.
Sea-kayaking
The protected waters, tiny islands, and remote settlements across
Kachemak Bay are fascinating places to paddle. You’ll probably see sea
otters and puffins and other sea birds. Floating above the shore gives a
great view of life in the intertidal zone — tide-pool creatures above or
below the waterline. You have to take a boat ride first to go sea-kayaking
in Homer, so it costs more than in some other places, but it’s worth it to
get away from town. True North Kayak Adventures (% 907-235-0708;
www.truenorthkayak.com) offers an eight-hour beginner day trip for
$145, including lunch and passage across the bay. True North also offers
more challenging overnight and multi-day trips to remote waters in the
area and a $245 package that includes the day tour, a night in the attrac-
tive Hesketh Island Cabins, and a second day of hiking. Various other
companies offer Kachemak Bay kayak trips, too. See the “Booking your
outing” sidebar.
Other things to do in Homer
Homer is known for its artists and galleries. Take an afternoon to check
out some of these options:
 Bunnell Street Gallery, 106 W. Bunnell St. (% 907-235-2662; www.
bunnellstreetgallery.org), is a nonprofit gallery, in an old
hardware store near Bishop’s Beach at the lower end of Main
Street. One of my favorite galleries in Alaska, Bunnell was made by
and for artists and is a noncommercial, often surprising place. It’s
open in summer daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., in winter Tuesday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Norman Lowell Studio & Gallery is on Sterling Highway at mile
160.9, near Anchor Point, about 12 miles from Homer (% 907-235-
7344). Lowell built his own huge gallery on his homestead to show
his life’s work. The immense oils of Alaska landscapes, which are
not for sale, hang in a building that counts as one of Alaska’s largest
art museums. Lowell or his wife, Libby, often serve as host to
guests walking through and sell smaller paintings and prints from
their shop. This sincere, dramatic, and expert work can be quite
moving. Hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. They’re closed mid-September through May 1.
 For some more downtown gallery hopping, a widely distributed
brochure lists most of the galleries in town, with a map. (Find it
online at http://fireweedgallery.com/cs4.pdf.) Many are close
together on Pioneer Avenue. Among my favorites are Ptarmigan
Arts, 471 E. Pioneer Ave. (% 907-235-5345; www.ptarmiganarts.

Chapter 16: The Kenai Peninsula 259
com), an artists’ co-op showing a cross-section of what the area
offers; the Fireweed Gallery, 475 E. Pioneer Ave. (% 907-235-3411;
http://fireweedgallery.com), right next door in an elegant, airy
space; and the large, friendly Art Shop Gallery, 202 W. Pioneer Ave.
(% 907-235-7076; www.artshopgallery.com).
Nightlife
The Pier One Theatre (% 907-235-7333; www.pieronetheatre.org) is
a strong community theater group, housed in a square, red building on
the spit, just short of the small-boat harbor on the left. It presents seri-
ous drama, musicals, comedy, dance, classical music, and youth theater
events. There’s generally something playing Thursday through Sunday
nights in the summer. Check the Homer News or the Web site for current
listings. They strongly recommend making reservations by phone; you
can change or cancel your reservations if necessary. Tickets are some-
times also available at the door.
The landmark Salty Dawg Saloon is a small log cabin on the spit with a
lighthouse on top — you can’t miss it. This is the place to swap fish sto-
ries after a day on the water. Wherever you go to hoist a beer, order a
draft from the Homer Brewing Company — Red Knot Ale is my favorite.

I
f you’re expecting Fairbanks, Alaska’s second-largest city and the site
of the University of Alaska’s main campus, to be somewhat cosmopoli-
tan, not only are you wrong, you could hurt people’s feelings. Fairbanks
doesn’t pride itself on being at the center of things; it likes being out on
the edge. The city is the last outpost before the great, unpeopled
expanse of Alaska, a town with a self-image of being tougher and more
extreme than anyplace else. It’s got a full range of eccentrics, from gra-
nola-crunching university types who climb glaciers to bear-eating gold
prospectors who would like to see Alaska become its own nation. And
not many people in the middle — most live here for a reason, not
because it’s just where they happened to end up. Nothing stops them,
not even winter days that can drop to –40°F (–40°C). They claim to like it.
Individualism and toughness are Alaskans’ favorite qualities about them-
selves (whether in truth or in myth), and Fairbanks is the quintessential
Alaska town. But truth be told, individualism and toughness can have
their downside. Fairbanks is not pretty. The downtown area has been
sucked dry by its outskirts, which look like any other suburban commer-
cial area in the United States: lots of malls and parking lots. Sightseeing
centers on sites beyond the urban core: the university, which has a
great museum and other sights, a big community park, and several com-
mercial tourist attractions. Indeed, some visitors tell me Fairbanks was a
disappointment.
But I love going to Fairbanks, especially if I’ve got my children along. The
Chena River runs through town and you can float right up to a restau-
rant for dinner. With its many accessible river floats, Fairbanks is
Alaska’s canoeing capital. Pioneer Park (formerly called Alaskaland) has
charmed and amused my family for hours. And the outlying residential

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 261
areas and the roads out of town are lovely, with big rounded hills
clothed in birch and spruce trees. A little farther afield, Chena Hot
Springs Road leads to wonderful day hikes and swimming at the springs.
If you can get into the lusty spirit of the place, Fairbanks can be a lot 
of fun.
Getting There
I think renting a car or RV in Anchorage and making Fairbanks the far
point in a driving loop that includes the Richardson Highway and Denali
National Park makes the most sense. The next chapter explains the high-
way layout and suggests some loop itineraries. But you can also save
time and many miles of driving by flying, or, if time is not a concern, by
taking the train to Fairbanks and renting a car there. The train is slow,
taking 12 hours from Anchorage to Fairbanks. Driving takes under seven
hours and flying takes about one hour.
By car
Roads from the rest of the world enter Fairbanks from two directions.
The Richardson Highway connects the city east 98 miles to Delta
Junction, the end point of the Alaska Highway, and then south to
Glennallen and Valdez. The Parks Highway links Fairbanks to Denali
National Park, 120 miles away, and then on to Anchorage, 358 miles
south. These are all paved, two-lane highways, and you can usually do
65 mph in the summer.
By air
Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com) connects
Fairbanks to Anchorage. Tickets are usually under $300 round-trip. The
airport is a hub for various small carriers to Alaska’s Interior and Arctic
communities. A cab downtown from the airport is $16 to $18 with Yellow
Cab (% 907-455-5555).
By train
The Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552; www.alaskarailroad.com)
links Fairbanks with Denali National Park and Anchorage. Tour commen-
tary is provided on the nicely appointed full-service trains. The high
season, one-way fare is $64 from Denali and $210 from Anchorage (more
than twice the cost of flying between the cities). First-class Gold Star
service costs $149 and $320 one-way, respectively.
Orienting Yourself in Fairbanks
The downtown area and College, which once was a separate town and is
the site of the University of Alaska campus, are the two original sections

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
262
of Fairbanks. The downtown area sits in a bend in the Chena River, which
bisects Fairbanks. You won’t find an awful lot there, but you can spend a
couple of hours walking around (see the “Other cool things to see and
do” section and the “Downtown Fairbanks” map, later in this chapter).
College is to the west. The airport and the Parks Highway (the road to
Anchorage) are both near College. The two areas are linked by Airport
Way, which is a major commercial strip and a kind of spine through the
city, and by the Johansen Expressway (part of an outsize road network
that makes getting around very speedy). From the east side of downtown,
the Steese Highway leads north to several important places, including
Chena Hot Springs Road and the suburban area of Fox.
Getting around by car
Fairbanks is designed for cars, and they’re the practical way to get
around. Without one, you’ll be restricted to downtown the whole time
and leave with a low opinion of the place. The city is too spread out to
use taxis much. If you fly or take the train to Fairbanks, you can find
many car-rental agencies. At the airport, you can rent from Alamo, Avis,
Budget, Dollar, Hertz, National, and Payless; contact information is in the
Quick Concierge. See Chapter 7 for agencies that will rent a vehicle you
can use on gravel roads such as the Dalton Highway — most car-rental
firms don’t allow it.
Getting around by bus
If saving money is your primary consideration, you can use the Fairbanks
North Star Borough’s MACS bus system (% 907-459-1011; www.co.
fairbanks.ak.us/Transportation/BusScheduleInformation).
Buses link the university, downtown, the nearby North Pole community,
shopping areas, and some hotels. At best, service is every 30 minutes,
but it’s worse on Saturday, and nonexistent on Sunday. Pick up timetables
at the visitor center or online. All buses connect at the transit park down-
town, at 5th Avenue and Cushman Street. The fare is $1.50 for adults; 75¢
for seniors, children, and people with disabilities; free for children 4 and
under.
Getting information
The folks offering visitor information in Fairbanks have consolidated
offerings in the new Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center
downtown at the corner of Wendell and Dunkel streets. The center
houses the Fairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau (% 800-327-
5774; www.explorefairbanks.com) and the Alaska Public Lands
Information Center (see later in this section), as well as cultural and
educational programs by the Tanana Chiefs Conference and
Denakkanaaga, two area Native organizations.
The visitors bureau maintains information kiosks in the main lobby of
the center, as well as a video nook featuring films about the area and

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 263
Alaska. The staff and volunteers answer questions and provide useful
maps, driving-tour pamphlets, and walking-tour audio players, and can
help you find a room with their daily vacancy listing (weekly in winter).
Several computers are set up for free e-mail access or to look up travel
information. Visitor bureau hours are May through mid-September daily
8 a.m. to 9 p.m., the rest of the year 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The organization
also has information desks at the airport and train depot, staffed
summer only, and at Pioneer Park, closed entirely off season.
The Alaska Public Lands Information Center (% 907-456-0527;
www.nps.gov/aplic) also has an information counter at the Morris
Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center, as well as trip-planning tables
where you can spread out maps. This is an indispensable stop for
anyone planning to spend time in the outdoors. The staff is remarkably
knowledgeable and can tell you about trips and activities based on first-
hand experience. The counter is staffed in summer daily from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m., in winter Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Native-owned Morris Thompson center as a whole also houses
exhibits about the state and its people and a theater that features daily
free films and naturalist programs. Parking is plentiful.
Where to Stay in Fairbanks
Going the bed-and-breakfast route is a smart choice in Fairbanks, where
good budget motel rooms are few. In addition to the B&Bs I list in this
section, you can find more through the Fairbanks Association of Bed 
& Breakfasts, which lists about 20 on its Web site at www.ptialaska.

Richards, a longtime transplant from the southern United States who
retains, along with a slight accent, the gentle hospitality and refined style
she brought with her. Each cozy room has its own inspired decorative
details in bold colors, and the housekeeping has always been perfect on
our many visits. For visiting with Mary or other guests, a series of elegant

Aurora Express Bed & Breakfast
$$$
South of Fairbanks
Susan Wilson’s late grandmother appeared to her in a dream and told her
there would be a train on a bank below her house, on the family’s 15 acres
high in the hills south of Fairbanks. So Wilson went out and got a train —
a collection that includes a pair of 1956 Pullman sleepers, a dining car, a
locomotive, a caboose, and a World War II hospital car — and her husband,
Mike, brought it all up the mountain to install below the house, right in the
spot indicated. Some cars are close to their original form, and Susan says
older guests sometimes weep over the memories they bring back. Others
were elaborately remodeled into rooms, some small, some huge, on
themes related to Fairbanks history. A full breakfast is served in the dining
car, which also houses the common area, TV, and phone (which rooms
lack). They’re located 61⁄2 miles out of town, so you’ll need your own car if
you stay here.

Grand View Bed and Breakfast
$$
East of Fairbanks
Perched on 10 acres on Chena Ridge, 15 minutes east of town, a big log
house overlooks a panorama of the Tanana Valley and Alaska Range, a view
shared by each of the four rooms. The house was crafted of local materi-
als by local craftspeople — even the furniture — and the understated
decor makes the most of the logs’ rich warmth. Owners Dave and Clodagh
Thompson settled here after extensive travels (they speak five languages
between them) and are raising three young children, whom they keep from
underfoot according to guests’ preferences. Rooms have their own full
bathrooms, but guests share common areas for TV-viewing. Access to the
kitchen is open; breakfast is served 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Despite the bargain
price, guests also have use of the computer center, laundry room, hot tub,
and sauna.

Downtown
Across the river from the downtown center, four buildings around a garden

River’s Edge Resort Cottages
$$$$$
College
An afternoon on a sunny riverbank exemplifies the best of Interior Alaska;
this place is built around that knowledge. Trim little cottages stand in a
grassy compound along the gentle Chena River, where guests can fish for
grayling. Inside, each light, airy cottage is an excellent standard hotel
room, with high ceilings and two queen-size beds. Outside, they’re like a
little village, where guests can sit on the patio, watch the river go by, and
socialize. It’s perfect for families, as the outdoor areas are safe for playing
and noise inside won’t bother the neighbors. A large, summer-only restau-
rant sits at river’s edge, with dining on a deck or inside at round, oak
tables. Dinner entrees — steak, seafood, and down-home cooking — range
up to $30; a burger is $10.

Wedgewood Resort
$$$–$$$$
North of downtown
Off College Road near the Creamer’s Field Refuge, this well-kept hotel
sprawls across a grassy, 23-acre complex in eight large buildings. Seven of
them are three-story apartment buildings converted into suites, regularly
refitted, without elevators but with large living rooms, separate dining
areas, fully equipped kitchens, air-conditioners, two TVs, balconies, and
phones with voice mail in both the living room and bedroom. The main
difference from home is that someone else cleans up after you. Another
157 units are large standard hotel rooms in the three-story Bear Lodge,
which has its own lobby; however, those are closed mid-September
through mid-May. A scheduled courtesy van runs to the airport and train
depot and various tourist sites in the summer, and there are many guest
services on the grounds. A footbridge connects the hotel to Creamer’s
Field, and the Alaska Bird Observatory has its research and educational
center on the grounds (see “Hiking and bird-watching,” later in this chap-
ter). The same company owns Sophie Station Hotel, which is nearer to
the airport. It’s similar to the Wedgewood but has smaller (although still
roomy) suites. The Sophie boasts elevators, is all in one building, and has
a very good restaurant.

Westmark Fairbanks Hotel & Conference Center

Downtown
This Fairbanks landmark, the town’s grand meeting place, owned by
Holland America Line, fills a city block and includes the city’s tallest tower
(not exactly a skyscraper, but you don’t need to be very high for good
views in Fairbanks). The decor in newer rooms is the city’s most stylish,
with a post-mod pastiche that includes fabrics and lamps out of The
Jetsons along with colonial woodwork; big, manly furniture; and lots of
color. I like it. The rooms are packed with amenities, including, in many,
little shelves for the coffeemakers so they’re not down with your tooth-
paste. Downstairs, the hotel has a cafe with a dining room that’s a work of
art (open summer only) and a comfortable steakhouse. A complimentary
breakfast is served in the winter months. All the usual high-end amenities
are on the grounds, including a fitness center and tour desk. The hotel also
offers a courtesy van.

Where to Dine in Fairbanks
The Bakery
$–$$
Near downtown
DINER
You can find an infinite number of old-fashioned coffee shops in and
around Fairbanks — the kind of places where a truck driver or gold miner
can find a hearty, down-home meal, a motherly waitress, and a bottomless
cup of coffee. This is one of the better versions. The sourdough pancakes
are good, the menu is long and inexpensive, portions are huge (sometimes
they require two plates), and the service is fast and friendly. You can get
breakfast all day (of course). They have no liquor license.
See map p. 264. 69 College Rd., Fairbanks. % 907-456-8600. Main courses: $7–$11
lunch, $9–$21 dinner. MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 6 a.m.–9 p.m. (until 8 p.m. in winter), 
Sun 7 a.m.–4 p.m.
Gambardella’s Pasta Bella
$$–$$$
Downtown
ITALIAN
This warm, charming restaurant is right in the center of things. The
chicken rustico (which sits on polenta) is tasty; they serve seafood in inter-
esting ways; and the lasagna — made with sausage, thin noodles, and a
rich, dusky tomato sauce — will improve your opinion of this abused dish.
Dining rooms are narrow and segmented, so you always seem to be sitting
with just a few other people, with elaborate decoration that adds to a
pleasingly busy feeling. The restaurant added more space with a second-
story dining room and patio while keeping the cozy ambience. Unlike the
synthetic ambience of some of Fairbanks’s other fine-dining places,
Gambardella’s feels real, a place where a family shares its cuisine. Perfect,
no — but pleasant and satisfying. They serve beer and wine.

ECLECTIC
In a big room of chrome, stone, and glass right downtown (at the base of
the Marriott Spring Hill Suites), Lavelle’s has a grown-up, cosmopolitan
feel that is quite welcome when you weary of the Alaskan rustic or gold-
rush themes of many of the area’s restaurants. It’s also got the advantage
of consistently superb food, ambitious in conception and fine in execu-
tion, and expert service. The cuisine is difficult to categorize, as Southwest
and Italian influences might be brought to a single dish, and Northwest,

Asian, and French influences turn up variously. Dinner main courses are
mostly over $20, but you can dine economically on the ample appetizers
and salads, or choose a vegetarian lasagna that, for only $16, comes with
soup or a salad and side dishes. The wine list is impressive and the 3,000-
bottle cellar is behind glass in the middle of the dining room; the owners
are on a mission to educate Fairbanks about wine, as they’ve already done
with food by creating one of Alaska’s best restaurants.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage

Sitting on the deck over the Chena, you can watch the riverboat paddle by
or a group in canoes stop for appetizers and drinks from the full bar. For
dinner, the cuisine is a cut above the area’s typical steaks and seafood and
includes game you may not have tried, including reindeer and musk ox.
Dishes such as the halibut Florentine and the fish chowder — hearty,
creamy, and flavorful — make the most of the regional ingredients with-
out trying to get too fancy. Many of the side dishes are a la carte, so,
although main courses are generous, it’s expensive to order a large meal.
Besides, you’ll want to save room for one of the exceptional desserts. They
serve a big Sunday brunch, too.

Thai House

Downtown
THAI
In a small, brightly lit dining room in the downtown area, this is a simple,
family-run restaurant with authentic Thai cuisine. Every time we’ve dined
here, the food came quickly and was deftly seasoned and cooked to a turn.
You can rely on the servers, beautifully attired in national costumes, to
help you order; just believe that when they say “hot” they really mean it.
The first time I ate here, I rechecked the bill because it seemed too small.
Thanks to this terrific restaurant and others, Fairbanks has gone a bit Thai
crazy, and now, incongruously for such a provincial town, has at least
seven Thai restaurants. This one is the most centrally located and among
the best, although that debate is part of the fun.

BEEF/SEAFOOD
Locals pack into this squat, windowless building, with its vinyl tablecloths
and stackable metal chairs, for a menu with just a few famous selections:
prime rib, lobster, king crab, and prawns. These are simple, burly meals
with friendly, roadhouse-style service; the menu is printed on the placemat
and vegetables are an afterthought from an indifferent salad bar. But when
the beef comes, you know it — the middle-sized prime-rib cut is over an
inch thick and covers a large plate, an insanely large portion — and the
meat is tender and cooked right. The atmosphere is noisy and super-casual;
people laugh loud and don’t worry about putting their elbows on the table
or spilling a little beer. You won’t run into many other tourists here, north
of the city in Fox, but you do need reservations, and even with them you
often wait half an hour in the smoky bar or a narrow corridor. If this 
doesn’t sound like fun, don’t go; but if you get it, the place is energizing.

Exploring Fairbanks
Some like Fairbanks, some don’t. Other than the attractions at the uni-
versity, the town’s tourist offerings can be rather hokey. The major com-
mercial tourist sites, including Gold Dredge Number 8, the Riverboat
Discovery, and the El Dorado Gold Mine, are oriented to the cruise 
lines’ escorted-tour trade; independent travelers may not enjoy being
part of the herd. Moreover, prices for non-package visitors tend to be
too high, and my recommendations here are offered with that proviso.
On the other hand, the university’s attractions are first-rate, and every-
thing described here can be a lot of fun if you relax and take Fairbanks
on its own terms, as an outpost on the unpolished periphery of the
known universe.
The top attractions
Gold Dredge Number 8
Fox
Authenticity makes this is the area’s best historic gold-mining site. The cen-
terpiece is a 1927 gold dredge, similar to machines in Dawson City and
Nome, standing five decks tall on a barge in a pond it created. When it oper-
ated, huge scoops would dig from one end, the mechanism inside would
digest the gold from the gravel, and then it would dump the spoils out the
back — in this way, the pond and the dredge it supports crept 41⁄2 miles
across the frozen ground north of Fairbanks. Many sterile hills you see in
this area were created by these earth-eaters, for nothing grows on their tail-
ings for decades after. The tour company that bought the historic site
added to the dredge with museums housed in relocated gold camp build-
ings, showing the harsh, colorless life lived by the miners. A 90-minute tour
includes a film, exhibits showing mining techniques, and the dredge, and it
ends with a chance to pan for gold yourself, with success assured.

Pioneer Park
West of downtown
This city park contains Fairbanks’s essence. Created as Alaskaland in 1967
for the centennial of the Alaska purchase, it was renamed in 2002 because
town leaders thought the old name promised too much. It’s true: this is no
theme park. But it is worth your time. The park is relaxing and low-key;
entrancing for young children, and interesting for adults if you can give in
to its charm. Plan on looking around for at least a couple of hours. The
centerpiece is the SS Nenana, a large sternwheeler that plied the Yukon
and Tanana rivers until 1952, with five decks, two of them endowed with
sumptuous mahogany, brass, and white-painted promenades. Additionally,
many of Fairbanks’s small historic buildings have been moved to the park.
And near the park entrance sits President Warren Harding’s railcar, from
which he stepped to drive the golden spike on the Alaska Railroad.
The Pioneer Air Museum is housed in a geodesic dome toward the back
of the park. An exhibit called 40 Below Fairbanks allows visitors to go into
a little room and experience the coldest winter weather in the middle of
the summer. Other attractions include a gold-rush museum, an illustrated
gold-rush show, a dance hall, and an art gallery. The park also offers canoe,
kayak, and bike rentals. And if you have children, you certainly won’t
escape without a ride on the Crooked Creek and Whiskey Island Railroad
that circles the park twice, with a tour guide pointing out the sights. Kids
also enjoy the large playground, with equipment for toddlers and older
children, the 36-hole miniature-golf course, and an old-fashioned merry-
go-round, the park’s only ride. And adults will appreciate the revue and
salmon bake (see “Nightlife,” later in this chapter).

The Riverboat Discovery
Airport
The Discovery belongs to the pioneering Binkley family, which has been in
the riverboat business since the Klondike gold rush and has run this attrac-
tion since 1950. The Discovery is a real sternwheeler, a 156-foot steel vessel
carrying up to 900 passengers on as many as three trips a day. There’s
nothing intimate or spontaneous about the 31⁄2-hour ride, which mostly 

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 273
carries package-tour passengers off fleets of buses, but the Binkleys still
provide a diverting outing that doesn’t feel cheap or phony. After loading
at a landing with shops off Dale Road, near the airport, the boat cruises
down the Chena and up the Tanana past demonstrations on shore —
among others, a bush plane taking off and landing, fish cutting at a Native
fish camp, and a musher’s dog yard. Finally, the vessel pulls up at the bank
for an hour-long tour of a mock Athabascan village.

UA Museum of the North
College
The on-campus museum of science and art is one of Alaska’s best. The
building is a swooping combination of grand, graceful shapes, recalling
moving icebergs, or perhaps the northern lights. Alaska’s largest natural
history collection is here, and its most scholarly, with information pre-
sented at advanced as well as elementary levels. Some of the objects have
a real wow factor, such as Blue Babe, the mummified steppe bison; a 5,400-
pound copper nugget; and the state’s largest public display of gold. The art
is no less inspiring. A towering gallery contains thematic presentation of
contemporary works alongside Native and archaeological objects, sound,
crafts, and much more. A sound-and-light installation on the second floor,
“The Place Where You Go to Listen,” received a lengthy review by The New
Yorker in 2008, which said the piece confirmed Fairbanks composer John
Luther Adams as “one of the most original musical thinkers of the new cen-
tury.” Visit the auditorium for presentations on the aurora, winter, and
other subjects. Audio players for self-guided tours are available for $4.

Getting outdoors in Fairbanks
Fairbanks’s population is extraordinarily active, making use of an out-
door environment rich in opportunities for exercise and adventure. Most
of these activities, however, are not the kind oriented to tourism: Instead
of guides taking visitors to easy goals with spectacular vistas, as in
coastal Alaska, most outings here are do-it-yourself. Take this opportu-
nity to get out on your own. Also, be sure to take a look at “A Side Trip
on Chena Hot Springs Road,” later in this chapter.
Canoeing
The Chena River is slow and meandering as it flows through Fairbanks,
and you have your pick of restaurants on the bank, perhaps floating
from the rental agency at Pioneer Park to the Chena Pump House

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
274
Restaurant for dinner. To pass wilder shores, go farther upriver. The
wilderness section beginning at the Chena Lake Recreation Area, near
the town of North Pole, is about 12 to 16 hours from Fairbanks by canoe.
You can use various access points along the way to tailor a float to how
remote you want to be and how long you want to go, from as little as a
couple of hours. Alaska Outdoor Rentals & Guides, located on the
riverbank at Pioneer Park (% 907-457-2353; www.akbike.com or
www.2paddle1.com), rents canoes and offers pickup or drop-off along
the river for flat rates. For example, to float from the park to the Pump
House restaurant is $37 for the canoe and $19 for the pickup. They also
offer lessons and drop-offs for longer paddles and expeditions.
Hiking and bird-watching
Creamer’s Field, 1300 College Rd. (% 907-459-7307; www.creamers
field.org), right in Fairbanks, is a 2,000-acre former dairy farm made
into a migratory waterfowl refuge by a community fund drive in 1966. The
pastures are a prime stopover point for Canada geese, pintails, and
golden plovers in the spring and fall. Swans are common in spring.
Sandhill cranes, shovelers, and mallards show up all summer. The
refuge’s support organization operates a small visitor center in the old
farmhouse with displays on birds, wildlife, and history, open June
through August daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. They offer guided nature
walks in summer Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 2 p.m., Wednesday
at 9 a.m., and Tuesday and Thursday at 7 p.m. You don’t need a guide,
however: During migrations, use the blinds around the edge of the field;
other times, explore the 3 miles of trails through forest, field, and wet-
land. I especially enjoy the boreal forest nature walk, interpreted by an
excellent booklet you can pick up at the visitor center or from a kiosk at
the trailhead when the visitor center is closed. The Alaska Bird
Observatory (% 907-451-7159; www.alaskabird.org) conducts
research and educational programs on the Creamer’s Field refuge, includ-
ing bird walks and bird banding that visitors can observe (call for times).
It is the farthest north facility of its kind in North America. The organiza-
tion’s building has interpretive displays, a nature store, and a library.
Located just west of the refuge on the grounds of the Wedgewood Resort,
the observatory can be hard to find — look for the signs.
Other options for hikes are covered elsewhere in this chapter. Birch Hill
Recreation Area, just north of town on the Steese Highway, has miles of
trails in pleasant woods; it’s covered in the “Winter recreation” section,
later in this chapter. The area’s best trail hikes are in the Chena River
State Recreation Area (see “Getting outside on Chena Hot Springs Road,”
later in this chapter).
Mountain-biking
Hiking trails around Fairbanks are open to bikes, and the cross-country
ski trails described in the following section are fine mountain-bike routes
in summer, too. You can get many other good ideas from Larry Katkin,
owner of Alaska Outdoor Rentals & Guides, whose main bike-rental

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 275
location is at Pioneer Park (% 907-457-2453; www.akbike.com). He has
a large fleet of quality bikes renting for $27 for an eight-hour day in
summer. People around here bike year-round: In the cold months, they
just use studded tires.
Winter recreation
Fairbanks has real Jack London winters. The visitor bureau guarantees
it. Fairbanks is the destination for a growing number of visitors who
want to experience deep cold, see the aurora borealis, and ride a dog
sled. Chena Hot Springs Resort, covered near the end of this chapter, is a
good goal for winter immersion, but you can also have a good time in
town, especially in March, when the days lighten up, temperatures
become moderate, and the town gets busy with dog-mushing and the
ice-carving contest (see Chapter 3).
 Aurora-viewing: Fairbanks is famous for the northern lights. Some
of the world’s top scientists studying the phenomenon are at the
University of Alaska’s Geophysical Institute (check out their predic-
tions at www.gi.alaska.edu). The cold, dark months are the best
times to see the aurora, and the best places are away from city
lights. Chena Hot Springs Resort specializes in aurora-viewing, but
all you really need are warm clothing and someone to wake you up.
Many accommodations in town offer aurora wake-up calls.
 Dog-mushing: The long winters and vast wild lands make the
Fairbanks area a center of dog-sledding, both for racers and recre-
ationists. Plenty of people are willing to take you for a lift, an expe-
rience not to be missed. I’ve heard good things about Sun Dog
Express Dog Sled Tours (% 907-479-6983; www.mosquitonet.
com/~sleddog), which charges as little as $20 for a quick spin, or
up to $250 to learn to drive a team in a half-day. They also have
summer cart tours.
 Nordic skiing: The Birch Hill Recreation Area, off the Steese
Expressway just north of town (look on the right for the signs and
follow them carefully), has about 16 miles of good cross-country ski
trails, most groomed for classical or skate skiing, and two warm-up
buildings for changing clothes. Several loops of a few miles each
offer advanced skiing on the steep southern side of the hill; loops
of up to 61⁄4 miles provide more level terrain to the north. The area
has a lighted loop, too. At the University of Alaska Fairbanks, a
similar but less varied set of trails start, mostly groomed for skate
technique. The trailhead is at the west end of campus, near the
satellite dishes at the top of Tanana Loop. The university rents
cross-country skis, too, at the Outdoor Adventures Program at the
Wood Student Center (% 907-474-6027; www.uaf.edu/outdoor).
Skis, poles, and boots cost a mere $10 a day.

276
Other cool things to see and do
If you have extra time in Fairbanks, you’ll find enough to do to fill several
days. I’ve gathered some additional highlights here:
 Walk the historic downtown area. The town’s most interesting
buildings are near the Chena River downtown. Across the foot-
bridge from the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center (see
“Getting Information,” earlier) is the Roman Catholic Church of the
Immaculate Conception. The white clapboard structure, built in
1904, has gold-rush decoration inside, rare for its authenticity,
including a pressed-tin ceiling and stained-glass windows.
 See inside Fairbanks’s attic. A visit to the old city hall, at 410
Cushman St., is a chance to see the town as it sees itself, in the
charming Fairbanks Community Museum (% 907-457-3669;
www.fairbankscommunitymuseum.com). A series of cramped gal-
leries offer up old photographs, maps, newspapers, and other bric-
a-brac, as well as skillfully created explanatory exhibits, mostly
focusing on the area’s gold-mining history and development. The
museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission is free. It’s closed in April.
 See ice year-round. The Fairbanks Ice Museum, downtown at 502
2nd Ave. (% 907-451-8222; www.icemuseum.com), shows off the
city’s legendary annual World Ice Art Championships (see Chapter 3). 
Besides a slide show, four expansive freezers with large picture win-
dows contain ice sculptures with an ice artist usually at work.
Admission is $12 for adults, $11 seniors and military, $6 children 6
to 12, $2 children 5 and under. It’s open mid-May to mid-September
daily 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 See the university campus. A free two-hour walking tour, led by
students, meets at Signers Hall June through August Monday
through Friday at 10 a.m., except for days around the Independence
Day holiday. Call ahead (% 907-474-7581) or check www.uaf.edu/
campusmap/visituaf for information. Use that Web site to learn
about other things to do on campus, too.
 Walk in a research garden. The University of Alaska’s Georgeson
Botanical Garden is a pleasant mix of science and contemplation.
Plots laid out to compare seeds and cultivation techniques contain
informative posts on the experiment; but at the same time, the
flowers and vegetables are spectacular, and there are peaceful
memorials and places to picnic here and there. Nearby, the barn of
the university’s experimental farm is open for visitors to wander
through and view the reindeer. The garden is not large, so an hour
is enough time for most visitors. It’s located on West Tanana Drive
at the bottom of the campus (% 907-474-1744; www.uaf.edu/
salrm/gbg). Admission is $2.

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 277
 Pan gold at an educational mining tour. At the El Dorado Gold
Mine, a train carries visitors (mostly on escorted packages)
through an impressively staged tour, including a tunnel through the
permafrost. Visitors gather around a sluice to hear the amusing and
authentic Dexter and Lynette (also known as Yukon Yonda) Clark
and watch a swoosh of water and gold-bearing gravel rush by. You
pan the resulting pay dirt, and everyone goes home with enough
gold dust to fill a plastic locket — typically $5 to $35 worth. Drive
out to the mine after making reservations, or take a $5 shuttle. It’s 
9 miles north of town, off the Elliot Highway (% 866-479-6673 or
907-479-6673; www.eldoradogoldmine.com). Admission is $35 for
adults, $23 children 3 to 12, free for children 2 and under (a bit
high, in my opinion).
Spending one, two, or three days in Fairbanks
Here are some ideas for how to organize your time during a stay in
Fairbanks. I’m not sure I’d spend three days in Fairbanks if I had only
limited time in Alaska (better to add more time somewhere like Denali
National Park), but you can certainly have fun if you do. Each element 
of the following itinerary is reviewed in more detail elsewhere in this
chapter.
Day 1 in Fairbanks
Start your day at the UA Museum of the North. It’s the most interesting
place to visit in town, and it provides a good introduction to the region
and the whole state. After spending the morning there, take a walk on
campus, perhaps strolling through the Georgeson Botanical Garden.
Eat lunch at College Town Pizza, just off campus. In the afternoon, take
a cruise on the Riverboat Discovery. For dinner, dine downtown at
Lavelle’s Bistro.
Day 2 in Fairbanks
Take a morning walk at Creamer’s Field to see the wildlife and learn
about Alaska flora and birds on the wooded trails and at the Alaska Bird
Observatory. At midday, go to Pioneer Park and eat lunch at one of the
small restaurants or food booths. Touring the park, be sure to see the
sternwheeler Nenana as well as whatever other attractions catch your
fancy — it’s a good place to wander. Walk to the riverbank and rent a
canoe. Take your time floating downstream. Finish the paddle at the
Chena Pump House Restaurant, where you can dine and have the canoe-
rental agency pick up you and the canoe for the ride back to your car.
Day 3 in Fairbanks
Here are three options, based on your level of activity:
 Take a morning stroll around downtown Fairbanks, taking a look at
the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center, the Fairbanks
Community Museum, and the Fairbanks Ice Museum. Lunch at

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
278
Gambardella’s Pasta Bella. In the afternoon, drive up the Steese
Highway to Fox to see Gold Dredge Number 8 (you’ll also see the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline along the road here). After the dredge tour,
head back to town to dine at the salmon bake at Pioneer Park and
see the Golden Heart Revue there.
 Spend your morning the same way I outline in the preceding bullet,
but in the afternoon head to Birch Hill Recreation Area for a hike
in the woods, building up an appetite for a big meal at the nearby
Turtle Club.
 Pack a picnic and spend the entire day on the magnificent trails in
Chena River State Recreations Area.
Shopping
Fairbanks isn’t a shopping destination by any means, but the town does
have some good shops:
 The Arctic Travelers Gift Shop, 201 Cushman St. (% 907-456-
7080), specializes in Native crafts, carrying both valuable art and
affordable but authentic Alaska gifts.
 Big Ray’s Store, 507 2nd Ave. (% 907-452-3458; www.bigrays.
com), makes an interesting stop, even if you aren’t interested in
buying anything. It’s known for heavy-duty Arctic wear, camping
gear, and work clothes favored by Alaskans who make their living
outdoors all over the state.
 New Horizons Gallery, 519 1st Ave. (% 907-456-2063; www.
newhorizonsgallery.com), occupies a large space with a combi-
nation of gifts, inexpensive prints, and large oils by Alaska’s best
serious artists.
 Near the airport, at 4630 Old Airport Rd., the Great Alaskan Bowl
Company (% 800-770-4222; www.woodbowl.com) makes and sells
bowls of native birch — salad bowls, of course, but also for many
other purposes. They can carve up to eight nested bowls from one
piece of wood and even laser-engrave a photo inside one. Through
a glass wall looking into the shop, you can see workers cutting the
bowls from raw logs.
Nightlife
To find out what to do, call the 24-hour event recording operated by the
Fairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau at % 907-456-INFO (907-
456-4636), or check the bureau’s event calendar at www.explore
fairbanks.com.
One pleasant way to spend a warm evening is the salmon bake and
revue at Pioneer Park. Dinner is served in the evening mid-May to mid-
September at the Alaska Salmon Bake, in the park’s mining valley area
(% 907-452-7274; www.akvisit.com). Cost for all-you-can-eat prime rib

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 279
and fish (halibut, cod, or salmon) is $31. Beer and wine are available.
The seating area is pleasant, with indoor or outdoor dining. The Golden
Heart Revue is at the park’s Palace Theatre (% 907-456-5960;
www.akvisit.com) nightly at 8:15 p.m. during the same months. It
covers the story of the founding of Fairbanks with comedy and song in a
nightclub setting; admission is $18 for adults.
If you want to get away from other visitors for a while, here are some
night spots where you’ll meet more locals. In the university area, hear
local and imported folk music live at the College Coffeehouse, 3677
College Rd. (% 907-374-0468;
www.collegecoffeehousefairbanks.com); the Web site lists upcom-
ing acts. Three miles south of town on the Parks Highway, The Blue
Loon (% 907-457-5666; www.theblueloon.com) has live music, many
beers on tap, and good burgers; they even show movies and call them-
selves the “cultural epicenter of Fairbanks.”
For something a bit wilder the Howling Dog Saloon out in Fox, 2160 Old
Steese Hwy. (% 907-456-4695; www.howlingdogsaloon.com), has long
been the place to cut loose in the summer. Besides a bar, “The Dog”
offers live music Wednesday through Saturday, a cafe, and volleyball out
back. It’s open May through September.

280
A Side Trip on Chena Hot Springs Road
The 57-mile paved Chena Hot Springs Road traces the Chena River
through wooded hills east from Fairbanks. It’s an avenue to an enjoyable
day trip or a destination for outdoor activities and hot-spring swimming.
The road crosses the Chena River State Recreation Area, where you’ll
find spectacular hikes and float trips, and leads to the Chena Hot Springs,
a year-round resort for soaking in hot mineral springs and a useful base
for summer or winter outdoor day trips. The resort is most popular in
midwinter, when international visitors come for aurora-viewing, but it has
many activities, winter or summer, including horseback-riding, hiking,
cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. (The slow seasons are spring 
and fall.) The owner, a famous and colorful inventor, has built an ice hotel
you can tour, offering the chance to sleep on a block of ice overnight.
Swimming in the hot-springs water, indoors or outdoors, goes on all year,
regardless of the weather. The paved road itself is a pleasant drive, about
11⁄4 hours each way from Fairbanks, but not particularly scenic.
As much as I love this area, however, including the hot springs, I must
warn that the word resort may create some false expectations. Chena
Hot Springs is no Club Med. It’s locally owned, constantly changing, and
full of crazy or interesting new ideas (the ice hotel and geothermal
greenhouse, for example). Sometimes the ground may be muddy, or
forest fires may be coming through, the road may flood, or bears may be
nosing around. Some rooms are rather worn. It’s a true slice of Alaska,
but don’t come expecting the plastic perfection some resorts attain.
Getting there
Chena Hot Springs Road meets the Steese Expressway about 10 miles
north of downtown Fairbanks. (Details on renting a car in Fairbanks can
be found earlier in this chapter.) The resort offers rides from anywhere
in Fairbanks. Summer rates are $110 round-trip for one person, $140 for
two people, and $70 for each additional person. Winter rates are $90
round-trip for one or two people, $45 for each additional person.
Arrange for this at least 72 hours in advance.
Where to stay and dine
The resort is the only place to stay or dine near the hot springs.
Chena Hot Springs Resort
$–$$$$$
Chena Hot Springs
This unsophisticated family resort, set on 440 acres of land in a bowl of
mountains, invites a slow pace, with plenty of time spent soaking or in the
woods. Swimming and soaking are the main attractions. The hot springs
supply an indoor pool, a series of indoor and outdoor hot tubs and spas,
and the outdoor hot pond (100–110°F/38–44°C). Kids are limited to the

Chapter 17: Fairbanks 281
indoor swimming pool, which is kept cool enough to swim, allowing adults
to escape from the noise by swimming outside. Winter is the high season,
when the aurora-viewing is exceptional, away from city lights, and you can
enjoy Nordic skiing groomed for classical or skating techniques, snow-
mobile tours, dog-sled rides, and more. In the summer, you can go horse-
back-riding, rafting, canoeing, hiking, fishing, mountain biking,geo-caching,
ATV riding or flightseeing (for guests only). Many activities are guided and
carry extra fees. Some rental equipment is available.
The accommodations range from yurts to large hotel rooms with televi-
sions, phones, and coffeemakers. The newest rooms, in the Moose build-
ing, are solidly built and nicely done up, but noise can be a problem on
winter nights as guests come and go to look at the aurora. The yurts are
basic but adequate if you want inexpensive lodgings and don’t mind not
having indoor plumbing. The intermediate rooms got new paint, carpet,
and furniture in 2005 and 2006, but were cheaply built to start with. They
have shower stalls, not tubs. The main lodge building contains the restau-
rant and bar. The menu and staff change fairly frequently. Overall, this is
a good place to have fun in the real Alaska, but be ready for some rough
spots.

Getting outside on Chena Hot Springs Road
The best trail hikes in the Fairbanks area are in the Chena River State
Recreation Area and the river is a popular waterway for canoeing. The
Alaska Division of Parks (% 907-451-2695;
www.alaskastateparks.org, click on Individual Parks and choose the
recreation area — not the “site”) manages Chena River State Recreation
Area and produces trail, river, and road guides, which are available at
trailhead kiosks, on the Web site, or in a newspaper, The Chena
Trailmarker, which you can also order from the Web. Or get all that and
answers to your questions in Fairbanks at the Alaska Public Lands
Information Center, in the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors
Center at 101 Dunkel St. (% 907-456-0527; www.nps.gov/aplic).
 Hike the Angel Rocks Trail. A sometimes steep 4-mile round-trip
to huge granite outcroppings, with impressive views of the valley
below. Rather than hiking the loop, go into the outcroppings and
back, as the far end is poorly maintained. The trailhead is at mile
48.9 of the road.
 Backpack or hike the Granite Tors Trail. This 15-mile loop, start-
ing at mile 39 of the road, leads to towering granite tors that stand
at random spots on the broad Plain of Monuments. The tors look
like a surrealist experiment in perspective, at first confounding the
eye’s attempts to gauge their distance and size. Water is scarce, so
bring along plenty. This is an excellent overnight hike, with the
driest ground for camping right around the tors. You’ll find a public

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
282
shelter halfway along. Massive fires in 2004 burned over much of
the trail but it remains passable and the Plain of Monuments was
practically unscathed.
 Float part of the Chena River. Where you choose to start depends
on your expertise. The easier water is downstream from Rosehip
Campground (mile 27), with the slowest of all nearer to Fairbanks.
The upper portion is attractive for advanced canoeists. Canoe
Alaska (% 907-883-2628; www.canoealaska.net) specializes in
white-water canoe instruction for beginners and intermediate pad-
dlers, and leads guided canoe and raft outings and expeditions; a
guided canoe trip costs around $100 a day. They also rent canoes
and offer shuttle service (as does another firm listed under
“Getting outdoors in Fairbanks,” earlier in this chapter).
 Swim and soak in the hot springs. You don’t have to stay at the
resort to enjoy the pools and outdoor hot pond, all fed naturally by
geothermal springs. Swim passes come with your room if you’re
staying at the resort; for day-trippers, a day pass is $10 adults, $8
seniors 60 and over, $7 children 6 to 17, free for children 5 and
under. To get there, just drive to the end of the road.

I
f you’re used to a drive being a chore and a highway being an inter-
state that looks about the same no matter where you are, prepare for
something completely different. Most of Alaska’s highways are lonely
two-lane roads that string together tiny settlements hundreds of miles
apart, with nothing in between but spectacular wild country.
A long drive in Alaska can be a form of wilderness travel. The radio goes
dead. You cross great rivers and mountain ranges and see moose and
other wildlife, but no people other than the ones who occasionally pass
in other vehicles. An hour can pass between buildings. The landscape
evolves and storms cross the skies. A winding road slowly unfolds the
world, displaying land that belongs to you. Alaska’s land is almost all
public; you can get out anywhere to walk through the heather, smell the
cottonwood trees by a roaring river, or feel the cool air of a bright mid-
night on your cheek.
Road trips take a long time around here: You must cover a lot of ground.
If you’re really ambitious, you’ll need a car that you can take over gravel
roads. That limits your choice of rental agencies, because only a few
allow it (see Chapter 7). On the other hand, you have little need to fear
the unknown on an Alaskan road trip during the warm months — you
won’t be eaten by wild animals. It’s a long way between services, but
people are friendly and helpful, and if you have a problem, you’ll muddle
through.
Winter driving on Alaska highways is beautiful (at least during the brief
hours of daylight), but undertaking a long winter’s drive safely requires
some preparation and knowledge. Consider flying or traveling by train
instead of driving between cities during the winter. (For winter or
summer trips, check out the safety tips in Chapter 7.)

I structure this chapter differently from the others. First, I summarize
the qualities of the few main highways. Reviewing this summary with a
map in your hand will help you get a fix on the routes and what they are
like. Next, I describe some of the best driving itineraries, starting with
the loops that most people want to drive, followed by the more extreme,
lengthy, and remote drives.
When planning the itineraries, I link places logically and suggest the
most popular activities, but I hope you’ll use these driving loops as
guides, not plans. For example, suppose you want to see tidewater gla-
ciers and whales in Prince William Sound. You’d need to add to your
plan an extra day for a tour-boat ride from Whittier or Valdez. My goal
here is to give you a solid foundation; build your trip on this base
according to what interests you.
Understanding Alaska’s Road Map
Losing your way on Alaska’s highways is pretty difficult, because there
just aren’t enough of them. One leads in and out of the state, another
connects Anchorage and Fairbanks, another heads to the Arctic, another
to Prince William Sound, and another ends at the Kenai Peninsula.
Despite the state’s enormous size, a usable highway map can essentially
fit on a cocktail coaster, because you need only a few simple lines to
show the entire network of roads.
For planning your trip, you nevertheless need some critical information
that’s more difficult to come by (but which I’m about to give you): the
drives that really are worth doing. Alaska has plenty of miles — plenty
of 100-mile stretches, in fact — that are as boring as driving through a
tunnel of brush can be. So get out your map (or use the “Alaska
Highways” map provided in this chapter) and follow me through this
menu, derived from many long road trips across Alaska. Where necessary,
I provide cross-references to additional information in other chapters;
otherwise, look for more-detailed information later in this chapter. I men-
tion only paved roads here. Remote, gravel highways are covered in the
“Driving to the Arctic and Other Extremes” section, later in the chapter.
 Alaska Highway (Route 2 from the border to Delta Junction):
Running nearly 1,400 miles from Dawson Creek, British Columbia,
to Delta Junction, Alaska, a couple of hours east of Fairbanks on 
the Richardson Highway, this World War II road is paved, but that
doesn’t mean it’s always smooth. Like other northern highways, 
it’s subject to bone-jarring frost heaves and spring potholes. And
the 200 miles in Alaska are pretty dull; the prettiest part is on the
Canadian side, in the Kluane Lake area.

Alaska Highways
Chapter 18: Driving Alaska's Highways 285
 Glenn Highway (Route 1 from Anchorage to Tok): From the
Alaska Highway, this road is how you get to Southcentral Alaska,
including Anchorage, 330 miles southwest of Tok. The northern
section, from Tok to Glennallen (sometimes called the Tok Cutoff),
borders Wrangell–St. Elias National Park. The park has broad
tundra and boreal forest (also known as taiga) broken by high,
craggy peaks — a pretty drive, but not top-five material by Alaska
standards. The section from Glennallen to Anchorage, however, is
truly spectacular. The road passes through high alpine terrain fre-
quented by caribou. It then claws its way along the walls of a deep
canyon near the Matanuska Glacier and the river that flows from it.
 Parks Highway (Route 3): The George Parks Highway is a straight
line from Anchorage to Fairbanks, 358 miles to the north, providing
access to Denali National Park (see Chapter 19). Although this high-
way features some vistas of Mount McKinley from south of the park
and nice views on the wide tundra of Broad Pass, it’s mostly a trans-
portation route, less scenic than the Richardson or Glenn highways.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
286
 Richardson Highway (Route 4 from Valdez to Delta Junction,
Route 2 from Delta Junction to Fairbanks): Leading 364 miles from
tidewater in Valdez to Fairbanks, this route is the most beautiful
paved drive in the Interior. I’ve been hypnotized into awed reverie
on this drive; you just can’t absorb so much beauty hour after hour.
From the south, the road begins with a magnificent climb through
Keystone Canyon and steep Thompson Pass, just outside of Valdez,
and then passes the huge, distant peaks of southern Wrangell–St.
Elias National Park. North of Glennallen, the road climbs into the
Alaska Range, snaking along the shores of long alpine lakes and
crossing the dizzyingly huge spaces of the tundra slopes, which are
good areas for spotting wildlife. The road descends again to the
forested area around Delta Junction and meets the Alaska Highway
before arriving in Fairbanks (see Chapter 17). The state’s first high-
way, it lost much of its traffic to the Parks Highway, which trims
more than 90 miles from the drive between Anchorage and
Fairbanks, and to the Glenn Highway, which shaves about 120 miles
off the trek from Glennallen to Tok. You’ll see few other cars on the
Richardson Highway.
 Seward Highway (Route 1 from Anchorage to Tern Lake, Route 9
from Tern Lake to Seward): The highway leaves Anchorage on the
124-mile drive to Seward following the rocky edge of mountain
peaks above a surging ocean fjord. Drivers often slow down to
admire the abundant wildlife and unfolding views. (See Chapter 15
for more information about this stretch of highway.) Later, the road
climbs through high mountain passes above the tree line, tracing
sparkling alpine lakes before descending through forest to Seward
(see Chapter 16).
 Sterling Highway (Route 1 from Tern Lake to Homer): Leading 142
miles from the Seward Highway to the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, the
highway has some scenic spots but is mostly a way to get to Kenai,
Soldotna, and Homer, places that are discussed in Chapter 16.
The Prince William Sound Loop: Anchorage 
to Whittier to Valdez to Glennallen
Here’s a great way to see Prince William Sound, the coastal mountains,
and the spectacular Glenn Highway sections from Glennallen to
Anchorage, including a trip on the Alaska state ferry from Whittier to
Valdez. The loop works equally well in either direction.
Day 1: Anchorage to Valdez
The loop starts with a drive south from Anchorage to Whittier of less
than two hours’ duration if you don’t stop. But making stops on this
stretch of road is part of the fun. You can spend a full day in the scenic

Chapter 18: Driving Alaska's Highways 287
Girdwood and Portage Glacier areas (see Chapter 15). Near Portage
Glacier, you drive through the unique 2-mile tunnel to Whittier. Important
tips about the tunnel’s opening times are in Chapter 15 as well.
In Whittier, put your car on the Alaska Marine Highway ferry Chenega
(% 800-642-0066; www.ferryalaska.com). The ship shuttles back and
forth between Whittier and Valdez several times a week. Every minute of
the ride is scenic and relaxing. Keep an eye out for whales. A Chugach
National Forest ranger interprets the scenery in the observation lounge.
The fare is $105 for a car up to 15 feet long, plus $89 for an adult passen-
ger (including the driver), with children 6 to 11 half-price and children 5
and under free. You do need to reserve ahead, but a few weeks usually is
sufficient.
In Valdez, check in at the Best Western Valdez Harbor Inn, 100 N.
Harbor Dr. (% 888-222-3440; www.valdezharborinn.com), which sits
at the top of the boat harbor entrance, with double rooms for $159 and
$169 a night in the high season. Dine at Alaska’s Bistro, in the hotel 
(% 907-835-5688). The pleasant dining room overlooks the busy docks.
Day 2: A day in Valdez
Here are some activities for spending the day in Valdez:
 The Valdez Museum & Historical Archive, 217 Egan Dr. (% 907-
835-2764; www.valdezmuseum.org), showcases regional history in
an engaging and often charming way. An annex contains a detailed
model of the town as it looked on another site before it was wiped
out by the 1964 earthquake and tsunami.
 Stan Stephens Glacier & Wildlife Cruises (% 866-867-1297; www.
stanstephenscruises.com) shows off Prince William Sound on
tours daily in the summer. A six-hour tour to the ice-choked waters
in front of Columbia Glacier often encounters seals, sea otters, and
sea lions, and sometimes whales, and costs $102 adults, $51 chil-
dren 2 to 12.
 Take a sea-kayaking outing on Prince William Sound with Pangaea
Adventures (% 800-660-9637; www.alaskasummer.com), or go
white-water rafting with Keystone Raft & Kayak Adventures
(% 907-835-2606; www.alaskawhitewater.com).
 Valdez is a great place to hike or fish. For information, contact the
Visitor Information Center, operated by the Valdez Convention &
Visitors Bureau, 200 Fairbanks Dr., a block off Egan Drive (% 907-
835-4636; www.valdezalaska.org).
Day 3: Valdez to Glennallen
If the weather is clear, the drive north from Valdez on the Richardson
Highway will be a highlight of your trip. The road traces the rocky slot 
of Keystone Canyon and then climbs straight up the side of the sheer

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
288
coastal mountains to high alpine country in Thompson Pass. This spot
has the distinction of receiving the biggest snowfall ever to occur in
Alaska during a 24-hour period (5 ft.) and the most during a season (81
ft.). A glacier that you can walk right up to is located here. A little farther
along, you see the silvery Trans-Alaska Pipeline snaking along to the left.
About 100 miles from Valdez, you come to Copper Center, a tiny
Athabascan community near Wrangell–St. Elias National Park. A remark-
able 85-room luxury hotel is here, the Copper River Princess
Wilderness Lodge (% 800-426-0500 for reservations, or 907-822-4000;
www.princesslodges.com). High-season rates are $179 double. Stop for
lunch at the excellent restaurant, or stay and see the park, making
arrangements through the lodge. The mining ghost town of Kennecott,
within the park, is well worth a visit. Allow two nights for that side trip,
because getting to Kennecott takes time and seeing it shouldn’t be
rushed. (Another lodging option and more details are in the “Edgerton
Highway and McCarthy Road” section, later in this chapter.) In any
event, check out the National Park Service visitor center in Copper
Center to find out about Wrangell–St. Elias, which is by far America’s
largest and most rugged national park.
Another 15 miles north of Copper Center, you reach the little town of
Glennallen, which lies at the junction of the Richardson and Glenn
Highways. If you want to join the northern Denali/Fairbanks Loop (cov-
ered in the next section), bear right (or straight) in Glennallen, taking the
next major left, toward Delta and Fairbanks. For that route, skip to “Day 2”
under “The Denali Fairbanks Loop: Anchorage to Glennallen to Fairbanks
to Denali,” later in this chapter. To remain on the Prince William Sound
Loop toward Anchorage, turn left in Glennallen onto the Glenn Highway.
Heading west from Glennallen, the Glenn Highway crosses tundra,
swamp, and taiga that are typical of Interior Alaska. The wide and dis-
tant vistas are a good place to spot caribou and moose. The road then
rises into the craggy peaks of two converging ranges, the Talkeetna and
Chugach mountains. Stop about 70 miles beyond Glennallen at either of
two welcoming lodges. The Sheep Mountain Lodge (% 877-645-5121;
www.sheepmountain.com) is an authentic mountainside roadhouse
where guests eat simply, take saunas or walk on the high tundra trails,
and bed down in cute cabins, which rent for $149 double. Across the
road, the Majestic Valley Wilderness Lodge (% 907-746-2930; www.
majesticvalleylodge.com) stands farther from the highway and has
impressive common rooms and a first-class cross-country ski-trail net-
work. The rooms range from bargain units for $115 to grander lodge
rooms for $145.
Day 4: The road back to Anchorage
Anchorage is only another 115 miles, but you have plenty to do on the
way. First comes the enormous Matanuska Glacier. See it from the

Chapter 18: Driving Alaska's Highways 289
Matanuska Glacier State Recreation Area, which has an overlook and 
a 1-mile nature trail with explanatory signs at mile 101 of the highway. To
get closer to the glacier, you have to take a rough side road and pay a fee
to the people who own the land in front of it, who also offer camping and
guided hiking under the name Glacier Park (% 888-253-4480; www.
matanuskaglacier.com). Turn at mile 102. The side road is 3 miles, fol-
lowed by a 15-minute walk to the glacier’s face. The fee for the non-
guided hike is $15 adults, $5 children 6 to 12.
More country-style development crops up along the road as you
approach urban Alaska. Chickaloon is the base for NOVA, the river-
riding company listed in Chapter 14; because you’re passing through,
call ahead and arrange a float. Sutton is a little town left behind by a coal
mine that once operated in these mountains. The small historical park is
worth a stop to stretch your legs. Next comes Palmer, site of the Alaska
State Fair (see Chapter 3). Anchorage is an hour further, but you should
also consider stopping along the way at Eklutna Historical Park, Eklutna
Lake, or Thunderbird Falls (all described in Chapter 14).
The Denali/Fairbanks Loop: Anchorage 
to Glennallen to Fairbanks to Denali
Most people who come to Alaska want to see the scenery and wildlife of
Denali National Park (see Chapter 19). The cheapest and most conven-
ient way to get there is in a rented car you pick up in Anchorage (see
Chapter 13). But after you’ve got the car, there’s far more country to see
than just Denali. This loop drive includes the park but also takes you
over some of the world’s most beautiful terrain on the way — places
every bit its equal in their grandeur.
If you have the time, traveling both loops that I describe here makes
good sense (see “Linking Up the Loops,” later in this chapter). It’s also
perfectly workable to reverse the direction of this loop.
Day 1: Anchorage to Glennallen
Leave Anchorage northbound on the Glenn Highway (6th Avenue as you
depart downtown). This day reverses the Day 4 itinerary of the Prince
William Sound Loop, taking you past Palmer, Sutton, and the Matanuska
Glacier to the Sheep Mountain Lodge or Majestic Valley Lodge. If you’re
not ready to stop there (perhaps you’re driving through and skipping
some sights), go another 70 miles to Glennallen, eat comfort food at 
the Caribou Restaurant, and stay at the New Caribou Hotel (% 800-
478-3302; www.caribouhotel.com), where good standard rooms rent
for $143 in summer. Be sure to call ahead, however, because they book
up fast.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
290
Day 2: Glennallen to Fairbanks
Drive north on the Richardson Highway, turning left at the T at the end
of the Glenn Highway and bearing left again at the next big Y. The next
150-mile stretch passes north through the Alaska Range to Delta
Junction. The scenery on this drive is exceptional, even by Alaska stan-
dards, and is a primary reason I recommend this loop. The road rises
from the forest, past a series of lakes, to an enormous area of alpine
tundra, traced topographically by more long alpine lakes. Scan those
wide vistas for wildlife. Although sightings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
are frequent, few other structures interrupt your view along the way, and
you can stop and take a walk virtually anywhere you like.
Consider packing a picnic for this drive, because the area has few good
places to dine. Or, if you get an early start, you can eat when you arrive
in the little farming town of Delta Junction (about three hr. from
Glennallen); turn left at the junction with the Alaska Highway and stop at
the Buffalo Center Diner (% 907-895-5089), on the right, a good, clean
local hangout. If you need a room at this point, the funky but charming
Kelly’s Alaska Country Inn (% 907-895-4667; www.kellysalaska
countryinn.com) is right at the junction, charging $119 double.
Or you can continue 100 miles west to Fairbanks, with one good stop 10
miles along the way at Rika’s Roadhouse & Landing (% 907-895-4201;
www.rikas.com), a historic way station from the days when this part of
the highway was a dog-sled journey of many days. Rika’s is a good
indoor and outdoor museum of pioneer life, with a simple restaurant.
Nearby, the Alaska pipeline crosses the Tanana River on a suspension
bridge, a site that is well worth a look.
In Fairbanks, I often choose the All Seasons Inn; it and other accommo-
dations and restaurants are listed in Chapter 17. For a terrific evening
meal, dine at Lavelle’s Bistro.
Day 3: A day in Fairbanks
Spend a day (or more) in Fairbanks. The area offers a wide variety of
things to do: the impressive UA Museum of the North, gold-mining sites,
hot springs, and other outdoor destinations — there is even an ice
museum. A list of ideas is in Chapter 17.
Day 4: Fairbanks to Denali
Driving south from Fairbanks on the Parks Highway, the first worthwhile
stop you come to is Nenana, about 60 miles along the way. It’s a town
straight out of a Mark Twain novel: a sleepy, dusty riverside barge stop.
Riverboats, in fact, still load with cargo for villages up and down the
Tanana River. Visit the nostalgia-laden Depot Museum and explore a
little on foot, not missing the riverfront, which is enlivened by a Native
craft shop, a gathering place and some old railcars. Stop in at the visitor

Chapter 18: Driving Alaska's Highways 291
center on the Parks Highway to find out about the Nenana Ice Classic
(% 907-832-5446; www.nenanaakiceclassic.com), a contest to guess
the exact minute the ice on the Tanana breaks up and starts to go out.
The jackpot typically tops $300,000. A big book lists the times of all the
guesses.
You should still be able to make Denali National Park for lunch, 120 miles
south of Fairbanks. Stop just short of the park in Healy to eat at the
Black Diamond Grill (% 907-683-4653) and check in at the Motel Nord
Haven (% 800-683-4501; www.motelnordhaven.com). In the afternoon,
enter the park to get your bearings at the spectacular Denali Visitor
Center. Take a hike in the front country or go on a river-rafting ride in
the Nenana Canyon. In the evening, you can catch a dinner-theater show.
All the Denali options are discussed in Chapter 19.
Day 5: A day in Denali
Get up as early as possible to board a shuttle bus into the park. You’ll
need reservations at least a few weeks in advance and a sack lunch.
(These and other preparations are covered in Chapter 19.) Your chances
of seeing brown bear, moose, and caribou are excellent, and you may
even see wolves, Dall sheep, and other hard-to-find animals. Get off the
bus for a walk on the tundra; out of sight of the road, you’ll discover 
how it feels to be all alone in the wilderness. When you’re ready, return
to the road and catch another bus. Stay out all day and dine in the
evening at the King Salmon Restaurant in the Denali Princess Lodge
(% 907-683-2282).
Day 6: Denali back to Anchorage
Drive about three hours south of the park to Talkeetna and have lunch
at Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge (% 907-733-9500; www.talkeetnalodge.
com) before boarding a bush plane at the Talkeetna Airport for a flight
over Mount McKinley and, in season, a landing on one of its glaciers.
(Details about the flight are found in Chapter 19.) After the flight, drive
two hours south to Anchorage to complete the loop.
Linking up the Loops
The two loops I describe earlier in this chapter — the Prince William
Sound Loop and the Fairbanks/Denali Loop — together form a figure
eight over the central part of Alaska. The middle of the eight, where the
two loops overlap, is the Glenn Highway from Glennallen to Anchorage.
With enough time, connecting these two loops into one long road trip
makes good sense, offering everything most visitors come to Alaska to
see, including the fjords and forest of Prince William Sound, the high
country of the Alaska Range and Denali National Park, and lots of gla-
ciers and wildlife in both places and all along the way.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
292
Here are three ways to connect the loops:
 Do the big loop. This is simplest connection, making one big circle.
Start with the Prince William Sound Loop, driving south from
Anchorage to Whittier, crossing Prince William Sound, and driving
north on the Richardson Highway; then join the Fairbanks/Denali
Loop by continuing north at Glennallen all the way to Fairbanks,
then south to Denali, and back to Anchorage. You won’t get to see
the beautiful Matanuska Glacier section of the Glenn Highway,
between Glennallen and Palmer.
 Complete the figure eight. If you don’t want to miss the amazing
vertical scenery of the Glenn Highway as it passes the Matanuska
Glacier, do the entire eight: Travel the whole Prince William Sound
loop, but when you reach Palmer, turn northward on the Parks
Highway to start the Fairbanks/Denali Loop. Complete that loop in
reverse order, ending up back on the Glenn Highway (you’ll have to
cover the middle of the eight twice) before returning to Anchorage.
 Do the Denali Highway. The unpaved Denali Highway connects the
midpoints of the Richardson and Parks highways, running between
the tiny towns of Paxson and Cantwell. To drive it with a rental car,
you have to rent from one of just a few companies that allow their
vehicles to be used on gravel roads (see Chapter 7). The route
opens up incomparable high-country scenery along the undevel-
oped Denali Highway and keeps you off the areas along the south-
ern portion of the Parks Highway that have been spoiled by
sprawling development.
Start with the Prince William Sound Loop, but continue north at
Glennallen instead of going west toward Anchorage. Drive the
Richardson Highway as far as Paxson, and then head west on the
Denali Highway to Cantwell, which is just south of Denali National
Park. Pick up the Fairbanks Denali Loop there in reverse order, vis-
iting the park and then Fairbanks, and then heading south on the
Richardson Highway back to Glennallen. Now turn west, picking up
the portion of the Prince William Sound Loop that you missed, and
return to Anchorage on the Glenn Highway. Following this loop
means you miss Talkeetna and the Denali glacier flight from there
and you drive about 70 miles of the Richardson Highway twice (the
portion from Glennallen to Paxson). You can find a little more on
the Denali Highway in the “Denali Highway (Route 8)” section later
in this chapter.
Driving to the Arctic and Other Extremes
The remote, unpaved highways of the Arctic and Interior offer an oppor-
tunity for drivers to venture beyond the beaten path into Alaska’s wild
country. You won’t be as alone as you would if you left the car behind

Chapter 18: Driving Alaska's Highways 293
entirely, but you can find many places of extraordinary beauty that are
far quieter and more remote than just about anywhere else you can
drive in the United States.
However, venturing beyond the beaten path is not for everyone; there’s
a reason why that other path is so much better beaten. First, you’ll have
to rent a car from one of only a few agencies that allow their vehicles to
be driven on gravel (see Chapter 7). After you have something to drive,
you may need to prepare with extra gas, at least one full-size spare, and
other emergency equipment (again, see Chapter 7). On the longer
routes, you also need food and bedding, because lodgings and restau-
rants can be too far apart to rely on.
When you’re on the road, you’ll find conditions are tough and services
are crude and infrequent. Even at the end of the highway, there may be
little of interest. These roads can be quite scenic, but they don’t all go
somewhere.
Enough warnings. I personally love driving these remote highways in my
own four-wheel-drive vehicle. Doing so is a real adventure, and amazing
things sometimes happen. (When I was sleeping in the back of my four-
by-four on the side of the Dalton Highway a few years ago, I woke to see
a moose mother and calf looking in at me.) If you’re prepared and moti-
vated, go for it. The rest of this section provides a preview of what you
can expect to see and do on these forgotten highways.
Dalton Highway (Route 11)
Built to haul equipment to the Prudhoe Bay oil fields about 500 miles
north of Fairbanks, the Dalton punctures the heart of the wilderness,
crossing the Brooks Range and the North Slope to the Arctic Ocean. 
The scenery is unbearably spectacular, the wildlife is abundant, and the
destination is unique. But it takes a full tank of gas between stops, and
prudence demands that you take extra gasoline in cans just in case.
Services are gritty and rough, and any mishap leaves you far beyond any
ordinary kind of assistance. Although the road is excellent in places, it
can wash out or become rough and muddy for long stretches.
There are only two substantial stops. Roughly halfway, the Coldfoot
Camp truck stop at mile 175 (% 866-474-3400 or 907-474-3500; www.
coldfootcamp.com) has gas pumps, a 24-hour restaurant, and an inn
built of leftover construction camp modular units. The camp also offers
minor vehicle repairs, towing, RV hookup, laundry, a post office, a gift
shop, and a saloon, and it can help arrange rafting, flightseeing, and
shuttles for hiking. Across the road is the Arctic Interagency Visitor
Center (% 907-678-5209), open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily in the
summer. The center has exhibits about the North, a theater for nightly
educational programs, a trip-planning room, a bookstore, and knowl-
edgeable staff.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
294
The next major stop, another 240 miles up the road, is its end at an oil
field security checkpoint. From here, the only way to the edge of the
water, and the true end of the road, is a $37 guided tour offered by the
Arctic Caribou Inn (% 800-659-2368 or 907-659-2368; www.arctic
caribouinn.com). You need to reserve at least 24 hours in advance to
clear security. When you reserve you must provide your name and an
identification number that British Petroleum can use to run a back-
ground check before allowing you on the oil field: a driver’s license,
passport, or Social Security number works.
Denali Highway (Route 8)
I simply couldn’t believe my eyes when I first drove this 133-mile gravel
road connecting the midpoints of the Parks and Richardson highways.
Stunning alpine vistas high in the Alaska Range rival those within Denali
National Park, but they’re open to all drivers, with a rich network of
trails and mountain lakes offering a good chance to see caribou, bear,
moose, and waterfowl. The Tangle Lakes area is lovely for canoeing, and
there are campgrounds and rough lodges at a few points along the way.
The trouble is the road is not always well maintained; at best, it’s a long,
bumpy ride with few services. In winter, the road is not maintained at all
and strictly off-limits. For information on outdoor activities on the way,
contact the Bureau of Land Management Glennallen Field Office (% 907-
822-3217; www.blm.gov/ak, click on “Glennallen Field Office).
Edgerton Highway and McCarthy Road (Route 10)
Running east from the Richardson Highway, south of Glennallen, the
Edgerton leads to the tiny town of Chitina, where the McCarthy Road, a
muddy one-lane route, penetrates Wrangell–St. Elias National Park to his-
toric sites at McCarthy and Kennecott. The road is the rail bed of the
Copper River and Northwestern Railroad, which was abandoned in 1938,
and it passes over high, narrow trestles. The journey of 93 miles takes
two and a half hours, with no services and few views. But the wondrous
ghost town of Kennecott is a great destination, with good places to stay
and eat. The best choice for lodgings and meals is the Kennicott Glacier
Lodge (% 800-582-5128 or 907-258-2350; www.kennicottlodge.com). If
you’re not up for the rough drive, the lodge can help you find an easier
way to get there, too. See the “Prince William Sound Loop” section, ear-
lier in this chapter, for another lodging and dining option in Copper
Center, the jumping-off point for Kennecott.
The Klondike Loop
Following the Klondike Highway (Yukon Highway 2), the Top of the
World Highway (Yukon Route 9), and the Taylor Highway (Alaska
Route 5), you can make a big detour from the Alaska Highway to see the
North’s best historic gold-rush treasures in Dawson City and Eagle.
Consider this loop when you’re driving your own car to Alaska, or when
you’re in Haines or Skagway and have a car you can drive over gravel
roads (generally, not allowed with a rental car). From Whitehorse,

Chapter 18: Driving Alaska's Highways 295
Yukon, to Tok, Alaska, is 502 miles via the loop, including unpaved 
roads — that’s 127 miles longer than the direct and paved Alaska
Highway between the two towns. Completing a circular loop by driving
from Skagway to Dawson City to Haines and then taking the Alaska
Marine Highway ferry back to Skagway covers more than 530 miles — a
great trip, but if you choose to do it, be prepared to spend a significant
amount of your vacation driving.
What you see are historic Dawson City, Yukon, and the fabulous moun-
tain scenery of the Top of the World Highway. Dawson was the destina-
tion of the 1898 gold rush; the bed of the nearby Klondike River
contained thick veins of gold. The town maintains the look of those
bygone days, when it was the second-largest city on the West Coast,
after San Francisco. Many buildings were restored by Parks Canada as
part of the Klondike National Historic Sites, and there is a lot to learn
from the guides and museums. Dawson City also has a nonprofit casino,
a center for indigenous culture, and other attractions easily sufficient 
for two days of touring. The best source of town information is the
Klondike Visitor Association (% 867-993-5575; www.dawsoncity.ca).
For information on the historic sites, contact Parks Canada (% 867-
993-7200; www.parkscanada.gc.ca, a search for “Dawson” will bring up
the Dawson Historical Complex). For information on the Han Nation
people here and their cultural center, call % 867-992-7100 or go to
www.trondek.com.
After passing into the United States on the Top of the World Highway —
this border crossing is open only during the day, and only during the
summer — a further detour leads north on the Taylor Highway to the
forgotten town of Eagle. (Going south on the Taylor leads you back to
the Alaska Highway.) The trip to Eagle adds 66 miles each way on a wind-
ing, narrow dirt road; allow two hours one-way. But, if you have the time,
the destination is more than worth the effort. Eagle is frozen in time, a
treasure of a gold-rush river town with many original buildings full of
original artifacts from a century ago. It’s entirely authentic and noncom-
mercial, with few businesses other than the store, cafe, motel, and B&B.
The Eagle Historical Society and Museums (% 907-547-2325; www.
eagleak.org) shows off the buildings and several museums of materi-
als. Their three-hour walking tour starts at 9 a.m. daily, Memorial Day
through Labor Day, and costs $5. For outdoor activities, contact the
office of the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve (% 907-547-2233;
www.nps.gov/yuch).
Steese Highway (Route 6)
The Steese Highway is a mostly unpaved road that climbs the rounded
tundra mountains 162 miles east of Fairbanks to the Native village of
Circle, on the Yukon River. It’s a bumpy route to Bush Alaska, quite
scenic, with good hiking trails and river floats along the way. Get details
from the Alaska Public Lands Information Center, in the Morris
Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center, 101 Dunkel St., Fairbanks (% 907-
456-0527; www.nps.gov/aplic).

Checking road conditions
Sometimes gravel highways are washed out or too rough to use, so checking current
conditions on any of the routes described here before you go is a good idea. Contact

D
enali National Park is managed the way a park should be: for the ani-
mals, not for the cars. That means a visit is different from what you
may have experienced at other parks, requiring more planning and plenty
of time. You reach the main part of the park by bus, with or without narra-
tion from a guide. If you don’t want to ride the bus, you shouldn’t go to
the park. (There are other excellent options near the park, covered later
in this chapter.) But if you do ride the bus, you stand a good chance of
experiencing a remarkable wildlife safari unlike anything else in the
national park system.
Brown bears (or grizzlies) here live entirely naturally, but they’re used 
to these buses. I’ve seen them walk within a yard or two — not like the
garbage-eating bears that used to climb on cars in some parks in the
Lower 48, but just out of curiosity, like any other wild bear. Elsewhere 
in Alaska, seeing a bear this way can cost more than $400 per person,
because it requires flying out to a remote spot on a small airplane where
bears have not been driven away by people. At Denali, it costs around
$30. The park handles visitors in a way that prevents them from scaring
off the bears. You also have excellent chances of seeing moose, caribou,
and Dall sheep, and less often, wolves and beavers.
The shuttle bus has another purpose that is just as important as the
scenery and wildlife it enables people to see. It’s a mass transportation
system to pure wilderness. It allows people without special skills or
experience to walk on untracked tundra under an immense sky and to
feel what the real world beyond the reach of humanity is like. This is a

big step beyond any trail hike. In most of the world, you need plenty of
money or muscle to travel to such places. Here, anyone can do it. And
when you reach your limit, you merely walk back to the road and catch
another bus.
The shuttle buses are the secret of Denali National Park, and unfortu-
nately, it remains a real secret. Plenty of visitors leave the park disap-
pointed because they don’t get it. They can’t separate from their cars, or
they don’t want to take a long bus ride, or they take a bus but don’t
understand why. Many gauge their successes purely on whether they see
Mount McKinley, a recipe for disappointment, because most days you
can’t see it from within the park. Some tour companies add to the prob-
lem, rushing as many visitors through the park as they can in less than 24
hours, too little time to really appreciate what Denali has to offer.
You need to spend at least two nights at Denali National Park, with one
whole, long day devoted to a shuttle-bus outing. Make sure to reserve
that bus ticket far in advance and remember that everything else at the
park is simply garnish to this main course. Following this advice allows
you to have a truly remarkable experience — one you can’t have any-
where else.
If the bus doesn’t sound like your thing, there are good options in the
region besides a traditional visit through the park entrance. South of the
park, at Talkeetna, you can do most of the same activities as at the park.
The setting is more natural than the ticky-tacky highway strip near the
park, you have a better chance of seeing Mount McKinley, and you may
even save money. Taking a flight around (or even onto) Mount McKinley
with a Talkeetna glacier pilot is an experience not to be missed.
Opportunities to view wildlife from the ground and to hike the vast
tundra are what you give up by opting to go south of the park.
Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
298
Fair warning for the nervous
Really seeing Denali National Park means taking a long bus ride inside the park.
Because the park road is narrow and made of gravel, only lightweight vehicles built
on a chassis similar to a school bus’s are permitted to drive on it, not highway motor
coaches. Different bus types in the park simply have different amenities: The guided
tour buses have cloth seats with higher backs and video screens. Despite the extras,
however, every bus bounces and rumbles along for a dusty eight hours or more on
these trips. Moreover, the buses act like mountain goats on the heights of Polychrome
Pass and near Eielson (aisle-son) Visitor Center. The road climbs without guardrails
and, if you’re afraid of heights, this may not be to your liking. If in doubt, I say go: Life
is short, and you can put up with a little discomfort to see such a beautiful place. But
if you’re pretty sure that you wouldn’t enjoy it, consider going to Talkeetna instead and
seeing the park by air.

Planning Ahead
More than at any other national park, making advance reservations is
critical to the success of your trip to Denali. That’s because the core of
the park experience — riding the shuttle bus to see wildlife and access
hiking areas — is limited by the number of seats available. For the best
bus times, those early in the morning, you must reserve well in advance
during the high season. How far in advance varies each year as the
number of visitors rises and falls. During some years, reservations have
been needed by March for a July visit; other years, a few weeks of
advanced planning has been sufficient. Reserving your shuttle tickets
and campsites as soon as you know the dates of your visit is safest. The
availability of lodgings also tightens in July but isn’t as critical. Reserve
as far ahead as you can, but don’t worry about getting stuck in a dive if
you don’t get your first choice of rooms or cabins, because there are few
really bad places near the park.
To learn more about the park and better plan your visit, contact the
National Park Service (% 907-683-2294; www.nps.gov/dena).
Reserving shuttle seats and campsites in advance
Sixty-five percent of shuttle-bus seats and all campground sites (except
Sanctuary and Igloo) can be booked by telephone, fax, or mail; the bal-
ance are held back for walk-ins (see the “Reserving when you arrive”
section, later in this chapter). Reserve with the park concessionaire,
Doyon/ARAMARK Joint Venture, 2445 W. Dunlap Ave., Phoenix, AZ
85021 (% 800-622-7275 or 907-272-7275; Fax: 907-258-3668; www.
reservedenali.com). Reservations by Internet or mail open December
1 for the entire upcoming summer. Reservations by phone open in mid-
February. After that date, lines are answered daily 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. moun-
tain standard time. (That’s two hours later than Alaska standard time,
where the hours would be 5 a.m.–3 p.m., and two hours earlier than east-
ern standard time, where they would be 9 a.m.–7 p.m.)
Chapter 19: Denali National Park 299
Knowing company names
The main concessionare at Denali National Park, and your main contact for planning,
is Doyon/ARAMARK Joint Venture, a partnership of the Doyon Native Corporation of
Interior Alaska and ARAMARK, a large national firm. Within the park, Doyon/ARAMARK
manages the critical shuttle-bus system, operates most of the tour buses, and takes
campground reservations. There are no hotels inside park boundaries. Outside the
park, an ARAMARK subsidiary called Denali Park Resorts offers river rafting, dinner
theater, camping, and several large hotels. You generally have to use Doyon/
ARAMARK for services within the park; for services outside the park, you can reserve
at the same contact numbers, but you also have many other choices for lodgings and
activities.

By using the Internet (www.reservedenali.com), you can get a big jump
on those who call for reservations. You’ll need a Visa, MasterCard,
American Express, or Discover Card. You can also pay by check if you’re
reserving by phone or mail; payment is due within ten days. But this
option is not available within 30 days of the date you’re arriving. It’s also
possible to reserve by fax, but I’m unable to think of a reason for doing so.
A confirmation will be sent out within two days of your making the
reservation. Take it to the “will call” desk at the Wilderness Access
Center or to the camping check-in desk at the Riley Creek Mercantile,
near the Riley Creek Campground, exchanging the confirmation for a
camping permit and bus ticket. The center closes at 8 p.m. and the
Mercantile closes at 11 p.m. If you’ll be arriving later, call % 907-683-
9274 in advance to avoid losing your site or shuttle seat.
Reserving when you arrive
Internet, mail, and fax orders are not accepted the day before the visit
starts (in fact, they’re mostly sold out weeks earlier), but walk-in reser-
vations begin two days out, offering the 35 percent of shuttle-bus seats
that are held back and any leftover car-camping sites (usually none), and
all sites at Sanctuary and Igloo Campgrounds. If it’s a busy time of year,
desirable shuttle reservations are snapped up early in the day. That
means you may not get a good reservation for the day of your arrival or
even the day after, only the next day after that. That’s why it’s so critical
to reserve in advance.
On the other hand, don’t despair if you arrive without reservations, as the
flow of visitors rises and falls unpredictably. It’s perfectly possible that
you’ll walk into the visitor center and get a shuttle seat on the same day.
Paying entrance fees
Park entrance fees are $20 per vehicle (up to eight passengers) or $10
per person, good for seven days. There is no entrance station to collect
the fee, but it’s automatically added to your bill when you make shuttle
or campground reservations. If you have one of the national passes for
senior citizens, those with disabilities, or frequent park users (called the
America the Beautiful–National Park and Federal Recreational Lands
Pass–Senior Pass; see Chapter 11) you can get a refund when you get to
the park. Entrance fees are in place year-round and are collected at the
Murie Science & Learning Center during winter months.
Reserving rooms
There are no hotels within the park (not counting the remote and expen-
sive wilderness lodges in the Kantishna area) but many outside. The
park concessionaire operates large hotels outside the park, and you’ll
find many other choices (see “Where to Stay,” later in this chapter).
Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage

Packing for the park
The packing advice in Chapter 12 is especially important for a Denali
National Park trip. Although it can be warm or even hot, you should pre-
pare for chilly, wet weather at any time of year by taking along water-
proof rain gear, fleece jackets, sweaters, and wool socks; a wool hat and
gloves can come in handy, too. If you’re camping, bring synthetic long
underwear and warm sleeping bags. Everyone should bring hiking boots
or sturdy walking shoes, binoculars, and insect repellent.
Getting There
For most independent travelers, driving to Denali is the least expensive
and most convenient option. However, the train service is famous and
you can fly as well.
Driving to the park
A car gives you the greatest flexibility in getting to the park, as well as
back and forth to your accommodations, and is the lowest-cost alterna-
tive. However, you can only drive 14 miles into the park with a car — not
far enough to see much (see “Riding the Shuttle Bus,” later in this chap-
ter). The park entrance is four and a half hours (240 miles) from
Anchorage, two and a half hours from Fairbanks (120 miles), on a good
two-lane road, the George Parks Highway. Talkeetna lies on a 13-mile
spur road that branches from the Parks Highway 100 miles north of
Anchorage and 140 miles south of the park entrance.
Taking the train
Taking the train to Denali could be a highlight of your trip, a luxurious
excursion through unspoiled wilderness fulfilling your fantasies of the
golden age of rail. However, it’s also a slow and expensive way to go.
The Alaska Railroad (% 800-544-0552; www.alaskarailroad.com)
serves Denali daily from both Anchorage and Fairbanks beginning at 
8:15 a.m., and arriving at 3:45 p.m. from Anchorage and at 12:15 p.m.
from Fairbanks. The two trains cross and arrive back in Anchorage and
Fairbanks at 8 p.m. Compared to renting a car and driving, the train adds
70 percent to your travel time and costs far more even for a single pas-
senger. The basic one-way adult fare from Anchorage to Denali is $146,
from Fairbanks to Denali $64, half-price for children. First-class Gold Star
seats are $231 and $149, respectively, half-price for children. The full,
daily trains run only from mid-May through mid-September, with some-
what lower fares in the first and last few weeks of the season.
Rail passengers to Denali have extraordinary choices of first-class serv-
ice. One set of Alaska Railroad locomotives pulls the Alaska Railroad’s
basic and Gold Star cars, and other sets of cars with full glass domes
Chapter 19: Denali National Park 301

owned by cruise lines, two of which have seats for independent travel-
ers (although 90 percent or more are filled with their older cruise-ship
customers). All passenger seats are assigned on all the cars. You can’t
walk from one company’s cars to another, but you can walk between
cars in your own train section.
Princess Tours (% 800-426-0500; www.princesslodges.com) has tall,
all-dome cars with table seating upstairs and dining rooms downstairs;
there’s plenty of headroom and large balconies at the ends of the cars
on the lower deck where you can ride outdoors. Gray Line of Alaska, a
part of Holland America (% 800-452-1737; www.graylinealaska.com),
has newer cars that are even better than Princess’s. They’re huge and
comfortable, with all seats facing forward upstairs — an advantage over
table seating — and dining rooms below that are large enough so only
two seatings are needed for each meal. (All meals are served at assigned
seatings in the cruise-line cars.)
Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
302
Getting a look at the mountain
The 20,320-foot monolith of Mount McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America, is
an indisputably awesome sight. The mountain rises straight up from an elevation of
only 3,000 feet, giving it the greatest relief of any mountain in the world — it’s the
biggest single thing you’ll ever see on the planet. The mountain’s Great Gorge is deeper
than the Grand Canyon, even though its floor is covered with an ice sheet that’s 4,000
feet thick. One sheer cliff is more than 2 miles high. No wonder visitors feel driven to
see the mountain and are disappointed when they fail.
Unfortunately, many people do fail to see McKinley. The mountain is often clearly vis-
ible from Anchorage and Fairbanks in winter, more than 100 miles away, but from the
Denali National Park entrance the view is blocked by intervening mountains.
Summertime shuttle buses carry visitors closer, into areas with spectacular views, but
even for shuttle passengers the chance of seeing the mountain is no better than 50
percent. During the summer, clouds pile up daily on the mountain’s flank, making it
hard to see from anywhere near its base. The general rule is that the earlier in the day
you go, and the longer your bus ride, the better your chances. The closest you can get
using the park bus service is 27 miles away, and that’s at the far end of a wearying 12-
hour round-trip bus ride. Staying at a hotel south of the park, near Talkeetna, enhances
your chances as well, because a clear view of the mountain right from the hotel means
you’ll be in place to look when the clouds clear.
The best solution to this mountain-gazing puzzle is to take a ride on a small plane.
Flights take sightseers above the clouds and provide a much closer look at the moun-
tain. Services offer mountain flightseeing from the park’s airstrip, from Talkeetna, or
from Anchorage. The Talkeetna option features pilots who routinely carry climbers to
the mountain and includes the opportunity to land on a glacier way up on the moun-
tain, an unparalleled experience that confirms how big the mountain really is. Details
are in the “Flightseeing” section of this chapter.

The Alaska Railroad’s basic service is in traditional railroad cars. They’re
clean and have big windows and forward-facing seats. Passengers stroll
around and dine when and how they please rather than at assigned seat-
ings. Old-fashioned Vista Dome cars provide a limited but adequate
number of shared dome seats. The upgrade to Gold Star service buys
your own full-dome seat for the entire trip on custom-built double-deck
cars like the cruise lines’, with a sumptuous white-tablecloth dining room
downstairs (eat when you like). These are my favorite cars on the train.
They’re decorated with original fine art and are very luxurious, but you
still know you’re on a train, not a cruise ship, and you’re not treated as a
herd animal. Also, the cars have large outdoor vestibules on the upper
deck. The views and open air there are incredible.
If you choose to take the train, especially one of the first-class options,
book your accommodations as a package at the same time. This is the
only way to get a reasonable price, and it makes the visit much more
convenient, as the tour operators usually take care of moving you and
your luggage around at the park, so you won’t need to rent a car or
figure out the schedules for the shuttle buses that transport visitors
between most of the hotels and the park entrance. Be sure, however,
that you allow plenty of time (see the introduction to this chapter). A
meaningful visit to Denali is difficult without spending at least two nights
and taking an all-day shuttle ride deep into the park.
Taking the bus
Bus and van services bring passengers to Denali and Talkeetna in com-
fortable vehicles aimed at the tourist market. They’re listed in Chapter 7.
Flying to Denali
Talkeetna Aero Services (% 800-733-2899; www.talkeetna-aero.com)
offers the only scheduled air service to Denali from Talkeetna, their
base, or from Anchorage, in the summer only. The flights are sold as
one-day packages, including flightseeing on the way, a bus tour at the
park, a box lunch, and ground transfers. It’s the only way to do Denali in
a day. The package from Anchorage is $495, from Talkeetna $395.
Learning the Lay of the Land
Denali National Park and Preserve is a huge slice of the Alaska Range
that stands like a pivot in the center of Alaska. It encompasses 6 million
acres, a roughly triangular polygon about 20 percent larger than
Massachusetts. (See the “Denali National Park” map in this chapter.) The
Parks Highway provides access to the entrance, which lies at the north-
east corner of the park. (Mount McKinley is on the southwest side of the
park.) A mile north of the park entrance on the Parks Highway, along a
cliff-sided canyon of the Nenana River, hotels and restaurants have
developed a seasonal town known locally as Glitter Gulch, or for

tourism purposes, the Nenana Canyon Area. Other services are avail-
able at Carlo Creek, 14 miles south on the Parks Highway, and in the
year-round town of Healy, 10 miles north of the park entrance. From the
park entrance, a road accessible only by shuttle bus leads west 89 miles
through the park, past a series of campgrounds and a visitor center, and
ends at the Kantishna District, a patch of park-surrounded private land
holdings with wilderness lodges. Talkeetna lies well south of the park on
the Parks Highway.
Arriving in the Park
Getting situated upon your arrival at Denali depends on whether you go to
the park entrance or take the Talkeetna option. I cover each separately.
Arriving at the park’s main entrance
On any self-guided trip (as opposed to an escorted tour), your first stop
should be the Wilderness Access Center on Denali Park Road, a half-
mile from the park entrance. At the access center, pick up your previ-
ously reserved shuttle tickets and campsite permits, or make new
reservations at ticketing desks operated by the concessionaire, Doyon/
ARAMARK. Because the park has no entrance station, the center is the
place to pick up the park map, a copy of the Alpenglow park newspaper,
and other handouts. The access center is open mid-May through mid-
September daily from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. (reservation desks open a 7 a.m.);
it’s closed the rest of the year.
The only means of travel into the heart of the park is covered in the
“Riding the Shuttle Bus” section, later in this chapter. Getting around 
the entrance area is easy using your own car or the various free 
shuttle buses that connect park facilities with nearby hotels. If you
choose a hotel that’s farther afield, it may have a courtesy van; some 
are convenient, others are less frequent. Scope out the service when 
you reserve. Taxis are not a good option because of high rates; however,
if you need one, try Denali Transportation (% 877-683-4765 or 907-
683-4765).
Arriving in Talkeetna
The Denali National Park Talkeetna Ranger Station, downtown
Talkeetna (% 907-733-2231; www.nps.gov/dena), was built to serve
climbers — Mount McKinley climbs start with flights from Talkeetna —
and it’s a fascinating stop for anyone curious about mountaineering.
Rangers are on hand to answer questions, too. It’s open May through
Labor Day, daily 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; winter, Monday through Friday 8 a.m. 
to 4:30 p.m. For information about commercial services, stop at the
Talkeetna/Denali Visitor Center, located in a tiny cabin at Parks Highway
and Talkeetna Spur Road and on Main Street (% 800-660-2688 or 907-733-
2641; www.talkeetnadenali.com). It’s open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in

summer and responds to inquiries year-round with free trip-planning
help. Keep in mind, though, that it’s a business that profits from booking
commissions.
You need a car to stay in Talkeetna, far south of the park, unless you’re
on an escorted tour or staying at a resort lodge that takes care of all
your activities and transfers.
Riding the Shuttle Bus
As I explain in the introduction to this chapter, the high point of a trip
into Denali National Park is the shuttle-bus ride. It’s an inexpensive
wildlife safari and an easy way to get to open country for off-trail wilder-
ness hiking — with transportation always close at hand. This section
provides tips to help you make the most of your ride.
Choosing your bus and destination
Decades ago, when the shuttle-bus system began, the idea was simply to
provide inexpensive transportation into the park. That philosophy still
prevails on the main shuttle fleet: Basic buses traverse the road and
stop for wildlife viewing, but don’t provide food or formal narration
(although some drivers do a terrific job of their own narration).
Passengers get on or off wherever they please for hiking or simply to
enjoy the countryside. Now, however, options for those who want a tour
rather than transportation are also available. The tour buses are more
comfortable and have planned narration, but they don’t let passengers
on and off for hiking.
Shuttle-bus options
Shuttle buses run frequently all day, making wildlife sightings and letting
off park visitors along the park road. Shuttle tickets designate the far-
thest you plan to go, but you don’t have to go to the end of the line. Any
bus can bring you back. The largest number of buses turns around at the
Eielson Visitor Center, 66 miles into the park. Other choices are the
shorter ride to the Toklat (toe-klat) River, 53 miles into the park, or a
longer journey to Wonder Lake at 85 miles, or Kantishna, which is far-
thest from the park entrance at 89 miles.
The Eielson option makes the most sense, balancing a desire to see
scenery and wildlife with the need to preserve your rear end from too
much sitting, while also saving time to get out and hike. That trip takes
about eight hours, and the fare is about $30 for adults, $15 for kids 15 to
17, and free for children 14 and under. No extra fee is charged for getting
off the bus at almost any spot of your choosing for a hike or picnic and
then flagging down the next bus to travel onward. Bring your own food.

Chapter 19: Denali National Park 307
Narrated bus tours
All narrated tours use the same lightweight buses as the shuttles, which
are similar to school buses but sized and outfitted for adult riders.
However, the Doyon/ARAMARK tour buses have higher-backed cloth
seats and those on the Tundra Wildlife Tour include closed-circuit video
that allows the driver to zoom in on distant wildlife. However, none of
the narrated tours allows you to get off on your own.
 The Natural History Tour ($56 adults, $28 children 14 and under,
including park fee) travels only 17 miles down the park road, barely
farther than you can drive yourself, and misses most of what you
come to Denali to see. It’s best for those who simply can’t tolerate a
long bus ride. Reserve through Doyon/ARAMARK.
 The Tundra Wilderness Tour ($94 adults, $47 children 14 and
under, including park fee and lunch) travels to Toklat when Mount
McKinley is hidden by clouds, and 9 miles farther, to Stony Hill,
when McKinley is visible. This route hits much of the best wildlife
habitat. Reserve through Doyon/ARAMARK.
 Kantishna Wilderness Trails (% 800-942-7420; www.seedenali.
com), Denali Backcountry Tours (% 888-560-2489), and Doyon/
ARAMARK’s Kantishna Experience all cover the entire park road
with a 190-mile, 13-hour marathon that includes lunch and activi-
ties at the halfway mark at the Kantishna area (private land within
the park). The cost is $139 to $149. Doyon/ARAMARK offers a 
half-off discount for children, but no kid I know can stay sane on 
a 13-hour bus ride.
Getting ready
Reserve your shuttle ticket for as early as you can stand to get up in the
morning. This strategy allows more time for day hikes and enhances
Staying sane in the park with kids
Denali can be a challenge for families. Young children tend to go nuts when subjected
to an eight-hour bus ride, and they aren’t often able to pick out the wildlife. The park
isn’t like a zoo, and most animals blend in with their surroundings. Likewise, even older
children have a hard time keeping their patience on these trips, as do many adults.
The best solution: Get off the bus along the route and turn your trip into a romp in the
heather. After you’ve had a chance to revive, catch the next bus. Remember: Just
because you buy a ticket to a certain turnaround point doesn’t mean that you have to
go that far. Keep in mind, too, that if your child normally needs a car seat, you must
bring it along on the bus, too.

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage

your chances of seeing the mountain and wildlife. During peak season,
the first bus leaves the visitor center at 5:30 a.m. and then roughly every
15 to 30 minutes in the morning. A few buses leave in the afternoon,
mostly to pick up stragglers on the way back, returning late under the
midnight sun.
Here’s a checklist for preparing the night before you catch your morning
shuttle bus:
 Lunch (several restaurants pack them) and plenty of water
 Sturdy walking shoes and layers of warm and lighter clothing with
rain gear packed
 Binoculars or a spotting scope
 Insect repellent
 Camera with long lens (optional)
 A copy of the mile-by-mile Denali Road Guide, available inexpen-
sively at the park bookstores (optional)
 For extensive hiking, a detailed topographic map ($9.95 at the visi-
tor center) and a compass (not necessary if you’re just walking a
mile or two off the road)
Spotting wildlife on your way
The shuttle bus has no reserved seats, but if you arrive early, you can
find a place on the left side, which has the best views on the way out.
Bus passengers often see grizzly bears, caribou, Dall sheep, moose, and
occasionally wolves. (But it’s all up to chance — some see no wildlife at
all.) Calling out whenever you spot any wildlife is common courtesy on
the shuttle bus so that others can see it, too. The driver stops the bus
and everyone rushes to your side of the bus. After you’ve had a look,
give someone else a chance to look out your window or to take a pic-
ture. Try to be quiet and don’t stick anything outside of the bus, because
that can scare away the animals.
Hiking and Backpacking from the Shuttle Bus
Walking away from the road takes a little courage, but doing so may be
the best chance you ever have for experiencing a place like this on your
own. The major risks of hiking are avoidable. It can get cold and wet in
midsummer, so you need to be prepared with layers of warm, waterproof
clothing to avoid the spiraling chill of hypothermia. The rivers are dan-
gerous because of their fast-flowing icy-cold water. Experienced back-
country trekkers plan their routes to avoid crossing sizable rivers. (See
Chapter 9 for other health and safety tips.)

Chapter 19: Denali National Park 309
Day hikes by bus
For a first foray beyond the trails, consider joining one of the hikes
guided by a park ranger. One or two daily Discovery Hikes take off from
spots along the park road. One hike goes well inside the park, toward
the Eielson Visitor Center, and the other stays closer to the entrance end
of the park. A ranger leads only 11 hikers while teaching about the
nature of the surrounding terrain. Plan for a 5- to 11-hour day, including
the shuttle ride. Actual hiking time is about four hours. The hikes gener-
ally aren’t too strenuous for families with school-age children, but
inquiring about how steep the hike will be is wise if you have any
doubts. Hikes cost no more than the price of your shuttle ticket. You
need to wear hiking shoes or boots and bring food, water, and rain gear.
Reserve a place in advance, because hikes fill up in July, and you’ll need
to know when and where to catch special buses.
Here are some good hiking areas along the park road shuttle-bus ride by
milepost. You don’t need a permit for any day hike:
 Mile 34: Manageable climbs on Igloo, Cathedral, and Sable moun-
tains take off along the road from Igloo Creek to Sable Pass.
 Mile 53: The bed of the Toklat River is a flat plain of gravel with
easy walking. The glaciers that feed the river are 10 miles
upstream.
 Mile 58: Highway Pass is the highest point on the road. In good
weather, dramatic views of Mount McKinley start here. The alpine
tundra from here is inviting for walking, but beware of holes that
can turn an ankle.
Backpacking
Imagine backpacking alone in your own area of wilderness, without
trails, limits, or the chance of seeing other people. Retracing your route
to get back to the bus isn’t necessary: Anywhere you meet the 89-mile
Denali Park Road, you can catch a bus back to the world of people. Any
experienced backpacker should consider a backcountry trek at Denali.
There are planning issues and outdoor risks in this open country that
make setting up a trip more challenging than on an ordinary trail. (This
section is about overnight trips, not day hikes; going for the day
requires little planning and no permits.) You need to be able to find your
own way without a path, know what hazards to avoid (such as crossing
rivers or climbing on slippery loose rock), and take care of yourself with-
out expecting a lot of other people to come along to help.
Permits for wilderness overnights in the park are issued at the
Backcountry Information Center near Wilderness Access Center, open
summer daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Although you can prepare in advance for a

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
310
trek, you can’t choose a backcountry unit to explore before you arrive 
at the information center and find out what’s available. That means 
you must be flexible about where you’re going and what kind of terrain
you’ll travel.
Information on what’s available and a map of the units are posted at 
the center. Hikers can reserve permits for overnight backpacking only
two days in advance; although you’re unlikely to get one for the day 
you arrive, you can reserve permits for continuation of your trip for 
up to 14 days at the same time. The first night of a trip is the hard one 
to get — for one thing, you can reserve only units that are contiguous 
to the park road for the first night — but after that, each night gets 
progressively easier. Rangers are available to help you through the
process.
Before you go, buy the Denali National Park and Preserve topographi-
cal map, published by Trails Illustrated, available for $10 from the
Alaska Geographic (% 907-683-1272 summer, 907-683-1258 off-season;
www.alaskageographic.org). You’ll also want a copy of the book
Backcountry Companion, which describes conditions and routes in each
area and is published and sold by Alaska Geographic. You’ll also find
both for sale at the visitor center.
Great Activities off the Bus
A bus ride into the park is the main event, but that’s not the only thing
to do at Denali. There are some fun and interesting activities near the
park entrance that you can get to without riding on the bus.
Day hiking near the park entrance
The Park Road is controlled by a checkpoint beyond which only buses
and bicycles can travel; short of that point, in the zone known as the
entrance area or “frontcountry” you can explore without worrying about
schedules or fares. The Savage River Day Use Area, at mile 15, is just
short of the checkpoint. It has a mile-long loop trail and longer informal
routes for great alpine tundra hiking. You can drive there or take a free
shuttle. Ranger-led hikes are also offered at times.
There are several trails near the visitor facilities at the park entrance,
mostly weaving through the boreal forest around small lakes. Only one
strenuous trail starts there, but it is a gem. The steep and spectacular
hike to the Mount Healy overlook is a 5-mile round-trip. The trail breaks
through the tree line to slopes of tundra and rock outcroppings, where
you can see far across the Alaska Range and its foothills in the distance.
Several easy nature trails teach about history and natural history of the
area. Pick up explanatory materials at the visitor centers.

Chapter 19: Denali National Park 311
Flightseeing
Getting a good, close look at Mount McKinley is best accomplished by
air. Frequently, you can see McKinley from above the clouds when you
can’t see it from the ground. These flights take off from the park
entrance, from Talkeetna, or from Anchorage (see Chapter 14).
From the park entrance
Small planes and helicopters fly from the park airstrip, private heliports
and airstrips along the Parks Highway, and the Healy airstrip. Denali Air
(% 907-683-2261; www.denaliair.com) has an office in Glitter Gulch,
and flight operations at mile 229.5 of the Parks Highway. An hour-long
flight going within a mile of the mountain costs $325 for adults, $160 for
children ages 2 to 12. Era Helicopters (% 800-843-1947; www.flight
seeingtours.com) has 50-minute flights for $320, including van pickup
from the hotels. Their heli-hikes land for a four-hour walk on a mountain
ridgeline, with the degree of difficulty tailored to customers’ abilities, for
$450. A two-hour glacier hike costs the same.
From Talkeetna
McKinley climbs typically begin with flights from Talkeetna to the 7,200-
foot level of the Kahiltna Glacier. You can use the same flight services to
see the mountain and even land on it, the most dramatic and memorable
experience available to the typical tourist in Alaska. Several operators
with plenty of experience offer flights. The least expensive excursions
cost about $180, approaching McKinley’s south face without landing. If
possible, however, and if the weather is good, buy an extended tour that
circles the entire mountain and flies over its glaciers, for $235 to $295 per
person. Best of all, you can arrange a landing on the mountain itself, just
as the climbers do. The Don Sheldon Amphitheater on the Ruth Glacier is
a stunning spot high on McKinley; only after you stand there do you real-
ize the incredible scale of what you’ve seen from above. Landings are
usually treated as add-ons to the tours mentioned here, for an additional
price of around $75 to $85 per person.
Try any of these glacier-flight operations that operate out of the Talkeetna
airport: Talkeetna Air Taxi (% 800-533-2219; www.talkeetnaair.com),
Talkeetna Aero Services (% 888-733-2899; www.talkeetna-aero.com),
or K-2 Aviation (% 800-764-2291 or 907-733-2291; www.flyk2.com). It’s
wise to reserve at least a couple of days ahead and to go early in the
morning, before the daily cloud buildup.
Rafting
Rafting on the Nenana River, which borders the park along the Parks
Highway, is fun and popular. Several commercial guides float two
stretches of the river: an upper portion, where the water is smoother
and the guides explain passing scenery; and the lower portion, where

Part IV: Road Trips from Anchorage 
312
the river roars through the rock-walled Nenana Canyon, and rafts take
on huge splashes of silty, glacial water through class III and IV rapids.
Each session takes two to two and a half hours, including safety brief-
ings, suiting up, and riding to and from the put-in and takeout points.
Prices vary from $76 to $104 for adults, with discounts for children that
range from $10 off to half-price. I’ve been impressed by Denali Outdoor
Center (% 888-303-1925; www.denalioutdoorcenter.com), which has
run an independent, professional tour for many years, offering rafting
trips and instruction in river techniques. It is located 21⁄2 miles north of
the park entrance at Otto Lake Road, at mile 247 of the Parks Highway,
and also has an office right in Glitter Gulch. Whoever you go with, plan
for a shower afterward — the silt in the river water will stick to your skin
and hair.
If you go to Talkeetna, Talkeetna River Guides, on Main Street (% 800-
353-2677; www.talkeetnariverguides.com), offers a two-hour wildlife
river-rafting tour, without white water, over 9 miles of the Talkeetna
River three times a day for $69 adults, $49 children 10 and under. They
also offer longer outfitted expeditions.
Ranger programs
Check the park newspaper, The Alpenglow, for ranger talks and slide
shows that happen as often as several times a day in the frontcountry
area (near the entrance) and at the Riley Creek, Savage River, and
Teklanika campgrounds. A daily demonstration of the park’s sled-dog
teams is a highlight at the kennels. I mention ranger-led hikes in the “Day
hikes by bus” section, earlier in this chapter.
Visiting educational centers
The 14,000-square-foot Denali Visitor Center introduces the park and its
connections to the rest of the world in a spectacular building. Life-size
models of cranes overhead lead to an enormous mural, 60 by 28 feet in
size, showing the landscape types found at the park. The carpet simu-
lates a flowing river of gray and brown, making a path to an exhibit area
with recreations of Denali wildlife, including a full-scale moose stepping
through deep snow. You’ll also find exhibits on the Athabascan people,
mining, tourism, and scientific research. On the upper floor, a large topo-
graphic model of the park demonstrates the arbitrary nature of its
boundaries and another exhibit shows the six-continent routes of migra-
tory birds found at Denali. An award-winner orientation film, Heartbeats
of Denali, lasts 18 minutes. Summer hours are daily 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the
center is closed in the winter.
Also near the park entrance, the Murie Science & Learning Center 
(% 866-683-1269; www.murieslc.org) supports research and offers 
programs about the park. It’s located about a mile in along the park road
on the right side. The lobby houses changing science exhibits. A variety
of organizations participate in programming, with evening lectures,
morning walk-in science presentations, youth camps, and natural history

Chapter 19: Denali National Park 313
field seminars for adults and for families with older or younger children.
Three-day courses are around $320 per person. Check topics and register
well in advance on the Web site. The center is open in the summer daily
9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., winter daily 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Where to Stay
At Denali, how much you pay for your room depends on how far from
the park entrance you stay. The roadside Glitter Gulch area near the
park entrance is dominated by large hotels with rack rates well over
$200 a night. Most guests don’t pay that much, however, because the
hotels are owned by cruise lines or their vendors, and generally are
filled with guests on escorted package tours. Bargain hunters can some-
times nab discounted rooms or off-season sales at the large hotels, but I
prefer to concentrate on smaller, locally owned places catering primarily
to independent travelers. These usually have more character and more
reliably affordable rates, and most are located 14 miles south of the park
in Carlo Creek or 10 miles north in Healy.
I also include lodgings in Talkeetna, more than two hours south of the
park. However, stay there only if you plan to spend all your time in that
area and will enter the park itself by air, if at all.

Horseshoe Lake and the other, larger hotels, the cabins are roomy and
comfortable, especially those on the 100 and 200 level. A log cabin and the
warmth of the Crofoot family seem more Alaskan than the modern, stan-
dard rooms that have filled the canyon, and the rates are reasonable for
the area (believe it or not). They offer a tour desk and courtesy van and
there is a hot tub on the deck. You spend a lot of time climbing stairs, how-
ever; and the rooms have shower enclosures, not tubs. The restaurant, the
Overlook Bar & Grill, is recommended separately under “Where to Dine,”

there’s a coffeehouse, Henry’s, serving breakfast and dinner and packing
sack lunches, where naturalist slide shows happen in the evening. In the
winter, the lodge operates as the dog-sledding concessionaire for Denali

This well-kept property of many buildings along Moose Creek in the old

opportunities of the area. Some rooms are large and luxurious, while
others are in smaller single cabins with lofts. The log central lodge has an
attractive lobby with people coming and going. The location is the main
thing, however: deep within the park, near Mount McKinley (although
without a view), and with a lengthy roster of activities making use of the
surroundings, including guided hikes, fishing, interpretive programs,
biking, gold panning, a daily sled-dog demonstration, and the bus ride from
the park entrance, all included in the rate. Several other excellent lodges
exist in the Kantishna area, but I think the rates and facilities of this one
would make it the first choice for most readers.

it’s not a gaudy showplace. Trim of regionally harvested birch finishes
rooms and hallways in understated geometric designs, hung with Native
art. Because the hotel sits atop a high river bluff, views from common
rooms and many guest rooms take in a broad-canvas masterpiece of the
Alaska Range, with McKinley towering in the center. Rooms in the main
building are somewhat larger and have either one king- or two queen-size
beds, and the hallways connect to several sumptuous lobbies with read-
ing areas. As much as I like the hotel, however, the rates are high. (A

Campgrounds
The park has six campgrounds, four of which — Riley Creek, Savage
River, Teklanika, and Wonder Lake — have flush toilets and sites you can
reserve in advance. Of these four, you can drive to only two: Riley Creek
and Savage River. Teklanika and Wonder Lake are in the backcountry,
accessible along the park road by the shuttle-bus system. One excep-
tion: You can drive to Teklanika if you stay three days and don’t move
your vehicle during that time. Use the reservation system described in
the “Reserving shuttle seats and campsites in advance” section, earlier
in this chapter. Two campgrounds that don’t take reservations, Igloo and
Sanctuary River; both are tiny, primitive campgrounds intended prima-
rily for backpackers getting ready for a trek.
Campground fees are $16 to $20 per night for car or RV camping, $12 
for walk-in tent camping sites at Riley Creek Campground, and $9 at
Sanctuary and Igloo Campground. A reservation fee of $4 is charged for
the first night of stays in Teklanika or Wonder Lake campgrounds, and
you also need a camper bus ticket, for around $30, to get to those camp-
grounds.
Other than Riley Creek and Savage River, these campgrounds aren’t the
car camping you may be used to. You’ll be away from any services or
even easy communication, so you must bring everything that you need.
 Riley Creek: This large campground is near the park entrance, easy
access to a store, showers, laundry, and so on. 147 sites.
 Savage River: A beautiful campground with great tundra views and
hiking routes, Savage River is the only one you can readily drive to
that’s away from the entrance (13 miles, to be exact). 33 sites.
 Teklanika River: When you wake up here close to the heart of the
park, you cut the time you must spend on the bus on daily explo-
rations. As of this writing, tents are not allowed, only hard-sided
RVs, due to wolves prowling in the area. Once you park the RV for a
three-night minimum stay, however, you must get around by bus.
Teklanika River is 29 miles from the entrance. 53 sites.

Chapter 19: Denali National Park 317
 Wonder Lake: After six hours to cover 85 miles on the bus, you
reach this coveted campground by a placid lake near the foot of
Mount McKinley. The mosquitoes can be horrendous but the views
are incomparable. Only tents are permitted and no campfires are
allowed. 28 sites.
Where to Dine
I list a range of restaurants matching locations with your lodgings (in

STEAK/SEAFOOD/ITALIAN
A unique 9-hole golf course lies amid the mountains and rolling taiga north
of the park. The associated restaurant produces excellent meals from a
menu mostly influenced by Northern Italian cookery. For lunch, sandwich
choices include a pesto chicken hoagie for $7.50, and for dinner there is
halibut in parchment with fresh rosemary and garlic for $20. Although not
as perfect as at the best restaurants in Anchorage, the cuisine is memo-
rable and satisfying. The dining room is light and cheery, with pine furni-
ture and flowers on the table. Children will enjoy the mini–golf course and
wagon rides.

The name comes from the milepost, which puts the restaurant in a quiet
area about 8 miles south of the park entrance, where it occupies a beauti-

the restaurant — Laura is a professionally trained chef and veteran of
Alaska’s best dining rooms. Whenever possible, she uses organic ingredi-
ents and local produce. The menu changes daily and has included main-
course items such as tenderloin filet, lemon pasta with asparagus, venison
chops, and, of course, salmon. A sweet-potato soup with king crab meat is
fabulous. The appetizer list is long and interesting, including spring rolls
second to none. Breakfast is coffeehouse fare, such as quiche, granola, and
fruit. Locals keep the place busy even on winter weekends, but the restau-
rant closes at 1 p.m. on Sundays in the winter so everyone in the commu-

Southeast Alaska

In this part . . .
S
outheast Alaska is a world apart, a realm of water and
mountains where charming old towns are tucked in
wherever they ﬁt among the peaks, bears, and big rain-forest
trees. Traveling is made more complicated and yet more
interesting by the region’s lack of highways — getting from
town to town requires you to board a boat or plane. Juneau,
the state capital and Alaska’s third-largest city, is the hub for
this area’s transportation network. It’s also a delightful place
to visit, with excellent access to outdoor activities. Skagway,
north of Juneau, is a center of gold-rush history. Sitka is full of
charm and the history of Russian America and has a spectac-
ular outdoor setting.

Chapter 20
Juneau
In This Chapter
 Basing yourself in Juneau
 Getting to the only capital city you can’t reach by road
 Finding the best places to sleep and eat
 Enjoying Juneau’s activities — indoors and out
 Planning a Juneau itinerary
Juneau stands out as a terrific town to visit. You get an inkling of that
as your plane glides toward the airport on Gastineau Channel and
you spot tall mountains looming above, grassy wetlands and towering
conifers below, and a great big glacier nearby that comes right up to a
suburban neighborhood. The taxi ride downtown is a scenic treat, trav-
eling at the base of mountains and along a coastal refuge full of eagles.
Downtown you’ll find steep, narrow streets sheltered by awnings
attached to charmingly weathered little buildings. It looks like a thriving
old-time downtown straight out of a movie, but in Juneau’s case it’s real.
And at the end of the streets, within walking distance, hiking trails begin,
climbing among moss-hung trees.
Few other towns in Alaska can justify a weeklong visit all by themselves,
but in Juneau, a long stay makes sense, using the city as a hub for
exploring the Southeast region. You’ll see plenty in town and on the
short road network, and the variety of outdoor activities you can do
from here is unmatched anywhere in the state. Next you can explore the
fascinating and splendid options within a day of here: the gold-rush his-
torical sites of Skagway, the whales and glaciers of Glacier Bay National
Park or Tracy Arm, or the abundant brown bear of Admiralty Island. Or
go dog-mushing at the peak of summer on a glacier high above the city.
By the end of your week, Juneau may be one of your favorite places. It’s
certainly one of mine.
That’s my prediction, anyway, but Juneau has a way of confounding pre-
dictions. The climate that produces those lush forests also produces tor-
rential rains, rotten visibility, and canceled flights. When you’re unlucky
with the weather, a week in Juneau can make you feel like moss is grow-
ing between your toes. Even during the summer, it can rain for days,

staying as cool and damp as winter in other places. In the fall, the rains
here are biblical in proportion. Although rainy days do have a special
charm here, especially when the soft light glows on rain-streaked
facades and mist drifts among moss-shrouded branches, a little of that
goes a long way.
Getting There
Juneau is a transportation hub without any road connection. Air and
water are the only ways of getting there.
Arriving by air
Jet service is available only from Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522;
www.alaskaair.com), with several daily nonstop flights from Seattle
and Anchorage, and from the smaller Southeast Alaska towns. Many of
the region’s commuter and air-taxi operators also maintain desks at the
airport and have flights out of Juneau; these include Wings of Alaska
(% 907-789-0790; www.ichoosewings.com).
Arriving by ferry
All the mainline ferries of Southeast’s Alaska Marine Highway System
(% 800-642-0066; www.ferryalaska.com) stop at the terminal in Auke
Bay (% 907-789-7453 or 907-465-3940 recording), 14 miles from down-
town, and the fast ferry, Fairweather, is based here, too, cutting sailing
times in half. The passenger fare is $37 to Haines, $50 to Skagway. The
Kennicott connects Juneau to Whittier and points west on the far side of
the Gulf of Alaska.
Getting Downtown
The ride downtown from the airport is a long one, and from the ferry
dock even longer. At times, airport or ferry-dock shuttles operate, but
arrangements change from year to year. For the latest, ask at the visitor
information desk in the baggage-claim area or inquire from the purser on
the ferry. When selecting your lodgings, keep in mind that if your hotel
has a courtesy van, it can save you more than $50 round-trip; in any
event, when reserving your room, ask for the best way to get there from
the airport.
Navigating by taxi
A taxi is the handiest way for most people to get downtown from the air-
port or ferry terminal. Capital Cab (% 907-586-2772) is one company. A
cab ride in from the airport will cost you $22; from the ferry dock, $33.
Part V: Southeast Alaska 
324

Navigating by bus
An express Capital Transit city bus (% 907-789-6901) comes to the air-
port at 11 minutes past the hour on weekdays from 7:11 a.m. to 5:11 p.m.
and costs $1.50; however, your luggage must fit under your seat or at
your feet.
Navigating by rental car
I often do without a rental car in Juneau because the downtown area is
compact and parking can be a headache. Operators of most outdoor
activities pick you up at your hotel. On the other hand, you need wheels
to visit some attractions, and having a car opens up more choices for
dining and lodging and some beautiful drives. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Hertz,
and National are based at the airport; national reservation contacts are
listed in the appendix. When contemplating your costs, remember that
Chapter 20: Juneau 325
To overhead — meaning, you’re screwed
Juneau’s mist-shrouded airport, wedged between ocean and mountain, is a tough
place to land in bad weather. That means that sometimes when you think you’re flying
to Juneau, you end up somewhere else, maybe Anchorage or Seattle, or maybe even
some little town that you’ve never heard of. Landing somewhere other than Juneau is
such a common experience that the locals have a special verb for it: to overhead.
Here’s an example of how you may hear it used:
“Why did you miss the fishing trip?”
“I overheaded three times and ended up sleeping in Ketchikan.”
When your flight overheads, the airline puts you on the next plane back to Juneau.
Even so, you may overhead again. Although people sometimes bounce back and forth
like Ping-Pong balls, the airlines won’t pay for hotel rooms or give refunds. Your only
protection is a relaxed attitude, a loose itinerary that provides you with a chance for
making up for lost time, and trip-cancellation insurance (see Chapter 12).
The friendly tourism authorities in Juneau object to my writing about this because, as
they rightly point out, improved aviation technology makes it a less common problem,
mostly confined to the winter months. But it does still happen occasionally. Passengers
can’t get into Juneau, or they can’t get out because the planes can’t get in. If in doubt
about whether your plane will leave, you can call ahead, but the airline often says to
go to the airport just in case. That’s why Juneau residents have the Channel Channel.
It’s a cable TV channel that silently broadcasts a view of the Gastineau Channel near
the airport (hence the name). Locals can tell from that image whether going to the air-
port is worth the effort. An example of everyday usage:
“Did you see the Channel Channel? They’ll overhead. Let’s have another beer.”

you can save about $50 by not using taxis to reach the airport. The air-
port and ferry dock are relatively close together, so when you come by
ferry and want to rent a car, do it as soon as you arrive so that you save
the cab fare downtown and back.
Orienting Yourself in Juneau
Juneau has three main parts: downtown, the Mendenhall Valley, and
Douglas. (Check out the nearby “Greater Juneau” map.) Downtown
Juneau is a numbered grid of streets (see the “Downtown Juneau” map
in this chapter) overlying the uneven topography in the lap of the moun-
tains. As you look at the city from the water, Mount Juneau is on the left
and Mount Roberts on the right; Mount Roberts is a few hundred feet
taller, at 3,819 feet. When the city outgrew its original site downtown,
housing spread to the suburban Mendenhall Valley, about a dozen miles
north out the Egan Expressway or the parallel, two-lane Glacier Highway.
The glacial valley also contains the airport and Auke Bay area, where
the ferry terminal is located. The road traverses a total of 40 miles to a
place known as The End of the Road. Across a bridge over the Gastineau
Channel from downtown Juneau is Douglas Island. Turn left for the town
of Douglas, mostly a bedroom community for Juneau, and turn right for
the North Douglas Highway.
Juneau is truly a walking city, but if your feet get tired, taking a cab
around downtown is cheap. Try Capital Cab (% 907-586-2772). You can
also hire a cabby as a personal tour guide for $55 an hour. To go beyond
downtown, you need a car.
Getting around by car
Rent a car if you want to stay, dine, or pursue self-guided activities
beyond the downtown area. Don’t bother if you’re happy downtown (by
far the most interesting area) or if you want to take part in only guided
outings — the operators usually take care of transfers. Alamo, Avis,
Budget, Hertz, and National are based at the airport; national reserva-
tion contacts are listed in this book’s appendix.
If you rent a car, be sure to check with your lodgings about parking
arrangements. Finding a place to park in downtown Juneau can be hard
amid its narrow, crowded streets, many of which are very steep.
Getting around by bicycle
Strong riders can cover the town with a bike, but you must be able to
handle the hills. Separate paths parallel many of the main roads, and
downtown traffic is slow. The 24-mile round-trip from downtown to
Mendenhall Glacier keeps you on a bike path almost all the way. You can
rent bikes at the Driftwood Lodge, 435 Willoughby Ave. (% 800-544-
2239; www.driftwoodalaska.com), for $25 a day, $15 half-day.

Where to Stay in Juneau
Hotel rooms are tight in the summer, so don’t arrive without a room
booked. At the peak of the season, it’s a good idea to reserve a month
ahead, or longer if you want to be sure of getting into the best places.
Bed-and-breakfasts are a good way to go in Juneau. The Juneau

Alaska’s Capital Inn
$$$$–$$$$$
Downtown
This scrupulously restored 1906 mansion offers constant surprises in its
fascinating detail: the shining potbellied stove and 1879 pump organ in the
parlor, the Persian rugs, the original (electrified) gas lamps, period wall-
paper, and even those old-fashioned push-button light switches. It took
owners Linda Wendeborn and Mark Thorson three years to bring the
house back to this former glory. They poured effort and expense into
making details authentic that no one will ever notice. Fortunately, the
house was worth it, with many large rooms with high ceilings, good views,
fireplaces, claw-foot tubs, and real elegance. The best asset of all, however,
may be the warmth and fun of the inn. The common rooms are conducive
to socializing, and the hosts love to connect with guests and strive to
accommodate their needs. There are some smaller rooms, allowing those
on midrange budgets to enjoy the ambience, but the real showplaces carry
high luxury rates. An elaborate breakfast is served at 8 a.m. They don’t
take children 10 or under.

Baranof Hotel
$$$
Downtown
The Baranof is the only lodging in Alaska with the pedigree and style to pull
off the role of the old-fashioned grand hotel. Built of concrete in 1939, it
served for decades as an informal branch of the state capitol. In 2007–08,
the hotel’s history gained a chapter when a group of legislators, current
and former, were convicted of taking bribes from oil-industry executives in
Suite 604, which happened to be under FBI surveillance. The structure feels
historic, in part, because the concrete construction limits modernization —
bathrooms and many bedrooms will always be small. In places, past efforts
at renovation have made the most of the classic features, retaining glass
doorknobs and pressed-tin hallway ceilings, while most bathrooms were
remodeled with period tile and porcelain pedestal sinks and tubs. The

Downtown
This downtown motel, next door to the State Museum, is popular with fam-
ilies, and houses legislators and aides in the winter in its apartment-like
kitchenette suites. Although the building can’t hide its cinderblock con-
struction, old-fashioned motel exterior, small bathrooms, or lack of eleva-
tors, the rooms are comfortable and well kept. The management has held
prices low while making improvements, so for a rate that won’t get you in
the door at most Juneau hotels ($125), you can put four people in a two-
bedroom suite with a full kitchen. Don’t expect luxury, just a basic, clean
motel room for a good price. The round-the-clock courtesy van saves big
money to the airport or ferry and the rental bikes will cover your trans-
portation needs downtown. The motel has a laundry room, too.

The Historic Silverbow Inn
$$$–$$$
Downtown
There is an oddly pleasing style to this quirky little downtown hotel. The
1914 building, with wood floors, bare brick, and stained glass, is decorated
with a stylish, contemporary style that nonetheless captures the warmth
of a B&B. The cozy rooms come with extras such as lollipops and popcorn,
among other original and considerate touches that show up repeatedly —
for example, the shelf of supplies you may have forgotten, the answering
machines on the direct-line phones, and the sack breakfast if you have to
leave too early for the free full breakfast in the bakery. The proprietors and
staff have created a local scene with their popular Silverbow Bakery,
giving the whole place a hip, community-oriented feel.

Downtown
STEAK/SEAFOOD/PASTA
Situated in a converted airplane hangar on a wooden pier with large win-
dows, this bar and grill has great views and a fun atmosphere; even off-
season, it’s packed. It’s a fine place to drink beer (with 24 brews on tap),
listen to live music, or play at one of the three pool tables. What’s sur-
prising is that the food is good, too. The seared ahi sashimi appetizer, raw
inside, has a pleasant texture and taste, and the jambalaya, a huge portion
for $13, is spicy but balanced. Although the menu’s steaks and such range
up to $30, plenty of choices are under $15.

PIZZA/SALADS/SANDWICHES
Across the bridge from Juneau (too far to walk), this is where local people

salad, which consisted of rare, well seasoned slices of grilled steak on a
bed of lettuce with a load of blue cheese dressing and onion rings. The

Part V: Southeast Alaska

specialty is pizza with creative ingredients. The smell of smoke from the
wood-fire grill hangs in the air. The dining room, dating from the 1930s, is
historic by Alaskan standards and comes by its pub ambience honestly. It
looks out on the Gastineau Channel through picture windows; at times cus-
tomers watch killer whales from the bar. (They have the photos to prove
it.) The pub is easy to find. Drive across the bridge to Douglas, turn left,
and after entering the town, turn left on E Street.

SEAFOOD/PIZZA
Overlooking the water at the cruise-ship dock, in the same building as Taku
Smokeries, the dining room is magnificent, with high ceilings and an entire
wall of windows on the Gastineau Channel, a fireplace of beach rock, lots
of hardwood, and, to keep it from being too grand, cartoon-like fish hang-
ing down. The quality and range of the food brings locals to a tourist zone
they would otherwise avoid: items like salmon on a cedar plank or in
pastry, halibut or salmon tacos, and also little pizzas, burgers and terrific
desserts. The service is fast and attentive, but the dining room makes you
want to stay long after you’re done eating.

Sometimes you just want an inexpensive lunch, possibly in a box to take on an outing
or a light breakfast in a friendly coffee joint. The Rainbow Foods natural food grocery,
an organic hangout in a former church at the corner of Franklin and 4th streets 
(% 907-586-6476; www.rainbow-foods.org), is the best picnic-packing place
downtown, making sandwiches and salads at the deli and with a buffet and salad

Zyphyr Restaurant

Downtown
MEDITERRANEAN
The dining room, once an old-fashioned grocery store, was remodeled with
restraint and a magnificent sense of style, using its wooden floors, 
very high ceilings, and huge storefront windows to create the illusion of
elegance passed down for generations rather than only since late 2006.
Tables robed in linen of dark rust are set so far apart that diners feel
they’re alone; on the winter evening I first ate here, the darkness outside
contributed to the velvety intimacy. The food and the service — courteous
but world-weary — lived up to the setting. Dishes are from the traditional
fine-dining palette of colors: calamari, pasta puttanesca, or veal scallop-
ini, for example. I started with rich, spicy clams and enjoyed a perfectly
textured grilled lamb kabob with asparagus as a main course. Deserts are
excellent, too. Save this place for a romantic meal or a special treat at the
end of the day.

Exploring Juneau
Juneau is like a comfortable, well-loved living room: It’s a town where
you can settle in and get comfortable, walk around and make your own
discoveries, and quickly feel like you belong there. Set aside some time
for leisurely walks to enjoy the human-scale surroundings.
Avoiding cruise-ship crowds
Most visitors to Juneau and Skagway arrive onboard the cruise ships that tie up at
the docks every day from mid-May through September. As many as seven ships dock
at once, flooding downtown Juneau with enough people to make the old, narrow
streets claustrophobic. To escape the throngs in the tourist area, arrange for an activ-
ity before you land. The cruise lines sell land activities (for a large premium), or you can
make arrangements directly with operators before you leave home (more effort for
you). Guides and tour companies are eager for your business and will tailor an outing
to your schedule. Or, if you prefer to do something on your own, choose an attraction
that’s less likely to be overrun: In Juneau, visit one of the three downtown museums,
all walking distance from the dock, or do a forest walk you can reach on foot from the
dock; in Skagway, consider renting a bike to explore beyond the most crowded area.
Schedules of cruise landings are available online, and you can pick a day for your visit
when only two or three ships will be there; go to www.juneau.com to find a link.

Exploring the top attractions
Alaska State Museum
Downtown
The museum contains a large collection of art and historical artifacts, but
it doesn’t seem like a storehouse at all because the objects’ presentation
is based on their meaning, not their value. Come here to put the rest of
your visit in context. A clan house in the Alaska Native Gallery contains
authentic art in the functional places where it would have been used 
in a memorial potlatch. The Lincoln Totem Pole is here, carved by an 
artist who used a picture of the president as his model to represent his
clan’s first encounter with whites. Superb artifacts from Native cultures
from around the state are presented to illustrate the lifestyle of those who
made them. The ramp to the second floor wraps around the natural his-
tory display, with an eagle nesting tree, and at the top a state history
gallery uses significant pieces to tell Alaska’s story. The children’s area is
exceptionally fun, with a ship that the kids can play in. Allow at least two
hours for the museum; half a day would not be out of line. The shop off
the lobby is also well worth a look. Although small, it carries lots of qual-
ity Alaska Native art, books, and no junk at all. (There’s a branch at 124
Seward St.)
See map p 329. 395 Whittier St., Juneau. % 907-465-2901. www.museums.state.
ak.us. Open: Mid-May to mid-Sept daily 8:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., mid-Sept to mid-May
Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Admission: $5 adults ($3 off season), free for children 18 and
under.
Macaulay Salmon Hatchery
Glacier Highway
The hatchery, known by locals as DIPAC (Douglas Island Pink and Chum,
Inc.), was ingeniously designed to allow visitors to watch the whole
process of harvesting and fertilizing eggs from outdoor decks. From mid-
June to October, salmon swim up a 450-foot fish ladder, visible through a
window, into a sorting mechanism, where they’re “unzipped” by workers
who remove the eggs. Guides and exhibits explain what’s happening.
During that period, you can often see seals and other wildlife feeding 
on the returning salmon just offshore from the hatchery. Inside, large and
realistic saltwater aquariums show off the area’s marine life. The tour is
less impressive in May and June, before the fish are running. At that time,
visitors see the immature salmon before their release and sometimes get
to feed them. The tours don’t take long; allow 45 minutes for your entire
visit.

Chapter 20: Juneau 335
Mendenhall Glacier
Mendenhall Valley
At the head of Mendenhall Valley, the glacier glows bluish white, looming
above the suburbs like an Ice Age monster that missed the general extinc-
tion. Besides being a truly impressive sight, Mendenhall is the most easily
accessible glacier in Alaska and the state’s third most visited attraction.
The parking and an adjacent shelter have a great view across the lake to
the glacier’s face, and a wheelchair-accessible trail leads close to the
water’s edge. The land near the parking lot shows signs of the glacier’s
recent passage, with little topsoil, stunted vegetation, and, in many places,
bare rock with scratch marks from the glacier’s movement. It’s an outdoor
science lesson, and children will enjoy the ability to be themselves while
soaking up the fascinating evidence of living geology. Atop a bedrock hill,
reached by stairs, a ramp, or an elevator, the Forest Service visitor center
contains a glacier museum with excellent explanatory models, computer-
ized displays, spotting scopes, and ranger talks.
In late summer, the area has the added attraction of being Alaska’s most
accessible bear-viewing opportunity. Red and silver salmon spawn in
Steep Creek, just short of the visitor center on the road, an interesting
sight in themselves, but even more important as a source of easy bear
food. All that fresh salmon attracts many black bears, which visitors easily
watch from a trail and platform built for the purpose.

Mount Roberts Tramway
Downtown
The tram takes only six minutes to whisk passengers from tourist-clogged
Franklin Street to the clear air and overwhelming views at the tree line
(1,760 feet), a destination that used to require a day of huffing and puffing.
The tram itself can be crowded: it’s up on the mountain that the beauty hits
you. The Alaska Native owners have done a good job of building a network
of paths that take advantage of the views as you pass through a fascinating
alpine ecosystem. If you’re energetic, you can start a 6-mile round-trip to
Mount Roberts’s summit (3,819 ft.), or you can hike the 21⁄2 miles back down-
town. There’s an auditorium at the top tram station showing a film on the
Tlingit culture, a shop where Native artisans are often at work, and a bald
eagle enclosure. The bar and grill serves lunch and dinner. I would choose
something else to do on a day when fog or low overcast obscures the view,
especially considering the high price; however, I’m told it’s sometimes
sunny up top while rainy down on Franklin Street — it can’t hurt to ask.

Other cool things to see and do
These barely-missed-the-top attractions are well worth a visit when
you’re in Juneau for more than a day or two:
 Juneau-Douglas City Museum: Find out about Juneau at this fun
little museum with fascinating history and cultural exhibits and a
tiny shop stocked with handy information for your visit, such as
walking-tour maps and historic trail guides. The museum is at the
corner of 4th and Main streets (% 907-586-3572; www.juneau.
org/parksrec/museum). Admission is $4 adults (free in winter),
free for ages 18 and under. Summer hours are Monday through
Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
winter Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Last Chance Mining Museum and Historic Park: Juneau’s indus-
trial past survives at these old mining buildings on forested Gold
Creek. You can see immense, intact, original equipment before
hiking the nearby Perseverance Trail (see “Hiking,” later in this
chapter). From downtown, take Gold Street to its top, and then join
Basin Road, continuing 1 mile up the valley to the end of the road
(% 907-586-5338). Admission is $4, and the museum is open in
summer daily from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.
 Glacier Gardens: For people with mobility problems, this is a
chance to see the rain forest as hikers do. A visit starts with a horti-
cultural exhibit in greenhouses and formal gardens, and then visi-
tors board a vehicle similar to a golf cart to ride up a steep trail
through woods landscaped with pools and plantings to an over-
look. The gardens are about 1 mile from the airport; take Glacier
Highway to near the Fred Meyer store (% 907-790-3377; www.
glaciergardens.com). Admission is $22 adults, $16 ages 6 to 12.
It’s open in summer daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Taking a scenic drive “Out the Road”: The 40-mile Glacier Highway
doesn’t go much of anywhere beyond the Mendenhall Valley, but it
does go through some lovely country with views of islands floating
on sun-dappled water. Stop at the moving Shrine of St. Therese
(% 907-780-6112; www.shrineofsainttherese.org), 9 miles
beyond the ferry dock, a simple chapel of rounded beach stones 
on a tiny island reached by a foot-trail causeway. It’s also a great
place for examining tide pools, and sometimes you can see whales
from shore.
Shopping
The most popular shopping district is on the streets surrounding the
cruise-ship dock and on South Franklin Street. Many shops that you see
here are entirely seasonal, while a few have a local clientele as well. Some
worthy of your attention include The Raven’s Journey, 435 S. Franklin
St. (% 907-463-4686; www.ravensjourneygallery.com), which shows

Chapter 20: Juneau 337
Alaska Native fine art; Taku Store, 550 S. Franklin St. (% 800-582-5122;
www.takustore.com), a place to buy expensive seafood delicacies and
see them made behind glass; and Decker Gallery, 233 S. Franklin St. 
(% 907-463-5536), showing Rie Muñoz’s charming prints and tapestries
on local themes.
Walking up the hill a bit, you reach more of the year-round businesses.
Check out Juneau Artists Gallery, in the Senate Building at 175 S.
Franklin St. (% 907-586-9891; www.juneauartistsgallery.com),
which is an artists’ co-op; the shop operated by Bill Spear, 174 S.
Franklin St. (% 907-586-2209; www.wmspear.com), who makes colored
enamel pins; and The Observatory, 299 N. Franklin St. (% 907-586-9676;
www.observatorybooks.com), which specializes in rare maps and
books about Alaska. Annie Kaill’s fine arts and crafts gallery is half a
block off Franklin at 244 Front St. (% 907-586-2880).
Nightlife
For a family night out, consider the Gold Creek Salmon Bake. It’s a 30-
year tradition of a picnic with marshmallow roasting, music, and other
entertainment. The cost is $35 for adults, $23 for children. Call % 907-
789-0052 to reserve.
I mention The Hangar under “Where to Dine in Juneau.” Other popular
drinking establishments include The Red Dog Saloon, 278 S. Franklin St.
(% 907-463-3658), with a sawdust-strewn floor, frontier atmosphere, and
nightly live music. Or join the locals across the street at The Alaskan
Bar, 167 S. Franklin St. (% 907-586-1000), which occupies an authentic
gold-rush hotel with a two-story Victorian barroom. Boisterous parties
and music go on here all year.
Getting Outdoors in Juneau
Juneau has more outdoor activities than anywhere else I can think of.
And thanks to the town’s role as a top visitor destination, you can do
most of it with a guide instead of on your own.
You’ll find support for self-guided outings, too. Alaska Boat & Kayak
Center, at the Auke Bay Harbor (% 907-789-6886; www.juneaukayak.
com), rents sea kayaks and camping gear and offers guidance in planning
where and how to go.
Bear-viewing
Bears are quite common around Juneau; in fact, they become pests for
residents who live near the woods. In late summer, the hot spot to see
black bears is the path and platform to Steep Creek at Mendenhall
Glacier (see “Exploring the top attractions,” earlier in this chapter). But

Part V: Southeast Alaska 
338
to see large numbers of huge brown bears close up in their natural habi-
tat, the best place to go is Admiralty Island and its Kootznoowoo
Wilderness (Kootznoowoo means “fortress of bears” in Tlingit). The
island’s Pack Creek Bear-Viewing Area allows a limited number of visi-
tors to watch bears up close as they feed on salmon spawning in July and
August; peak viewing is in the middle of that period. Only 25 miles from
Juneau, Pack Creek is so popular that the Forest Service uses a permit
system to keep it from being overrun during the day (9 p.m.–9 a.m. no
people are allowed). The easiest way to go is with a tour operator who
has permits; here are a couple of good choices:
 Alaska Fly ’N’ Fish Charters, 9604 Kelly Court (% 907-790-2120;
www.alaskabyair.com), offers naturalist-guided five-and-a-half-
hour fly-in visits, which cost $600 per person, and include every-
thing you need.
 Alaska Discovery, 5310 Glacier Hwy. (% 800-586-1911; www.
akdiscovery.com), offers two-night sea-kayak expeditions camp-
ing near the creeks, with ample time to see the bears and other
scenery. It costs $1,195 per person.
Fishing and whale-watching
The closest I ever came to a humpback whale — I almost touched it —
was on the way back from king salmon fishing out of Juneau on a friend’s
boat. More than two dozen companies offer charters from Juneau and
Auke Bay; you can go to watch whales or fish, or both. Juneau is well
protected behind layers of islands, so the water generally is calm. A lot
of companies offer trips. The Juneau Convention & Visitors Bureau main-
tains a list of businesses, and its Web site has links to each. Juneau
Sportfishing & Sightseeing, 2 Marine Way, Suite 230 (% 907-586-1887;
www.juneausportfishing.com), is one of the largest operators, charg-
ing $279 per person for a full day of salmon fishing, $425 for halibut and
salmon, or $179 for four hours of salmon fishing. They charge $115 for a
two-and-a-half-hour whale-watching trip.
Flightseeing and dog-mushing
More than 36 major glaciers around Juneau flow from a single ocean of
ice behind the mountains, the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Ice Field. You
can land on it in a helicopter just to touch the ice, or for a nature hike or
dog-sled ride. On the flight, you survey the bizarre scenery of long, sinu-
ous strands of flowing glacier ice. Then, when you land, you find yourself
transported into winter during the middle of summer, surrounded by
blindingly white, crusty snow. Era Helicopters (% 800-843-1947;
www.flightseeingtours.com) is among Alaska’s oldest and most
respected operators. Its one-hour flight over four glaciers with a 15-
minute landing on Norris Glacier costs $265 per person. It also offers a
program of dog-sled rides on the ice, a chance to try a winter sport in
the summer. That excursion includes the same overflight and adds
about an hour at a sled-dog camp on a glacier with a ride behind the
dogs. It costs $445 per person.

Chapter 20: Juneau 339
One caveat: Poor or even overcast weather makes seeing the ice diffi-
cult, but if you wait for a sunny morning, all seats will likely be booked.
Era has a 48-hour cancellation policy, so you must gamble to some
extent on good viewing conditions.
Hiking
Juneau’s superb trail network offers choices ranging from easy strolls to
leg-burners up those omnipresent mountains. Here are some highlights,
in order of increasing difficulty:
 The Treadwell Mine Historic Trail: This is a fascinating hour’s
stroll through the ruins of a massive hard-rock mine complex 
that once employed and housed 2,000 men but was abandoned 
in 1922. Numbered posts match a historic guide available from 
the Juneau-Douglas City Museum (see “Other cool things to see 
and do,” earlier in this chapter). To find the trailhead, take 3rd
Street in Douglas, bearing left onto Savikko Street, which leads to
Savikko Park (also known as Sandy Beach Park). The trail starts at
the far end.
 Outer Point Trail: This lovely but sometimes crowded trail leads
11⁄3 miles on a forest boardwalk to a beach with good tide pools,
plenty of eagles, and occasional whale sightings. To get there, drive
over the bridge to Douglas, and then go right on North Douglas
Highway 12 miles to the trailhead.
 Perseverance Trail: A fairly level 3-mile trail leads from behind
downtown up to the Perseverance Mine at the Silverbow Basin, 
a mining community from 1885 to 1921. The trailhead is about 
11⁄2 miles from downtown on Basin Road; check out the Last Chance
Mining Museum there (see “Other cool things to see and do,” ear-
lier in this chapter).
 Mount Roberts: The trailhead is downtown — just follow the stair-
way from the top of 6th Street. The summit is 41⁄2 miles and 3,819
vertical feet away, but you’ll see great views much sooner. At the
1,760-foot level, you reach the top of the Mount Roberts Tramway,
which is mentioned earlier in this chapter. (Of course, taking the
tram up and hiking down is easier.)
Sea-kayaking
The protected waters around Juneau call out for sea-kayaking, and the
city is a popular hub for trips farther out on the water. Besides the sub-
lime scenery, you’ll almost certainly see eagles, seabirds, and seals, and
possibly humpback whales. Alaska Travel Adventures (% 800-323-
5757; www.bestofalaskatravel.com), offers three-and-a-half-hour
kayak trips from an unspoiled spot on the north end of Douglas Island
for $89 adults, $59 children 6 to 12. The tour includes orientation for
beginners, transportation from downtown, and a snack.

Spending One, Two, or Three Days in Juneau
You must go outdoors in Juneau, even if you’re only in a car or helicop-
ter. So these aren’t just seeing itineraries, they’re doing itineraries, too.
Each element of the following itinerary is reviewed in more detail else-
where in this chapter.
Day 1 in Juneau
Start the morning by boarding a helicopter bound for the Juneau Ice
Field to see vast glaciers and the icy plateau they spring from; if you can
afford it, add a dog-sled ride on the ice. For a lower-budget alternative,
Choosing glaciers: Glacier Bay 
or Tracy Arm
Glacier Bay National Park is awesome — huge glaciers, sheer rock mountains, and
whales leaping out of the water — but I don’t recommend a visit for land-based visi-
tors with limited time or money. You can see the same kind of sights for less money on
a day trip from Juneau to Tracy Arm in the Tongass National Forest. (Note that this
advice doesn’t apply to cruise-ship passengers: Your ship’s itinerary will determine if
you visit Glacier Bay. If you do, a ranger will come onboard to provide commentary
while the ship traverses the bay.)
Glacier Bay is a marine park. To get to the glaciers from the park headquarters, you
have to take a boat ride that lasts eight hours and costs $182. And to get to the park
headquarters, where the boat ride starts, requires a round-trip flight that costs roughly
$200 more. It seems ridiculous to do all that as a marathon day trip, but spending the
night at Glacier Bay costs more again. (A double room at the Glacier Bay Lodge is
around $200, not including meals and transfers.) On the other hand, an all-day boat
trip to Tracy Arm, which includes mile-high mountains that come right out of the sea,
calving glaciers, and often whale sightings, costs about $140 and takes eight hours in
total, right from the dock in Juneau. One tour is with Adventure Bound Alaska, 76 Egan

take the Mount Roberts Tramway for mountain views and a walk.
Returning to Juneau, stroll downtown for shopping on Franklin Street
or to simply explore the town and see the modest public buildings of 
the state capital. Have lunch at The Hanger before going to the Alaska
State Museum for an orientation to Alaska’s history and culture. If the
weather’s nice, finish the day by eating outdoors while listening to music
at the Gold Creek Salmon Bake.
Day 2 in Juneau
Rent a car today and pack a picnic at Rainbow Foods. Your first stop is
the Mendenhall Glacier, where you definitely should check out the visi-
tor center, take a hike, and, in season, watch the black bears on Steep
Creek. Next, explore the Glacier Highway (or go “Out the Road,” in 
the local parlance) to see the views and visit the lovely Shrine of St.
Therese. After your picnic, stop on the way back into town at the
Macaulay Salmon Hatchery for the tour. Cross the bridge to Douglas for
a hike. You may have time for the historic Treadwell Mine Trail and the
natural Outer Beach Trail. Dine at the Island Pub.
Day 3 in Juneau
Spend one day on an all-day outdoor expedition: taking the boat to
Tracy Arm, sea-kayaking in Juneau, or bear-watching on Admiralty
Island. Dine at the Twisted Fish.

T
he 1898 Klondike gold rush was the last gasp of the Wild West and
the first breath of Alaska’s modern history. Skagway was where it hit
its wildest. Miners found the gold near Dawson City, Yukon Territory,
where Canada’s Mounties kept the stampede in relatively good order.
But in Skagway, men crazed with greed knew no law at all. They disem-
barked their boats on Skagway’s dock for the tough cross-country trek
to Dawson City. One day the area was wilderness; the next, a city of
saloons and brothels. After the men came ashore, they played cards,
lifted drinks, spent time (and money) with some very busy women, and
got fleeced by the thousands. They settled arguments with guns, and the
absence of sanitation caused epidemics, so the cemetery grew fast.
No wonder the governor came to town and asked one of the most popu-
lar local citizens to be the territorial marshal, marching with him in the
Fourth of July parade. The plan might have worked, too, except that the
man he chose, Soapy Smith, was the most dangerous con man and gang
leader in town. Four days after the parade, in Skagway’s greatest tale,
vigilante Frank Reid killed Soapy Smith in a fair fight, standing face-to-
face on the docks. Reid later died himself of the wounds he sustained,
but not before breaking the grip that Soapy’s men had on the town. And
then the curtain closed. The rush lasted less than two years, and soon
Skagway was an ordinary town, but one with a brief and notorious past.
If that history interests you, Skagway presents it well in the Klondike
Gold Rush National Historical Park, a collection of buildings and muse-
ums. You can spend a good day there. If you’re not interested in the gold
rush and Wild West, however, you can skip Skagway.

Skagway is Alaska’s most touristy community, with as many as seven
cruise ships pulling into town at a time — that’s in a town with fewer
than 900 residents. All the cruise-ship passengers make for an awful
mob, and they’re tough to avoid. Planning sightseeing early and late in
the day may help, and weekends appear to be quieter than weekdays. If
you arrive with thick crowds (perhaps on a ship yourself), you can avoid
some of the crush by renting a bike (see “Orienting Yourself in Skagway,”
later in this chapter) and riding beyond the central walking area. (For
more tips on cruise-ship crowds, see Chapter 20.) And, of course, the
city is quieter during the cruising off season (Oct–Apr).

Gold-rush primer
At a big wedding that I attended in Anchorage, most of the wedding party came to
Alaska and toured the state together before the festivities. They spent many hours in
gold-rush towns, visiting museums and sites devoted to the gold rush. I asked one of
the young men what he thought of it. He said he’d enjoyed Alaska and thought all the
historic sites were interesting enough. However, he was left with one nagging ques-
tion: “What’s the gold rush?”
Because the gold rush is just about the only big thing that’s ever happened in Alaska,
we tend to forget that it’s not on everyone’s mind.
The rush started in 1897 when a group of regular guys got off a boat in Seattle with a
ton of gold stuffed in steamer trunks and gunnysacks. A sourdough prospector, George
Carmack, and his Native partners, Tagish Charlie and Skookum Jim, had found gold in
the Klondike River in Canada’s Yukon Territory the year before — gold so plentiful it
looked like slabs of cheese in a sandwich. At the time, the nation was in the fourth year
of a financial collapse. People were poor, and when the newspapers wrote about a
river up north with gold by the ton, they didn’t have to be told twice. Some 100,000 —
including the mayor of Seattle — quit whatever they were doing and headed north.
This rush happened at a time when the total non-Native population of Alaska was
counted at 4,000.
The cheapest and most popular route was by boat to Skagway, on foot over the tor-
tuous Chilkoot Pass or White Pass, and then by handmade boat across Lake Bennett
and down the ferocious upper Yukon River to the new town of Dawson City. Just to
make it alive was impressive. But few who did found any gold — the mining claims
had been staked and big companies were soon doing the mining. Some gave up, but
others had too much pride or too much greed to go home, or they just liked it here.
They populated Alaska, rushing from one gold find to another in a series of gold strikes.
That’s how many of Alaska’s cities, including Fairbanks and Nome, were founded.
Gold fever didn’t give out until World War I, and it has never died completely. Big-time
companies still mine around Dawson City and Fairbanks. And small-time prospectors
still scratch the hills across the state in hopes of a strike as big as the one George
Carmack, Tagish Charlie, and Skookum Joe made more than 100 years ago.

Getting There
You can drive, fly, or take a boat to Skagway, but for most visitors, the
water is the most practical way.
By boat
Most visitors get to Skagway on a cruise ship (see Chapter 8). The
Alaska Marine Highway System (% 800-642-0066 or 907-983-2941;
www.ferryalaska.com) connects Skagway daily with Juneau and less
frequently with Haines. The passenger fare from Juneau is $50; from
Haines, $31. Choose the fast ferry Fairweather for the same price to save
a couple hours.
By road
Klondike Highway 2 connects Skagway with Whitehorse, Yukon
Territory, 99 miles away over the White Pass. It’s a high, rocky gold-rush
route, with views as good as those on the excursion train operating over
the pass. The international border is at the top of the pass; a few facts
about clearing Customs are in Chapter 6. The highway meets the Alaska
Highway and Klondike Highway in Whitehorse for drives to the rest of
the state or northward to Dawson City.
By air
Several air-taxi operators serve Skagway. A round-trip from Juneau costs
$228 on Wings of Alaska (% 907-789-0790 reservations, or
907-983-2442; www.ichoosewings.com).
Orienting Yourself in Skagway
Broadway is the main historic street. A simple grid spans a few blocks
on either side. The Klondike Highway leads north out of town at the end
of the grid. The gold-rush cemetery is just past town on the right.
Walking is the best way to explore. To get to sites on the outskirts, try
the Dyea Dave Shuttle (% 907-209-5031), which operates like a taxi.
Skagway also has a bus, called SMART (% 907-983-2743), which runs a
circuit around town for $1.50 a ride, or to sights on the fringes for $5,
leaving on the hour from City Hall and 7th Avenue and Spring Street. A
bike is fun and practical transportation in Skagway. Sockeye Cycle, 381
5th Ave., off Broadway (% 907-983-2851; www.cyclealaska.com), rents
good mountain bikes for $14 for two hours and leads guided day trips.
To go beyond the town or to venture down the highway to the rest of
Alaska, rent a car from Avis, at 3rd Avenue and Spring Street (% 800-
230-4898 or 907-983-2247; www.avis.com).

Where to Stay
Skagway has several charming and comfortable places to stay.
Accommodations generally have courtesy vans available, but check 
for exact arrangements when you reserve your room.
At the White House
$$
Skagway
The Tronrud family essentially rebuilt a burned 1902 gable-roofed inn,
which has dormer and bow windows and two porticos with small Doric
columns. They made the rooms comfortable and modern while retaining
the style of the original owner, Lee Guthrie, a successful gambler and
saloon owner of the gold-rush years. The inn has hardwood floors and fine
woodwork. Bedrooms vary in size; all have quilts and other nice touches
and are equipped with TVs, refrigerators, and Wi-Fi.

Chilkoot Trail Outpost
$$$–$$$$
Dyea
These beautifully crafted log cabins contain comfortable, modern lodgings
with carpeted floors and log interior walls, some in the form of two-room
suites, with many amenities. The hiker’s suite consists of two rooms in a
duplex with bunk beds that rent for $145 double, including breakfast. The
location, in Dyea near the Chilkoot Trail and Taiya River, puts you in quiet,
natural surroundings away from the carnival atmosphere created by the
crush of tourists in Skagway proper. In good weather, the hosts have a
nightly campfire and provide supplies for s’mores. You can also cook your
own food at a barbecue and sink in a screened gazebo. Breakfast, served
in a remarkable log building with a vaulted ceiling, consists of a buffet with
various choices, including one hot selection. The lodge loans bikes to
guests; rooms have Wi-Fi but no phones.
Mile 8.5, Dyea Rd., Skagway. % 907-983-3799. Fax: 907-983-3599. www.chilkoot

Canadian Mounted Police. Once inside, however, you’ll find typical modern
motel rooms, familiar accommodations for those who simply want a com-
fortable place to sleep. Ten rooms have only shower stalls — no tubs. The
rooms are clean, but the lobby remains unkempt year after year.

Where to Dine
Covering the restaurants in this seasonal community is difficult because
they change quickly. Ask around for what’s new, as something like one-
third of the eateries are different each year. The two that follow have
been consistent for years.

Skagway
THAI
Other menu selections are available, but the specialty here is spicy Thai
cuisine — stir fries, curries, soups, and salads. The Pad Thai comes in a
large portion with a cabbage salad and is cooked and seasoned just right.
But the small, ten-table dining room is the restaurant’s most memorable
aspect, with dark hues and art that create an intimate and relatively
upscale experience, despite the paper napkins and tight quarters. Service
is helpful and speedy, and the menu is clearly presented to help those not
used to the food to order intelligently.
See map p. 346. 4th Avenue between Spring Street and Broadway, Skagway. % 907-
983-3663. Main courses: $14–$19. MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 11 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat–Sun
4–10 p.m. Closed off season.
The Stowaway Café
$$–$$$$
Skagway
SEAFOOD
Housed in a bright blue building overlooking the boat harbor, a five-minute
walk from the historic sites, this little restaurant has, for several years,
turned out many of Skagway’s best meals. Grilled and blackened salmon
and halibut anchor the menu, but you can also get either fish with various
creative preparations — salmon with a wasabi panko crust or with a green-
apple chipotle sauce, or even grilled halibut with Jamaican jerk spice and
a cranberry chutney garnish. Another part of the attraction is the restau-
rant’s handmade charm, with a tiny dining room decorated on a mermaid
theme that will keep your attention almost as well as the harbor view. The
restaurant has a beer and wine license.
See map p. 346. 205 Congress Way, near the small-boat harbor, Skagway. % 907-
983-3463. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $16–$29. V. Open: Daily 
4–10 p.m. Closed winter.

Exploring Skagway
Skagway Street Car Company, 270 2nd Ave. (% 907-983-2908; www.
skagwaystreetcar.com), offers two-hour town tours using antique
touring vehicles and costumed guides. The price is $42 for adults, $21
for children 12 and under; advance reservations are needed.
The top attractions
Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park
The park encompasses a collection of about 15 restored gold-rush build-
ings. Start at the museum at the park’s visitor center, where you can catch
one of the frequent ranger-guided walking tours. If you prefer to go alone,
a handy brochure is available. Among the highlights are the Mascot
Saloon, at Broadway and 3rd Avenue, where statues belly up to the bar;
the saloon is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and admission is free. Don’t
miss the 1897 Moore House, near 5th Avenue and Spring Street; it’s open
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the summer, and admission is free. In a brilliant pre-
diction ten years before the gold rush, Captain William Moore home-
steaded the land that would become Skagway. But when the rush hit, the
stampeders simply ignored his property claims.
See map p. 346. 2nd Avenue and Broadway, Skagway. % 907-983-9223. www.nps.
gov/klgo. Open: May–Sept daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m., Oct–Apr Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
White Pass & Yukon Route
In 1900, after only two years of construction, workers completed this
narrow-gauge railroad — an engineering marvel and a fun way to see spec-
tacular, historic scenery. The summer-only excursion uses some cars more
than 100 years old, climbing steep tracks chipped out of the mountains’
sides. The 40-mile round-trip summit excursion lasts a bit over three hours
and costs $103 for adults. Other, longer trips are available, too; check the
Web site. Go on a nice day — when the pass is socked in by weather, all
you see are clouds. Tickets are expensive, and you have to reserve ahead.
Take the gamble: Cancellation carries only a 10 percent penalty, and you
can change dates for no charge. Try to go on a weekend, when fewer
cruise-ship passengers are in town taking up the seats. You can book week-
end trains as little as a week ahead, while midweek reservations can sell
out months in advance.
See map p. 346. 231 2nd Ave., at Spring Street, Skagway. % 800-343-7373. www.
wpyr.com. Admission: $103–$229 adults, half-price for children 3–12.
Getting outdoors in Skagway
When you tire of history, there are several ways to get outdoors nearby.

Part V: Southeast Alaska 
350
Biking
Sockeye Cycle, 381 5th Ave., off Broadway (% 907-983-2851; www.
cyclealaska.com), leads bike tours, including one that takes clients to
the top of the White Pass in a van and coasts down on bikes; the two-
and-a-half-hour trip is $75. Sockeye Cycle also takes riders to Dyea in a
van and then leads a bike tour of the quiet ghost-town site for the same
price. Or ride to Dyea on your own over a scenic, hilly, 10-mile coastal
road, with a rented bike.
Flightseeing
Skagway is a good starting point for flights over Glacier Bay National
Park, just to the west. Operators include Haines-based Alaska Mountain
Flying and Travel (% 800-954-8747; www.flyglacierbay.com), known
for glacier and beach landings. Prices range from $149 to $499 per person,
and reservations are recommended. Temsco Helicopters (% 866-683-
2900; www.temscoair.com) takes 80-minute tours over the Chilkoot
Trail, including a 25-minute landing on a glacier (not in Glacier Bay);
those flights cost $269. A helicopter and dog-sled tour on Denver Glacier
is $449.
Hiking
An easy evening walk starts at the footbridge at the west end of the air-
port parking lot, crossing the Skagway River to Yakutania Point Park,
where pine trees grow from cracks in the rounded granite of the shore-
line. Across the park is a shortcut taking a couple miles off the trip to
Dyea and to the Skyline Trail and A. B. Mountain, a strenuous climb to
a 5,000-foot summit with great views. On the southeast side of town,
across the railroad tracks, a network of trails heads up from Spring
Street between 3rd and 4th avenues to a series of mountain lakes, the
closest of which is Lower Dewey Lake, less than a mile up the trail. A
Skagway Trail Map is available from the visitor center (see “Fast Facts:
Skagway” at the end of this chapter).
To hike the historic Chilkoot Trail, allow several days and make arrange-
ments for a special permit, gear, and transportation at the other end. For
permit details, contact Parks Canada (% 800-661-0486 or 867-667-3910;
Fax: 867-393-6701; www.pc.gc.ca/chilkoot). You can rent equipment,
get advice, or even arrange a guided hike with the Mountain Shop, 355
4th Ave. (% 907-983-2544; www.packerexpeditions.com).
Other cool things to see and do
The Skagway Museum and Archives, at 7th Avenue and Spring Street
(% 907-983-2420), rewards an hour of study in a dignified granite build-
ing. Admission is $2 adults, $1 students, free for children 12 and under.
The museum is open in the summer Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; winter
hours vary, so call ahead.

Chapter 21: Skagway 351
The graves of Soapy Smith and Frank Reid are the big attractions at the
Gold Rush Cemetery, but don’t miss the short walk up to crashing Reid
Falls. The closely spaced dates on many of the cemetery’s markers
attest to the epidemics that devastated stampeders living in squalid con-
ditions. The cemetery is 11⁄2 miles from town, up State Street.
Nightlife
The Days of ’98 Show has been staged every year since 1927 in the
Fraternal Order of Eagles Hall No. 25, at 6th Avenue and Broadway 
(% 907-983-2545). Actors from all over the United States perform four
shows a day (10:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m., and 8 p.m.) that include
singing, cancan dancing, the story of the shooting of Soapy Smith, and a
Robert Service reading. (Service recorded the gold-rush era in his amus-
ing poetry, which he traded for drinks in the saloons.) The evening
shows are best, beginning with an hour of mock gambling at a casino run
by the actors. All shows are $16 for adults, half-price for children 15 and
under.
The Red Onion Saloon, at 2nd Avenue and Broadway, celebrates its his-
tory as a brothel with waitresses in corsets and a mock madam who
offers $5 tours of the rooms upstairs. It’s closed in winter.

S
itka has a combination of qualities you can’t find anywhere else. It’s
the center of Russian-American history, with more to investigate
from that time than any other town. It’s also the site of two great Alaska
Native struggles: two centuries ago, a battle against the Russians, and,
more recently, a successful fight to keep Tlingit culture alive and accessi-
ble. Besides, the town’s charm is irresistible and its natural setting spec-
tacular — an island surrounded by islands on waters rich with life.
Altogether, Sitka is the best of Alaska. Taking the extra trouble to get
there is really worth your while.
Besides the fascinating historic and cultural places to visit, which can
easily fill a day or two, make a point of getting outdoors in Sitka. The
waters here are full of otters, whales, seabirds, and fish, and the town
has some fine hiking trails.
Understanding Sitka’s place in history
Two crucial historical events took place in Sitka: The Russians took over Southeast
Alaska from the Native Tlingit population, and the Americans took over all of Alaska
from the Russians. In 1799, the Russians had already conquered the coastal people
west of here and were moving eastward in search of new sea-otter hunting grounds
(they sold the pelts in China for fabulous sums) when they set up a settlement near
present-day Sitka. The Tlingit were a fierce and powerful people, and they didn’t
accept the invasion: They massacred the occupants of the Russian fort in 1802. In
1804, the Russians counterattacked. The battle lasted six days, but finally the Tlingit
withdrew. That battlefield remains the heart of the Sitka National Historical Park, a
peaceful and moving place under huge trees and totem poles.

Getting There
Sitka is on the west side of Baranof Island, accessible only by air or
water. To get downtown from the airport or ferry dock, Sitka Tours
charges $8 one-way, $10 round-trip on a bus; reservations are not
needed. A ride downtown from the ferry dock with Sitka Cab (% 907-
747-5001) is about $18.
By ferry
The ferries of the Alaska Marine Highway System (% 800-642-0066;
www.ferryalaska.com) serve Sitka with large ships that cover the
whole coast and a fast ferry that also connects Sitka to Juneau. Vessels
pass through the narrow and scenic Peril Straits to get to Sitka. The fare
from Juneau, nine hours by conventional ferry, less than five by fast
ferry, is $45. The ferry dock (% 907-747-3300) is 7 miles out of town.
By air
Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com) links Sitka
daily to Juneau and Ketchikan with flights that then continue nonstop to
Seattle and Anchorage.
Getting Around Sitka
Sitka is on an island, so you can’t drive far (see the nearby “Sitka” map).
The ferry terminal is 7 miles out, near the end of Halibut Point Road.
The town faces Sitka Sound. Across Sitka Channel are Japonski Island
and the airport.
You can easily manage Sitka on foot and with a visitor shuttle or taxi,
unless you choose lodgings or take hikes out on Halibut Point Road.
Chapter 22: Sitka 353
After the battle, Sitka became the capital of Russian America, which at one time
stretched all the way to California, and the best remaining buildings from that era are
here. But with the near extinction of otters, the colony became a money loser, and in
1867, the Russian czar sold his claim to Alaska to the United States for $7 million, or 2¢
an acre. Even at that price, most Americans thought they’d been taken. When the
Russian flag came down over Sitka’s Castle Hill and the American flag went up, the
United States didn’t even bother to give the new territory a government. Only decades
later, with gold discoveries that provided Alaska with a white population, did the cap-
ital move to Juneau and the modern era begin.

The Visitor Transit Bus, operated by the Sitka Tribe, 200 Katlian St. 
(% 888-270-8687 or 907-747-7290; www.sitkatours.com), makes a con-
tinuous circuit of the sights May through September when large cruise
ships are in town. The fare is $10 all day. Guided town tours of various
lengths are offered as well.
By car
If you decide to rent a car for better access to trails or lodgings on
Halibut Point Road, you can pick one up at the airport from Avis
(% 800-230-4898 or 907-966-2404; www.avis.com).

Alaska Ocean View Bed and Breakfast
$$$–$$$$$
Near downtown
Ebullient Carole Denkinger and her husband, Bill, have a passion for
making their bed-and-breakfast one you’ll remember. They’ve thought of
everything — the covered outdoor Jacuzzi where you can watch the
eagles, toys and games for the kids, a laptop to borrow, an open snack
counter, and HEPA air filters in each room for people with allergies, just to
name a few items. Rooms are soft and plush and guests are pampered.
Shared amenities include an outdoor hot tub and a business center. The
exceptional hospitality extends to Carole’s big, organic breakfasts, which
she cooks to suit guests’ dietary preferences — for vegans, dieters, those
with special sensitivities, and so on. The couple also strives to reduce the
B&B’s environmental footprint, which has been certified “green.” The
house is on a residential street with a view of the water about a mile from
the historic district.

Sitka Hotel
$–$$
Downtown
After a major fire hit this family-owned budget hotel early in 2006, it blos-
somed from the ashes (thanks to an insurance settlement) with 15 brand-
new rooms and complete redecorating, upgrading what had always been
a good deal in a fairly rickety wooden building into a very good deal in a
relatively modern building. The smaller rooms will never be luxurious, but
the owners always keep them clean and comfortable. The location is
prime, right across from the Russian parade grounds. The new rooms, in
the back of the building, have private bathrooms and added amenities,
such as coffeemakers, and all rooms have Wi-Fi. Victoria’s Restaurant,
with about a dozen tables in the storefront downstairs, tries for a high
Victorian feel, but it’s more like a friendly small-town diner, with hearty
breakfasts and lunches in winter and an inexpensive fine-dining dinner
menu added in summer.

Westmark Shee Atika
$$$
Downtown
This upscale hotel, above Crescent Harbor in the heart of the historic 
district, contains many comfortable rooms with sweeping views of Sitka
Sound. The lobby suggests the building style of Northwest Native Ameri-
cans, but the more anonymous rooms will be familiar to any business trav-
eler, with furniture of warm wood and all the expected amenities. There’s
nowhere to stay that is more convenient to the sites or more comfortable
for a broad range of travelers. The Raven Dining Room restaurant shares
the hotel’s view and is one of the best spots in Sitka for an evening meal.
It’s quiet and the service is good. You’ll find a long menu of seafood and
beef in the evening, and even the more challenging entrees are expertly
prepared.

MEDITERRANEAN/OYSTER BAR
This tiny dining room and its chef-owner, Colette Nelson, offer Sitka’s only
first-rate cuisine, and it’s a very pleasant place for a meal. She’s taken a
formerly grungy concrete space and filled it with charm and warmth, with
Mediterranean colors, wine bottles, and whimsical art. The restaurant is
too small to serve many meals a night, so each one is carefully crafted,
coming from a changing menu intended to stretch the chef and introduce
the small-town clientele to new tastes. A recent menu included grilled mar-
inated lamb chops, a wild mushroom ragu, and calamari. Or snack in the
afternoon on tapas ($15) or local oysters ($2 each).

Exploring Sitka
Sitka is Alaska’s most historic town and has more high-quality sightsee-
ing than any other. One day may not be enough, if these attractions
interest you. Definitely plan for more than a day if you want to see the
historic sites and do any of the excellent outdoor activities. The visitor
shuttle is covered in the earlier “Getting Around Sitka” section.
Chapter 22: Sitka 357

Exploring the top attractions
I’ve arranged these top attractions according to importance, recognizing
you may not have time for everything. I suggest starting at the Sitka
National Historical Park, which will put the rest of the sites in context.
Sitka National Historical Park
The park, designated in 1910, preserves the site of the 1804 Battle of Sitka,
in which Alaska’s Russian invaders defeated the Tlingit and won control of
the area (see the “Understanding Sitka’s place in history” sidebar, earlier
in this chapter). The park contains an extraordinary collection of early
totem poles, with reproductions and contemporary originals displayed
outside and ancient poles housed indoors in a wonderful 30-foot-high hall.
The visitor center is really a living museum: Besides the fascinating
explanatory exhibits, there are workshops in which artisans from the
Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center create traditional crafts of metal,
wood, beads, textiles, and woven grass. Visitors are welcome to come in
and ask questions. Don’t be shy — striking up a conversation is more
polite than just staring. Be sure to walk through the totem park and battle
site. A free 12-minute video provides a good historical overview.
See map p. 354. 106 Metlakatla St., Sitka. % 907-747-0110. www.nps.gov/sitk.
Open: Visitor center summer daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m., winter Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; park
summer daily 6 a.m.–10 p.m., winter daily 7 a.m.–8 p.m. Admission: $4.
The Russian Bishop’s House
In 1842–43, the Russian America Company retained Finnish shipbuilders to
construct this extraordinary house for Bishop Innocent Veniaminov as a
residence, school, and chapel. It may have survived many years of neglect
in part because its huge beams fit together like those of a ship. Now beau-
tifully restored, the building is the best of only a few surviving from all of
Russian America and is Alaska’s most interesting historic site. Downstairs
is a self-guided museum; upstairs, rangers lead tours of the bishop’s quar-
ters, which are furnished with original and period pieces. It’s an extraor-
dinary window into an alternate stream of American history, from a time
before the founding of Seattle or San Francisco, when Sitka was the most
important city on North America’s Pacific Coast. The tour concludes with
a visit to a beautiful little chapel with many of the original icons Innocent
imported from Russia.
See map p. 354. Lincoln and Monastery streets, Sitka. No phone; call Sitka National
Historical Park Visitor Center (% 907-747-0110). Open: Summer daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.;
by appointment in winter. Admission: $4 per person or $15 per family; family admis-
sion also covers the visitor center.
Alaska Raptor Center
This nonprofit center takes in injured birds of prey (mainly bald eagles,
but also owls, hawks, and other species) for veterinary treatment and
release or, if too badly injured, for placement in a zoo or as part of the 
Part V: Southeast Alaska 
358

collection of 25 that live on-site. Visitors get to see the impressive birds
up close in a lecture setting, through the glass wall of the veterinary clinic,
and in outdoor enclosures, but the highlight is an extraordinary flight-
training center. This enormous aviary is where recuperating birds learn to
fly again, and visitors can walk its length behind one-way glass watching
them preen, feed, and take to the air in a peaceful setting simulating their
natural habitat. Seeing these giant birds fly from so close is awesome. The
center’s grounds also include a pleasant, disabled-accessible nature trail
that leads down to a salmon stream where healthy eagles sometimes can
be seen feeding.
See map p. 354. 1000 Raptor Way (off Sawmill Creek Boulevard), Sitka. % 800-643-
9425. www.alaskaraptor.org. Open: Summer daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.; call for hours
in winter. Admission: $12 adults, $6 children 12 and under.
Sheldon Jackson Museum
Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian missionary with powerful friends in
Washington, D.C., was Alaska’s first General Agent for Education, a pater-
nal guardian of the welfare, schooling, and spiritual lives of Alaska’s
Natives. On the side, he gathered an omnivorous collection of some 5,000
objects of Native art and culture from 1888 to 1898. That collection, the
best in Alaska, has been displayed for more than a century in a concrete
building on the campus of a now defunct college bearing Jackson’s name.
Despite the age of many of the pieces, they appear as if just made. Don’t
miss Katlian’s raven-shaped helmet, which was worn by the Kiksadi clan’s
war leader in the Battle of Sitka in 1804. It’s that rare piece of great history
that’s also great art. Native artists demonstrate their skills on summer
days, and the gift shop offers almost exclusively authentic Native arts and
crafts, with prices to match.
See map p. 354. 104 College Dr., Sitka. % 907-747-8981. www.museums.state.
ak.us. Open: Mid-May to mid-Sept daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m., mid-Sept to mid-May
Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Admission: $4 adults, free for children 18 and younger.
Getting outdoors in Sitka
No wonder the Russians and the Tlingit fought for this place: It’s
absolutely gorgeous and full of wildlife and fish. See the historic sites by
all means, but also take the time to explore the rich environment that
lured those historic figures here — an environment that’s still pretty
much the way it was in those long-ago days.
Fishing
Many charter boats are available for salmon or halibut. The Sitka
Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 907-747-5940; www.sitka.org)
keeps a detailed charter-boat list online. Using the grid view (www.
sitka.org/grid.html), you can compare boats, rates, and services,
and link to the vessel’s own home page. Alaska Adventures Unlimited
(% 907-747-5576) is a long-established booking agent handling many
charter boats.
Chapter 22: Sitka 359

Hiking
Sitka is a great hiking area. A dozen U.S. Forest Service hiking trails are
accessible from the roads around town. A beautifully made little book,
Sitka Trails (Alaska Geographic, $8), covers each trail with a detailed
description and fine-scale color topographic map. For additional advice,
contact the Sitka Ranger District, 204 Siginaka Way, Sitka (% 907-747-
6671; www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/districts/sitka).
Here are some favorites:
 Indian River Trail: From downtown, this is a 4-mile walk (one-way)
through the rain forest, rising gradually up the river valley to a
small waterfall. Take Indian River Road off Sawmill Creek Road just
east of downtown.
 Gavan Hill–Harbor Mountain Trail: A steeper mountain-climbing
trail to alpine terrain and great views. The trailhead is near the end
of Baranof Street, which starts near the Russian Bishop’s House. It
gains 2,500 feet over 3 miles to the peak of Gavan Hill and then 
continues another 3 miles along a ridge to meet Harbor Mountain
Road.
 Starrigavan Recreation Area trails: The recreation area is at the
north end of Halibut Point Road, near the ferry dock, 71⁄2 miles from
downtown. On the right, the Estuary Life Trail and Forest Muskeg
Trail total about a mile. Exquisitely developed and accessible to
anyone, they circle a grassy estuary rich with birds and fish. The
well-built Mosquito Cove Trail starts from the far end of the camp-
ground loop on the left, loops 11⁄4 miles along the shore to the
secluded gravel beach of the cove, and returns over boardwalk
steps through the old-growth forest.
Marine wildlife tours
When sea conditions allow, tour boats visit St. Lazaria Island, a bird
rookery where you can see puffins, murres, rhinoceros auklets, and
other pelagic birds. Volcanic rock drops straight down into deep water,
so big boats can pilot in close, but in rough weather even they won’t go
to the exposed location of St. Lazaria. When you can’t get to the island,
however, there is still plenty to look at. Humpback whales appear in
large groups in fall and often are seen by the half-dozen in summer, and
encounters with endearing sea otters are a near certainty.
The largest tour-boat operation, Sitka Wildlife Quest, operated by Allen
Marine Tours (% 888-747-8101; www.allenmarinetours.com), has
well-trained naturalists aboard to explain the wildlife. A two-hour cruise
Tuesday and Thursday at 6 p.m. costs $59 adults, $39 children. A three-
hour cruise Saturday at 9 a.m. costs $79 adults, $49 children. The boat
leaves from the Crescent Harbor Visitors Dock late May through early
September. Buy tickets onboard.
Part V: Southeast Alaska 
360

Sea Life Discovery Tours (% 877-966-2301; www.sealifediscovery
tours.com) offers an opportunity to see the rich underwater life in Sitka
Sound from an extraordinary boat that has big windows 4 feet below the
waterline; it’s really cool. They charge $86 for a two-hour tour; call for
times.
Sea-kayaking
Sitka’s protected waters and intricate shorelines are perfect for sea-
kayaking. You’re almost sure to come upon seals, sea otters, sea lions,
and eagles, and you may see whales. Sitka Ocean Adventures (% 907-
747-6375; www.ssoceanadventures.com) offers tours for beginners
every day in the summer when they have at least two customers to go
along. A two-hour paddle (plus a half-hour for instruction and gearing
up) takes kayakers into the islands around Sitka and costs $70. A half-
day paddle could also go to a historic World War II fort, where you can
walk through the abandoned bunkers. That’s $100. The firm offers all-
day paddles, too.
Tide-pooling and shore walks
Halibut Point State Recreation Area, 41⁄2 miles north of town on Halibut
Point Road, is a great place for picnics, shore rambles, and tide-pooling.
The Mosquito Cove Trail (see “Hiking,” earlier in this chapter) is also
promising. Check a tide book to find out about the best low tides.
They’re available all over town. The best time to go is when the lowest
Chapter 22: Sitka 361
What about Ketchikan?
When arriving by boat at the south end of the Southeast Alaska Panhandle, the first
place you land is Ketchikan, Alaska’s fourth-largest city. Because of the location,
Ketchikan is usually first in every Alaska guidebook, but I’ve neglected to include it at
all here. This isn’t an oversight. My philosophy in this book is to send you to the best
and forget the rest, and that forces me to make some tough choices. I love Ketchikan,
but Sitka is unquestionably richer in history and wildlife and is Ketchikan’s equal in
totem poles and Tlingit culture. Sitka also suffers less from cruise-ship tourism, which
tends to create a crowded, carnival atmosphere in the towns where several ships can
tie up at once.
If you have time for both communities, or if your itinerary makes Ketchikan easier, by
all means go. You’ll find plenty to do there, with totem-pole viewing and fishing topping
the list, and also exceptional bear–viewing and flightseeing to Misty Fjords National
Monument. I cover it all in my comprehensive Alaska guidebook, Frommer’s Alaska
(Wiley Publishing). Or contact the Ketchikan Visitors Bureau, 131 Front St., Ketchikan
(% 800-770-3300 or 907-225-6166; www.visit-ketchikan.com).

tide is expected, arriving on the shore an hour before the low ebb. To
identify the little creatures you’ll see, buy a plastic-covered field guide at
the National Park Service visitor center or at a bookstore.
More cool things to see and do
Sitka offers so many high-quality attractions that the runners-up here
would be the top picks in most Alaska towns:
 Visit a historic Russian Orthodox Church. St. Michael’s Cathedral,
at Lincoln and Cathedral streets (% 907-747-8120), was the first in
the New World, standing grandly in the middle of Sitka’s principal
street since 1848 (although today’s structure is an exact re-creation
of the burned original structure). The cathedral contains several
miraculous icons, some dating from the 17th century, as well as a
trove of fascinating stories told by knowledgeable guides. The
church is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; call for
weekend and winter hours. A $2 donation is requested.
 Attend a traditional Native dance performance. The Sitka Tribe
performs at the community house, 200 Katlian St. (% 888-270-
8687; www.sitkatribe.com), on the north side of the downtown
parade ground. Performances last 30 minutes and include three
dances and a story. It’s entirely traditional. You can also sign up 
for tours and activities in the lobby. Admission is $8 adults, $5 
children; call for times.
Shopping
Most of Sitka’s best shops and galleries are on Lincoln and Harbor
streets. Several are across the street from St. Michael’s Cathedral, on the
uphill side.
 Fairweather Prints, 209 Lincoln St. (% 907-747-8601), has a fun,
youthful feel. It’s large and has a diverse selection, such as wear-
able art (including T-shirts), watercolors, prints, ceramics, and
cute, inexpensive crafts.
 Continue west on Lincoln to Old Harbor Books, 201 Lincoln St. 
(% 907-747-8808), a good browsing store with an excellent selec-
tion of Alaska books and a cozy espresso shop in back, the
Backdoor Cafe.
 In the other direction, near the boat harbor, the Sitka Rose Gallery
occupies a Victorian house at 419 Lincoln St. (% 888-236-1536 or
907-747-3030), featuring higher-end work, mostly local, including
sculpture, original paintings, engraving, and jewelry.
 The Sheldon Jackson Museum Gift Shop, 104 College Dr. (% 907-
747-6233), is an excellent place to buy Alaska Native arts and
crafts, assured of their authenticity.

The End of the Road
and Beyond: 
Bush Alaska

In this part . . .
W
hile reading adventure tales as children, some people
develop an irresistible drive to go to Alaska. That
drive has nothing to do with easy-to-reach towns or national
parks on roads. They’re looking for the Arctic, for remote
bear country, for extreme places completely unlike anything
they’ve experienced before. In short, they want to go to the
Bush.
In this part, I deal with some of the best Bush destinations —
the ones with something to see and reasonable services to
get you there and keep you comfortable. Each of these four
places — Nome, Barrow, Katmai National Park, and Kodiak
Island — offers something unique, exciting, and exotic.

P
icturing the Arctic in your imagination is easy: in summer, flat green
tundra without trees meeting a green ocean; in winter, flat white
snow and ocean melding together into one. But you can’t imagine the
real beauty of the place until you go there. Under diffuse gray light, the
land’s watercolor tints and hues melt together with its stark shapes and
shades. Under the beams of the low midnight sun, rich and yellow, the
snow and sky become royal blue. A sense of overwhelming immensity
prevails; it can make you feel incredibly tiny and vulnerable but also
entirely free for the first time. The Arctic is a remote, unforgiving hell of
harsh weather, but it’s also a paradise.
All flowery writing aside, however, traveling to the Arctic definitely isn’t
for everyone. You can’t go there cheaply. And, after you’re there, you
won’t find much to do. The Arctic’s few communities are tiny. Outdoor
activities are rugged and cold. The towns have developed activities for
visitors, but they’re mostly designed for escorted tour packages and can
be scripted and even dreary. If seeing the Arctic isn’t a particular inter-
est, you can find better ways to spend your time and money on an
Alaskan trip.
If, on the other hand, you feel the drive to go way up north, fulfill your
dream now. Just make sure to allow enough time for getting away 
from the tour bus so that you can have one of those strange, solitary
moments that seem to happen only at the top of the world.
In this chapter, I cover in detail the two best towns to visit in the 
Arctic — Barrow and Nome — because each offers a different flavor to
your visit. Although flying is the only way to get to Barrow and Nome,
you can also reach the Arctic by driving the Dalton Highway north from
Fairbanks. That very ambitious option is covered in Chapter 18.

Discovering the Arctic and 
Its Major Attractions
Barrow and Nome offer different activities that appeal to different inter-
ests. To help you choose, here are the highlights of each.
Barrow
Barrow is the essential Arctic community. It’s the farthest north of any
mainland town in North America, lying on a point in the Arctic Ocean
around which bowhead whales migrate. In a tradition dating back 1,000
years, the Iñupiat Eskimos here hunt whales for sustenance. The town
isn’t much to look at: Modest plywood houses on pilings sit on flat green
tundra along gravel roads. But it’s a unique and potentially interesting
place to visit, with some of the following highlights:
 The Iñupiat Heritage Center, a living museum of Eskimo culture
 Bird-watching and polar bear–viewing tours
 Guided tours to discover more about this unusual town
Nome
Nome is a gold-rush town, not a Native community like Barrow, and it
isn’t technically Arctic, lying just below the Arctic Circle (although it
looks like the Arctic). But in many ways, Nome is a better place for an
independent traveler to visit, because you can do more on your own,
including some of the following:
 Exploring the network of roads around Nome on your own to see
abundant wildlife
 Witnessing a gold-rush town that still rocks, loaded with some of
the best stories anywhere in Alaska
 Watching the finish of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, Alaska’s
biggest annual event
Part VI: The End of the Road and Beyond: Bush Alaska

Beware indoor pollution
Bush Alaska lags behind the rest of the country in many ways, few more startling than
the prevalence of smoking in these remote little communities. It seems as if everyone
smokes everywhere. Escape can be impossible. Restaurants usually are smoky, and
lower-cost hotel rooms tend to smell smoky. If avoiding smoking is a high priority, stick
to the most tourist-oriented (and most expensive) establishments.

Going to the Top of the World: Barrow
Barrow is an ancient Iñupiat Native community, founded and still sus-
tained by its access at this farthest-north point to the migrating bow-
head whale, which Eskimos hunt from small, open boats. It’s also a
modern town, rich in North Slope oil revenues, a center of scientific
research about the Arctic, and home to Alaska’s largest corporation, the
Native-owned Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. If these seem like con-
tradictions, they are, but they’re like the ones that describe each person
you meet here: Corporate leaders also are respected whalers. (Their
hunt is not a threat to the bowhead whales’ population, which is strong
and growing.)
The town’s Iñupiat Heritage Center celebrates this cultural mix. There
you can view natural and cultural exhibits, see Iñupiat dance, and meet
Native people selling their crafts. The bus tour that most visitors take
also points out some of the town’s interesting points, although it can’t
be described as a cultural immersion. You can also take a bird-watching
tour and may be able to go out and see polar bears.
Beyond those formal activities, however, you won’t find much else to do
in Barrow. The town has only one main store and no trails to hike — the
tundra tends to be swampy — although walking on the gravel beaches is
possible. Most visitors come up just for the day on the escorted package
tour offered by Alaska Airline Vacations from Anchorage or Fairbanks;
the package is a good deal and gives you the highlights. If you want time
on your own, you can spend the night and go back the next day. Few
people want to spend more time here than that.
Getting there
The only way to get to Barrow is via Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-
7522; www.alaskaair.com), which flies a couple of times daily from
Anchorage and Fairbanks and offers one-day and overnight tour pack-
ages. The packages are good deals, competitive in price with stand-alone
round-trip tickets from Anchorage, which can top $500. Book through
Alaska Airlines Vacations (% 800-468-2248). I explain more about this
in “Exploring Barrow,” later in this chapter.
Getting around
The Alaska Airlines Vacations package tours provide all transportation.
Otherwise, the easiest way to get around Barrow is in a taxicab, with
competing companies all charging the same flat rates ($5 or $6 per trip
in town, $10 beyond the town, plus $1 for each additional passenger).

Where to stay
Barrow has few lodging options, and none I would call cheap. The
lowest-cost option is the Alaska Airlines Vacation package, which puts
you at the Top of the World Hotel, described in this section.
King Eider Inn
$$$$$
Barrow
The best rooms in town are found in this clapboard building near the air-
port. They’re crisp and airy, with faux rustic furniture, and kept up well. It
surely helps that shoes are not allowed in the hotel — you have to take
them off at the front door every time you come in. The halls and rooms
are decorated with Native art. A room with a kitchenette is $10 more, and
the enormous and luxurious Presidential Suite (where Barrow’s honey-
mooners and visiting celebrities stay) is $315 summer, $290 winter. The
lobby is comfortable, with a stone fireplace and free Internet terminal, and
free coffee and other hot beverages are offered there around the clock.
Bathrooms have large shower stalls, not tubs.

Top of the World Hotel
$$$–$$$$$
Barrow
This is a good hotel with familiar standard rooms, worn in places but per-
fectly comfortable. The staff works to keep the place clean and quiet.
Rooms have light furniture and blue carpet, desks and refrigerators. Those
on the water side have remarkable views of the Arctic Ocean, and it’s only
a few steps to the beach and the heart of Barrow. The lobby is a place
where people pass time, somewhat cluttered with a TV and a stuffed polar
bear. The hotel is owned by the Native corporation that also operates
Tundra Tours, and you stay here if you come on the package tour.

Summer $150–$220 double, winter $125–$155 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Where to dine
The sale of alcohol is illegal in Barrow, so you can’t buy a glass of wine
or beer with your meal in any of the restaurants. Bringing alcohol with
you is severely limited; for simplicity’s sake, and to avoid breaking the
law, don’t do it.
You’ll find no fine dining in Barrow, but there are plenty of places to eat
out where locals go for a pizza or burger.
Most visitors go no further than Pepe’s North of the Border, 1204 Agvik
St. (% 907-852-8200), which adjoins the Top of the World Hotel. It
serves large portions of familiar American-style Mexican food, steak, and
Part VI: The End of the Road and Beyond: Bush Alaska 
370

seafood. On the Alaska Airlines Vacations package, you’ll lunch here and
likely receive a souvenir from owner Fran Tate, who’s locally famous for
an appearance she made on the Johnny Carson show decades ago.
I’ve had my best meals in Barrow at the Northern Lights Restaurant,
5122 Herman St. (% 907-852-3300). It’s a comfortable place with a clean
dining room and a charming family in charge. The extensive menu fea-
tures the owner’s own Chinese food, plus deli selections and burgers,
and the town’s top-rated pizza.
Exploring Barrow
For most visitors, the escorted tour is the way to visit Barrow, for rea-
sons I explain in this section. If you’re feeling brave, however, you can
have an interesting visit without a guide, joining a wildlife-viewing outing
and spending time at the Iñupiat Heritage Center and seeing the Iñupiaq
dancing there.
Basic Barrow: The Escorted Tour
Even if you hate escorted tours, as I do, they make sense in Barrow. The
package sold by Alaska Airlines usually costs little more than a plane ticket
alone, but includes valuable extras. Barrow is hard to figure out without a
guide: It has no downtown, no shops, and few obviously public places.
When you take the tour, you’ll get a good six-hour orientation and some
highlights. Then you can stay overnight to take your own measure of the
place. The tour drives around town, out the short roads beyond town, and
visits the Iñupiat Heritage Center, described in the next listing, where you
watch dancing and a blanket toss and can buy crafts directly from artists.
(That presentation is the highlight; if you skip the escorted tour, make sure
to visit the Iñupiat Heritage Center anyway.) The day-trip tour is about
$500 from Fairbanks; for $600 per person, double occupancy, you can
spend one night in Barrow at the Top of the World Hotel, giving you time
on your own without the tour group. Both prices include airfare. If you buy
the tour separately when you’re already in Barrow, it’s $95. A winter tour
is also available for seeing the aurora ($99 separately), but it does not
include the cultural elements.
Alaska Airlines Vacations. % 800-468-2248. www.alaskaair.com.
The Iñupiat Heritage Center
This is the town’s main attraction. It’s part museum, part gathering center,
and part venue for living culture. Inside is a workshop for craftspeople
where hunters build the traditional boats and tools they use and where
drummers build their drums; during the summer, an artist is usually in res-
idence for visitors. In the museum area, displays of Iñupiat artifacts change
regularly, while a permanent exhibit covers Eskimo whaling and the influ-
ence that Yankee whaling has had on it. A special $15 admission fee
includes Iñupiaq dancing and drumming demonstrations, a blanket toss,
Chapter 23: The Arctic 371

games, and a craft sale that happen every afternoon in the summer from
1:30 to 3:30 p.m.; these are the same programs that are the highlight of the
escorted tours.
Ahkovak and C streets. % 907-852-0422. www.nps.gov/inup. Open: Mon–Fri 8:30
a.m.–5 p.m. (call ahead to see the dancing program on weekends). Admission: $5
adults, $2 students, free for seniors and children 14 and under.
Getting outdoors in Barrow
In season, Barrow is a good place to see polar bears. The bears are
always around when the ice is in; they’re dangerous and people take
extreme care to avoid them. Barrow and other North Slope communities
have minimized the danger of bears in town by setting up sites outside of
the villages to dispose of gut piles and other hunting waste. It’s a way of
bribing the bears to leave the town alone. In Barrow, heavy equipment
hauls the leftovers from fall whale-butchering — bones and a few inedible
organs — out to the very end of the point. Polar bears come for an easy
meal whenever the pack ice is close to shore, which is October through
June. Commercial tours take visitors out to the point in all-terrain vans or
Humvees that can drive on the beach gravel. Arrangements change annu-
ally and these are casual home businesses, so if polar bear–viewing is
your goal, be sure to make firm arrangements with someone before you
go. Arctic Tours (% 907-852-4512 or 907-852-1462) takes visitors out in a
Humvee May through September on a two-hour tour that costs $70 per
person, with a two-person minimum. Go only in May, June, or earlier,
when the sea ice is in; you stand little chance of seeing a bear during
times of open water, in the summer or fall.

On Your Own in Nome
Compared to Barrow, Nome is not as far north, is not as rich in Alaska
Native culture, and doesn’t have a sizable museum or polar bear–
viewing tours. But it does have one quality that may trump all of those:
You don’t need a tour guide. Nome has shops, historic sites you can
walk to, and, best of all, a long network of roads where you can see
wildlife and natural places on your own. That alone may make it a better
choice than Barrow.
Nome exploded into existence with gold finds around 1900. The beach
sand in front of the community turned out to be full of gold. People
poured in by steamship and built a boomtown powered by alcohol and
gambling. At the Board of Trade Saloon, which still serves drinks on
Front Street today, bettors set odds on dog mushers racing across the
vast Seward Peninsula, their progress reported by telephone lines set up
for the purpose.
The spirit of those days lives on, to some degree. Nome has more
strange and funny community events than any other place I know,
including the Bering Sea Ice Golf Classic in March and the Polar Bear
Swim, which is scheduled June 21 (late enough for ice to be clear from
the ocean). And, of course, Nome has the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
The hoopla in March, when mushers arrive at the end of their 1,000-mile
dash from Anchorage, is essential Nome.
Getting there
Flying is the only way to get to Nome. Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-
7522; www.alaskaair.com) flies 90 minutes by jet either direct from
Anchorage or with a brief hop from Kotzebue. Prices are usually $350 to
$550 round-trip. Many visitors come on escorted-tour packages sold by
Alaska Airlines Vacations (% 800-468-2248); as a day trip, it costs
about $500. But I think Nome is better without an escort, especially if
you rent a car or take an independent wildlife-viewing tour.
Getting around
All taxis operate according to a standard price schedule. A ride to town
from the airport is $5. Nome has three taxi companies, including Louie’s
Cab (% 907-443-6000).

To explore the roads around Nome, you’ll need a car. Stampede Rent-A-
Car, 302 E. Front St. (% 800-354-4606 or 907-443-3838), charges $95 to
$150 a day for SUVs and vans. The same people operate the Aurora Inn
(see “Where to stay,” next).
Where to stay
Nome has many lodging options. If you can’t find a room at one of 
these top choices, get a referral from the Nome Convention & Visitors
Bureau, Front and Division streets (% 907-443-6624; www.nomealaska.
org/vc). Be sure to get the advice of a real live person, either by 
phone or e-mail, to avoid stumbling into some of Nome’s truly dreadful
accommodations.

Nome
Come to this mock country inn on Nome’s main street for the best tradi-
tional hotel rooms in town. In marked contrast to most of Nome’s other
rooms, these are nicely furnished and even have some style. Also note-
worthy in Nome, you’ll find lots of nonsmoking rooms. The same company
owns the car-rental operation in town, which is on-site.

It’s the hosts who make this place special. Erna and Leo Rasmussen, who

Two rooms share a bathroom while a third has its own, but not attached.
A full breakfast is served when Erna has time to prepare it, and they pick
up and deliver to the airport.
406 W. 4th St., Nome, AK. % 907-443-2919. Rack rates: $135 double. Rates include full
breakfast. MC, V.
Where to dine
Nome has greasy spoons with typical diner food and ethnic restaurants
where the owners serve their own national cuisine, plus that of a few
countries. Milano’s Pizzeria, 503 Front St. (% 907-443-2924), for exam-
ple, offers Italian and Japanese food and pizza attested to by locals.
Probably the best place to eat in town is Airport Pizza, which no longer
is at the airport — it’s at 406 Bering St. (% 907-443-7992; www.airport
pizza.com). The restaurant serves breakfast, sandwiches, and Tex-Mex,
Part VI: The End of the Road and Beyond: Bush Alaska 
374

as well as pizza, and it brews fancy coffee. It also has 15 microbrews on
tap and offers free Wi-Fi. But the delivery service is the biggest claim to
fame: They package up pizzas and put them on bush planes out to tiny
villages.
Twin Dragons, on Front Street near Steadman Street (% 907-443-5552),
specializes in Chinese cuisine in a fully decorated dining room. The food
is good enough to have kept them in business many years.
All restaurants in Nome are open long daily hours, and you can count on
them taking at least Visa and MasterCard.
Exploring Nome
It’s worth your time to take a walk around Nome to see some of the sur-
viving historic buildings and other sites of interest. Check out the gold
rush–era Board of Trade Saloon and a bust of Roald Amundsen, who
landed near Nome, in Teller, after crossing the North Pole from Norway
in a dirigible in 1926.
Below the library, at Front Street and Lanes Way, the small Carrie M.
McLain Memorial Museum (% 907-443-6630) contains an exhibit dedi-
cated to the town’s gold rush. The museum is free; it’s open in summer
daily noon to 8 p.m., and in winter Tuesday through Saturday noon to 
6 p.m.
In good weather, walk or take a taxi to the beach southeast of town,
where you may see small-time miners still sifting the sand for gold. You
can walk the beach for miles. The gold-digging Swanberg Dredge that
you can spot from here operated until the 1950s; a large dredge north of
town worked into the mid-1990s.
Driving the tundra
Do explore the extraordinary 250-mile road network that provides
access to the tundra and mountains beyond the town during your visit
to Nome. Nowhere else in Alaska is this kind of wilderness so easy to
access. You’re likely to see reindeer and musk oxen, and bird-watchers
can add many exotic new entries to their life lists.
For information on the three routes around Nome, check with the visitor
center on Front Street or your car-rental agency. The best choice may 
be the Nome-Council Road, which heads 72 miles to the east, about half
of that on the shoreline, before turning inland at the ghost town of
Solomon, an old mining town with an abandoned railroad train known
locally as the “Last Train to Nowhere.” The engines were originally used
on the New York City elevated lines in 1881; they were shipped to Alaska
in 1903 to serve the miners along this line to Nome.
Chapter 23: The Arctic 375

Flying over the tundra
Nome is a hub for bush-plane operators. Flightseeing charters are avail-
able, or you can fly on one of the scheduled routes out to the villages
and spend a couple of hours touring. The way to do it is to contact a
flight service, explain what you have in mind, and follow their advice.
Expect to pay $175 to $250. Don’t plan to stay overnight in a village with-
out advance arrangements and don’t go in bad weather — you’ll see
little and may get stuck in a tiny village. Bering Air (% 800-478-5422 in
Alaska only, or 907-443-5464; www.beringair.com) has a long and illus-
trious reputation and serves 32 villages from Nome and Kotzebue. They
offer flightseeing trips by fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter on hourly
charter rates (expensive if there are just one or two of you along). Or
they’ll sell you a seat on a scheduled loop flight that visits various vil-
lages, charging the fare only to the closest village on the trip while you
enjoy the entire round-trip. They even offer charters across the Bering
Strait to the Russian towns of Provideniya and Anadyr.
Shopping
Nome is one of the best towns in Alaska to shop for ivory and other
Eskimo artwork, with low prices and a variety of choices, including the
following highlights:
 Jim West has a legendary collection for sale, assembled in the bar-
room of the historic Board of Trade Saloon, which is attached to a
shop at 212 E. Front St. (% 907-443-2611).
 The Arctic Trading Post, 302 W. Front St. (% 907-443-2686), is
more of a traditional gift shop and has a good ivory collection.
 Chukotka-Alaska, 514 Lomen St. (% 907-443-4128), is an importer
of art and other goods from the Russian Far East and is really worth
a look.
Alaska Native art that you find in Nome is likely to be authentic, but you
still need to ask; check out the information concerning fake Native art in
Chapter 5.

Bear Country: 
Katmai National Park 
and Kodiak Island
In This Chapter
 Finding lots of big bears
 Choosing a bear-viewing destination
 Traveling to Katmai National Park
 Taking in the wonders of Kodiak Island
W
here the moisture of the North Pacific Ocean runs into the moun-
tains of Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula, frequent snow
and rain give rise to rivers full of salmon. During spawning season,
brown bears catch as much of that rich, fatty food as they can. When the
fish aren’t spawning, bears still dine on seafood, using their huge claws
to dig clams from the beaches. And to finish the feast, they can find
abundant berries on limitless miles of green hills. Inland, the species is
called the grizzly bear, growing to a few hundred pounds. But here on
the coast, a big bear can weigh three-quarters of a ton and stand 9 feet
tall. The Kodiak brown bear, the world’s largest, is an entire subspecies
to itself.
The region has other things to do besides looking at bears. Kodiak is a
fascinating little town on the huge island of the same name, with ves-
tiges of Russian America and the Alaska Native culture that preceded
and survived the Russian invasion of 250 years ago. Katmai National
Park also contains the bizarre and spectacular Valley of Ten Thousand
Smokes, where one of history’s largest volcanic eruptions occurred. You
can go salmon-fishing at either place.
Bears are the marquee attraction, and if bears are your main goal, you
need to consider your options carefully. The cheapest way to see bears
is from a bus at Denali National Park (see Chapter 19), but you won’t see
the great big ones and you probably won’t see them close up. You can’t

get to big, coastal brown bear–viewing cheaply, but you may be able to
simplify your trip by taking a small plane directly for bear-viewing from
Anchorage or Homer (see Chapters 14 and 16, respectively). That may
not get you to the absolute best bear-viewing sites, but, in season, you
can find brown bears lots of places. Admiralty Island near Juneau also
has prodigious bear-viewing; if you reserve well ahead, you can count on
seeing bears there in season (see Chapter 20).
Katmai is the ultimate bear-viewing destination, where visitors watch
bears feeding from close up, but it’s also expensive, and the limited facil-
ities are crowded when bear-viewing is hot. From Kodiak, you can get to
bears only by small plane; you see them without crowds when you find
them, but you’re less likely to see large numbers of bears close up.
Discovering Bear Country and 
Its Major Attractions
On Kodiak Island and at Katmai National Park, bears rule the landscape.
Not only are the bears much larger than the people, but they’re also
more numerous, the primary reason visitors trek to these remote
locales.
Katmai National Park
Katmai is a remote, wilderness park far beyond the road network on the
Alaska Peninsula southwest of Anchorage. All accommodations are in
tents or expensive wilderness lodges, but you can go for a day trip just
to see the bears. The park’s main attractions are
 Watching huge and abundant brown bear feeding in Brooks River
 Fishing for salmon
 Hiking in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes
Kodiak Island
The nation’s second-largest island (after Hawaii’s Big Island) is mostly an
enormous bear refuge, a kingdom where big bears reign supreme.
Besides tiny Alaska Native villages, the town of Kodiak is the only settle-
ment, an unspoiled fishing port with several interesting sites and many
outdoor opportunities, including the following:
 Watching brown bear feeding in areas accessed by floatplane
 Kayaking in the protected ocean waters of the Kodiak Archipelago
 Hiking and tide-pooling on little-used trails and shorelines
 Fishing salmon in some of Alaska’s most abundant streams
Chapter 24: Bear Country: Katmai National Park and Kodiak Island 379

Bear-Watching at Katmai National Park
Katmai National Park takes in a large section of the Alaska Peninsula, a
wild, rugged, and sparsely visited land within which lies a hot ticket:
Brooks Camp, a former fishing lodge and the site of an extraordinary
congregation of large brown bears. When fish are running in the Brooks
River, in July and September (but not outside those times), bears come
to catch them at a waterfall and feed to their hearts’ content. Visitors
are led by armed park rangers to elevated viewing platforms, where they
can watch the bears in relative safety from quite close up.
The park was set aside in 1918 after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta
Volcano, the most destructive volcanic event of the last 3,400 years. A
40-square-mile area was buried as deep as 700 feet in ash. Named the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, the area continued steaming for
decades. Now quiet, it remains a strange, unearthly wasteland, cut by
erosion into precipitous gorges. To get to the valley, you first go to
Brooks Camp and then take a bus.
Getting a room to stay overnight at Brooks Camp is prohibitively diffi-
cult: You must act far, far ahead of time. Even for day-trippers, the view-
ing platforms are crowded and you have to take turns. And getting there
is costly. It’s always so with a finite resource that’s this desirable: The
world’s largest protected population of brown bears is here.
Getting there
You have one option to get to Katmai National Park’s Brooks Camp: 
by small plane. Most people first fly by jet from Anchorage to the town
of King Salmon, which lies just west of the park, on Alaska Airlines
(% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com). Service is twice a day in
summer for $450 round-trip or more. For more flight options, you can
use Alaska’s prop partner, PenAir (% 800-448-4226; www.penair.
com), which can also be booked through Alaska Airlines. Air taxis carry
visitors the last leg from King Salmon to Brooks Camp for a fare of 
about $180 round-trip. Katmai Air, operated by park concessionaire
Katmailand (% 800-544-0551; www.katmaiair.com), provides these
flights and offers round-trip airfare packages from Anchorage that can
save some money (they charge a total of about $589) and add simplicity
to your planning.
Every visitor arriving at Brooks Camp is required to attend a 20-minute
orientation called “The Brooks Camp School of Bear Etiquette,” designed
to train visitors (not bears) and keep them out of trouble.
Getting around
Brooks Camp is a place you get around on foot; don’t go if you can’t walk
a mile or more over rough ground. To get to the Valley of Ten Thousand
Smokes, you join a bus tour 23 miles by gravel road from the camp. The
park concessionaire, Katmailand, charges $88 per person, round-trip,
for the all-day excursion, plus $8 more for lunch.

Where to stay and dine
Katmai’s extreme remoteness means there is only one choice for indoor
overnight lodgings at the park’s main visitor area, Brooks Camp.
Brooks Camp Lodge
$$$$$
Brooks Camp
The park has 16 hotel rooms, and they’re all at this lodge. Staying here,
you can enjoy the bears close up, perhaps sipping lemonade on the deck
while they wander by. Otherwise, they’re ordinary rooms with private
bathrooms with shower stalls. The problem is, you have to reserve farther
ahead than most people can manage. All peak dates (when the bears are
around) book up 12 months out or earlier; for your choice, you have to
call when the reservation system opens 18 months ahead, or January of
the year before your visit. To save money, book the lodge rooms as pack-
ages with air travel. The least expensive with airfare is a one-night visit for
$883 per person, double occupancy, meals not included; three nights is
$1,497. A double room without airfare is $682. Three buffet-style meals are
served daily for guests and visitors who aren’t staying in the lodge.
Breakfast is $15; lunch, $19; and dinner, $32. For food only, they take
MasterCard and Visa; everything else, you pay for in advance.

Exploring Katmai National Park
You may have been to many national parks, but you’ve likely never been
anywhere that’s like Katmai. Read on to prepare for a unique experience.
The bears of the Brooks River
When the fish are running — in July especially, but also in September —
40 to 60 brown bear gather to feed at the falls on the Brooks River, half a
mile from Brooks Camp. Visitors sign up for an hour on the viewing plat-
forms and then hike out with park rangers as guides to enjoy their view-
ing period. Make sure to bring binoculars and warm fleece or wool
clothing and rain gear, because the region is cool and damp.
While lodgings at the park are limited to the point of being unavailable
to all but a lucky few, as many day-trippers can go as can afford the
flights. Permits are not needed and there is no fee for entering the park.
The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes
If you spend more than one day at Brooks Camp, you can take time to
enjoy an outing to the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, ground zero of a
volcanic eruption ten times more powerful than the 1980 eruption of
Mount St. Helens. Although the smokes have stopped smoking, the area
remains a dusty desert zone of strange landforms created by the erosion
of the thick ash layer. For information about an all-day tour to the area,
see “Getting around,” earlier in this chapter.

Crossing to Kodiak Island
I’ve never seen a place as green as Kodiak. Flying over the island, vivid
green hills of brush and meadow rise from intricate shorelines of black
rock on green water. Huge spruce trees of dark green cast deep shadows
over a forest floor of thick, bright green moss. Frequent rains water the
rich landscape, feeding the streams and plants that, in turn, feed animals
and fish. The people lucky enough to live here make their living from the
fish, and they’ve built a town that reflects the island, too, with narrow,
winding streets, curious old buildings, and constant proximity to the sea.
Another part of Kodiak’s charm lies in its undiscovered quality: You see
few other tourists, and most businesses are locally owned and sup-
ported. The town is one of the oldest in Alaska and still has one of the
most important structures left behind by Russian America, in addition 
to a good museum owned by Alaska Natives still working to recover
their culture from the Russian invasion of 250 years ago. But most of 
the attraction of Kodiak is in the outdoors, with its bear-viewing, sea-
kayaking, and fishing.
Getting there
Kodiak is easier to get to than other remote Alaska communities. It’s
accessible by frequent air service from Anchorage or by ferry from Homer.
The flight by jet from Anchorage to Kodiak is an hour long on Alaska
Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com). ERA Aviation 
(% 800-866-8394; www.flyera.com) also serves the route with 

prop-driven planes, which can save money. A round-trip ticket from
Anchorage costs around $350. A cab, from A & B Taxi (% 907-486-
4343), runs about $20 from the airport downtown.
The ferries Tustumena and Kennicott, of the Alaska Marine Highway
System (% 800-642-0066; www.ferryalaska.com), serve Kodiak from
Homer, ten hours away. Traveling by ferry is well worth it if you have the
time, but the open ocean is often rough and passengers get seasick. (See
tips for avoiding seasickness in Chapter 9.) Booking a cabin is a good
idea for an overnight run. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service staffs the trips
with a naturalist. Without a cabin, the passenger fare is $74 adults, $37
children 6 to 12, free for children 5 and under.
Getting around
A rented car helps in Kodiak, because the area has lovely remote roads
to explore and the airport isn’t close to downtown. You can rent from
Budget (% 800-527-0700 or 907-487-2220 locally; www.budget.com),
with offices at the airport and downtown.
Where to stay
Kodiak is a remote small town, but you can find a good room there,
either in a substantial hotel or a simple bed and breakfast.
Best Western Kodiak Inn
$$$$
Downtown
This is the best hotel in downtown Kodiak, with attractive rooms perched
on the hill overlooking the boat harbor, right in the center of things. Rooms
in the wooden building vary in size and view, but all are acceptable stan-
dard rooms with good amenities, including refrigerators, microwave
ovens, and wireless Internet. The courtesy van and central location can
save you the cost of a taxi or rental car.
The Chart Room restaurant, specializing in seafood and with a great view
of the water, is a good choice for a nice dinner out, with main courses in
the $18 to $28 range.

Where to dine
The restaurant at the Best Western Kodiak Inn is among the best conven-
tional restaurants in Kodiak (see the preceding section), but another
unconventional option is quite good, too: dinner on a 42-foot yacht, 
the Sea Breeze, from Galley Gourmet (% 800-253-6331; www.kodiak-
alaska-dinner-cruises.com). The evening starts at 6 p.m. with a 
45-minute cruise, then a dinner of seafood creations at anchor, and
you’re back at the dock at 9:30 p.m. The price is $125 per person.
For breakfast or lunch, try Mill Bay Coffee & Pastries, about 2 miles out
of downtown at 3833 Rezanof Dr. (% 907-486-4411; www.millbaycoffee.
com). Paris-trained chef, Joel Chenet, produces wonderful pastries and,
at midday, brilliant combinations of local seafood and international sea-
sonings brought to inexpensive sandwiches — the Kodiak sea burger is
made of salmon, crab, shrimp, and cream cheese, among other ingredi-
ents, and costs only $11.
Downtown, Harborside Coffee & Goods, 210 Shelikof St. (% 907-486-
5862), on the south side of the boat harbor, is a comfortable coffee-
house with soup, bagels, and fresh pastries, popular with young people.
Henry’s Great Alaskan Restaurant, 512 Marine Way (% 907-486-8844),
on the waterfront mall, is a bar and grill where you’ll meet many com-
mercial fishermen and other locals. The menu includes daily specials,
local seafood, and good halibut sandwiches.
Exploring Kodiak
You can easily spend much of a relaxed day of sightseeing in Kodiak
between your outdoor sojourns.
Alutiiq Museum
This exceptional museum, governed by Natives, seeks to document and
revitalize Kodiak’s Alutiiq culture, which the Russians virtually wiped out
in the 18th century. Besides teaching about Alutiiq culture in a single
gallery, the museum manages its own archaeological digs and repatriates
Native remains and artifacts, which researchers removed by the thou-
sands until the 1930s. The archaeological repository now includes 100,000
objects.

The Baranov Museum
The museum occupies the oldest Russian building of only a few left stand-
ing in North America, which is Alaska’s oldest building of any kind.
Alexander Baranof, who ruled Alaska as manager of the Russian American
Company, built the log structure in 1808 as a magazine and strong house
for valuable sea-otter pelts — the treasure that motivated the Russians’
interest here. This was the headquarters for the invasion he extended
across Alaska and down the Pacific Northwest coast. The museum stands
in a grassy park overlooking the water across from the ferry dock. Inside
is a little gallery rich with Russian and early Native artifacts. The guides
know a lot of history and show educational photo albums on various
topics. The gift store is exceptional, selling antique Russian items and
authentic Native crafts.

Getting outdoors in Kodiak
Kodiak offers more than brown bear–viewing. You’ll also find opportuni-
ties for fishing, hiking, and sea-kayaking.
Brown bear–viewing
Most of rich bear habitat of Kodiak Island is controlled by the Kodiak
National Wildlife Refuge (% 888-408-3514 or 907-487-2600; http://
kodiak.fws.gov). You can learn about the bears at the refuge visitor
center at Mission Road and Center Avenue, near the ferry dock, but to
count on seeing them you need to get out on a plane or boat and visit at
the right time of year. The easiest way is a Kodiak-based floatplane;
expect to pay $450 to $475 per person, with a two- or three-person mini-
mum for a half-day trip. Landing on the water, you don rubber boots
(provided) and walk up to half an hour to get to where bears congregate.
In early July to early August, depending on salmon runs, flights land on
Frazer Lake for viewing at Frazer fish pass. A 3⁄4-mile walk on a dirt lane
leads to the viewing area. Flights also visit Ayakulik and Karluk rivers
when fish are present. At any of these sites, binoculars and telephoto
camera lenses are essential, as no responsible guide would crowd
Kodiak brown bears so closely that such lenses become unnecessary
(although the bears could choose to approach within 50 yd. of you).
Bears congregate only when salmon are running, so the timing of your
visit is critical. From early July to mid-August, you have a good chance of
seeing bears fishing in streams on Kodiak, sometimes in numbers.
Contact the refuge for more information on timing and bear activity.
When fish aren’t running on Kodiak, such as in June or after mid-August,
air services fly to the east coast of the Alaska Peninsula, often in Katmai
National Park, to watch bears digging clams from the tidal flats and
eating grass and greens on the coastal meadows. It’s interesting and the
flight is spectacular, but the viewing may be from a greater distance than
Chapter 24: Bear Country: Katmai National Park and Kodiak Island 385

on the streams and the bears will more likely be on their own. Generally,
the flight services charge their standard bear-viewing seat rate regard-
less of how far they have to fly to find bears; if you charter, it may cost
much more, but you’ll have freedom to determine where the plane 
goes for added sightseeing. Several small flight services offer bear-
viewing, including Sea Hawk Air (% 800-770-4295 or 907-486-8282;
www.seahawkair.com).

386
Hermits on the Homestead
Many years ago, U.S. News & World Report did an article about a homesteader on
the Kenai Peninsula who was a Vietnam veteran — just one of the many mad hermits
from the war who had hidden off in the Alaska woods by themselves, populating the
wilderness with human time bombs. The subject of the story, a well-respected member
of his little homesteading community, resented the characterization, and the maga-
zine later paid him to settle his libel suit and printed a retraction. Everyone in the area
knew the article was a bunch of baloney — Alaska homesteaders are as varied as
people in the city. They aren’t all crazed veterans any more than they’re all victims of
unrequited love, although those make the best stories. What they do have in common
that’s unique is a willingness to invest hard physical labor every day of their lives into
the things the rest of us obtain effortlessly by turning a thermostat or a faucet handle.
Alaska’s homesteaders came in waves. There were the prospectors from the gold
rush who stayed. Then, after World War II, GIs with families looking for broad new
opportunities came north and settled more land. The counterculture movement of the
1960s brought yet another group.
Federal homesteading laws written to open the Great Plains to agriculture in the
19th century made getting land difficult and required Alaska homesteaders to do a lot
of anachronistic, absurd work — like clearing large tracts for farming that could never
occur. The homesteaders had to survey the land, live on it, clear much of it, and then
answer any challenges about their accomplishments at a hearing. If they passed the
test, they received a patent to up to 160 acres.
The laws allowing homesteading on federal lands in Alaska were all repealed by
1986, but the state government still sometimes provides remote land to its citizens
under various programs. The parcels are very remote and smaller than the old fed-
eral homesteads, and the rules still don’t make it easy. Some families try, with a
Hollywood dream of living in the wilderness, but give up when they learn firsthand of
the hardship, privations, and cold. I know from experience that living off the grid can
be wonderful, but it means completely reorienting your time and work to basic sur-
vival. Homesteading in the wilderness is a big step further, since you also have to build
your place from scratch. Homesteaders repair engines below zero, construct houses
without heavy equipment, help or advice, carry their water and firewood, and live poor,
largely without an income or any of the things money can buy. You have to be willing
to bathe rarely, be cold in winter, and be eaten alive by mosquitoes in summer, and
end up with land that isn’t really worth anything.

Fishing
The roads leading from the town of Kodiak offer access to terrific
salmon- and trout-fishing. Get a list of where to fish and find help with
contacting guides or charter boats for ocean fishing from the Kodiak
Island Convention & Visitors Bureau, 100 E. Marine Way (% 800-789-
4782; www.kodiak.org). To fish remote areas, you’ll need to charter a
plane, going for a day or staying at a remote cabin or wilderness lodge.
Hiking and tide-pooling
Kodiak has some good, challenging day hikes and a wonderful seaside
park with World War II ruins, easy walks, and tide pools for inspection.
That’s Fort Abercrombie State Historical Park, a couple of miles north
of town on Rezanof Drive, where concrete ruins sit on coastal cliffs amid
Chapter 24: Bear Country: Katmai National Park and Kodiak Island 387
Many successful homesteading experiences end with growing children. 
A couple may make it in the wilderness before having children, and kids don’t care if
they can take a bath, so long as the parents don’t mind washing diapers by hand and
being far from medical care. But when children get to a certain age, they need to go
to school and be around other children. The families often expect to go back to the
homestead someday, but, somehow, they rarely do. I met a couple who moved to town
to educate their children; then, after they retired and the kids were through college,
moved back out to their place along the railroad line north of Talkeetna. They didn’t last
through the winter — they’d forgotten how hard it was. Areas that were thriving little
communities of neighbors in the 1950s or 1960s now are deserted, perhaps with one
hermit left. Out of Alaska’s total land mass of 365 million acres only about 160,000 acres
show any signs of human habitation.
My wife Barbara’s parents homesteaded in the 1950s and 1960s. Her father was a
World War II veteran. Today the family still has some acreage, and a treasure trove of
great stories — among them the tales of my late father-in-law’s feats of strength and
endurance, and my wife’s memory of playing with dolls as a girl, and looking up to
meet the eyes of a bear that had been watching her.
But my favorite is the story of Rose and her lover. They lived in the same area of
northern California where Barbara’s parents grew up. Everyone in town knew the story
of the red-headed beauty who had an affair with an older man. Rose’s parents refused
to let her marry him and decreed that the couple couldn’t see each other anymore.
She entered a convent, and he disappeared, never to be seen in the town again. Many
years later, after moving to Alaska, Barbara’s parents were boating in Kachemak Bay
when they got caught by bad weather on the opposite side of the bay from Homer. On
their own in an open boat and looking for shelter, they found a cabin on a remote beach
of an otherwise uninhabited island. They were taken in and befriended by the hermit
who’d homesteaded there for years. After warming up with a cup of coffee, they got
to talking about where they’d come from and how they’d ended up in Alaska. When it
came time for their host to tell his story, it was about a beautiful young woman he’d
loved, named Rose.

huge trees. Paths lead to beaches and tide pools, a swimming lake, and
other discoveries. The gun emplacements, bunkers, and other concrete
buildings defended against the Japanese, who had seized islands in the
outer Aleutians and were expected to come this way. One bunker has a
volunteer museum that’s open sporadically.

challenging hikes are cataloged by the town visitor center, at 100 E.
Marine Way.
Sea-kayaking
The Kodiak Archipelago, with its many folded, rocky shorelines and
abundant marine life, is a perfect place for sea-kayaking. Kayaks were
invented here and on the Aleutian Islands to the west. For beginners, it’s
best to start with a day trip, and the waters around the town of Kodiak
are lovely for such a paddle. For a half-day, expect to pay around $140
per person; for a full-day, $220. One day-trip guide with a strong environ-
mental ethic is Andy Schroeder, whose business is called Orcas
Unlimited Charters (% 907-539-1979; www.orcasunlimited.com).

Ten Great Walks and 
Hikes in Alaska
In This Chapter
 Hiking Alaska’s most spectacular trails
 Strolling Alaska’s most interesting streets
 Walking Alaska’s prettiest beaches
F
eet are wonderful things. They don’t cost anything to use, and they
can take you places no other vehicle can. In Alaska, your feet are
especially useful, because hikes and walks can transport you to places
of inspiring beauty, often with very little company (except for the occa-
sional moose or eagle).
Hiking information is easy to get. Every town’s visitor center has maps,
handouts, and trail guidebooks. For strolls around small towns’ historic
downtown areas, you can frequently find a free walking-tour brochure.
Information can enhance beach walks, too; you can usually find out where
the tide pools are at public-land visitor centers or bookstores in coastal
communities. In this chapter, I supply you with a head start to your 
information-gathering excursion by outlining ten great walks and hikes.
Bring good walking or hiking shoes to Alaska. You also need layers of
warm clothing, good rain gear, snacks, and water. For beach walks or
tide-pool explorations, shin-high rubber boots enhance the experience.
You can find a pair for around $15 in any coastal town. While you’re in
Alaska, wear them everywhere you go and people will think you’re a
local. When you leave, take the boots home as a souvenir or, if you have
no room in your bags, give them away. Guests have left my garage
stocked with every size over the years and now it’s become a boot lend-
ing library for my visiting friends and relatives.
Glen Alps: Stepping from City to Mountain
The Glen Alps Trailhead in Chugach State Park, 2,000 feet above
Anchorage, is a magical portal between two worlds. On one side,
Anchorage spreads out below you like a toy city. From the park, you can

see how isolated the city really is — a mere splash of civilization on a
much larger background of wild land.
You can hike anywhere and in any style you like. Near the parking lot,
take the paved overlook trail. Opposite the trail, climb steep Flattop
Mountain. Up the valley, choose one of several trails through the moun-
tains for hikes of up to a few days — you can camp anywhere along the
trails. Or don’t use a trail at all. Everything to see is above the tree line,
and after you’re past the brush near the parking lot, you can walk just
about anywhere you want. Enjoy the other world — the total freedom
beyond the city’s edge. See Chapter 14.
Tony Knowles Coastal Trail: 
Exploring Urban Wilds
This coastal trail is the best of many paved multiuse trails that network
through Anchorage like an alternative circulatory system. It starts down-
town. Wander down to Elderberry Park, at the end of 6th Avenue, pass
through a tunnel, and you’ll find yourself face-to-face with the ocean and
mudflat bird habitat. From there, the trail continues along the shore and
in the wooded bluffs above the water for 10 miles to Kincaid Park, the
city’s crown jewel of forest trails for cross-country skiing or mountain-
biking. On the more wooded half of the trail, it’s common to see moose
and eagles, and occasionally you can spot beluga whales in the nearby
Knik Arm from the downtown portion of the trail. The trail is popular at
all times of year, good for walking, biking, skiing, and roller-skating.
There are many spots to stop for a picnic — by a pond, on an ocean
beach, or in a park. See Chapter 14.
Bird Ridge Trail: A Spectacular Cardiac Test
About 25 miles south of Anchorage on the Glenn Highway, this Chugach
State Park Trail rises straight up a 3,500-foot mountain in just 21⁄2 miles,
with mind-expanding views all the way. If you don’t have the energy to
make it to the top, you won’t go home feeling disappointed: From near
the start, you can see far along Turnagain Arm and into the series of
mountains and valleys in the Chugach Range. If you have energy left, the
ridge continues as an informal route, even higher and farther into the
heart of the mountains. See Chapter 15.
Alaska Center for Coastal Studies: 
Tide-Pool Adventure
This nonprofit educational center in Homer takes visitors across
Kachemak Bay, far beyond the reach of roads, to a lodge in the woods
above a lovely, protected cove. From there, well-trained naturalists lead

392

small groups to see the tiny animals in the tide pools of China Poot Bay,
to discover the plants along the woodland paths, and to visit an archeo-
logical site where an ancient Native family once lived. Back at the lodge,
you can use microscopes to inspect the plankton floating around tide-
pool water and observe saltwater tanks with creatures you may not have
seen in the wild. You don’t have to hike more than a mile or two to see it
all. See Chapter 16.
Granite Tors Trail: Nature-Carved Monuments
This challenging hike rises to a strange destination called the Plain of
Monuments, where big granite monoliths stand up like abstract statues.
The 15-mile looping route is in Chena River State Recreation Area, out-
side of Fairbanks on Chena Hot Springs Road. The trail slowly rises from
the partly burned boreal forest to damp tundra, the site of the tors, natu-
rally occurring towers of rock, standing at random spots upon the
plateau without a sense of scale to orient their size. They were formed
when softer material eroded from around granite that had oozed up
from below. See Chapter 17.
Denali National Park: Finding Your 
Measure in the Backcountry
Denali National Park has few formal trails, and those that do exist have
nothing on the places you can explore without a trail, setting out on
your own on tundra or on a gravel river plain. Without trees to get in the
way, you can walk anywhere you choose, keeping your common sense
handy to remember your way back and avoid dangerous situations. One
of the best starting points is the Toklat River, reachable on the park’s
shuttle-bus system. If you don’t see wildlife on your hike, you’ll likely see
animals on the bus ride. Or, if you’re not ready to head out on your own,
join a ranger-guided Discovery Hike into the backcountry with a small
group. See Chapter 19.
Outer Point Trail: Walking to Whale Waters
This trail, which leads from the North Douglas Highway near Juneau, is
an easy walk of just 11⁄3 miles. A boardwalk trail leads through mossy rain
forest, over sunny wetlands, and out to a rocky beach overlooking islet-
dotted Stephens Passage, on the side of Douglas Island opposite the city.
Whales frequent these waters. At low tide, you can explore the tide
pools on the beach before following the loop trail back through woods
so pretty that you have to remind yourself you’re not in a botanical
garden, but just a small slice of a huge forest. See Chapter 20.
Chapter 25: Ten Great Walks and Hikes in Alaska 393

The Streets of Juneau: Finding 
the Charm of Old Alaska
Start at the capitol building at 4th and Main and walk uphill. You don’t
need a plan; every street is lined with charming, moss-roofed houses.
You do need strong legs, however, as the streets climb insanely, some-
times quitting and becoming stairs, up to the ridge that is 7th Street.
Explore in any direction from 7th Street: down the stairs that descend
far below to Gold Creek, down Goldbelt Street to the Governor’s
Mansion, on Calhoun Avenue; or uphill toward the mountains along 7th.
You’re just steps away from a hike into the rain forest that looms over
the city. See Chapter 20.
Sitka National Historical Park: 
Picturing the War
The battlefield where the Russians and the Native Tlingit settled the
ownership of Alaska in 1804 is reached along a quiet, seaside trail lined
by big trees and priceless totem poles. The faces on the poles, so digni-
fied and distant, seem laden with memories of the great events that hap-
pened here. You can imagine the Russian ship approaching the shore
with its cannons blasting. And you can easily picture how the Tlingit
warriors felt as they waited for the attack: Listen to the ravens call,
watch the waves on the shore, and smell the rain in the cedar trees, and
you’ll understand why they fought so hard to hold onto this place. See
Chapter 22.
Barrow’s Arctic Ocean Beach: 
Standing at the World’s Edge
You won’t ever mistake the beach of pea-size gravel where the land 
ends and the Arctic Ocean begins near Barrow for Waikiki, or even Bar
Harbor, but it has its own desolate beauty. You’re truly at the end of the
world, and it feels and looks like it. Huge whale bones left over from
Eskimo hunts lie on the beach in several places, especially near the
Naval Arctic Research Laboratory (NARL) scientific facilities north of
town. In the winter, the beach is a strange place — the frozen sea piles
up into miniature mountain ranges. At those times, however, get local
advice before walking far to avoid the hazards of polar bears or danger-
ously cold weather. See Chapter 23.

Ten Questions to 
Ask an Alaskan
In This Chapter

 Understanding why an Alaskan is an Alaskan
I
can say this because I’m an Alaskan and have been all my life:
Alaskans tend to think they’re better than people from other places.
We’ve either got good self-esteem or delusions of grandeur — you can
decide for yourself. One reason for this confidence is the mindset that,
because Alaska is such a tough place, the people who live here must be
tough, too. That’s hooey. Another reason is that Alaska is such a wonder-
ful place that Alaskans must be wonderful, too. More hooey. And yet
another reason that actually begins to make a little sense: We love it
here. Living here is a conscious decision for most of us, and we want to
spread the word. Many Alaskans treat visitors as potential converts. As
for you, well maybe, deep underneath, you’re an Alaskan, too. You won’t
know for sure until it’s time to get on the plane for home, but some good
conversations on the way can give you an inkling. The questions in this
chapter can help you get some of those good conversations started.
Where Are You from Originally?
In Alaska, the word Native means a member of an indigenous tribe and is
always capitalized. Real Alaska Natives comprise about 16 percent of the
population. Of the rest of the population, not many qualify to be called
“Native,” even by the ordinary meaning of the word (someone born in
Alaska), because the great majority came from somewhere else. Alaska
is a young and growing state. It’s still a place people move to for a little
adventure, knowing that they’ll return to their previous home after a few
years. Or at least that’s what they think they’ll do. My own parents came
up for what they thought would be only three years. That was in 1966.
They’re still here.

How Long Have You Lived Here?
When people get up to speak in public meetings in Alaska, they invari-
ably start out by saying how many years they’ve lived here. Since gold-
rush days, it’s been a rule that you can judge a resident’s wisdom about
the North by how many winters he’s seen. Although people who don’t
enjoy winter sports can go stir-crazy, these days it isn’t really that tough
to get through the winter. Instead, knowing how long a person has been
here tells you how much he remembers about the good old days. Alaska
changes fast, and no matter how long you’ve been here, you think the
real Alaska is what it was like when you arrived, not the pale copy that’s
here now.
Would You Tell Me about Your 
Gun/Boat/Snow Machine?
Save this question for when you have plenty of time to kill. Guns, boats,
and snow machines are essential tools for many people who spend time
outdoors in Alaska. They’re also subjects of intense interest, discussion,
and even obsession. People — mostly guys, to be honest — can talk for
hours about caliber, horsepower, and track length, discussing what they
own, how well it works, and what they dream of owning. Paying atten-
tion to the tools upon which your life depends makes sense when you’re
out in the wilderness. It’s also fun to talk about your toys.
What Do You Think of This New 
Land-Management Plan?
Politics in Alaska — at least the interesting part that isn’t just about
money — is all about land, water, wildlife, and how they should be used
or protected. The two camps — those who would save more, and those
who would use more — are both well supplied with organizations, politi-
cians, and lawyers. Because about 85 percent of the land is government-
owned (15 percent belongs to Alaska Natives and less than 1 percent is
privately owned), almost anything anyone wants to do requires a public
debate. Stating your own opinion isn’t really a good idea until you find
out the views of the person you’re talking to. These are the kinds of
issues that make people angry.
Is the Legislature Doing a Good Job?
No, the legislature is never doing a good job. In fact, you’ll discover that
the legislature is a bunch of self-dealing, bone-headed, free-spending 
buffoons who couldn’t be trusted on a cakewalk at a penny carnival.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
396

Alaskans tend to get very worked up about state politics, and elections
are often close and acrimonious. The reason for the poor results, despite
the high interest, is because the population is a bunch of lazy, spoiled,
latte-swilling newcomers (or ignorant, red-necked, pistol-toting old-
timers) who want to lock up (or bulldoze) the most beautiful place on
Earth. (You’ll have to guess which kind of Alaskan I am.)
Why Is the Capital in a City 
You Can’t Drive To?
Many people in Anchorage think the state capital should be in
Anchorage, the largest city and the one with the best transportation 
network. Many people in Fairbanks think the capital shouldn’t be in
Juneau, but they’d like it even less if it were in Anchorage, a city they
view kind of the way Canadians view the United States — big, arrogant,
and unaware. In Juneau, everyone knows that keeping the capital means 
economic survival, and the town fights off the votes that come up every
few years to move the capital (or some portion of it) with everything in
its power, making a lot of sensible arguments about the costs involved in
a move. And that’s why the capital is still in Juneau.
Where Do You Like to Go in Summer?
Never ask, “Where’s your favorite place to fish?” That’s the best way to
stop a conversation, not start one. Alaskans like to think they guard
their favorite fishing spots better than the U.S. government guards the
gold at Fort Knox. But you’ll get the same information whenever you ask
for favorite places to camp or to go to a cabin. Cities empty out on long
summer weekends. Everyone goes somewhere. Living in Alaska and
wasting those precious summer days would be nuts. And the places you
go — on the ocean, on a river somewhere, or up in the mountains — are
the places where you remember why you live in Alaska and why you
enjoy being alive on this earth. Some people may keep that sort of infor-
mation to themselves, but most love telling for the sheer joy of talking
about their special places. Chances are, in their enthusiasm, they’ll end
up telling you about their favorite fishing holes, too.
Have You Ever Encountered a Bear?
While dining with my brother’s family and his in-laws in New Jersey one
evening, I made the mistake of wondering out loud the best way to get to
a certain address in Manhattan at rush hour the next morning. The topic
stayed alive for 45 minutes. Bringing up the topic of bears at an Alaskan
dinner table works about the same way. Two problems with the topic:
Chapter 26: Ten Questions to Ask an Alaskan 397

 Everyone wants to talk, because each thinks he has the best bear
story (or five).
 After the conversation, you’ll be afraid to leave your room for the
rest of your trip.
Just remember that the information you receive this way has roughly the
same accuracy that you’d expect whenever you ask, “Have you ever lost
a really big fish?”
Here’s My Itinerary — Do You 
Have Any Suggestions?
Some of my suggested questions are silly, but this one is a good idea. No
matter how much time you spend planning, as a visitor, you’ll never be
able to know as much as the people who already live here. They’ll proba-
bly have their own little-known trails, restaurants, and shortcuts to sug-
gest. Besides, many Alaskans are travel experts, whether they want to be
or not. When you live here, you get a lot of visitors.
Why Do You Live in Alaska?
In many other places, the answer may be “This is where I was born” or
“This is where my job is.” But most people who live in Alaska have made
a conscious decision to be here. They probably moved here from some-
where else, even though living wherever they came from would have
been easier. But they’re here, and they know why, and they’re likely will-
ing to tell you. They can come out with something as prosaic as “I enjoy
hunting” or “I love the snow,” or something as eloquent as a gesture
toward a grand view of a white mountain range. After you hear those
answers and after you see the place for yourself, you may find yourself
asking, “Why don’t I live in Alaska?”

In This Chapter
 Discovering how big Alaska really is
 Finding out about mountains, earthquakes, and volcanoes
 Puzzling out Alaska’s strange government finances
 Boning up on fish, fowl, and fur
C
ommit this chapter to memory and you’ll be able to lean over to
your fellow passenger on a trip through Alaska and deliver a long
stream of informational nuggets that will amaze listeners and make you
sound like a resident — or, more likely, make your listener raise a hand
and say, “Excuse me, can I switch seats?” Call it the Cliff Clavin chapter.
(He was the know-it-all barfly on the TV series Cheers who bored every-
one to death with his encyclopedic command of dubious factoids.)
How Big Is It?
Alaska is so big that:
 If each of the roughly 600,000 residents were spaced evenly through
the state, no one would be within a mile of anyone else.
 There are a million acres for every day of the year (365 million
acres of land).
 If it were placed on top of the contiguous 48 states, it would reach
from coast to coast (if you include the Aleutian Islands).
 The span of north–south latitudes is the same as the distance from
Miami, Florida, to Bangor, Maine.
 You can fit Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom within
its borders, and still have room left over for the state of Maine.
 If its shoreline of 34,000 miles were stretched out into a straight
line, it would wrap all the way around the world, and then some.

That’s a Lot of Park
In 1980, Congress protected a block of Alaskan parks and other conser-
vation lands that, combined, are as large as the state of California, bring-
ing the total protected area to roughly the size of Texas. Alaska contains
69 percent of all the national park lands in the United States, and 85 
percent of the wildlife refuges. Alaska has 150 times more protected 
land than privately owned property. Wrangell–St. Elias National Park is
the largest of all at 13.2 million acres, more than six times larger than
Yellowstone. East of Wrangell–St. Elias is the Canadian border, where
Canada’s Kluane National Park begins, covering another 5.5 million
acres. Between the two, that’s almost as much park as the entire state 
of Maine. (Why do I keep picking on Maine?) This is why some Alaskans
get irritated when people say the state needs to be protected from 
development.
Those Mountains Are Really Tall
The top of Mount McKinley is 20,320 feet above sea level. That’s the
tallest in Alaska, and about a mile taller than California’s Mount Whitney,
which is the tallest mountain in all the other states. Moreover, McKinley
stands taller from its base to its top than any other mountain in the
world. Sure, mountains on other continents are taller in total, but they
all start off on higher ground to begin with. That’s like my seven-year-old
saying she’s taller than Daddy when she’s standing on a chair. And,
although McKinley is Alaska’s star center, it also has a deep bench. The
fact is that Mount Whitney is only the nation’s 17th tallest mountain —
the 16 tallest mountains in the United States are in Alaska.
And They’re Getting Bigger
You may think that Mount McKinley is big enough, which shows how
much you underestimate the strong Alaskan spirit! In fact, McKinley is
growing about an inch every three years. The state tourism board would
like to take responsibility, but the real reason is that the Pacific tectonic
plate (a massive slab of the Earth’s crust) is constantly crushing itself
against Alaska’s southern coast. The Alaska Range, of which McKinley 
is the star attraction, is basically a big dent caused by that massive 
collision.
The mountains of Southeast Alaska are growing fast, too, but for another
reason. There the cause is the melting of immense sheets of ice from the
last Ice Age. All that weight lifted off the land is enabling it to spring up
like a sofa cushion — about 11⁄2 inches a year in Glacier Bay.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
400

A Whole Lot of Shaking . . .
Alaska averages 50 to 100 earthquakes a day. Of course, we don’t feel
that many (Alaska is very big and most of the earthquakes are small),
but we do feel our share. To be precise, Alaska claims
 Eleven percent of the world’s earthquakes
 Fifty-two percent of all earthquakes in the United States
 Three of the ten largest earthquakes ever recorded in the world
 Ten of the 15 largest earthquakes in U.S. history
It’s all thanks to those tectonic plates bashing into each other (see the
preceding section), which is also why we have so many volcanoes. But
that’s another topic — the next one, in fact.
. . . And a Whole Lot of Spewing
Fifty of Alaska’s more than 130 volcanoes are active. That’s 80 percent of
the volcanoes in the United States, and 8 percent of all the above-water
volcanoes in the world. A look at a globe tells much of the story. The
long arc of the Aleutian Islands, stretching across the North Pacific
Ocean to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, is the northern edge of the
Pacific’s Ring of Fire (the zone where the collision of tectonic plates
causes leaks of the Earth’s internal heat in the form of volcanic erup-
tions). Eruptions are like flares at the site of the collision. Or, maybe,
they’re bigger than flares. The 1912 eruption that created the Valley of
Ten Thousand Smokes in Katmai National Park was the largest in the
20th century and was heard clearly in Juneau, more than 500 miles away.
More recently, the 1989–90 eruptions of Mount Redoubt near Anchorage
were the second most costly in U.S. history for their disruption of avia-
tion and the oil industry.
Free Money Just for Breathing
Yes, it’s true: Every man, woman, and child gets a check from the state
government just for living through the year. When the Prudhoe Bay oil
field was developed in the 1970s (the biggest ever in North America —
are you sick of the bragging yet?), it produced so much tax money for
the state that, for at least a few years, the politicians in Juneau couldn’t
spend it fast enough. (You’ll be relieved to hear they soon got over that
problem.) The voters amended the state constitution and diverted a
share of the tax money to a permanent investment account. Half the
annual income from that account is passed out in annual checks, called
Chapter 27: Ten Ways to Be an Alaska Know-It-All 401

Permanent Fund Dividends, which have risen to as much as $2,000. In
2008, when oil prices went through the roof, the state government again
found itself awash in money (thanks, American motorists — here’s look-
ing at you). Led by Governor Sarah Palin, the legislature voted to send
out more free money, adding an additional $1,200 to the $2,000. My
family of six, like Palin’s, received almost $20,000 in free money. (The
seventh member of the Palin family, baby Trig, didn’t qualify because he
wasn’t born by January 1 — you can’t give money to just anyone!)
Redefining the Word Conservative
It might come as a surprise to learn that Governor Sarah Palin’s popular-
ity in Alaska dropped from over 80 percent to around 60 percent when
she rocketed to national fame as John McCain’s running mate for the
presidency. The fact is, her national image as the “pit bull with lipstick”
didn’t look much like the Palin we knew and loved. In Alaska, Palin’s con-
servatism included the largest tax increase in state history: a levy on the
oil industry that, in a year, quadrupled what the largest oil company
paid. We liked that, because she also sent us a lot of the money she
raised (see the preceding section). As governor, Palin worked more with
Democrats in the legislature than Republicans and stuck to issues with
strong public support across the board. Seeing her on the national stage
as a tough-talking Republican campaigner registered as a personality
change for some of her non-Republican admirers in Alaska.
Catching Politically Correct Fish
Alaska’s biggest employer is the fishing industry, and the biggest catch
is the plentiful wild Pacific salmon. A fact that is universally acknowl-
edged and beyond dispute is that fresh Alaska salmon, properly pre-
pared, is the tastiest and healthiest food on Earth. You’ll have plenty of
opportunities to agree with that, because people will try to feed you
salmon every time you turn around. Unfortunately, the salmon industry
is in decline because of competition from fish farmers from other places
(fish farming is illegal in Alaska) who pawn off mushy, less flavorful, less
pure, captive salmon (at lower prices) as fresh year-round. Wild Alaska
salmon is the environmentally sustainable and politically correct choice.
Stating the Facts
If you’ve read this chapter and you still have someone sitting next to you
on the plane after spouting all the knowledge you’ve gained, don’t give
up yet. It’s time to pull out the heavy artillery:
 State bird: The willow ptarmigan, a grouse so dumb you can hunt it
with a big rock.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
402

 State fish: The king salmon, of which the biggest commercial catch
(146 lb.) and biggest sport catch (97 lb.) both came from Alaska.
 State flower: The forget-me-not. Isn’t that sweet?
 State fossil: The woolly mammoth. Quick, what’s your state’s 
official fossil?
 State insect: The mosquito. No, that would be too honest. The real
state insect is some kind of dragonfly (by vote of Alaskan school-
children), an insect that at least eats mosquitoes.
 State sport: Dog-mushing. But basketball is even more popular.

o simplify the process of finding a particular phone number or fact
quickly, I’ve collected all the details I think you may need and put
them here, in this handy directory.
Fast Facts
AAA
For roadside assistance, call % 800-222-
4357. AAA is made up of regional affiliates;
you can find yours by going to www.aaa.
com and typing in your zip code. The
Alaska branch is AAA MountainWest 
(% 800-332-6119; www.aaa-mountain
west.com).
Banks and ATMs
You can find banks and automated teller
machines (ATMs) in all but the tiniest
towns. In larger towns, every gas station
and convenience store has an ATM.
Business Hours
In the larger cities, major grocery stores
are open 24 hours a day (or almost 24
hours a day) and carry a wide range of
products (even fishing gear) in addition 
to food.
At a minimum, stores are open Monday
through Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Saturday afternoon, and they’re closed
Sunday. But many are open much longer
hours, especially during the summer.
Banks may close an hour earlier, and if
they’re open on Saturday, only in the 
morning.
Under state law, bars don’t have to close
until 5 a.m., but many communities have an
earlier closing, generally around 2 a.m.
Cellphone Coverage
The most densely populated portion of the
state and some of the paved highways
have cellphone coverage, but it’s spotty, so
don’t bet your life on being able to make a
call. In any event, if you plan to use your
phone, check with your wireless provider
to make sure it will work in Alaska and to
find out just how badly you’ll be gouged on
roaming charges. The largest provider is
an Alaska company called ACS.
Driving
Safety tips for driving on Alaska’s rural 
and seasonally icy highways are found in
Chapter 7. For updated road conditions 
and construction delays, use the Alaska
Department of Transportation’s system.
Call % 511, or go to http://511.
alaska.gov.
Emergencies
Generally, you can call % 911 for medical,
police, or fire emergencies. Remote high-
ways sometimes have gaps in 911 cover-
age, but dialing 0 generally connects you
with an operator, who can connect you to
emergency services.

Citizens Band (CB) channels 9 and 11 are
monitored for emergencies on most high-
ways, and so are channels 14 and 19 in
some areas.
Holidays
Besides the normal national holidays,
banks and state- and local-government
offices close on two state holidays:
Seward’s Day (the last Mon in Mar) and
Alaska Day (Oct 18, or the nearest Fri 
or Mon whenever the 18th falls on a 
weekend).
Hospitals
The location of local hospitals is listed in
the “Fast Facts” sections in each city
chapter or section.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information,”
later in this Quick Concierge.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
In the cities and even in the Bush, Alaska’s
population is among the most wired any-
where. Most hotels and even B&Bs have
wired or wireless broadband Internet
access, or offer public terminals for their
guests. Every public library has free
Internet access, although there may be a
wait for a computer. Internet cafes and
business centers are common. I’ve listed
handy places to get online in the “Fast
Facts” sections in each city chapter or
section.
Liquor Laws
The minimum drinking age in Alaska is 21.
Most restaurants sell beer and wine, while
a few have full bars that also serve hard
liquor. Packaged alcohol, beer, and wine
are sold only in licensed stores, not in gro-
cery stores, but these stores are common,
and you’ll find that they’re open long hours
everyday, including Sunday.
More than 100 rural communities have
laws that prohibit the importation and pos-
session of alcohol (known as being dry) or
prohibit the sale but not possession of
alcohol (known as being damp). With a few
exceptions, these laws are limited to tiny
Bush communities that are off the road
network; urban areas are all wet. Of the
communities featured in this book, Barrow
is damp and the rest are wet. Bootlegging
is a serious crime and serious bad man-
ners, so before flying into a Native village
with any alcohol, ask about the liquor law
in that community, or check a list online
(go to www.dps.state.ak.us/abc
and click on “Local Option Restrictions”).
Maps
You can buy street maps almost anywhere.
For the outdoors, I recommend the excel-
lent trail maps published by Trails
Illustrated, part of National Geographic
(% 800-962-1643; http://maps.
nationalgeographic.com/trails).
They’re available in sporting goods stores
and public-land visitor centers.
Newspapers
The state’s dominant newspaper is the
Anchorage Daily News (www.adn.com);
it’s available everywhere but isn’t always
easy to find in Southeast Alaska.
Seattle newspapers and USA Today often
are available, and in Anchorage you can
get virtually any newspaper.
Post Office
The location of the local post office is
listed in the “Fast Facts” sections in each
city chapter or section.
Restrooms
Don’t expect interstate highway rest stops.
When you find the infrequent public rest-
rooms on Alaska’s highways, they’re usu-
ally outhouses. If you require plumbing,
Appendix: Quick Concierge 405

you’ll have to wait for a roadhouse or
town. On unpaved rural highways, you
need to be ready to go in the bushes.
(Bring toilet paper and a plastic bag in
which to carry used paper for proper 
disposal.)
In the cities, finding a restroom in a hotel
lobby, shopping center, or the like is usu-
ally easy. Any business that serves food is
required to have public restrooms.
Safety
You can find tips about rural highway
safety in Chapter 7 and about outdoor
safety in Chapter 9.
As for avoiding being a victim of crime,
follow the same precautions you’d take
anywhere else when traveling. Don’t
assume that small towns don’t have crime.
Although mugging is rare in Alaska, rape is
much more common than it is nationally,
and women need to be careful. Avoid
rough bars, and don’t go out alone at night.
Smoking
In rural Alaska, smoking remains quite
common and can be hard to get away
from. Make a point of asking for an authen-
tically nonsmoking room if you want one in
a small town.
Anchorage is more in tune with the times,
and smoking isn’t allowed in any indoor
public place, including bars.
Taxes
Alaska has no state sales tax, but most
local governments have a sales tax and a
room tax on accommodations. The tax
rates are listed in the “Fast Facts” sections
in each city chapter or section. The state
and local governments and airports also
impose high car-rental taxes and fees. In
general, they’re unavoidable and should be
included in your rate quote; however, tips
for avoiding some airport fees are covered
in Chapter 7.
Telephone
All of Alaska is in area code 907. In the
Yukon Territory, the area code is 867. When
placing a toll call within the state, you must
dial 1, the area code, and the number.
Generally, hotels add large surcharges on
long-distance calls. You can often pay
much less if you use a calling card from
your home telephone provider, but make
sure to ask about fees anyway. Pay
phones often are costly to use with a call-
ing card. Usually, the least expensive and
simplest alternative is to buy a by-the-
minute phone card, available in grocery
and convenience stores.
Time Zone
Although the state geographically spans
five time zones, in the 1980s, Alaska’s
middle time zone was stretched so that
almost the entire state lies in one zone,
known as Alaska time. It’s one hour earlier
than the U.S. West Coast’s Pacific time,
four hours earlier than eastern time.
Crossing over the border from Alaska to
Canada adds an hour and puts you at the
same time as the West Coast.
Like almost everywhere in the United
States, daylight saving time is in effect
from 1 a.m. on the first Sunday in April
(turn your clocks ahead one hr.) until 2 a.m.
on the last Sunday in October (turn your
clocks back again).
Tipping
Follow the same guidelines that you’d use
anywhere else in the United States. For
information about tipping guides, fishing
charters, and wilderness lodges, see
Chapter 4.

Where to Get More Information
Alaska’s statewide visitor bureau is the Alaska Travel Industry
Association (% 907-929-2842; www.travelalaska.com), but they don’t
field inquiries from the public and you may have better luck with the
town visitor centers listed in this section. For example, the Anchorage
Convention & Visitors Bureau has staff and volunteers to respond to
individual traveler questions. For information on outdoor recreation, the
Alaska Public Lands Information Centers are centralized sources of
information on all government lands, which make up some 85 percent of
the state. The centers, in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Ketchikan, and Tok, are
operated cooperatively by many land agencies, including the National
Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service. The Anchorage center is at 605
W. 4th Ave., Suite 105 (% 907-271-2737; www.nps.gov/aplic).
