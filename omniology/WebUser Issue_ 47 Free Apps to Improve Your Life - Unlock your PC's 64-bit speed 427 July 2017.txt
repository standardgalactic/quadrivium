Need to Know
8 12 - 25 July 2017
What happened?
Another massive ransomware outbreak
disrupted companies around the world,
locking down data and demanding
Bitcoin in return for its release.
Known as Petya – or, confusingly, as
NotPetya by some researchers – the
attack appears to have started in
Ukraine and spread to 60 countries,
taking out major corporations, such as
ad giant WPP, and even shutting down a
terminal in the Port of Los Angeles. The
attack followed the WannaCry
ransomware outbreak in May, which
infected networks in more than 100
countries and knocked swathes of the
NHS offline.
Although there were some similarities
between the attacks, including the use
of an infection technique developed and
leaked by the US National Security
Agency, it now appears that Petya’s
purpose wasn’t to extract money from
victims. Instead, it may have been
designed as a distraction to conceal the
installation of further malware.
Petya doesn’t allow the attackers to
decrypt their victims’ data, which
suggests that they aren’t actually
expecting people to pay up – though
some already have. Instead, the
‘ransomware’ is being described as a
‘wiper’: a different type of malware that
destroys data rather than simply locking
it down until a ransom is paid.
Additionally, entire networks weren’t
taken offline, as happened with
WannaCry, raising the question of why
the attackers wanted a few computers
to remain unaffected. One hypothesis is
that they’re hoping to infect those
machines with a separate malware.
With the main target appearing to be
Ukraine, many fingers point to Russia as
the likely culprit, although evidence is
thin, as is usual with such incidents, and
large Russian firms including oil giant
Rosneft and gas company Gazprom
were also hit by the attack.
How will it affect you?
If you’ve been hit by this attack, there’s
no point in paying the ransom. The
email account the attackers were using
has been taken offline, and there
appears to be no way for them to
actually decrypt your data.
So, what can you do? Sadly, very little.
Ransomware is on the rise and battling
it requires forward planning. Ensure
your operating system and software are
up to date, run antivirus and always
have backups of important data.
WannaCry and Petya both use a flaw
that’s since been patched by Microsoft,
but that’s no guarantee against future
infection. The malware was spread via
legitimate government accounting
software through its real update system.
Sometimes, there’s nothing you can do
to stay safe; but if you have backups of
your data, you can wipe your machine
and continue unaffected.
If this attack has frightened or
concerned you, use that as motivation
to set up backups. And if you already
have them in place, test your system to
ensure you can easily recover your
backed-up data.
What do we think?
It’s one thing to be targeted by criminals
hoping to make a quick buck out of
holding our data hostage – or the myriad
other ways hackers extract money from
victims – but it’s harder to protect
against these new attacks, which are the
digital equivalent of being caught in the
crossfire between warring nations.
The exploit that allowed this Petya
attack to happen was developed by the
NSA to use in matters of national
interest. The details were leaked, and
are now being used against Ukraine as
weapons, like stolen missiles or guns.
This means security is getting harder
for all of us. These are sophisticated
attacks, not kids making mischief or
criminal gangs after an easy payday,
and their apparent success means we
should expect to see more of them.
Consider Petya a shot across the
bows. You’ve been warned that
protecting your data is becoming
increasingly vital, so run your updates
and back up all your important files and
documents. You might not be the target
of attacks such as Petya, but that
doesn’t mean you won’t be a victim.
Not again! Petya ransomware
attack wreaks global havoc
The Petya attackers are more interested in
wiping data than extorting money

Need to Know
What
happened?
The anti-piracy
group FACT
(Federation
Against
Copyright
Theft) says its
investigations
could soon
target buyers
of ‘fully loaded’
Kodi boxes.
So far, the Kodi
crackdown has targeted
the people selling these
boxes, but FACT says the
net is widening and anyone
found using illegal add-ons
may now be threatened
with fines and even prison
sentences.
The comments come
from Kieron Sharp, the
chief executive of FACT,
who says an investigation
against Kodi-box owners
will be launched “in the
very near future”. Sharp
told the Independent:
“What we’ve been looking
at in conjunction with many
of our clients and members
are the different levels of
crime being committed.
We’ll also be looking at – at
some point – end users
[because] they are
committing criminal
offences”.
A ruling by the European
Court of Justice in April
said that the use of media
players to stream
copyrighted content would
be considered a criminal
activity, whereas previously
it was only illegal to
download the content. It
also ruled that the sale of
Kodi boxes preloaded with
software capable of
Kodi users could face
prison sentences
accessing copyrighted
content was illegal.
How will it affect you?
FACT clearly means
business in clamping down
on the use of illegal
add-ons, but if you only
use Kodi to stream content
legally, then you’ve got
nothing to worry about.
However, anyone buying
a fully loaded Kodi box
needs to be aware that
they could face a custodial
sentence if they get
caught. Sentencing for
copyright infringement has
become more severe since
the Digital Economy Act
was introduced earlier this
year, so watch out!
What do we think?
People who use Kodi to
stream subscription
content for free must know
that they’re breaking the
law, but FACT’s threat to
pursue users as well as
sellers makes the risk even
greater. There are plenty of
legal uses for Kodi, and
hundreds of official
add-ons to try, so it would
be a shame if piracy
ultimately ruins the
software for everyone.
What happened?
Google will stop reading
your messages in Gmail
to personalise its
advertising, the company
has confirmed. Previously,
Google analysed the
content of emails sent and
received for behavioural
advertising purposes –
which is why a message
about a holiday or wedding
can suddenly spark a slew
of very specific ads.
This change in policy is
believed to be an attempt
to appease corporate
customers. Gmail is free for
individuals, but companies
pay for the webmail service
as part of Google’s
cloud-based collection of
productivity tools, G Suite.
Messages sent in corporate
Gmail aren’t scanned for
advertising, but some
companies believed
differently and weren’t
happy about it. To avoid
such confusion, Google has
dropped email scanning
for everyone.
How will it affect you?
If you’re a Gmail user,
Google will not look at the
content of your emails –
you may be alarmed to
learn that it had that power
previously. However, that
doesn’t mean behavioural
Google finally stops
scanning your emails
advertising is being
ditched, because Google
will use personalisation
data across its other
services, based on your
account settings.
If you want to turn off
behavioural advertising, go
to My Account (myaccount
.google.com) and under
‘Personal info & privacy’,
click Ads Settings. You can
turn off advertising
personalisation entirely,
or select topics you’d like
to see or prefer to avoid
– and see Google’s guess
at your gender and age,
which is sometimes
amusingly incorrect.
What do we think?
We’re amazed that the
scanning of emails for
advertising purposes has
lasted as long as it has –
if such a system was rolled
out now, there’d be uproar!
We’d either grown
accustomed to the
corporate giant reading
our messages or failed to
realise it was doing so.
Admittedly, “read” only
means a machine looking
for keywords to serve ads,
but it just shows how easy
it is to give up our right
to privacy. Hopefully,
we won’t give in so easily
next time.

OnePlus 5
oneplus.net/uk/5
The long-awaited OnePlus 5 is finally
on sale, with prices starting at £450
from the OnePlus
website. But is the
company’s latest and
greatest ‘flagship killer’
(a phone that has all or
most of the features of
a high-end phone but
costs less) worth your
hard-earned money?
The OnePlus 5 is a
5.5in smartphone with
an AMOLED 1,920x1,080
screen and a dual-lens
camera. The aluminium
unibody design offers a
handful of distinguishing
features: a dual-lens
screen set to 170cd/m2 brightness and
Flight mode switched on, the OnePlus
5 lasted 20hrs and 40mins. That’s
more than twice as long as Sony’s XZ
Premium. What’s more, the phone
charges incredibly quickly, thanks to
the included Dash Charge 3 charger.
The rear snapper, made in
collaboration with DxO Labs, features
a 16-megapixel main camera and
a 20-megapixel telephoto camera.
These work together to produce some
of the best shots we’ve seen on a
device of this price. Only the camera’s
HDR mode failed to impress.
The OnePlus 5 is the best
smartphone the company has ever
produced, but we wouldn’t be
surprised if the price rise – up to
£449 from £399 for the OnePlus
3T – eats into its dominance
among mid-range phones.
What happened?
The European Commission has fined
Google ¤2.4bn (£2.1bn) for abusing its
search dominance to disadvantage
online shopping rivals. The
complainants in the long-running case
allege that Google promoted its own
shopping services above independent
alternatives, hitting their traffic by 85%
in the UK. “What Google has done is
illegal under EU antitrust rules,” said EC
competition commissioner, Margrethe
Vestager. “It denied European
consumers a genuine choice of services
and the full benefits of innovation.”
Although the fine is a record from the
EC for ‘antitrust’ issues, it amounts to
just 2.5% of the web giant’s annual
revenue, and Google could have been
hit with a punishment of up to 10%.
The fine is based on Google’s
comparison shopping revenue from
13 countries, and the company could be
liable for further fines of ¤10.6m
(£9.3m) a day if it doesn’t resolve the
situation within 90 days. Google has
denied the EC’s findings and says it is
reviewing the ruling before deciding
whether to appeal.
How will it affect you?
If Google doesn’t appeal against the
decision, the search results you see
when shopping online will change. At
the moment, if you search for a specific
Google fined €2.4bn by EU watchdog
product, you’re likely to see a Google
carousel of different online stores.
That’s likely to disappear in favour of
other shopping options, to appease
European regulators.
This isn’t the only case before the EC.
Google also faces an investigation into
claims that its AdSense advertising
products limit consumer choice, while
a third case involves the inclusion of
Google services such as search in
Android, which the EC says is unfair.
What do we think?
This long-running case may not yet be
over, depending on whether Google
decides to fight back with an appeal,
but it’s safe to say that Vestager isn’t
winning any fans in Silicon Valley. She’s
already been accused of anti-American
sentiment for targeting corporate
dominance, but European consumers
should applaud her. Vestager is willing
to stand up to the web giants in a way
we haven’t seen before in the name of
consumer rights rather than corporate
cash or power. Tech firms, wherever
they’re from, shouldn’t be allowed to
ride roughshod over local laws, and it’s
good to have at least one regulator
watching closely to ensure they don’t.
We’ll take a closer look at the
darker, greedier side of Google in
next issue’s cover feature, and will
be recommending products and
services you can use instead.
camera that protrudes from the back,
a ‘do not disturb’ switch on the left edge
and a 3.5mm headset jack and USB-C
port. Like its predecessor, it also has a
central fingerprint scanner.
Qualcomm’s latest
2.45GHz Snapdragon 835
processor makes the
OnePlus 5 a near-perfect
multi-tasker, with a generous
6GB or 8GB of RAM and
storage options starting at
64GB. In fact, it performs
almost identically to the
Samsung Galaxy S8 and the
HTC U11, both of which are
much more expensive.
A long battery life is often
a priority when choosing a
phone, and the OnePlus 5
doesn’t disappoint. In our

Dog owners can usually tell when their pets need to relieve
themselves, but not when they’re in another room. Pellet
solves this problem by letting your pooch alert you
electronically when it wants to go to the toilet, rather than barking, whining or
scratching at the door. When your dog presses the Pellet with its paw or nose, it
sends a notification over Wi-Fi to your phone or smart TV, so you can let it out.
There are Pellets for both indoors and out, for when your dog has finished and
wants to come back in. The creator hopes to raise £22,500 by 26 July.
Google hasn’t officially revealed
its codename for Android O, but
reports suggest it may be
‘Oatmeal Cookie’. Past versions
of the mobile operating system
have been named after desserts
and other sweet treats, and
references to ‘oc.dev’ spotted
in Android 8’s source code point
to Oatmeal Cookie as the most
likely candidate.
Of course, ‘oc’ could stand for
another dessert, but the latest
find came after other sharp-eyed
Google fans noticed references
to “oatmeal_cookie” in slides shown off
at Google’s IO developer conference
in May. Google staff could even be
leaking a false name to throw us off the
scent, and Android 8 may actually be
called Oreo, Orange Juice or Ovaltine.
The real codename doesn’t actually
matter because the new operating
system will be officially known by its
release number, but that doesn’t stop
the speculation over the name that
usually precedes an update. Previous
releases were codenamed KitKat,
Lollipop and Nougat, while earlier
names include Eclair and Froyo (frozen
yogurt). Google usually sets up an
Android character at its headquarters
themed around the dessert of choice.
Whatever the OS is called, Android O
could start rolling out as early as
August, according to some sources.
Google’s own Pixel and Nexus phones
Will Android O be called
Oatmeal Cookie?
What’s new on Kickstarter
Our favourite new project on the crowdfunding site
are likely to receive the update first,
and Google’s new ‘Project Treble’
initiative should mean that users with
devices from other manufacturers
won’t have to wait as long to get it as
with previous versions.
WEBOMETER
LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
There hasn’t been an Android
release with a crunchy-sounding
codename since Gingerbread
(2.3) – the last two were the soft
Marshmallow and chewy Nougat,
so we reckon Oatmeal Cookie is a
definite possibility, even if it
doesn’t sound like a particularly
tasty or exciting treat.

Q
What’s the best
way to avoid
ransomware
such as Petya
(see page 8)?
Rhys Ball, Twitter
A
After your PC gets
infected with
ransomware, it will
wait for about an hour until
Gov.uk breach exposes
user data
The Government Digital
Service (GDS) has told
users to change their
passwords following
a security breach affecting its
website Data.gov.uk. During a routine
security review, GDS found that
a clutch of usernames and email
addresses had been left on a publicly
accessible system.
A spokesperson for the Cabinet
Office said: “During a routine review
of Data.gov.uk, it was discovered that
a file containing some users’ names,
emails and hashed passwords was
publicly accessible on a third-party
system”. The hashed passwords
mean they’re scrambled and
therefore harder to crack.
Data.gov.uk provides information
published by government
departments and agencies, public
bodies and local authorities. The data
it reboots. This reboot is
required for the malware to
encrypt your system. In some
cases, shutting down your
PC disrupts the encryption
process and your data can be
saved. For this reason, you
should power down as soon
as you see any suspicious
pop-ups. If you see a Check
Disk message, quickly turn
off your PC to stop your files
being encrypted by the
ransomware.
Ransomware developers
often try to trick you into
clicking pop-ups displaying
malware warnings. Close any
that appear with a keyboard
command or via your taskbar.
To avoid ransomware in
the first place, always install
the latest security updates.
These often contain patches
for the latest vulnerabilities.
Don’t open anything
suspicious you receive via
email. Delete dubious emails
purporting to be from your
bank, ISP or credit card
company, and don’t click
links or attachments in emails
you’re not expecting. Never
give your personal details –
if asked – via email.
Back up your important
data to an alternate device
and keep it unplugged and
stored away.
Finally, use a VPN for
additional safety, to
protect you against
malware that targets online
access points. That’s
especially relevant when
using a public hotspot.
However, keep in mind that
although a VPN stops
malware from spreading
while it’s connected, it
cannot protect you from
downloading the malware
in the first place. So
although a VPN encrypts
your activity online, you
should be vigilant when
downloading and opening
files and clicking links.

The spokesperson added that the breach
was very recently discovered and action
was taken as soon as possible to notify
users and the UK’s data watchdog, the
Information Commissioner’s Office. The
breach affects users who signed up to
Data.gov.uk on or before 20 June 2015.

HMS Queen Elizabeth ‘runs on
vulnerable XP’
Britain’s newest aircraft carrier, the
£3.5bn HMS Queen Elizabeth, appears to
be running the outdated Windows XP
operating system, and is likely to be
vulnerable to the same style of cyber-
attack that hit the NHS. The HMS Queen
Elizabeth, Britain’s largest ever vessel, is
the culmination of a nearly decade-long
project to build two new aircraft carriers.
However, an extraordinary discovery was
made during a tour of the warship,
as photos published by The Telegraph
taken inside a control room onboard
seemed to show computer screens
displaying a Windows XP login screen.
Officers on board the aircraft carrier
said that there are teams of cyber-
specialists onboard to deal with any
security threats against its systems.
Mark Deller, commander on the Queen
Elizabeth, told the Guardian: “I would
say compared to the NHS buying
computers off the shelf, I would think
we are probably better than that. If you
think more NASA and less NHS, you
are probably in the right place.”

Google News
news.google.co.uk
Google News has been given a much-
needed redesign, which has made a
world of difference. It’s now far less
cluttered, with a card-based interface
that keeps related news stories grouped
neatly together. The menu in the
left-hand column is much clearer, too,
and you can customise it with sections of
your own. We love the way the top
navigation bar offers headlines, local
news and stories based on your interests.
The prominent keyword tags are also
welcome, both on the homepage, where
they flag up trending topics, and within
the story cards, to provide greater depth.
The video player is also much improved.
Happy Beds
www.happybeds.co.uk
One downside to buying a bed online
is that you can’t test whether it’s
comfortable or not, so Happy Beds tries
to give you as much information as
possible. Each mattress is accompanied
by a list of features and a firmness rating,
and you can specify how many will be
sleeping in the bed and their weight. The
site provides videos, images, precise
dimensions and honest customer
reviews. The best part is the interactive
bed builder, which lets you customise
your bed and see it created before your
eyes. With mattress guides, sleep advice
and an FAQ, it has everything covered.

Product Recall
productrecall.campaign.gov.uk
Faulty products can put your health and even your life at risk, but keeping up with
product recalls usually entails watching out for easily missed announcements. This
government website brings together new and past announcements about product
recalls, so you can check all your household appliances and other electrical products,
as well as food and drink, vehicles, medicines and international alerts. Most sections
link to specific sites, such as the Food Standards Agency, and the hub itself is
comprehensive, well designed and easy to use. Be sure to check out the registration
section – that way, you’ll be able to receive recall notifications by email or post.

Bagel Factory

Feeling peckish and fancy a bagel?
One look at this site and you will be. Its
pages are filled with appetising photos
of bagels bursting with tasty-looking
ingredients and, to entice you further,
there’s a 10% discount for first orders.
We like the way the menu section
is neatly divided into vegetarian,
breakfast, lunch and vegan options, and
we were impressed that each bagel’s
entry lists vital nutritional facts as well
as ingredients. If you’re near a Bagel
Factory shop, you can even place an
order for delivery or have your bagels
delivered to you by bike using Uber Eats.
Yahoo Mail

your mouse over an image icon for an
instant preview. With less clutter,
colourful themes, access to animated

Onefootball
www.onefootball.com
This site’s goal is to cover football in
as many ways as possible. It kicks off
with lots of news articles, and also
delivers podcasts, scorelines, tweets
and plenty of mobile apps. Onefootball
is arranged like a blog, with story after
story in a series of boxes, some larger
than others. Clicking these opens the
articles, which are interspersed with
images and usually rounded off with
a video, podcast links and suggested
stories. Use the search facility if you’re
only interested in news about your club
or a particular competition. Otherwise,
you need to select tags on each
article to access specific sections.
Joejack Entertainment
www.joejackentertainment.co.uk
Joejack Entertainment is a London-
based production company created by
award-winning film and TV director John
Deery. The site includes a list of feature
films that are either finished or in
production, as well as Joejack’s latest
news. Although the site offers brief
descriptions of the films and links to the
official movie sites and press releases
where available, it’s low on interactivity.
You can’t click most of the films that are
in development, and the news section
has few entries. There are only two
trailers, too, and the site uses a
background of annoying flashing lights.
We were less than star-struck by it.

Next Day Hardware

and other electronic gear. It also
promises to hunt for items you can’t
find, with links to its various social-media
accounts. Many of the product shots
are low-res, but everything is well
described and the ordering system is
fluid. You can leave your own reviews
and make product comparisons, but it’s
not perfect. The menus need reordering
(clicking the Computers menu brings
up Computers in the sub-menu), the
Twitter link has an error, Home Security
is empty and there are spelling mistakes.

Google tweaks testing tool
Google has updated its mobile
speed testing tool (bit.ly/test427),
which times how long your site
takes to download on phones and
tablets, and offers advice based
on its results. The new version
estimates the number of mobile
visitors you may be losing
(apparently, mobile users only
wait seven seconds for a website
to appear) and how your speed
compares to other sites offering
similar content. Speed isn’t
everything but if you stay on top
of your site’s download speed,
you won’t lose potential visitors
unnecessarily.
Which WordPress to choose?
If you want to start a new website,
most people will recommend you
use WordPress, but there are two
versions so which do you choose?
WordPress.org is the one you have
to install on a server via a paid-for
web host, though most now offer
a one-click installation service or
do it for you. WordPress.com is
hosted by WordPress, so all you
need to do is make an account.
The hosted ‘.org’ version is a lot
more flexible and customisable
than the ‘.com’ version, but if
you’re still not sure, WPBeginner
has a very useful breakdown of
the differences at bit.ly/wp427.

Q
I want to sell stuff via a website
and have been advised to go
‘omnichannel’. How do I do this?
Ben Farrow, via email
A
Omnichannel or multi-channel
means being able to sell your
products across numerous sales
channels, such as your website, online
marketplaces, in store, on social media and
on the phone. This increases your chance of
a sale and offers maximum convenience for
the shopper to research goods in one way,
and purchase or collect them using another.
For even the smallest online shop, offering
more sales channels ensures you are
relevant to more customers. Look for an
ecommerce platform that allows you to
oversee multiple channels with ease.

W
hen Microsoft
announced
Windows 10 S,
saying it would only run apps
that can be downloaded
from the Windows 10 Store,
everyone jumped to the
conclusion that this would be
a cut-down operating
system. The logical
extrapolation was that
Windows 10 S laptops would
also be low-powered
versions, similar to the
Chromebooks that run
Google’s Chrome OS, which
can cost less than £200.
Microsoft
Surface Laptop
It’s something of a
surprise, then, that the
Surface Laptop – Microsoft’s
first PC to come with
Windows S preinstalled –
costs just shy of £1,000.
It appears that Microsoft
isn’t looking to muscle in on
Chromebook territory at all,
that 10 S will launch faster and
run more efficiently, but that’s
mainly because it’s relatively
locked down, not because
it needs less power to run.
Frankly, this is a
disappointing development.
Rather than offering
something fundamentally
different with Windows 10 S,
Microsoft has stripped away
the wealth of software choice
associated with Windows PCs.
That flexibility was crucial to
the market-leading position of
Windows PCs, and removing
it seems like a mistake.
Microsoft’s new laptop aims
to marry the familiarity
of Windows with the
locked-down security of
a Chromebook – but the
price leaves us baffled
or at least not by rivalling the
ubiquitous cheap models.

is that Windows 10 S is

Microsoft has surprised us
by coupling an expensive
laptop with a stripped-back
operating system. Windows
S stops you from installing
anything that isn’t available
in the Windows Store, which
may improve security but
vastly reduces choice and,
as a result, removes one of
Windows’ core strengths.
We suspect many people
will immediately replace the
OS with Windows 10 Pro.
The laptop itself is
powerful and sleek, but
there are some great rival
laptops available at that
price, including the
superlative and larger-
screened Dell XPS 15.
Acer Chromebook R11,
£209.99
bit.ly/acer427
Dell XPS 15, £1,148.99
bit.ly/dell427
We understand that
Microsoft will be able to better
control PC security if you can
only download software from
its Store, but even if this
walled garden ends up
blossoming in the future, right
now it feels more like a prison.
If you don’t get on with
Windows 10 S on the Surface
Laptop, you have until the
end of the year to upgrade to
Windows 10 Pro for free. We
suspect that this is exactly
what most people will do, not
least because the Surface
Laptop is more than capable
of running it.
Build and specifications
The Surface Laptop itself has
a high-end, sleek design.
If you’ve coveted Apple’s
svelte MacBook Air laptops,
you’ll love the way this looks.
It has clean aluminium edges
and rounded corners, and is
seriously skinny to boot,
measuring 14.5mm at its
thickest edge and tapering to
9.5mm at its thinnest. The
super-slim 13.5in 2,256 x
1,504-resolution touchscreen
measures a mere 3mm, and
the whole laptop weighs only
1.2kg. You start to get an idea
of why it’s so expensive.
Internally, the basic model
comes with an Intel Core
i5-7200U, 4GB of memory
and 128GB of SSD storage.
This will set you back £979
(bit.ly/surlap427). If you want
the top-end model (Core i7,
16GB of memory and 512GB
SSD), you’ll be spending up to
£2,149 (bit.ly/surtop427).
This may seem wildly
expensive compared to most
Chromebooks, but the basic
version isn’t actually that far
off its ultraportable rivals: the
13in MacBook Air costs £949,
with the Pro version costing
from £1,249; Dell’s wonderful
XPS 13 range starts at £1,149;
and the sleek Asus ZenBook 3
is around £1,000.
As with most laptops, and
ultraportables in particular,
physical connectivity is
somewhat limited. It has
a solitary USB 3 port on the
left-hand edge, accompanied
by a mini-DisplayPort and
3.5mm headset jack. On the
right-hand edge, there’s
a magnetic charging port
for the proprietary charger.
And that’s your lot.
Bizarrely there’s not even
a USB Type-C port in
evidence. If you crave more
ports, you can buy a matching
dock but that’ll set you back
another £190.
Top-end touches,
performance and power
Open the lid, and the
keyboard surround really
draws the eye. It’s coated in
Alcantara fabric (the same
fabric coating used in
high-end sports car
dashboards, steering wheels
and bucket seats) and it’s one
of the Surface Laptop’s
fanciest features. It’s also
hardier than you might
expect, treated to resist spills,
stains and moisture
absorption, and it wipes clean
remarkably successfully.
Sadly, the keyboard itself isn’t
spill-resistant, but it is a joy to
type on. The touchpad is
generously sized, too.
Historically, Microsoft’s
displays have been up there
with the very best, and the
Surface Laptop’s follows the
trend, capable of displaying
95.6% of Microsoft’s own
sRGB colour standard. It’s
bright enough for use in most
environments, with a
maximum brightness of
397cd/m2, while its 1,490:1
contrast ratio offers up
punchy, solid-looking images.
We had to upgrade the
laptop to Windows 10 Pro to
run our benchmark tests on it,
but we’d recommend doing
this anyway, rather than
sticking with 10 S. The
resulting overall score of 49 in
our demanding 4K tests is
unexpectedly high. You’d
expect a device this skinny to
buckle under the pressure,
but that’s not the case. For
comparison, last year’s
Surface Pro 4 reached a score
of 44, while the Surface Book
lagged not too far behind at
43. This is Microsoft’s fastest
laptop yet, and we only had
the basic £979 model to test.
Even more impressive is the
Surface Laptop’s battery life.
Lasting 10 hours and
42 minutes in our continuous
video-playback test (with
the screen set to 170cd/m2
brightness and Flight mode
engaged), it’s one of the
longest-lasting Windows
laptops we’ve come across
in recent times, and will
comfortably get you through
a day’s use.

the camera, which has been
boosted from 8 megapixels in
cheap, the Smart N8 looks
and feels far from it, with
a textured rear cover and
beautifully crafted edges.
However, with a thickness of
8.6mm and weight of 151g, it’s
both thicker and heavier than
the Prime 7, which measures
8mm and weighs 128g.
At the front of the phone,
there’s a front-facing
5-megapixel camera, an
unusual front-facing flash and
a surprisingly good-sounding
speaker. The N8 comes with
a 3.5mm headphone jack and
a micro-USB port for charging
and data transfer. On the
back, there’s a fingerprint
reader, which provides a quick
and secure way to unlock
your phone.
The 5in HD (720 x 1,280
pixels) IPS display is relatively
bright (374cd/m2) but isn’t
in the top echelon of phone
screens, and you might have
trouble viewing it in really
bright, sunlit conditions.
The Smart N8 is powered by
a 1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek
MT6737 processor with 1.5GB
of memory. Compared with
even cheaper phones, such as
the Prime 7, the N8 comes out
better on paper but we found
using it in the real world felt
about the same: sluggish,
though no worse than we’d
expect for the price. You
won’t have any problems
running casual games such as
Candy Crush and Pokémon
Go, but don’t expect it to
manage smooth gameplay on
more sophisticated games
such as Asphalt 8.
Unfortunately, the phone’s
battery life is poor. In our
video-playback test, the N8
lasted just 8hrs 44mins, which
means it will struggle to last
a full day on a single charge.
By comparison, the Smart
the Prime 7 to 13 megapixels.
Performance, especially in
HDR mode, is impressive for a
sub-£100 smartphone and we
found it offered good colour
reproduction, good results in
low light and our test snaps
were bursting with detail.
Alongside the regular camera
and video modes, there are
360-panorama, time-lapse
and video-snapshot modes.

paper, the N8 looks like
a significant upgrade with
a better processor, Android 7

and a vastly improved
camera, but it’s a tad more

Linux before, don’t worry because Tails
is not too dissimilar to older versions of
Windows, and offers a straightforward
Desktop environment.
If you plan to install and run Tails
on a USB flash drive, you will need two
memory sticks with capacities of at
least 4GB – one of which you use to set
up an intermediary version of Tails that
lets you install the full OS on the second
drive. You can’t currently install the OS
directly from Windows. Alternatively,
you can download Tails in ISO format
and burn this straight to DVD.
The Amnesiac Incognito Live System
– Tails, for short – is a privacy-focused
live Linux operating system that you can
boot into from a DVD, USB memory
stick or SD card. This versatile free OS
can hide who and where you are;
encrypt your files, emails and instant-
messaging chats; and protect you from
malware threats. NSA whistleblower
Edward Snowden is a big fan, for
obvious reasons!
The latest version of Tails is based on
the Debian 9 (Stretch) Linux operating
system and features a new startup and
shutdown, a more polished Desktop,
numerous security improvements and
major upgrades to much of the bundled

AES Protect keeps your personal files safe
from prying eyes by securing them using
strong AES encryption, which we discussed in
last issue’s Essential Guide to Encryption.
The portable tool is only 32KB in size, but
offers three programs – AES Protect
(encrypts single files), AES Metal (a more
advanced option) and AES Command
(a command-line tool). AES Protect is very
easy to use – just select the file to encrypt and
enter a name and folder to save the secure
version to. Enter a passphrase twice, click
Start and the file will be encrypted. To unlock
it, select the file, switch Encrypt to Decrypt
and enter the passphrase again.
Videos that you capture using your
smartphone’s camera can sometimes display
incorrectly – either upside down or sideways.
You can fix this problem by importing the file
into a video editor, but using an advanced
tool to fix such a simple problem might seem
like overkill.
Free Video Rotator rotates your clips in
90-degree steps. To use it, just load your
video and click the Clockwise Rotation button
until the clip looks right (the program only
displays the first frame but this should be
enough for you to check the orientation).
Enter an output location, then click Start to
save the corrected movie.
Calibre is a brilliant free program for managing

changes and support for all the major
hardware readers. This latest release of the
software introduces support for high-res
displays; and Calibre’s content server, which
lets you access books over a network, has been
completely rewritten. The program can now
convert ebooks directly to Microsoft’s Word
DOCX format, which is a welcome addition for
reading files in office software.

Experience a web without
net neutrality
You’ll probably notice that this issue has
a bit of theme, with our FAQ on page 36
and Barry’s column on page 74 both
addressing the topic of net neutrality,
and how dreadful the web would be
without it. You can see for yourself
using a new Chrome extension called
Removal of Net Neutrality (bit.ly/
neutrality427), which demonstrates the
full horror of an internet controlled and
shaped by the government and ISPs.
You’ll find your connection slowed
by throttling; favourite sites blocked
in favour of sponsored alternatives;
search boxes obstructed; and other
annoyances that stop you enjoying a fair
and free web in which all data is treated
equally. Although the add-on is
designed to educate US web users
about net neutrality, there’s no
guarantee the UK won’t fall prey to
these same anti-competitive and unfair
online practices.
As we reported in last issue’s
What’s New Online, Twitter has
undergone a major redesign
that makes it look cleaner,
bolder and bubblier – with
square profile pictures replaced
by round ones. Naturally, some
Twitter users aren’t happy
about the changes and have
been threatening to quit the
site, stage protests in the street
and cry into their pillows
forever, which is where Twitter Debubbler (bit.ly/

Decorate your new tabs

an animal-themed add-on in this

reintroduce the trend with an
ape-ealing, simian-themed extension
called Monkey Wallpapers (bit.ly/

photos of adorable primates every
time you
open a
new tab,
or you
can choose a monkey image to set
as your default. The page also
provides the time and weather
forecast for your location; a large
search box that lets you choose
between Google, Bing and Yahoo;
and links to further monkey pictures
and GIFs on Facebook, Twitter and
Tumblr. Our tabs gave us
orangutans, ring-tailed lemurs,
baboons, gorillas and many more –
it’s enough to drive you bananas!
Spruce up Gmail messages
using templates
Gmail’s simple, minimalist interface is
one of its biggest strengths, but it can
also make your emails look rather plain
– especially if you’re wishing someone a
happy birthday or congratulating them
on successful corrective-eye surgery.
You can make your salutations a little
more interesting by installing Gmail
Email Templates (bit.ly/templates427),
which transforms your messages using
colourful, attractive templates tailored
for specific types of recipient and
occasion. For example, you can send
party invitations, legal letters and job
applications; and import newsletter
templates from MailChimp (mailchimp

Skip YouTube ads without
cheating creators
Few of us enjoy sitting through
adverts before YouTube videos, but
we understand that without them
creators wouldn’t be able to offer
their content for free. Still, some ads
are way too loud and drag on for
ages, which is why we have no qualms
in promoting a new “ethical ad
skipper” for Firefox and Chrome
called YouTube Auto Ad Skipper
(bit.ly/skipper427). This ensures that
video creators earn ad revenue from
their hard work by only skipping ads after 30 seconds - the minimum length of
time for a creator to get paid. Additionally, the sound is muted as soon as an ad
begins and unmuted when the video starts playing. If that doesn’t sound tough
enough, then you’re better off blocking all YouTube ads using Adblock Plus or
uBlock Origin – but on your conscience be it, pal!
Merge all open Firefox
windows into one
It’s reasonably easy to keep track of all
your open tabs when they’re in a single
Firefox window, but things get more
confusing when you have several open
tabs spread across
multiple windows.
The new add-on
Merge Windows
(bit.ly/merge427)
provides an easy
solution by allowing
you to – you
guessed it – merge
every open window
into a single one,
so all your tabs are
neatly grouped side by side. Simply
right-click anywhere and choose ‘Merge
all windows’ to bring them together.
Alternatively, you can drag tabs
individually from one window to another,
but using the add-on is much faster.
Check how many days
between two dates
If you’re impatient to know how long
you have to wait before you head off on
holiday or until you celebrate your
birthday, then you need a simple but
useful add-on called Date Diff Finder
(bit.ly/date427), which tells you the
precise number of days between two
Customise your
Start page more
easily
One of the most welcome
changes in Opera’s recent
revamp (see our workshop in
Issue 424) is the ability to
customise your Speed Dial start
page with attractive wallpapers
and sidebar shortcuts. The latest
version of the browser (46)
makes things even easier by
adding a dedicated button for
changing the look of the page.
Simply click the three-line
‘Customise start page’ button in
the top-right corner to choose
and apply
your preferred
wallpaper,
enable
Opera’s new
dark theme,
select which
shortcuts to display in the
sidebar and turn Speed Dial
suggestions on or off. If only
Chrome and Firefox offered
similar flexibility.
Try the latest
extensions for Edge
We’ve often scoffed at
the lack of extensions for
Microsoft’s Edge browser, but
we’re not scoffing now because
no fewer than five new
extensions have been added to
the Windows Store. However,
only one of these is likely to have
mass appeal and that’s Enhancer
for YouTube, which adds useful
new features to the video site
(much like our workshop on
page 54).

SYSTEM CLEANER
ES Disk Analyzer
bit.ly/esdisk427

Hard-drive housekeeping
is second nature for a
computer user, and this
new app from the maker
of ES File Explorer aims to
encourage a similar habit
with your phone and tablet.
High time, too. If you’ve
shopped for a new Android
phone lately, you’ll have
noticed that expansion
slots – normally microSD
– are disappearing.
Manufacturers say it’s
because SD cards
compromise performance
and “confuse” users;
others say it’s because
manufacturers want to cut costs. Whatever the true reason,
expandable storage is on its way out, leaving you to make
the most of the space you’ve got.
One way to do this is to keep large media files off your
device. But backing up and streaming costs data, and
leaves you without photos to show to friends. So ES Disk
Analyzer – or DiskAnalysis, to quote its display name –
offers a compromise, at least for photos, by shrinking them
to a third of their size. Before using this ‘Image
compression’ tool (see our Mini Workshop, right), back up
the originals using a service such as Google Photos.
Then there’s the hidden junk – the caches and duplicate
files that seem to grow out of nowhere. ES Disk Analyzer
has a one-tap duplicate cleaner that judges duplicates by
exact contents rather than file
names – a crucial distinction.
It also lets you clear caches with
a couple of taps, and lets you
back up then uninstall ‘Rarely
used apps’.
The app is easy to use, fast and
small (just over 5MB), and it’s
certainly worth installing. But
we’d have liked to see options
for removing temporary files and
app leftovers. You may be able
to clear this stuff manually using
the app’s built-in file
manager, but these
space hogs could
do with their own
one-tap sections.

Web giants including Amazon and Netflix are fighting to save the web
from political and corporate interference. David Crookes explains all
Our guide to net neutrality
What is it?
Net neutrality is the concept that all
online traffic should be treated equally
whether it’s an email, a social-media post,
a voice call, a shopping purchase or
a YouTube video. It effectively means
web access without restriction and
discrimination, and it ensures that the
internet remains free and open – not only
by preventing broadband providers from
blocking content but by stopping
companies paying more to benefit from
faster data delivery. It is currently under
threat in the US and some of the biggest
names in tech are trying to save it.
Does the UK have net neutrality?
Yes, at the moment. For just over a year,
the EU has banned the blocking,
throttling and discrimination of online
content, applications and services. This
means that ISPs are not allowed to
restrict or make it difficult to access
a service, and it prevents them from
slowing down certain traffic to the
detriment of any other. They are also
prevented from prioritising, for example,
Netflix over BBC iPlayer or My5, which
means that one piece of data can’t
overtake another piece of data to get to
its destination more quickly.
But are there exceptions?
There certainly are. When net neutrality
was enshrined in EU law last April, it
included several exceptions. For example,
ISPs are able to manage traffic if they are
legally obliged to, so if a court orders
that certain content has to be blocked,
then that must be acted on. Internet
providers can also interfere with the flow
of data if it makes the network more
secure or to avoid congestion at specific
times. What they can’t do, however, is
slow down Spotify, for instance, while
allowing Apple Music to continue
unaffected, because equivalent
categories of traffic – in this case, music
streaming – must be treated equally.
Does the US have net neutrality
laws, too?
Yes, it does. In 2015, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC)
ruled in favour of net neutrality, changing
the classification of a broadband provider
from “information provider” to “common
carrier” (which means it carries traffic
without discrimination and interference).
The new Open Internet rules treat the
internet as a public utility and, as in the
EU, ISPs are prevented from throttling
or blocking content online. But the
situation is changing and the FCC is
already looking to reverse the rules.
What would scrapping net
neutrality achieve?
It would allow network owners to
produce ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ lanes on the
internet. By paying extra to ISPs, major
services such as Google, Facebook and
Amazon would be able to move around
the internet faster than those services
that pay less or nothing at all.
So why doesn’t the FCC want net
neutrality?

Chairman of the FCC by President

Everything you need to know about the most
interesting new technology trends and events

HOW NET NEUTRALITY COULD AFFECT YOU
12 - 25 July 2017 37
Discuss net neutrality at forum.webuser.co.uk
Net neutrality
Donald Trump, believes enforcing net
neutrality has slowed consumer access
to faster broadband connections and
reduced investment in network
expansion. He is backed by US cable
companies who want the freedom to
grant preferential
treatment to selected
content. They say
innovation has
been stifled and
that the amount
of money put
into broadband
has fallen by as
much as 3%.
Pai favours
“voluntary”
compliance with
the net-neutrality
rules that state
there should be
no discrimination, blocking or paid
prioritisation. This would leave ISPs that
don’t want to volunteer for compliance
free to cash in on deals with services
willing to pay for prioritised traffic. US
networks Comcast and Verizon have said
they need to charge some companies
more to help tackle congested traffic.
What do the supporters of net
neutrality say about this?
As you’d expect, they are up in arms,
fearing that ISPs will try to interfere in
content delivery. A record four million
public comments were posted ahead
of the introduction of the Open Internet
rules and its backers are not going down
without a fight. They want the same
speeds for all data and they want all legal
content treated equally. Certainly, they
are opposed to any moves that would
allow ISPs to set up fast lanes that give
paying content providers better speeds
and prioritisation. They argue that rolling
back the Open Internet rules impedes
innovation and that ISPs rather than
users will end up determining which
companies win and lose. It’s rather telling
that more than 800 internet-based
startups have signed an open letter
against the move.
But what are the big tech
companies doing about it?
Some of the internet’s largest companies
made 12 July their ‘Day of Action’ protest
(www.battleforthenet.com/july12). Those
involved included Amazon, Kickstarter,
Reddit, GitHub, Etsy, Mozilla, Netflix,
BitTorrent and Vimeo together with the
American Civil Liberties Union, American
Library Association Center for Media
Justice, Demand Progress, MoveOn,
Greenpeace and Organizing For Action.
It’s not surprising to see such opposition
given the level of protests against
similarly restrictive bills five years ago.
Back then, more than 50,000 websites
blacked out their homepages for a period
of 12 hours.
Will net neutrality win again?
It’s hard to tell because Pai appears
determined to see it overturned (we’d
rather see an overturned pie). In May, the
FCC voted two to one in favour of an
order to eliminate net-neutrality rules,
but it still has to go through the current
period of comment and a final vote in a
month or two. A good number of
senators are also against the repealing of
net-neutrality rules and have signed an
open letter published on TechCrunch
(bit.ly/techcrunch427). “President
Trump’s FCC is threatening to take away
your ability to have free and open use of
the internet,” they wrote.
Will Brexit affect net neutrality
in the UK?
The current plan for Brexit is that the
Great Repeal Bill will repatriate EU law
into British law when we leave the
European Union. But that doesn’t prevent
laws from being repealed later. Ofcom
is a member of the Body of European
Regulators for Electronic
Communications (Berec), which oversees
the net-neutrality rules for the EU.
It could decide to set out its own
guidelines if it ceases to be a member.
However, that would mean companies
that operate in both the EU and UK
markets would face different rules,
which could prove confusing.
• See Barry’s column on page 74 to read
his views on the threat to net neutrality.
Extra costs
The big internet companies would – reluctantly –
pay for access to the “fast lane” but the extra costs
involved could end up being passed on to consumers.
Services such as Netflix may have to spread the
burden on American customers by increasing
subscriptions globally.
Less choice
Smaller companies in the “slow lane” may find they don’t attract enough users
and so they may not expand to these shores in the way we’d hope. New startups
will be affected because the cost of providing an optimum service will rise.
Blocked content
If one company – let’s choose Spotify as an example
– pays an ISP a fortune, then removing restrictions
that prevent broadband providers from
discriminating could see rivals restricted or even
blocked, and that would inevitably have a knock-on
effect worldwide.
A tiered internet
Although changes across the pond won’t water down the EU’s net-neutrality
laws, it’s still scary to hear suggestions that ISPs may seek to offer basic internet
packages limited to certain content, with charges for wider use.
If net neutrality is overturned in the US, it could have some
wide-ranging, long-term consequences for all web users
Lots of big websites support net neutrality,
including Amazon, Reddit and Pornhub

by securely storing your messages in

What we liked:
At some
point in
Pixlr’s
history, its
developers
decided that
you can’t have
everything in one program.
Hence, this simple-to-use
image editor that’s stuffed
with enough features to
keep experienced photo-
tweakers happy is split down the middle
to provide two free tools, each catering
for different demands.
The Express version (left-hand screen
grab, above) has an app-like feel that
wouldn’t look out of place on a tablet or
phone. It’s designed for quick image
tweaks such as crops, rotations and
adjustments to brightness and colour,
and lets you add fripperies like stickers
and borders, though these are
admittedly a bit naff. You’ll find stacks
of similar online tools elsewhere but
Pixlr Express is good at what it does.
Where Pixlr really shines, however,
is in its Editor version (right-hand screen
grab, above). If you’ve used Photoshop
Elements or Paint.net, Pixlr Editor will
look and feel familiar, and it’s made
no compromises in the transition from
installed software to web-based app.
Run it full-screen and you wouldn’t
know you were in a browser.
The standout feature is that it provides
layers and masks, so you can make
changes to specific areas of your image
and easily undo them. This is something
that serious users of software image
editors lean on heavily, and Pixlr Editor
is the only online image editor we found
that comes close to providing such
expert functionality for free.
How it can be improved:
Our only gripe was with Pixlr’s design.
On the one hand, it looks modern and
is packed with features, including
a bank of easily accessed toolbars.
The advanced tools are organised in
a set of menus across the top of the
screen, but the Times New Roman font
they use looks old-fashioned. Pixlr also
includes ads, though they’re relatively
unobtrusive, especially if you’re using
a large, high-resolution screen.
OUR VERDICT
Pixlr Editor is a sophisticated image-
editing tool that rivals the software
you install on your PC. Pixlr Express
works well for quick fixes, but the
Editor version provides superior
power and a range of tools that
beat anything else in this test.
You don’t have to leave your
browser (or pay!) to edit
your photos. Andy Shaw

What we liked:
Photoshop Express is
a free online editor with
a very familiar look and
feel, and is the best
looking of all the editors
we tested. It has a wide
range of well-designed tools
in an attractive and intuitive interface
that uses familiar Adobe icons and even
provides a short text description of
each tool. The toolbar is split into Edit
and Decorate sections using tab-like
buttons at the top. Edit includes
everything from cropping to pixelation,
while Decorate covers elements you can
add in, such as text, speech bubbles
and a small collection of frivolities
such as balloons and cartoon animals.
Compared to the full version of
installable software such as Photoshop
(or even Photoshop Elements), this
online editor feels heavily pruned.
However, the core features are present
and correct, including some useful
context-specific tools such as red-eye
and skin-blemish removal.
Despite its limited features,
Photoshop Express has no locked-down
What we liked:
LunaPic mimics the design
of installed software by
providing a menu across
the top of its working area
and a bank of icons down
the left-hand side. At first
glance, its layout looks similar
to Gold Award-winning Pixlr, but in
most other ways it feels more like
a website than an app. Options for
specific tools pop up above your image
and when you make changes to an
image, the entire page appears
to reload.
As Web User forum member
lizzygraham mentions in Readers
Helpdesk on page 70, LunaPic has
a lot of filters and doesn’t nag you
to upgrade to a paid-for version.
Unfortunately, it hosts obtrusive adverts
that can detract from your images while
you’re editing them.
How it can be improved:
The toolbar is unconventionally
organised, with icons for tools such as
Save and Print positioned in the middle,
wedged between the various drawing
tools for shape-drawing and freehand
design. This is typical of the LunaPic
software design as a whole, which is
powerful and loaded with useful tools
but doesn’t seem to have had much
thought applied to its layout.
tools that you can’t access, so at least
you can use everything that’s available.
How it can be improved:
There’s no option to select areas of a
photo and split it into layers, so it’s only
suitable for casual editing. Annoyingly,
it also only lets you edit JPEG files.
OUR VERDICT
Photoshop Express is a little short
on tools compared to our other
award winners, but you know what
you’re getting and aren’t taunted by
locked tools. It looks good and is
great for performing quick edits
if you don’t want to have to launch
a Windows image-editing tool.
OUR VERDICT
LunaPic has more features than any
of the other image-editing tools we
tested but the clunky design means
they’re listed by name in one of its
very long drop-down menus. What
it gains in power, it loses in ease of
use and general finesse.
Polarr
photoeditor.polarr.co
Polarr is all about filters and it has
loads to play with, though not
as many
in its free
version as
LunaPic
has.
However,
if the
latter’s
ugly interface puts you off, Polarr is
vastly better looking. There is a
paid-for version available, so some
of its tools are locked, which can be
frustrating, but there’s still plenty to
play with before you have to pay.
Fotor
www.fotor.com
Fotor has a clever interface that lets
you have more than one photo open
for editing at a time – just switch
between them using the thumbnail
bar on the right. It has loads of tools
you can experiment with, but some
are locked unless you pay for the
full version, which can be
frustrating. Also, the free version
is surrounded by adverts, which
isn’t unusual on a website but is
distracting when you’re trying to
edit an image, particularly when the
ads are animated and flashing.
Aviary
www.aviary.com
Aviary was once a brilliant photo
editor but it’s now owned by Adobe
and hasn’t seen much love of late,
left to limp along behind more
sophisticated tools. There’s no
paid-for
option, so
it doesn’t
tantalise
you with
tools you
can’t
access, as
other
programs with paid-for upgrades
often do – but its options and tools
are rather limited overall.

Upgrade to 64-bit
Windows 10
Many programs and apps
are 32-bit, but 64-bit
software tends to be faster and more
secure, and makes better use of
available system memory. A 32-bit
program will run on both 32-bit and
64-bit systems; but 64-bit software
requires you to have a compatible
64-bit processor and operating system
to get the most from the extra power it
offers. There are numerous benefits in
doing so, including support for more
memory (see this issue’s Weekend
Project on page 58 for tips on
upgrading your PC’s memory).
You can easily check if you’re running
64-bit Windows 10 by typing about
into the search box and selecting ‘About
your PC’. Next to System Type, it should
say ‘64-bit operating system, x64-based
processor’. If it says ‘32-bit operating
system, x64-based processor’ that
(unsurprisingly) means that your PC is
running a 32-bit version of Windows on
a 64-bit processor.
Unfortunately, there isn’t a direct
upgrade path from the 32-bit version to
the 64-bit one, so the only solution is to
perform a clean install of Windows 10.
Download and run the Windows 10
Media Creation Tool (bit.ly/
win10mct427). Choose to create
installation media for another PC and
make sure you select 64-bit as the
architecture type. You can write the
installer to a USB flash drive or save it
as an ISO file for burning to DVD. Fully
back up your PC (everything will be
overwritten, so this is a vital step), then
boot into the flash drive/DVD and start
the installation process. If you previously
had a 32-bit version of Windows 10,
you won’t need to enter a product key.
When asked what type of installation
you want, select ‘Custom: Install
Windows only (advanced)’. Select and
delete the system partitions and follow
the installation instructions. When it
finishes, go to Settings, ‘Update &
security’, Windows Update to get the
latest updates and drivers. If your PC is
a little old, it may not have compatible
64-bit device drivers for all your

why to make the move from 32-bit to 64-bit software without losing
any data or settings
hardware, in which case you will need to
get those from the relevant product
manufacturers.
Switch to a 64-bit
browser
Upgrading to a 64-bit
version of your web
browser makes a lot of sense because
you’ll benefit from improved speed and
security, and are less likely to encounter
memory problems.
There are 64-bit versions of both
Chrome and Firefox available and when
you download a new browser, the
correct build should automatically
install on your computer (provided
you’re running a 64-bit operating
system). However, if you’re currently
using a 32-bit browser or have older
plugins installed, you may need to
manually update it to 64-bit. Thankfully,
the process is very straightforward and
you won’t lose any user data, such as
passwords or bookmarks.
In the case of Chrome, click the
three-dot button in the top-right corner
and open the Settings menu. Click
About and you’ll see which version
Switch to

software
Check to see if you have 64-bit Windows
and a compatible processor
Make sure you’re running the latest 64-bit
version of Chrome
To upgrade to 64-bit Windows, you’ll
need to perform a clean reinstall

Switch to 64-bit
Discuss 64-bit software at forum.webuser.co.uk
12 - 25 July 2017 49
you’re running and whether it’s 64-bit or
not – Chrome may even update itself to
the latest release while you are here. If it
doesn’t say you have a 64-bit build, go
to the Chrome download page (bit.ly/
chromedl427) to get the latest version.
The download box should say ‘For
Windows 10/8.1/8/7 64-bit’. Install it to
upgrade your current browser, with all
your data and settings left intact.
Firefox users can check if
they have the 64-bit version
by clicking the three-line
‘hamburger’ button and
clicking the Help question mark at the
bottom. Click About Firefox and you’ll
see either ‘(32-bit)’ or ‘(64-bit)’ next to
the version number. To upgrade the
browser, go to the Firefox download
page (bit.ly/ffdl427) and click the
‘Firefox For Other Platforms &
Languages’ link. Click the Windows
64-bit link in the box and when the
download completes, install it. Again,
you won’t lose any existing settings.
There’s also a third-party
dedicated 64-bit version of
Firefox called Waterfox
(www.waterfoxproject.org)
which has been optimised for speed so
it may be faster than Firefox itself on
older computers. Likewise, Pale Moon
– which was originally based on Firefox
– has a 64-bit version that you can
download from bit.ly/pale427.
Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 is
64-bit only, while Internet Explorer is
available in both 32- and 64-bit
downloads.
Change to 64-bit
Office
The 32-bit version of Office
is automatically installed
unless you select the 64-bit version at
the beginning of the installation
process. You can check which version of
Microsoft Office you’re running by
opening Word and going to File,
Account, About Word. If it’s the 32-bit
version, you will need to first uninstall
your existing copy of Office, then
reinstall it, this time selecting ‘Office
– 64-bit’ under Version in the ‘Language
and Install Options’ box.
Download other 64-bit
programs
Before downloading a new piece of
software, check to see if there is a
64-bit version available. The download
site may automatically detect that you
are running a 64-bit OS and present you
with the correct option.
Some downloads include both 32-bit
and 64-bit versions and you need to
select the correct one during the
installation process. In other cases,
you need to select the correct
download option from the website.
For example, when you go to the
download page for the popular ebook
manager Calibre (bit.ly/cali427, see
page 28) you are presented with options
for Windows, MacOS and Linux, a
portable version and, finally, the
Windows 64-bit version. Try to get in
the habit of looking for 64-bit builds.
It’s worth checking all your installed
programs – or at least the most
frequently used ones – and replacing
32-bit versions with 64-bit ones
wherever possible. You’ll definitely
notice the benefit of doing this.
Try the new
64-bit Kodi
The MacOS, Linux and
Android versions of Kodi
have been 64-bit for a while, but the
developers of the popular media player
have only just now begun the transition
on Windows. Kodi 18 ‘Leia’ will be the
first 64-bit compatible build for
Microsoft’s operating system, and
although that isn’t officially available
yet, you can try it now by installing
a ‘nightly’ developers’ version from
bit.ly/kodi427. Be sure to grab the latest
download from the top of the list.
You should be aware that because
Leia is pre-release software, certain
third-party packages and add-ons won’t
run on it – at least for the moment.
When Apple introduced the iPhone
5S four years ago, it was noteworthy
for being the first mobile device
powered by a 64-bit system on
a chip (SoC) processor. Other
companies have since followed suit
and introduced 64-bit devices of
their own. If you have an iPhone 5S
or newer (not 5S), it will be 64-bit.
To check an Android phone, install
the AnTuTu Benchmark app (bit
.ly/antu427), open it and tap the
‘Info’ tab at the bottom. Look
for the Android entry and it will
tell you if you’re running the
32- or 64-bit version of Google’s
mobile operating system.
If you see a message on iOS
warning you that a particular app
might slow down your iPhone, it’s
because that app is 32-bit. The bad
news is that unless the developer
updates the app, it won’t even run in
the forthcoming iOS 11 because
Apple is dropping support for
non-64-bit apps in the new OS.

S
ketchUp, the 3D scene-creating
software that used to be owned by
Google, has just launched a web
version that saves you having to
download and install any software.
Creating detailed 3D models sounds like
a complicated and skilled process, but
my.SketchUp makes it easy. You just lay
down a flat geometric shape, then push
or pull it to add a third dimension. You
can add other forms to your construction
and use tools to reshape them. You can
also import existing 3D models and
adapt them for your own purposes.
It’s entirely free, and your creations can
be saved in the cloud, so you can pick up
where you left off on any computer
using any web browser.
Create 3D models and scenes
online with my.SketchUp
5
Use the Eraser tool 1 to remove lines
and sides, and colour in some or all
of your objects using the Paint tool. 2
You can Create curves with the Arc tool
3 and check sizes with the Dimensions
tool. 4 The Walk and Orbit tools 5 let
you explore your scene in different ways.
1
Launch my.SketchUp to load the
workspace. The man 1 is there to
give you an idea of scale, and can be
deleted. The strip of tools on the left 2
contains everything you need to get
started. To produce your first 3D shape,
select the Rectangle tool 3 and draw
a 2D rectangle in the space. 4
2
You can change the measurements
of the shape by entering real-world
dimensions in the box. 1 To turn the 2D
object into a 3D one, select the Push/Pull
tool, 2 then select Push/Pull from the
options. 3 Click the shape and drag
upwards until you reach the height
you require. 4
3
You can change the height, width
or length of the box by hovering your
mouse over the side you want to adjust,
then clicking and dragging. Click the
Rectangle tool again and select another
shape. 1 Draw that on the first box and
use the Push/Pull tool 2 to change it
as required.
This free web-based 3D-modelling tool lets you
save creations in the cloud. Here’s how to use it
4
Fully select an object by drawing
a rectangle around it with the Select
tool, 1 then use the Move tool 2 to move
the item elsewhere. The Move tool can
also slant objects and turn flat roofs into
apex ones. Use the Line tool 3 to draw
a bisecting line, then pull it upwards. 4

The add-on that makes
YouTube even better
2
You can turn the volume up or down by scrolling the
wheel on your mouse. If you use a laptop and don’t have
a mouse wheel, you might prefer to choose the option
‘By holding right mouse button and moving mouse’, 1 which
better suits a trackpad. Below this, you can fine-tune how the
volume of a video is displayed. 2
1
Install Magic Actions, making sure to click Skip when you’re
offered an additional extension during setup (unless you
actually want it). Click Settings 1 and, on the web page
that loads, scroll down to view the extension’s Options window.
This is where you control most of the settings. ‘Instant control
over volume’ is enabled by default.
3
AutoHD is also enabled by default. 1 You can change
this and set YouTube to play videos at your screen’s
resolution, 2 whenever possible. Alternatively, if you have
a slow internet connection and find your videos sometimes
pause, you can choose a lower resolution so the video streams
more smoothly.
4
The next entry in the Options menu lets you ‘Hide Ads’. 1
Below this is ‘Enable Multi-Range Looper’, which is ticked
by default. 2 This lets you select one or more sections
of a video to play on an endless loop. We show you how to
do this in Step 9.
M
agic Actions brings an impressive range of powerful
features to YouTube, adding a bar of buttons across the
bottom of the video panel to give you one-click access
to Night mode, Cinema mode, colour filters and more. You can also
capture still images from video frames and play segments of
a video on a continuous loop with the Multi-Range Looper.
In this Workshop, we show you how to take advantage of these
features and also how to configure Magic Actions’ Options menu
to hide ads, stop autoplay and strip out YouTube elements you don’t
want to see, such as related videos and comments. Once you’ve
configured the settings to suit your preferences, you can export
them for safekeeping and to use on another PC.
For the purpose of this Workshop, we’ve used Chrome,
but Magic Actions is also compatible with Opera and Firefox.

Another option enabled by default is Cinema, which lets
you view videos with the ‘Magic Backlight’. We show you
how to adjust this in Step 7. Below this, you can enable
handy options such as Stop Autoplay; 1 Speed Booster, 2
which makes clips load more quickly; and Auto-hide Player
Controls, 3 to hide video controls when a clip starts playing.
6
Ticking the box for Hide Page Elements 1 lets you opt to
hide specific features including Header, Footer, ‘Related
videos’, 2 ‘Video description’ and Comments. There’s no
need to save your configuration but when you’re happy with
the setup, you can export your settings by scrolling down and
selecting the appropriate button.
7
Load a YouTube video and you’ll see a strip of new
buttons that belong to Magic Actions. The Settings cog
loads the Options page where you made your
customisations and clicking the film strip next to it enables
Cinema mode. In Cinema mode, click the top-right icon 1
to choose a backlight colour.
8
Click anywhere outside the video to disable Cinema
mode. In the top-left corner, you’ll see a light-switch icon
that lets you enable or disable the dark-themed Night
mode. 1 To add a colour filter to the video, click the filter
button 2 until you find a suitable option.
10
Clicking the camera icon lets you capture a still
image of the current frame. After clicking the button,
a new tab loads showing the dimensions of the
image and its file size. 1 You can choose up to two filters 2
and set the image quality 3 and format 4 before clicking
Save. 5
9
To set a section of the video to loop, move the red dot
to an appropriate starting point on the timeline, then
right-click to mark an end position. A green line appears,
indicating your selection. 1 You can add multiple segments
in this way. Right-clicking a loop deletes it.

Don’t wait until you’ve lost your phone to set up Android
Device Manager because it will be too late! Tracking must
be enabled for the app to work, so open Settings, then tap
Google and Security. From this menu, tap Android Device
Manager and check that both ‘Remotely locate this device’
and ‘Allow remote lock and erase’ are enabled. 1
2
Should you misplace your
phone, ask a friend if you
can install Find My Device
on their Android phone or
tablet. Open the app, tap the
option to ‘Sign in as guest’, 1
then enter your email address
or phone number before
tapping Next. Now enter your
password and tap Sign In.
3
Find My Device shows the
location of your device
on a map 1 and displays
a summary of its location,
battery percentage and Wi-Fi
status. 2 To update the location
of your device, tap the
appropriate button. 3
4
If you know that your
device is somewhere
nearby but you’re not
sure exactly where, tap Play
Sound. 1 This plays a sound
loudly for five minutes, even if
your device is set to silent or
vibrate. When you find your
phone, you can stop the sound
by pressing its power button.
5
If you still can’t find your phone, use the Lock option to
protect your data. Your phone may already have a screen
lock, but Find My Device’s Lock option lets you add a
message of up to 100 characters 1 and a phone number 2
(don’t use the number of the device you’ve lost). If someone
finds your device, they can use this info to return it to you.
6
Only use the Erase option
1 if your phone is
irretrievably lost or has
been stolen, and you’re sure
you want to permanently erase
all its data. After using this
option, you’ll be unable to use
Find My Device again with
your phone.
Find your phone from another Android device
A
ndroid Device Manager has been renamed Find My
Device and updated to include handy tools that let you
check your phone’s Wi-Fi and battery status as well as
its location. In this Workshop, we show you how to find, lock
and erase the contents of your phone
using another Android smartphone
or tablet, in the event that you lose it
or discover that it’s been stolen.

Use mouse gestures to navigate the web
G
estures are a great way of streamlining your browsing.
Rather than having to use precision mouse clicks to
access fiddly buttons and menu options, you can enter
commands simply by moving your mouse in a certain way.
SmartUp Gestures is a Chrome add-on
(bit.ly/sm427) that now works in Firefox,
too. We’re using Firefox here, but it works
in both browsers.

1
When you install the add-on, its icon appears in the
Toolbar. 1 Gestures will start working straight away,
but only on the current tab and any subsequent tabs
you open, so if you want to use it on any previous tabs,
you’ll have to restart the browser and reload them.
2
To make a gesture, hold down the right mouse button
and draw a shape on the screen. A line appears as you
draw. 1 If you’ve created a shape that the add-on can
understand, a description appears. 2
3
There are lots of commands you can use. To see what’s
available, click the icon and choose Options. 1 Click
Mouse Gestures, then Actions. 2 Hover your mouse
over one of the actions to see the direction in which you
need to move your mouse. 3
4
If your mouse has a middle button, you can use this
instead of the right-hand one. In Options, click Mouse
Gestures, then Settings. 1 Select Middle Button from
the ‘Operating mode’ menu. 2 You can set the Shift, Control
or Alt key to temporarily disable gestures. 3
5
You can customise gestures and create your own. In
Options, select Mouse Gestures, then Actions. You can
edit existing gestures 1 or click the ‘+’ button 2 to add
your own. Draw the gesture, choose the action from the
drop-down list 3 and click Save. 4
6
Some settings in the software are switched off by
default but they’re worth exploring. From Options,
choose General, then ‘Features ON’. 1 For example, if
your mouse has a wheel or a rocker, you can assign basic left,
right, up and down gestures to it. 2

You can see at a glance the speed
of your RAM, the number of memory
sockets in use inside your PC, the form
factor (DIMM, for example) and the
amount of memory being reserved by
hardware. The graph on the left side
shows the percentage of memory that is
currently in use. This detail is important
because if it’s too high, your PC is likely
to experience problems.
How to...
Upgrade your PC memory
Wayne Williams shows you how to find out whether you have
enough memory in your PC, and how to upgrade it
Gather information
It’s very easy to check how much
memory there is inside your computer,
and you don’t even need to open the
case. On a PC running Windows, you just
press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Task
Manager, then click the Performance tab
and select Memory on the left-hand side.
This will show you the amount of
memory you have installed, as well as
how much is currently in use and how

I
f your PC is starting to feel a little
slow, and a thorough spring clean
hasn’t fixed the problem, it could
be down to a lack of memory. If you
only have 4GB (or less) installed, your
system may be struggling to cope,
even if it’s only carrying out low-
impact tasks such as browsing the
web or using office software.
In this Weekend Project, we look at
the best ways to find out whether your
PC is running out of memory, and if
adding to it or replacing it could give
your computer the necessary boost.
We also show you how to find out
what type of memory you need and
how much you can add, and guide you

Depending on your computer and the
software you’re running, if you’re using
70% (or more) of your installed memory,
then you are in danger of slowdowns,
freezes and crashes. This threshold is
even more pronounced in PCs with
limited memory.
If you’re wondering exactly what’s
hogging your PC’s memory, there are two
ways to find out. You can either click the
Processes tab at the top of the Task
Manager and explore the Memory
column; or open the Memory section
under Performance in the Task Manager
and click the ‘Open resource monitor’ link
at the bottom. In the new window that
opens, click the Memory tab to get a
detailed display of how much memory is
in use, and what is using it.
The good news is there’s a very simple
way to speed up a computer that’s
currently using more than 70% of its
memory, and that’s to restart it.
Obviously don’t do this if you’re in the
middle of some important work!

PassMark RAMMon (bit.ly/ramm427)
scans your PC and provides data
about your installed memory. The
summary at the top 1 shows the
number of ‘memory devices’ (RAM
modules), as well as the total amount
of physical memory, the amount of
available memory and the current load
percentage.
2
Look below to see detailed
information for each memory slot
(if the memory is all the same, the
details should be identical in each
column). You can see the memory type
and its speed, 1 the capacity of the
module, 2 and the manufacturer. 3

The software even tells you when
the RAM was manufactured 1 and

clipboard or write it to a file. 4
tabs you previously had open will
reappear, but your browser won’t be
using as much memory as before.
Upgrade your memory
If you don’t have at least 8GB of memory
– which is really the minimum amount
you need these days – and you’re often
at or above the 70% in-use threshold,
then you need to perform an upgrade.
However, not every computer is receptive
to an upgrade. Most desktop PCs are

Another option is to close the
programs that are using the most
memory – this will often include your
web browser. If you’ve got a lot of tabs
open in your browser that you don’t want
to lose, click the Processes tab in Task
Manager, select your browser in the
Name column and click ‘End task’. This
closes the browser and frees up some
memory. Launch the browser again and

MINI WORKSHOP | How to install more memory
upgradeable, but not all laptops are.
There are other restrictions to bear in
mind – you’re limited by the number of
free memory slots (unless you plan to
scrap and replace all the existing memory
and start afresh), and the version of
Windows you’re running.
The 32-bit versions of Windows 7, 8
and 10 can only recognise a maximum of
4GB (and use a total of around 3.5GB) of
memory. The 64-bit Home Premium
edition of Windows 7 can use up to 16GB,
while the Professional and Ultimate
editions can access up to 192GB. The
64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and
Education editions support up to 2TB of
memory, but the 64-bit version of
Windows 10 Home is limited to 128GB.
Upgrading to a different version of
Windows may allow you to install more
memory, but bear in mind you will only
be able to run a 64-bit edition of
the operating system if your
PC has a 64-bit processor.
If you’re not sure which
version of Windows you’re
running, press Windows+i,
then choose System
and About. See our feature on
page 48 for more on this topic.
Which memory to buy
You need to buy memory that’s
compatible with your PC. If yours
uses DDR3 RAM (DDR stands for
Double Data Rate), don’t buy DDR4
because it won’t fit. If you’re adding
(rather than replacing) memory, you
need to make sure the speed of the new
modules matches that of your existing
ones. Although mixing and matching
different speeds won’t cause any harm,
your installed RAM will only run at the
slowest rate of all your installed modules.
Bear in mind that not all memory is
created equal. You don’t need to spend a
fortune on branded products but if you
are replacing (rather than adding to) the
memory in your PC, make sure you get
all the modules from the same supplier to
avoid potential problems. Two of the best
memory suppliers are Crucial (bit.ly/
cruc427) and Kingston (bit.ly/kin427).
The Crucial System Scanner (bit.ly/
crucss427) will tell you the type of
memory your system is using and the
type you need to buy. However, you have
to buy your memory from Crucial.
We show you how to install memory in
our Mini Workshop, below.
Upgrade laptop memory
Adding more memory to a portable PC is
much the same as installing it in a
standard computer, but getting into a
laptop can be tricky. Some devices, like
Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop (see our
review on page 20), are sealed with glue,
and the supplied memory is soldered into
place so it can’t be replaced.
If you can open your laptop without
damaging it, it’s likely there will only be
the one RAM slot, in which case you will
need to replace your existing memory
module with a single, higher-capacity
one. Laptop memory is different from
desktop memory so make sure you buy
the correct type.

search box. Click ‘Choose which apps
can run in the background’.
All the Windows 10 apps are listed,
with on/off switches next to them,
which determine whether they can run.
Alarms & Clock, Calendar and a few
others are obviously useful, but apps
like Candy Crush Saga
don’t need to run in the
background, so switch
them off.
Pick a power plan
Windows power plans
consist of configuration
settings that determine
how your PC’s
components function.
Some components have
two or more modes,
each of which consumes
a different amount of
power; other
components are variable
and can operate at
a range of different
speeds – the processor,
for example, varies its
speed according to the amount of
work it has to do.
You can change to a different
power plan when your PC needs
a performance boost or if you need
to reduce power consumption to
make the battery last longer. Open
the Control Panel and open Power
Options. If necessary, click ‘Show
additional plans’ to see them all.
Selecting ‘Power saver’ reduces
battery drain so you can work for
longer when you don’t have access to
a mains plug. It works by limiting the
performance of the CPU and other
components, which affects some
but not all software.

While you’re sunning yourself by the pool
for two weeks, your laptop’s battery will
be idle, and it’s important to leave it in
a healthy state to avoid causing
permanent damage.
It’s tempting to charge the battery to
100% just before you head off but this
isn’t actually ideal. Charge it to 100%,
then use it and run down the battery to
about 50-70%. Don’t just close the lid of
the laptop because it might only go into
sleep mode and drain the battery. Instead,
power it off and pull out the power cable
before you put it away.
Prepare your battery before going on holiday

More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
select the ‘High performance’ power
plan to set all the hardware components
to maximum speed. This uses
considerably more power and the
battery drains faster, but certain
activities, such as fast action games,
will only run properly in this mode.
Calibrate the battery
Click the battery icon in the taskbar
to see the percentage charge and the
time remaining. This gauge can become
wildly inaccurate over time, shutting
down while still at 20% or even 30%
charge, or with an hour or more power
remaining. To solve this, you need to
recalibrate the battery so that the
percentage displayed accurately
indicates your battery’s status.
The simplest method is to charge the
battery to 100%, then unplug the power.
Use the computer until it shuts down,
then leave it for an hour or so and
charge it back up to 100%.
Alternative battery calibration
If your laptop still shuts down while
showing more than 10% charge, the
calibration hasn’t worked and you
should try this next method. Charge the
battery to 100%, then open Power
Options in the Control Panel and click
‘Create a power plan’ on the left. Name
it whatever you like and click Next. Set
the display to never turn off and the
computer to never sleep when running
on the battery. Click Create and select
the plan, then close the Control Panel.
Use the laptop as you would normally
on battery power until it shuts down.
Plug in the power cable and charge it
up. It should now be calibrated. You can
now return to Power Options and set
your preferences for the display to turn
off and computer to sleep.
Reset the battery
Resetting the battery can fix problems
and calibrate it at the same time. Try
powering off the laptop, then hold down
the power button for 10 to 15 seconds.
This doesn’t work with all laptops, but
it’s worth trying.
If you have an older Lenovo laptop,
plug in the power cable and charge it up.
Go to Power Manager, select the Battery
tab, then click Battery Maintenance and
the Perform Reset button.
If your Lenovo laptop is a more recent
model, run Energy Management and
click the gear icon. Click the Start
button next to Battery Gauge Reset.
You need to connect to the mains
power and close all applications before
you click the Continue button.
You should be aware that this takes
several hours to run.
Delete the driver
Some battery problems can be cured
by deleting the current driver and
replacing it with a new one. Click the
search box on or next to the Start
button and type device manager.
Click to open it and expand the
Batteries section to view the items.
Right-click anything named ‘Microsoft
ACPI-...’ and select ‘Uninstall device’.
Now restart your computer to make
Windows install the default driver.
Customise the power plan
Once you’ve picked a power plan (see
tip on opposite page), you can tweak
its settings. Open the Control Panel,
open Power Options and click the
‘Change plan settings’ link next to a
power plan. On the next screen, click
‘Change advanced power settings’.
Expand each section to see two
options: ‘On battery’ and ‘Plugged in’.
Click the setting next to ‘On battery’
for a menu or an input box where you
can type
a value to
customise
the setting.
Select
the ‘Power
saver’ plan
and go
through
each
section,
setting the
maximum
power
savings for
each item. For example, expand
‘Processor power management’ and
‘Maximum processor state’. Set it to
50% so that the CPU only runs at half
speed when you’re using the battery.
This will slow down your PC but also
makes considerable power savings so
the battery will last longer.
Test the battery
Some laptops have their own
diagnostic software for testing the
battery. If you have an HP laptop,
for instance, switch it on and press
the F2 key several times. The HP PC
Hardware Diagnostics UEFI utility
appears. Using the up/down arrow
keys, select Component Tests and
press Enter. Select Battery in the next
menu, then Run Now.
If the results of the test show that
the battery is working fine, go back
through the menus and quit. If a
problem with the battery is found,
a repair and calibrate test will run.
This could take a couple of hours or
more, so only run this when you don’t
need your computer for a while.
Get a battery report
Click the Search box on or next to the
Start button and type command
prompt. Right-click Command Prompt
and click ‘Run as administrator’. Type
powercfg /batteryreport in the
command window and press Enter.
The report is created and saved to the
hard drive at the location shown.
Open Explorer, go to the folder and
double-click the file to view it.
In the ‘Installed batteries’ section,
you’ll see numbers for Design
Capacity and Full Charge Capacity.
The Full Charge Capacity reduces
over time as your battery wears out.
By comparing the two, you can see
how much capacity has been lost.
Use Windows Calculator to divide the
full charge capacity by the design
capacity, then multiply by 100. This
tells you the percentage charge the
battery can hold. When it falls below
80%, you should consider replacing
the battery.
Test your Chromebook
If you have a Chromebook, press
Ctrl+Alt+T to open the terminal
window and type battery_test.
This displays a brief battery-health
report showing the current charge
and health as a percentage. When the
health falls below 80%, you should
consider replacing the battery.
To get more information, type
chrome://power into the browser’s
address bar and press Enter. Find
Battery Charge and, next to it, click
Show. This displays the battery
discharge rate as a chart.

Solve PDF page-count
problem
Q
I recently downloaded a 711-page
book in PDF format. When I tried to
print a few pages, I found that they were
numbered only as far as page 532. The
page numbering to that point was
accurate and corresponded to the
numbers in the book, but when I tried to
print a page after 532, either by printing
the current page or entering a number,
the printer just printed a random page.
After fiddling with the settings, I found
I had greater success if I first click View,
‘Page display’, then ‘Single page view’.
If I then print from the File menu
(choosing Print, then ‘Current page’)
it works, but not if I used the printer icon.
Is there a more satisfactory way of
printing pages beyond 532 and up to 711?
Lynnette Hammet, via email
A
We downloaded a PDF book with
over 1,300 pages and had no
trouble printing right up to the end.
Your PDF may be corrupt after page
532, and a glitch in the file may be
causing your problem, so try
downloading it again.
Another possibility is that there’s
a bug in the program you’re using
to print the PDF. We used Microsoft
Edge, which is Windows 10’s default
PDF viewer. When you view PDF
files in a web browser, you have two
ways to print: you can select Print
from the browser menu or click the
printer icon in the PDF display. The
two systems are different, which is
why you may get different results.
Try a different PDF viewer, such as
Microsoft Reader (bit.ly/read427),
Adobe Reader (bit.ly/ad427), Foxit
Reader (www.foxitsoftware.com) or
Nitro’s Free PDF Reader (bit.ly/nitr427).

Q
Why does my Asus laptop keep
losing its internet connection?
I don’t have any problems with either
of my Android tablets.
Dave Tansley, via email
A
Try switching off the router, waiting
a few seconds and then switching it
back on. Some routers automatically
scan for the best Wi-Fi channel to use
when starting up. If the current channel
clashes with your neighbours’ Wi-Fi,
your router may change channels.
All network devices have a unique
IP address, such as 192.168.1.2; the
problems arise when two devices try to
use the same one. Turn off Wi-Fi on
everything except the laptop to see
if that solves the connection problem.
If it does, there may be a clash of
IP addresses.
Use Advanced IP Scanner (bit.ly/
aips427) to view IP addresses when all
your devices are switched off and again
when they’re switched on. Each one
should have a unique IP address.
If you discover that your laptop is
using the same IP address as another
device, change it manually. Open
Control Panel, find the ‘Network and
Sharing Centre’ and click the link for the
current network. Click Properties, then
double-click Internet Protocol Version 4
in the next window. Select ‘Use the
following IP address’ and enter an
IP address that’s different to all the
others in use. The subnet mask should
be 255.255.255.0 and the default
gateway is your router’s IP address.
Your computer’s power plan could
also be the cause of the problem. Open

You can then plug each one into a USB
hub and connect that to your computer.
The hub and possibly the hard drives
will need power.
Such a setup would create a mess of
boxes, a tangle of cables and possibly
power problems. You could instead buy
a new USB hard drive for less than you’d
spend on cases, hubs and cables for

You can, but it’s a really bad idea.
If the hard drive gets corrupted or
fails, you won’t be able to access your
backup. If you don’t have an external
drive, it’s best to use an online drive.
Instead of storing all your files in the
regular Documents, Music, Pictures and
Videos folders on the disk. Store them in
those folders under OneDrive. This will
sync anything you put in there with your
online storage, so you’ll have a copy
online in the event of a disaster. A USB
drive is better, though, because it
provides a lot more storage.

I’m sure I remember reading recently that
someone had had a problem when trying
to play an older game on Windows 10,
TOP TIP
Whenever I see someone
browsing the web with Chrome,
it always looks exactly the same.
Either people like the default
theme a lot or they don’t realise
how easy it is to change the way
the browser looks.
Go to Settings and click the
Get Themes button. Browse the
themes, find one you like and click the
Add To Chrome button to install it.
Some of them add fantastic images to
the New Tab page.
You can remove the theme by
Choose a new
Chrome theme
BROWSERS
clicking the ‘Reset to default theme’
button in Settings.

Revo Uninstaller for mobile
In Your Top Tips of issue 425 (bit.ly/
webuser425), Alan McCarthy said that he
didn’t think there
was an Android
equivalent to
Windows
uninstallers such
as Revo
Uninstaller.
In fact, there
is a mobile
version of Revo
Uninstaller, aptly
named Revo
Uninstaller
Mobile (bit.ly/
revoa427).
Like the PC
software, this
handy app lets
you see a list of
all your installed
apps. You can
then batch uninstall several apps at once
and also clear leftover junk files.

Watch Sky Sports for less
About five years ago, I wrote a tip on the
Web User forums about watching Sky
Sports on your TV legally, at little cost
and with no contract (see bit.ly/
skysports427). The method involved
installing the official Sky Sports Mobile
app for iOS (subscriptions start at
£4.99), then jailbreaking your iPhone so
you can connect the device to your TV
using a cable (and transmit the audio).
Five years on, the tip more or less still
works, except I now use the app on a
Samsung S7 and there’s no need to root
or jailbreak it. I installed Sky Sports
Mobile TV (bit.ly/ssports427), picked one
of the services and could flawlessly cast
the channels to my LG Smart TV.
Depending on your device and TV, you
may have to use a specialist cable instead
of casting. Even if you can’t connect your
phone to your TV screen, £4.99 is pretty
good value for money for watching the
main Sky Sports channels on your phone.

Get Windows 10 Spotify app
early
This week, Spotify has introduced a
Windows 10 Store app, but for some
reason it’s not yet available in the UK.
You can find the app at bit.ly/spotify427,
but the ‘Get the app’ button is greyed
out and says ‘This app does not work on
your device’. When I checked the System
Requirements, English UK was not listed
under supported languages.
To get around the issue, I therefore
searched for region in Windows and
then changed my location from UK to US
before clicking Apply. After this, you
need to close and reopen the Windows
Store, but you should then be able to
search for Spotify and install the app.
When you switch your location back to
the UK again, the app should carry on
working fine.

Quicker access to Android
settings
In the last issue of Web User, Ed Wright
explained how he accesses different
settings, such as battery and data usage,
since Samsung removed the ‘Quick
settings’ panel in Android 7.0. I thought
I’d add that I’ve discovered an even faster
way of accessing settings on any phone
if you have Nova Launcher (bit.ly/
nova427).
Just long-press the Home screen and
tap Widgets, then long-press the
Activities option below Nova Launcher
and drag it to a suitable location on the
Home screen. A pop-up appears letting
you choose from a range of different
options. Swipe up to Settings, expand it,
and you can then create a shortcut for
any Settings page on your Home screen.
I’ve done this for the settings I use
most regularly, such as ‘Battery usage’
and Wi-Fi.

After not using my
old inkjet printer for
several months,
I was worried that
the long period of
inactivity had
caused it to stop
working properly
because none of the
sheets I printed was
legible. Before
consigning the
printer and its
cartridges to the
dump, however, I thought I’d see
if there was anything I could do
to bring it back to life.
I had a look through the
maintenance menus and found an
option to clean the printheads. After
selecting this and waiting a few
minutes for the process to complete,
I tried printing again and was pleased

It might seem obvious, but if you
ever have problems with your printer’s

won’t leave it so long without using the

Should I pay for antivirus
software?
Q
My new Windows 10 PC came loaded
with a trial of Norton (uk.norton.com)
and I also have a trial of Malwarebytes
Premium (bit.ly/mw427). After the trial
period, what should I use for security
software? Is there a good free option?
mal23, Web User Forums
A
I don’t usually pay for programs but
I can recommend paying for Norton’s
security software. I’ve used various
versions of Norton Internet Security,
which includes Norton Antivirus, since the
2002 version and I’ve never had a virus
or serious malware infection on any PC.
It’s worth noting that you can usually
save a bit of money by buying a licence
from a high-street retailer rather than
through Norton’s website, unless there’s
an offer available. Norton Security
Deluxe, which covers five computers,
normally sells at Argos for £29.99, but
its retail price is £59.99 when purchased
direct from Norton.
If you really don’t want to fork out for
antivirus software, it’s worth checking
if your internet service provider offers
a free package – these are usually
rebadged versions of one of the major
antivirus tools. If you want a free program
that you can download right away, Avast
Free (avast.com/free) is highly rated and
probably better than Windows Defender.

Why does Windows Update
keep failing?
Q
For the past three months, I have
repeatedly tried to run Windows
Update but every time it reaches 100%,
a message appears saying “We couldn’t
complete the update...undoing changes...
don’t turn off computer”. Is there any
simple thing I can do to get all the

It’s possible that your
antivirus software is
responsible. Try disabling
it momentarily when you
run Windows Update.
An error code, if one is
reported, could help to
determine the cause,
so try searching for
Event Viewer and
Reliability History from the Start
menu to see if there are any clues there.
Manually updating may resolve the
problem. According to Microsoft’s update
history (bit.ly/update427), aside from
Creators Update, you’re only missing the
May update (KB4019472). I’d therefore
try installing the standalone version from
the Microsoft Update Catalog, which you
can find at bit.ly/catalog427.

Neural Styler (neuralstyler.com) is a

Who needs high-speed
internet, anyway?
No doubt your obsession with faster
internet (Issue 424) stems from your
IT-trade
promotional
obsessions. I take
a pragmatic
attitude and install
nothing that isn’t
useful to me. This
is why I’m still
using an ADSL
connection via a
BT phone line –
as I have done
through several
PC updates and a few home moves since
the advent of the internet.
I have found that ADSL serves me well
enough for browsing, email and even
(shock horror – no buffering!) the
occasional BBC iPlayer programme
I might fancy playing.
Most of the rubbish apps you at Web
User keep pushing are of no interest to
me whatsoever. I’d rather avoid the
clutter that would result and, of course,
the unwelcome intruders that high
speeds encourage. That’s what I take my
hacking axe to.

Why old laptops are better
than new ones
While rummaging around my loft, I came
across a rather old and neglected laptop.
It’s so old that the badge has fallen off,
so I’ve no idea what make it is. It has a
CD drive and a 20MB hard drive, though,
so it was clearly once a ‘must have’.
I decided to take it downstairs to see if
I could start it up but, alas, no joy – it was
well and truly dead, with a black screen.
But my reason for writing is to mention
two wonderful features on this laptop.
The ﬁrst of these – a noticeable
I
read with interest Barry Collins’
column in Issue 425 of Web User,
‘Don’t blame Windows XP for
WannaCry’. Barry suggests that the
NHS must “root out those [Windows]
XP machines”. I agree. But given that
in the majority of cases, software
cannot be upgraded (or rewritten) to
later versions of Windows, the NHS
will, instead, have to implement a
rigorous legacy-systems-maintenance
regime, maintaining these old
machines – probably in a separate,
isolated, network space (that is, not
networked) for as long as possible.
There are many NHS machines, not just
computers, that are out of warranty
and out of parts (and ‘patches’)!
A replacement plan should be
included in this programme. There is
easily enough programmer-capability
in the world to write new software to
replace all the NHS legacy systems.
How to save the NHS computer system
It is just a matter of the NHS specifying
and tendering out the projects. This is
easier said than done, though in many
cases the NHS hasn’t even made a start.
A lot of the legacy software is simple to
rewrite and wouldn’t take that long
(a week, in some cases).
I don’t work in or for the NHS but
from what I read about large-scale
tenders in the organisation, I would
suggest it produces thousands of
mini-tenders for individual
programmers instead of giving large
tenders to one or two big companies.
As you say, the new NHS patient-
records system failed! It was just
too big to manage.
There are, indeed, hundreds of
separate IT departments in the NHS,
each with around a hundred different
systems to manage. Let each IT
department be the ‘stakeholder’ for
each replacement project. They are,
after all, the most knowledgeable
about their own managed systems.
The users (staff) should also be
involved, in a formal capacity, in
replacement projects.

improvement over modern laptops – is
that it has no ‘brick’, just a (long) mains
cable that uses a standard two-pin plug,
as seen on many appliances today.
The second really useful feature –
again, absent from any modern laptop
– is a removable hard drive. A ‘secret
compartment’ slides away to reveal
a removable ‘draw-out’ caddy, which
allows you to have totally separate drives
for different operating systems,
or a drive for home/personal use and
another for business. You could even
have a backup hard drive in the event of
a failure, enabling you to just swap them
out in 10 seconds – bliss!
Having spoken to a few friends and
work colleagues about these features,
it seems there would be a lot of interest
– especially with the removable hard
drive. So think on, manufacturers!

Keep software simple and
unchanged
Having been a computer user for many
years and a reader of Web User, I ﬁnd
many of your hints, tips and tests very
useful. However
I am rapidly
losing any
enthusiasm for
using my laptop
and smartphone.
Windows is
constantly
updating but many of these updates fail,
while Android apps change themselves
far too often. Gmail is a perfect example
– every time I get it to work the way
I want, Google changes it.
I must have tried installing half the
email apps in the Play store and could
not even work out how to start some of
them. Those that do work are ‘slide to do
this’, ‘slide the other way for something
else’, ‘press to do something you don’t
want to do’. It is the same with browsers
– why do the designers think everyone
needs half the screen ﬁlled with icons for
Facebook, Twitter and other services?
Facebook – yes, the dreaded Facebook
– I will not use by choice, because I don’t
wish to know what people are having for
breakfast or if they are on the second
visit to the loo in an hour. Yet more and
more businesses make it the only way to
contact them. Even when I had an
account with the most stringent privacy
settings, I encountered friends I didn’t
know I had – so it had to go.
Basically, what I want is a simple,
uncluttered browser on my PC, and
Android apps that remain how I want
them. Any ideas, anyone?

Give us more content for
Mac users
I really enjoy your magazine but the
latest issue prompted me again to
wonder whether Mac users like me are
getting fair treatment.
Although Mac compatibility gets an
occasional mention, sections such as
‘Best Free Software’ and features
including ‘Record what you watch online’
seem to assume we all use Windows.
You also provide features on the best
Windows 10 apps, but not Mac tools.
I realise that Macs may have fewer
users, and fewer software releases, but it
feels like Web User has got the balance
wrong. This is odd, because you treat
iOS and Android in a pretty even-handed
way, and cover Chrome OS and Linux,
too. Applying this balance and making
it clear what is Windows or Mac
compatible would make a great read
even better!

Trust the government? Don’t
make me laugh
I read the Star Email from Gerry Walker
in Issue 423, ‘Online surveillance is for
our protection’. If anyone hasn’t read it,
I highly recommend it for when you are
feeling down; I never expected to ﬁnd
belly laughs in Web User.
Gerry comments on a letter from a
Peter Savage and talks about online
surveillance, saying the following: “Those
who plead the human-rights argument
for privacy invariably suffer an innate
distrust of authority. I’ve never
understood this. Society collectively
performs what the individual cannot –
this is why we have government”.
Here comes the punch line: “When this
is bound by the democratic right of
consent – as it is in our country – the
distrust of government cannot be
sustained”. How I laughed at good old
Gerry, sat there in his innocence and
naivety. I swear he actually believes that!
Gerry, have you seen anything in the
news in recent years about a chap called
Edward Snowden? It’s in the same article
as the words “illegal surveillance”. I won’t
bother to go further or mention that
GCHQ takes part in the same procedures.
Gerry, I truly wish your comments could
be taken seriously but it’s time to wake
up and smell the coffee.
As it happens, I do believe that the
government needs to be able to crack
down on the terrorists’ activities and
even on organised crime, and to do that
we probably do have to lose some of our
privacy. However, can we believe that any
government anywhere can always be
trusted? Never in a million years; power
corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.
The Shadow, Web User Forums
Defence against surveillance
Colin South (Inbox, Issue 425) is quite
correct in his remarks about the need
to protect our personal data. The
government’s arrangements will be
abused from day one to monitor
bloggers, journalists, dissidents and so
on. The best defence, short of using
traditional mail, is a good paid-for VPN,
Donald Trump promised to unite
America, and on 12 July he will have
succeeded

Help me rescue my BBC
Store purchases
I just read your article in Issue 425,
‘Record what you watch online’. My
speciﬁc problem is that over recent
months, I have purchased and
downloaded various programmes from
the BBC Store. These are accessible to
watch by signing into the store with my
username and password.
The problem is that, from November
this year, the BBC Store is closing down
and apparently I won’t be able to access
these programmes, because I won’t be
able to sign in! The BBC will, until
November, reimburse people who have
bought its content, either with an
Amazon voucher or by paying the
amount of money spent into their bank
accounts.
I’ve checked to see if the programmes
I bought are available to purchase again,
on Amazon or elsewhere – some are, but
not all. The BBC says that it hopes to
make said programmes available
elsewhere, at some point in the future,
but it can’t guarantee if and when this
might happen!
Does anybody know of a way to save
these programmes on my Mac or to a
USB memory stick? After all, I paid for
these shows and even on the BBC Store
site it says: ‘These programmes you own’!

74 12 - 25 July 2017
Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
YouTube – and you and me – to put their
traffic in the ‘fast lane’. They may even
reserve the right to block websites
altogether. So if, let’s say, Trump.com
paid an American provider $5m, it could
slow or bar access to the websites of
other hotel
chains. Or even
political rivals.
Scrapping net
neutrality plays
straight into the
hands of the big
boys. If, 10-15 years ago, internet
providers were charging companies
to make their content run smoothly
over their networks, there would be
no YouTube, no Netflix and no Spotify,
because these startup companies
wouldn’t have been able to afford the
fees. It’s expensive enough to run
servers to reach millions of people,
let alone pay the broadband providers
to make sure that content gets through.
As a group of 800 tech startups
wrote in an open letter to the US
Barry Collins hopes that web giants can fend
off the latest threat to net neutrality
Page 404
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) earlier this year: “Without net
neutrality, the incumbents who provide
access to the internet would be able
to pick winners or losers in the market.
They could impede traffic from our
services in order
to favour their
own services or
established
competitors.
Or they could
impose new tolls
on us, inhibiting consumer choice.”
This makes it all the more staggering
that companies such as Amazon and
Netflix are leading the protests, because
if they were acting entirely in their
own interest, they could wipe out
competition in a heartbeat. Both
companies are rolling in cash and can
afford life in the fast lane. They could
consign rival video services to
‘buffering’ screens, making their own
services as untouchable as BBC1 and
ITV were on British television a
generation ago. There would literally
be no competition.
Instead, they’ve done the decent
thing and joined dozens of other
companies in protesting against the
threat to net neutrality. At the time of
writing, it wasn’t clear what form the
protest would take, but I know what
I’d love them to do: switch their sites off.
Do it for an hour, for an evening, or
ideally for the whole day – but make
everyone realise what the net would
be like if some of the massive sites we
rely on simply weren’t there.
Have they got the guts to do it?
I’m not sure, but Donald Trump has
certainly got the nerve to push his
legislation through. The cost of
scrapping net neutrality will be far
greater than a few hours offline.
Without net neutrality,
there would be no YouTube,
no Netflix and no Spotify
Y
ou can’t knock Donald Trump’s
record. He promised to unite
America, and on 12 July he will
have succeeded. Because on
that day, internet companies as diverse
as straight-laced Amazon and America’s
biggest porn site will join forces (or will
have joined, depending on when you’re
reading this) to protest against the
President’s attack on net neutrality.
And those two companies aren’t easy
bedfellows.
Net neutrality, as David Crookes
explains on page 36 of this issue, is the
well-established principle of treating all
internet traffic equally. It means your
broadband provider will give the same
priority to traffic from your website as it
would Facebook’s or YouTube’s or
anyone else’s.
President Trump’s advisors are not
keen on this legislation, most likely
because it’s not got enough dollar signs
in it. Instead, they’re siding with
America’s telecoms providers, who want
the option to charge Netflix and
